            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE occaſion of <hi>publiſhing</hi> the following <hi>farewell</hi> Sermon, was the repeated impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a number of my late pariſhioners who heard it. But as to the particular occaſion of its being <hi>preached,</hi> and the very peculiar ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs in ſaid pariſh, at that time, and the ſpecial circumſtances attending the ſame, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to enter into a relation thereof; leaſt it ſhould ſeem to carry in it, ſome reflections on thoſe who are ſuppoſed to be the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſtruments of my removal from that people; which I would carefully avoid, as I alſo have in the following Sermon; and would earneſtly adviſe my late adherents to do likewiſe: for I am exceeding deſirous that all thoſe things that have the leaſt tendency to irretate the minds of any, ſhould be laid aſide and buried in oblivion; and that every one would put on that "fervent charity" towards each other, which "covers a multitude of Sins." So, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the candor of all who may read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe, and praying that the divine bleſſing may accompany it, eſpecially to that people who have been my late charge, I abide your ſincere friend and ſouls well-wiſher,</p>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011687_0005_0F87EC8F9C8DD850"/>
CHRIST, to the people committed to their charge, and how deſirous to leave GOD with them, when they themſelves are departing from them.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE I have choſen theſe words of the Apoſtle to vent the love of a <hi>friend,</hi> and the heart of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> in taking my final <hi>fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> of you, who have been, ſo long, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved people of my charge—'Finally, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>farewell</hi>; be perfect, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the GOD of love and peace ſhall be with you.' And truly I do not know how, in fewer and more comprehenſive words, to expreſs my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of your ſpiritual welfare, than by adpoting a ſimilar language with the Apoſtle in my text in my <hi>laſt addreſs</hi> to you, 'Be perfect.' i. e. See that you are united to JESUS CHRIST by faith, and knit together, one to another by love and charity: This is goſpel perfection. Then, 'Be of good comfort,' even rejoice in tribulation which befals you in the way of duty. 'Be of one mind,' of the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if poſſible, in all things. However, if this cannot be attained, yet be of <hi>one heart.</hi> 'Live in peace.' Let not difference in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cauſe difference in affection. If in ſome leſſer things your heads be different, yet let your hearts be one: And for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hearken to this counſel, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that 'the GOD of love and peace will be with you;' even that GOD who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of peace, the worker of peace, and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011687_0006_0F87EC905C8DD080"/>
lover of peace and concord: the heart of GOD will be with ſuch, the help of GOD and the preſence of GOD: He will dwell with them here, that love and live in peace, and they ſhall ſhortly dwell with him in his glorious preſence hereafter forever.</p>
            <p>THUS you have briefly heard what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the Apoſtle's validiction and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate <hi>farewell</hi> to his beloved Corinthians, and in what manner I deſire to take my leave of you alſo, to whom I have ſo long ſtood in a paſtoral relation, now immediately to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. And I have the rather choſen theſe as my <hi>parting words,</hi> becauſe, (as to ſome of you) 'I perceive ſorrow hath filled your hearts,' upon this melancholly occaſion. Therefore I would be glad to guide you to the fountain head of all conſolation, even to 'the GOD of love and peace,' and to JESUS CHRIST 'the prince of peace,' and 'the conſolation of Iſrael,' and to the 'Spirit of truth,' who is the 'comforter of them that are caſt down,' and are 'mourners in Zion.'</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps ſome of you may be ready to raiſe ſome objections in your own minds, which, (as my deſign is to be very practical in handling the ſubject) I would endeavour to obviate; eſpecially as I may hereby as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open and explain the ſcope and meaning of the text, as in any other method.</p>
            <p>SOME then, may be ready to ſay, within
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011687_0007_0F87EC911C9156D8"/>
themſelves, That, 'if in the concluſion of your Miniſtry among us, and in your parting advice to us, you ſhould inſiſt upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with theſe comprehenſive exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contained in the text, that you will, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not only put us upon improbabilities, but upon impoſſibilities under our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. For (firſt) <hi>perfection</hi> is not attainable in this life. Nor (ſecondly) is it poſſible we ſhould be of good comfort under our preſent unhappy, diſtreſſed, and broken circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in this place; being deprived of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and in all probibility of ever more enjoying goſpel ordinances among us. Nor (thirdly) can it be expected that we ſhould ever be all 'of one mind' and judgment in every thing, in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate as this; much leſs under our divided circumſtances; and that there is little or no hopes of our being ever ſo well reconciled to one another's way of thinking, who are now ſo wide in our opinions and ſentiments. And therefore (fourthly) there is no hopes of our 'living in peace' among our ſelves, and ſo of the 'GOD of love and peace' being with us.</p>
            <p>I SAY, theſe are the objections, my hearers, which ſome of you may be under a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make againſt my preſſing thoſe patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal exhortations upon you, urged in my text; eſpecially in your preſent frame of mind, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by your grievous afflictions: and may be provok'd to ſay, It is in vain to tell of theſe things; eſpecially of 'living in peace' with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011687_0008_0F87EC91DC8F5B08"/>
ſome of our brethren and neighbours; for we can never get over what we have met with, during life.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE I ſhall now endeavour to make anſwer to theſe your objections, and ſhew you that the things mentioned in the text, are poſſible, and what may be attained, by the help of divine grace, even in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate, and under your preſent diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances, in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle. As,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WITH regard to the exhortation, <hi>Be perfect.</hi> This may be attained, in the ſenſe of the text, by getting united to CHRIST by faith, and ſo clothed with his <hi>perfect</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then you will be <hi>perfectly</hi> juſtified: And by getting knit to one another in love and charity, which is the 'bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,' and ſanctifyed throughout, in ſoul, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſpirit. Your ſanctification will be <hi>perfect</hi> as to parts, though defective as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, when your hearts are 'ſound in GOD's ſtatutes,' and you 'have reſpect to all' his 'commandments,' and 'hate every falſe way: When the mark you aim at and purſue, is the higheſt degree of <hi>perfection,</hi> with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>; and to be 'perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,' according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's direction. This is to be <hi>perfect</hi> in a ſcripture ſenſe; which is attainable in this life. This is evangelical or goſpel-perfection, conſiſting in a ſtate of juſtification by faith,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011687_0009_0F87EC929C8CDA68"/>
and a ſpirit that hath no allowed guile. For there is a proportion between ſuch a heart and GOD's commands: No other heart can reach every commandment; and without this integrity and uprightneſs of heart, we do nothing to purpoſe in religion. But where there is this ſoundneſs, ſimplicity, and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, GOD has, in a meaſure, what he calls for, even the whole heart; and ſuch an one with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> will 'follow the LORD fully;' making up ſwervings, repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaches in his heart, and every day la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring that it may be perfect with GOD. Theſe are, in ſcripture called 'perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,' as <hi>Abraham, Job,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE never ſay that it is impoſſible to attain what the Apoſtle enjoins in the firſt part of his val<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dictory exhortation, 'Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.' And therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. 'BE of good comfort.' Now if we have attained to the former duty, we may eaſily arrive to the enjoyment of this priviledge, for that will lay a good foundation for it. And ſurely this may be enjoyed by Chriſtians in this world, and that, even under the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable circumſtances of life. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and primitive Chriſtians attained to it, who were 'ſorrowful, yet always rejoicing:' Yea, they were 'exceeding joyful in all their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>lations;' and well they might, while ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for CHRIST, in that they had the 'Spirit of GOD and of glory reſting upon them.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011687_0010_0F87EC935C8FBCB0"/>BUT perhaps you may be ready to ſay, this is the hardeſt duty of all, and even impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comply with under your preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when you are deprived of goſpel ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and are never like to enjoy them more in a ſtated way; where can we look for conſolation, when our <hi>Barnabaſes</hi> are removed from us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</p>
            <p>To which I reply,—Then is your time to look out for it, then is your time to expect the fulfilment of that gracious promiſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> xiv.16, 17. 'I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and he ſhall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth.' Obſerve, our Saviour was at this time, juſt taking his leave of his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and departing from them as to his bodily preſence; and they were almoſt overwhelmed with ſorrow upon this occaſion; wherefore the compaſſionate Saviour, after lovingly chiding their inordinate grief hereupon, ſaying, 'Let not your hearts be troubled,' he adds the words before cited, as an antidote againſt their being exceſſively troubled upon this account, namely, 'I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter. And v.18, 'I will not leave you comfortleſs:' As if he had ſaid, Although I cannot abide always with you my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon, nor by my <hi>miniſters,</hi> yet I will ſend the HOLY GHOST to abide with you forever, whoſe proper work and office it is, to comfort the diſconſolate and them that are caſt down. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011687_0011_0F87EC941C8A2318"/>
hereby ſignifies, that his people ſhould not think themſelves undone when he withdraws the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſymbols of his preſence from them, his miniſters and ordinances; as if, when theſe were gone, <hi>all</hi> muſt be inevitably gone—no, no, if all creature comforts, and even religious advantages too, as to externals, are gone, yet ſo long as GOD and CHRIST and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit live and abide with GOD's people, they cannot want for grounds of comfort.</p>
            <p>INDEED the comfort of ordinances is ſweet, and Sermons are ſweet when GOD is in them; but are not the comforts of the Spirit ſweet alſo, when enjoyed without them? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O children of GOD, you may 'be of good comfort,' if it is not your own fault, under whatſoever ſad providences befall you, or your families, your Miniſters or the church of GOD. 'In the multitude of your thoughts within you,' his 'comforts may delight your ſouls, <hi>Pſa.</hi> xciv.19. 'Therefore be of good comfort'—for when you have trouble without, you may have peace within. See to it that you do not grieve the Spirit, your divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; and then, though earthly comforts are fled, and even thoſe ordinances, through which divine conſolations uſed to be conveyed to your ſouls are removed, yet haſten to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of his Son JESUS CHRIST, and plead with him to ſend you relief in this way, according to his promiſe. Yea, plead with your Saviour, under thoſe gloomy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that he would do that for you in Heaven, which he promiſed when on earth,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011687_0012_0F87EC94DC8F7A48"/>
even, 'pray the Father, that he would ſend the comforter' into your hearts. Thus lay up your comforts, not in creatures, but in CHRIST himſelf, even in his ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: For if he can comfort, his people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his bodily preſence, (as we have heard) then ſurely he can do it in the want of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, and conſequently, without his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or external ordinances. As it is the Spirit of GOD alone that can comfort in the uſe of theſe means, ſo he can do it in the want of them. He can comfort in the wilderneſs, in 'a land of drought where no water is.' Where he denies us the ſtreams, he can make us drink of the fountain: Yea, theſe comforts which we have ſo from the firſt hand, are abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comforts; whereas, what comes by ſecond hand or mediately, are, like thoſe means them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not abiding. Ordinances and <hi>Miniſters</hi> may be taken from you, either by death or otherwiſe; but here are comforts that abide forever. Therefore 'let not your hearts be troubled,' but 'be of good comfort;' for though inſtruments may, when GOD permits, keep your Miniſters out of the pulpit, yet none can keep the comforter out of your ſouls, and who is he that 'can harm you,' while 'ye be followers of that which is good.' Now as to the</p>
            <p n="3">IIId thing: 'Be of one mind.' This is alſo attainable, in the ſenſe of my text; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an agreement in all eſſential things, and in the fundamental points of religion; and as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011687_0013_0F87EC959CCE38C8"/>
to thoſe of leſs importance, and things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in themſelves, ſurely difference in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, need to breed no alienation in affection, or bitter diſſentions and diviſions. Wherefore, not to enlarge here, I paſs to the</p>
            <p n="4">IVth thing mentioned, 'Live in peace:' That is, live no longer in ſtrife, contention, and wrath, but let all ſchiſms and breaches be healed among you, and good agreement take place. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii.18. 'If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men,' Hence it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty always to endeavour, and it is doubtleſs poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to live in ſome degree of peace, with all, even the worſt of men, if it is not our own fault. And methinks the conſideration of GOD's readineſs to be reconciled to us, even when in a ſtate of enmity with him, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in us a placable and reconcileable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards thoſe that are enemies to us, even towards ſuch as remain of an implacable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per towards us, ſo as to harbour no malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or unchriſtian reſentments againſt them, but from our hearts to forgive them in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and to wiſh and ſeek their beſt good and welfare both of ſoul and body; and when we are brought to ſuch a temper as this, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging any ſpleen, bitterneſs, or ill-will, but are poſſeſſed of a benevolent diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, we do ſo far 'live in peace;' be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at peace with GOD and having a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able frame and diſpoſition of heart towards all men: And then may we claim and expect the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011687_0014_0F87EC965C8711F0"/>
benefit of that gracious promiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> xvi.7. 'When a man's ways pleaſe the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;' that is, GOD ordinarily will, in ſuch caſes, ſo mercifully lay his reſtraints upon our moſt bitter enemies, as that they ſhall not be ſuffered greatly to harm us, when we ourſelves are, in this reſpect, 'followers of that which is good.' And in this way it is, that we may overcome evil with good, at leaſt ſo as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ourſelves from the <hi>miſchief,</hi> if we cannot from the <hi>reſentment</hi> of our enemies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſay not, it is impoſſible for you, under your preſent circumſtances, to comply with this part of the exhortation, 'live in peace;' ſince there is no circumſtance or condition you can be in, here in this world, but, if your hearts are right with GOD and your neighbour, you may enjoy peace with GOD, peace in your own breaſts, and poſſeſs a peaceable diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men, even your worſt and bittereſt enemies. If they will contend with you, the blame will not lie at your door, nor is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the peace of your own minds ſhould be diſturbed thereby.</p>
            <p>I GRANT indeed, it is no eaſy matter, in ſuch an imperfect ſtate as this is, and under very trying circumſtances, to attain to ſuch a degree of grace, and ſuch ſtedfaſtneſs of faith and charity, as to ſtand our ground againſt ſuch ſtrong temptations, as we are liable to; yet it may be attained, and has been attained, and is what we ought earneſtly to ſeek and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011687_0015_0F87EC971C863348"/>
after: And in attaining ſuch a frame of mind as this, we ſhall reap the preſent comfort and benefit of it, as well as the future rewards of grace; for in the very 'keeping of' this 'command, there is a great reward.'</p>
            <p>THEREFORE be perſwaded to 'live in peace', by being ſo far from giving any juſt cauſe or grounds of ſtumbling to any, as to remove all ſuch occaſions out of the way of ſuch as would ſeek occaſion. Yea, endeavour not only to 'leave off contention before it be meddled with,' 'but uſe your beſt' your utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make up differences and heal diviſions where they have riſen, and you ſhall thereby obtain the bleſſedneſs of 'peace-makers', and be honoured with being 'called the children of GOD.' Thus ſee that you 'live in peace' putting up injuries, forgiving offences, as you expect that GOD for CHRIST ſake will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you.' Say not that your brethren and neighbours have done you ſuch unſpeakable wrongs, and offered you ſuch abuſes, that you can never put them up, and do not think you are required in duty to do it —I pray you to conſider what wrongs, what injuries have you been guilty of againſt the bleſſed GOD! Yea, what indignities, high handed offences, and affronts have been offered to the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven! Can you imagine the wrongs and abuſes you have received from men, your fellow creatures, can be comparable with thoſe you have offered to GOD your Creator, and to JESUS CHRIST your Redeemer? And yet
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011687_0016_0F87EC97DC839750"/>
do not you hope to obtain forgiveneſs from GOD? But what grounds have you for theſe hopes, if you do not forgive men their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes? Our Saviour ſays expreſsly, <hi>Matt.</hi> xiv.15. 'If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you, but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your treſpaſſes.' Comfortable words indeed to the reconcileable in ſpirit; but awful words to them that are of an implacable and unforgiving ſpirit, and harbour malice in their hearts.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps ſome may ſay, 'I know I ought to forgive, upon repentance and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſatisfaction, and hope I ſtand ready to do it; but do not think I am obliged to do it without; nay I think I ought not.' To which I reply,—It may be granted that you are not obliged to forgive ſo fully as to reſtore to your chriſtian charity, an offender, but upon evidence of his repentance and offered ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; yet you ought ſo far to forgive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch manifeſtation of repentance, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge no ſecret grudge, ill-will or unchriſtian reſentment againſt your worſt enemies upon earth; yea, ſo as to wiſh and pray for their welfare, that they may be the ſubjects of all the good things that they are capable of, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do them all the good that lies in your power, though they deſpitefully uſe and perſecute you,' <hi>Matt.</hi> v.44. And ſo far as this diſpoſition is wanting, and the contrary to it harboured and indulged, you fail of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the exhortation in the text, 'live in peace.' But this temper and conduct may, by the grace of GOD, be attained, and ought
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011687_0017_0F87EC989C80FB58"/>
to be the object of your deſire and purſuit; and ſo far as you ſucceed herein, it ſhall turn to your good account, both as a community and as individuals; as appears by what is added in the laſt part of the text; to which I proceed in a few words,</p>
            <p n="5">Vthly, To ſet forth the great priviledge which all ſuch ſhall enjoy who comply with the foregoing precepts and exhortations, 'the GOD of love and peace ſhall be with you.' As if he had ſaid, All ſuch who comply with the exhortations, ſhall have the gracious preſence of 'the GOD of love and peace,' with them. And O! what tongue can tell, or what heart can conceive the unſpeakable bleſſedneſs, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe priviledge contained in this promiſe, 'The GOD of love and peace ſhall be with you; Now GOD is rightly ſtiled 'the GOD of LOVE,' who is originally and eſſentially <hi>love</hi>; and who has 'ſo <hi>loved</hi> the world as to give his only begotten Son' to die for them. And he is ſtiled 'the GOD of PEACE,' in that he is the Author of <hi>peace</hi> and worker of <hi>peace</hi>: As he has provided for reconciliation and <hi>peace</hi> between himſelf and ſinners, which is a ſpecial work by which he manifeſts that glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, even in finding out a way and means to win thoſe that are ſinners, 'and by nature children of wrath,' to be 'the children of GOD.' Thus you may judge ſomething by the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and endearing character which is here given of GOD, 'as the GOD of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi>' what an ineſtimable advantage it will be to have him dwell with you; who in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner delights in diſplaying theſe attributes of 'love and peace.' This ought unſpeakably
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011687_0018_0F87EC995C839750"/>
to recommend him to us, who muſt be forever ruined, and irrecoverably undone, unleſs we experience the bleſſed fruits and effects of GOD's preſence with us in theſe reſpects. Whereas this favourable preſence of GOD with us, is ſufficient to make our condition tolerable, yea, pleaſant in every circumſtance of life, even under the ſevereſt afflictions; by ſupporting us under them, and finally by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us out of all tribulation, and making us inconceivably happy in the enjoyment of him forever and ever. Thus we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding part of the text contains a ſtrong and moſt powerful argument for us to endeavour to 'live in' love and 'peace:' Intimating that it is impoſſible for us to ſee and enjoy 'the GOD of love and peace,' while deſtitute of this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition. But being poſſeſſed of this ſpirit, we become in ſome meaſure like GOD himſelf, and ſo are brought into a capacity of enjoying the happifying preſence of 'the GOD of peace,' according to the promiſe in our text. But I proceed to ſome more particular application and addreſſes, by way of IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IN the firſt place, is it as we have heard, that the faithful Miniſters of CHRIST have ſuch an unfeigned love to their people while abiding with them, but eſpecially when <hi>called to leave them,</hi> as to deſire above all things to leave 'the GOD of love and peace with them'— hence ſuffer me, as becomes ſuch an one, now upon my taking my <hi>farewell</hi> of you, to preſs theſe exhortations of the text, upon you, in this <hi>my laſt Sermon</hi> to you. The compliance with which alone will entitle you to the great priviledge therein mentioned: For you have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011687_0019_0F87EC9A1C82B8A8"/>
heard upon what condition this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, even upon your being 'perfect, being of good comfort, of one mind, and living in peace.' And you have alſo heard that this is a poſſible and practicable thing; that is, It may, by the grace of GOD, be attained, in the ſenſe of the Apoſtle, even in this preſent world, and under as bad circumſtances as you are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or can be in. O! ſuffer me then to preſs theſe duties upon you, as they are of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, great importance, eſpecially to you un<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> your preſent melancholy circumſtances. And ſuffer me to uſe ſome earneſtneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity herein. For although my <hi>paſtoral relation</hi> is diſſolving, through a ſtrange diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Providence, beſt known to GOD, yet my <hi>brotherly relation</hi> ſtill continues with you; and therefore I cannot looſe my love to you, and tender concern for you. Nay, in leaving you I leave a number among you, that are near and dear to me 'according to the fleſh,' even <hi>children</hi> and <hi>grand children,</hi> who will ſhare with you in your proſperity or adverſity; therefore, I cannot but naturally care for you and for the welfare of this ſociety, and wiſh your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, your ſpiritual edification and comfort: And ſincerely deſire and pray, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſchiſms and diviſions in this church and ſociety, may yet be healed, and that peace and unity in opinion and affection may again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and that 'the GOD of love and peace' may yet take up his abode among you and dwell in the midſt of you, as your covenant GOD, your reconciled Friend and Father through CHRIST: And if ſo, you need not deſpair of being reunited to one another, nor
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011687_0020_0F87EC9ADC813208"/>
of being comfortably reſettled with the goſpel miniſtry and ordinances among you: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too hard for GOD. He that raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he had 'been dead four days'— he that 'breathed upon the dry bones,' cauſing them to live, when to all outward appearance, their caſe was hopeleſs and deſperate, ſurely can eaſily reſtore you to your former priviledges. Wherefore 'wait on the LORD,' by a deep humiliation, by the 'prayer of faith,' and by a thorough reformation, and you ſhall yet 'ſee the' power and 'ſalvation of GOD.' Do as the diſciples of <hi>John</hi> did when their maſter was beheaded; they 'went and told JESUS.' Do thus, as becomes the diſconſolate diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of JESUS CHRIST; whatſoever ails you at any time, go and breathe out all your complaints into the boſom of a compaſſionate Saviour; who is 'the great Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of ſouls,' not liable to be removed from his flock by reaſon of death, or any other means, as all his earthly under-ſhepherds are. For though he has been 'dead,' yet 'he is now alive for evermore' To him, therefore, you may eaſily commit yourſelves and your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones, when your earthly ſhepherds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from you, and he 'will never leave you nor forſake you,' whilſt you obſerve the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in my text; 'Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace:' Then be aſſured, 'the GOD of love and peace' will dwell with you.</p>
            <p>BUT without ſtrictly confining myſelf to the words or immediate ſcope of the text, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, out of the abundance of my heart, to leave a few inſtructions, cautions, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011687_0021_0F87EC9B9C7D26E0"/>
and counſels, as my parting advice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different ages, conditions and other circumſtances you may be in.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To the <hi>young people and children</hi> of this flock, who were born, and have hitherto been brought up under my paſtoral care and charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear children and youth,</hi> you have already heard frequent addreſſes from my mouth, both in the pulpit and out of it, concerning the things which belong to your everlaſting peace; what impreſſions they have made upon you, GOD and your own conſciences, are the beſt witneſſes. It is an encouraging thought to me, that the LORD JESUS CHRIST has a very tender regard for the lambs of his flock, as well as the ſheep. This he plainly diſcovered in ſaying, 'ſuffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not'—when ſome would fain have kept them from him. Yea, he not only 'gathers theſe lambs in his arms,' but 'carries them in his boſom.'—O! my <hi>dear children and youth,</hi> I muſt repeat to you, in this my laſt addreſs, what I have always inſiſted upon, that you ſtand in abſolute need or a Saviour as well as others; and it is your duty and intereſt to come to JESUS CHRIST, to this great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, when under-ſhepherds are removed from you; come and chooſe CHRIST for your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly Teacher, how your earthly teacher and inſtructor is to be taken from you. O! come and 'learn of him, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.' Hear what he ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> viii.17. 'I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.' It is only through him, that you guilty ſinners can have acceſs to a holy GOD. But I know you
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011687_0022_0F87EC9C5C7B1B70"/>
will never be perſwaded to hearken to this counſel, until you ſee and feel your extreme need of JESUS CHRIST; therefore ſtudy your own ſinful, guilty, loſt, and periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by nature and practice, that you may ſee the neceſſity of, and be perſwaded to come to him, as an all-ſufficient and willing Saviour who 'is able to ſave to the uttermoſt,' from ſin and wrath; and to bring to holineſs and happineſs. 'all that come to GOD by him.' O! remember you have, the moſt of you, been baptized in the ſacred name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; which lays you under an obligation to make choice of GOD the Father for your father and the portion of your ſouls, GOD the Son for your Saviour, and GOD the Holy Ghoſt for your ſanctifier and comforter; and by thus ſecuring the all-ſufficient GOD, the ſacred Three for your everlaſting portion, you will be happy in this world and the next. But whilſt you remain in a chriſtleſs ſtate, 'the wrath of GOD abideth on you,' becauſe you are 'children of wrath,' and 'GOD' out of CHRIST 'is a conſuming fire.' Hence JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST alone, is the 'way to the Father' for you as well as others. Let CHRIST therefore be 'precious' to your ſouls. Take him for your LORD and Saviour, and reſt your ſouls upon him for reconciliation, pardon, and peace with GOD.—And, <hi>dear children,</hi> ſee that you are ſpeedy in, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards GOD, and faith' in 'our LORD JESUS CHRIST;' now whilſt GOD is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, CHRIST inviting, and the Spirit ſtriving with you. O! 'make haſte and delay not' to comply with theſe motions and calls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011687_0023_0F87EC9D1C7B0400"/>
life is ſo ſhort and uncertain, and one day more, ſhould you refuſe, may prove your utter undoing. Should you neglect this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity, perhaps you may never hear another Sermon, never have another offer of CHRIST and grace. O! trifle not with your ſouls; now 'life and death' are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, chooſe life, in chooſing the way leading thereto. It is a pity that your youth, and the flower of your age ſhould be waſted away in ſordid pleaſures and gratifications, and you be thereby everlaſtingly deprived of ſpiritual delights. Sure if you make the trial, you will find the pleaſures of religion far prefarable to all the delights of ſenſe and ſin. Remember, <hi>dear children,</hi> and <hi>young people,</hi> the day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is near, and haſtens on apace, when you will be called to account how you have ſpent your childhood and youth; for thus ſaith the LORD,—'Know then that for all theſe things GOD will bring thee into judgment, <hi>Eccl.</hi> xi.9. O! then ſecure him now, to be your friend and advocate, who will be your Judge, in the the great day of accounts. Although the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of youth take another courſe, yet do you reſolve by the grace of GOD to devote yourſelves to him, and become religious betimes. Is it better to go to Heaven alone, or with few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and better company, than to go to Hell with a multitude, a world of ſinners? Conſider, morever, the work of repentance and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, humanly ſpeaking, is much eaſier, the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you begin: Sin will be leſs rooted, Satan not ſo fortified, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ace not ſo much ſlighted, nor the Spirit of GOD ſo much grieved, nor conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo much feared and hardened, as when ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

Beſides, young diſciples are the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciples. GOD the Father will love you; for he takes delight in early converts. JESUS CHRIST will love you, the HOLY GHOST will love you—all the Saints will love you— the holy Angels of GOD will guard and defend you, yea, the great GOD himſelf will dwell with you. Dear children and youth, what deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination do you now come to? Will you chooſe CHRIST and Heaven, or ſin and Hell?</p>
            <p>As you are now like to be left for a ſeaſon, without a ſpiritual guide and inſtructor, O! ſee that you read and ſtudy much in the word of GOD—prize it more than ever, and make that your rule in all you do.' Agreeable to <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxix.9. 'Wherewith ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by taking heed thereto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy word.' And ſee that you get the divine Spirit for your teacher, and dwell in the ſtrength of CHRIST. And while you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live every day in the fear of GOD, ſo eſpecially keep holy the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> I have ſometimes of late been ready to tremble for your ſakes, dear youth, when I have had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the future ſilent Sabbaths that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on among you; leſt whilſt you are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the preached word, GOD's holy day ſhould be profaned by ſinful neglect, idle talk, impertinent behaviour, or by unſuitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable viſits, CHRIST JESUS thereby diſhonoured, and your ſouls ruined. O! let me therefore now adviſe and exhort, yea, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly charge you before GOD. to 'remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath to keep it holy;' and ſo to ſpend every one, as that you may get nearer to GOD thereby. Let none of it be trifled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in vanity, but the whole day carefully ſpent

in reading, meditation, and prayer, when you cannot regularly attend the preached word. And while you are praying, reading, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c. take heed you do not make a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of theſe duties—deſpair of ſaving your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereby, being aſſured that all your 'own righteouſneſs' are but 'filthy rags' Yet in this way it is your duty to wait upon GOD to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you in CHRIST, and give you a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying righteouſneſs in him, as well as ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. Remember that true victory is to overcome yourſelves, and true ſtrength to break the tempter's ſnare: Therefore henceforward 'be ſtrong in the LORD and in the power of his might,' that you may be famed among thoſe worthy <hi>young men,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle wrote, 'Becauſe they were ſtrong and had overcome the wicked one.' In this way you may hope before long to ſee matters take a new and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent turn, for the better, in this place. And it is to you, dear youth, that we principally look, under GOD, to forward ſuch a bleſſed revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You are now in your forming age, and ſo more likely to receive good impreſſions, than thoſe who have long 'accuſtomed themſelves to do evil.' Hence to you we look, under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, as the ſeed of the church, for the preſervation of religion in the places where you live: And a token for good it will be to this church and ſociety, if you do not diſappoint our hopes nor diſregard this my parting coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to you; beſides which, you will find your own good account therein, as by this means you will lay a good foundation for rejoicing hereafter, and not be found among thoſe miſerable youth who will mourn at the laſt day, and ſay, how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011687_0026_0F87EC9F5C6F6F28"/>
reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed me.' But you will be found among thoſe happy ones who have 'heard counſel and received inſtruction, who ſhall be wiſe in their latter end;' and then, if I ſhould never more have an opportunity of ſpeaking to you in this world, I ſhall hope to have a happy meeting and rejoicing with you together in another and a better world.</p>
            <p n="2">II. LET me now addreſs myſelf to the elder people, even thoſe of this flock, who are paſt their childhood and youth, and have arrived to an advanced age—to parents and heads of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Hear my laſt counſel and advice to you; and that for your own ſakes, and alſo for the riſing generation among you. Remember the eyes of the younger will be upon you, as the guide of their youth; at leaſt they will, in all probability be very much influenced by your conduct and example, whither it be virtuous or vicious. Oh ſee, therefore, you behave your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves "circumſpectly, not as fools but as wiſe, redeeming your time becauſe the days are evil'. Improve your religious opportunities, ſuch as you ſhall have whither publick or private, to the beſt advantage. Oh! let not the children and youth ſee you, who are older than they, trifling with the precious ſeaſons of grace, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſoul's ſalvation; leſt you bring the 'guilt of their blood' as well as your own, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Eſpecially doth this exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to you, who have the care of children and families. Do not content yourſelves, barely with not hindering them in the ways of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by your bad examples, but endeavour, as much as in you lies, to further them as well as
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011687_0027_0F87ECA01C715388"/>
yourſelves therein; according to <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, reſolve that, by divine grace, 'as for you and your houſe, you will ſerve the Lord.' Therefore be frequently praying with and for them—improve all opportunities in counſelling, adviſing and catachizing them, eſpecially on Lord's-days, whilſt you are deprived of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preaching of the word among you; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour thereby to make up, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the lack of miniſterial inſtruction, even by abounding ſo much the more in parental, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and private inſtructions, admonitions and reſtraints. In this way, wait upon GOD for his gracious return to you in the way of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ordinances. Avoid every thing in heart, ſpeech and behaviour, in your perſonal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative conduct, that may have a tendency to provoke the lord to leave you long without thoſe uſual means of convincing and converting ſinners and edifying ſaints. Beware of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfruitfulneſs under what you do ſtill enjoy; 'for to him that hath, ſhall be given.' i. e. They that improve the ſpiritual privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and advantages they do enjoy, may hope for greater advantages of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whereas, 'from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.' Now by obſerving theſe cautions and exhortations, dearly beloved, you may humbly hope, that in GOD's time, you ſhall yet ſee good days; and that he will 'make you glad according to the years wherein he hath afflicted you.'</p>
            <p>BUT to draw towards a concluſion—Let one and all, young and old, male and female, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children, labour, in the reſpects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, to 'be perfect, to be of one mind, living in peace;' and then you may 'be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011687_0028_0F87ECA0DC6E80E0"/>
of good comfort,' aſſuring yourſelves that 'the GOD of love and peace ſhall be with you,' for GOD lives, GOD loves, CHRIST interceeds: and though the great ſovereign head of the church has permitted ſuch a ſeperation to take place here, between miniſter and people, before death had diſſolved the paſtoral relation; yet let us not be inordinately diſquieted at ſuch an event; only make ſure of CHRIST, and you may be of good comfort ſtill—for has he not ſaid, 'fear not little flock, it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom.' While CHRIST is your Shepherd, both the ſheep and lambs of the flock ſhall find paſture: Therefore be not diſmayed, you cannot finally miſcarry, whilſt you are 'followers of the LAMB,' and are ſuitably affected with GOD's dealings with you, humbling yourſelves for what has been amiſs among you in not improving former pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and goſpel ordinances—acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD's juſtice in thus dealing with you, and your own unworthineſs of further favours. Yet at the ſame time plead with GOD for his names ſake, for his dear Son's ſake, for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſake, as well as your ſouls ſake, that he would prepare you for, and in his due time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch a precious gift of an aſcended Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon you, as a Paſtor after his own heart, even one that ſhall naturally care for your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual welfare. And dearly beloved, 'ſee that you fall not out by the way,' while you are looking out after a reſettlement and preparing for it; but 'let all your things' therein 'be done with charity' Lay aſide all unchriſtian reſentments towards any who you may think have been the blameable inſtruments of the removal of your Miniſter. I repeat it, do not
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011687_0029_0F87ECA19C6D7B28"/>
harbour or indulge any unbecoming reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or grudges againſt one another, upon your own account, or <hi>for my ſake,</hi> whom you may think injuriouſly treated. For I do deſire from my very heart to forgive any perſonal injury done me, and I pray GOD to forgive them and me, and hope you will do likewiſe. Be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to 'put on, as the elect of GOD, bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as GOD for CHRIST ſake hath forgiven you.'</p>
            <p>WHAT ſhall I add further, but a few miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous counſels and exhortations? Pray mind your families more than ever. The few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opportunities you have in publick, on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Days or lecture days, O! be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and conſcientious in reading, meditation, and prayer in your families and cloſets. When you cannot hear Sermons, then read Sermons, and call to mind what you have heard.</p>
            <p>ARE there any children or youth who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing at the thoughts of their Miniſter's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them, in hopes they ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leſs reſtraints on Sabbath-Days and other times? O! do you, who have the care and watch over them, diſappoint their vain expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and wicked hopes; and they will, it is to be hoped, one day give you a thouſand thanks that they have had ſuch parents and ſuch maſters; though now they may murmur and complain of ſuch reſtraints.</p>
            <p>AND as to ſuch, among you, as fear GOD and are mourning under this ſad providence that has befallen you, O! lay not the blame any where, ſo much as upon yourſelves. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to take part to myſelf, and be humbled
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011687_0030_0F87ECA25C738608"/>
before GOD this day, under a ſenſe of my own barrenneſs and unfruitfulneſs, yea, for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable defectiveneſs in my work, who have been ſo long honoured of the LORD with a ſtanding in the vineyard. And whereinſoever my neglects and miſcarriages in the miniſtry, have been the means of procuring or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any divine judgments upon this ſociety, (inſtead of 'ſtanding in the gap' to keep them off I deſire to fly to the atoning blood of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, which was ſhed for the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood as well as for the people; and hope you will improve your intereſt in Heaven for me, as I deſire to improve mine for you, that we may be together pardoned, purged, and ſaved, through the merits of the Redeemer.</p>
            <p>I FIND in hiſtory, that when idolatry was once eſtabliſhed by law, inſtead of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; thoſe who ſuffered martyrdom on the account of it, did not lay the blame of it ſo much upon the law makers, nor upon their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as upon themſelves, upon their own hearts. One of them ſaid, 'all this is come upon us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we did not love the goſpel.' Another, when his minſter was ſilenced, comes to this reſolution, 'well, by the grace of GOD, the world ſhall never have thoſe hours that I uſed to ſpend in hearing GOD's preached word, they ſhall now be ſpent in my cloſet and in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.' If I could prevail with you as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade myſelf to make ſuch an improvement of the rebukes of providence which we have met with, I ſhould believe that the devil and his kingdom would be looſers by this our parting; that is, if we could but be brought to prize the goſpel more, and by how much the leſs oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities we have in publick, be ſo much the more in private duties, ſuch as prayer, reading,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011687_0031_0F87ECA31C754358"/>
meditation, and inſtructing our families.</p>
            <p>TRULY, my beloved hearers, do not the ſilent Sabbaths which ſeem to be coming upon you, loudly proclaim the importance of that doctrine which I am, and have long been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to you? even ſpeedy 'repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD and faith' in 'our LORD JESUS CHRIST?' humble yourſelves under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of GOD; endeavour to repair your decays in religion, recover your 'firſt love' and do your 'firſt works.' Speedily make up the breaches among you. Oh! have not parents and heads of families much to repent of, and cauſe to lament before the LORD this day for their omiſſions in duty, in their particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And have not children much to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for, on account of their diſobedience and want of ſubjecting themſelves to the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government of the families to which they appertain? Nay, who is there among us all, but have reaſon to ſay, 'what have I done'. Let every one therefore ſearch and ſee what has been amiſs in their hearts and lives, and in their houſes, and repent and reform, 'putting away all iniquity far from your tabernacles'; and then ſhall you be lifted up in due time; yea, you ſhall be built up in perfection and comfort, in unity and peace.</p>
            <p>TO conclude, hearken to that exhortatation in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 xxvii. 'Only let your converſation be as becometh the goſpel of CHRIST: that whither I come and ſee you or elſe be abſent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye ſtand faſt in one mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the goſpel. I ſhut up all with that in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to GOD and to the word of his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi>— AMEN.</p>
