      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FUTURE generations will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps view the late revolution in North America, as the moſt ſingular phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political hemiſphere of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>To point out the gradual ſteps by which America finally obtained her independence, to deſcribe thoſe terrible ſcenes of rapine, blood, and ſlaughter, which accompanied thoſe ſtruggles, ſo fatal to thouſands of brave officers and men on both ſides, and ſo ruinous to the ſinances of the mother-country, are principally the objects of this epitome.</p>
            <p>In the execution of this buſineſs, we have endeavored to diveſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of every ſpark of national prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udice, and have therefore contented ourſelves with barely relating facts, without preſuming to give our opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb facs="unknown:025347_0004_0FCCDB8687763B88"/>thereon, wiſhing to leave our readers the ſole power of judging for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Beſides the detail of theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant events, we have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cuſtoms and manners of the original inhabitants of North America, and ſuch as they nearly are at this day. We have alſo ſhewn at what time, and by what cauſes, the Britiſh colonies in North America were firſt ſettled, and have marked their riſe from their original inſignificance, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Thirteen United and Independent States.</hi>

Their bodies are ſtrong, but more fitted to endure much hardſhip, than to continue long at any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile work, which they cannot ſupport. Their bodies and heads are flattiſh;
<pb n="14"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0012_0FCCFEECAECDF2E8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>their features are even and regular, but their countenances fierce; their hair long, black, lank, and very ſtrong, but without beards. The colour of their ſkin is a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh brown, which moſt of them admire, and take proper methods to improve.</p>
               <p>The Europeans, on their firſt arrival in America, found the Indians quite naked, except thoſe parts, which it is common for the moſt unciviliſed people to conceal. Since that time, they have generally a coarſe blanket to cover them, which they buy from their neighbours. The whole tenor of their lives is of a piece: they are hardy, poor, and ſqualid; and their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from their infancy, is ſolely direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fit their bodies for the mode of life they purſue, and to form their minds to inflict and endure the greateſt evils. Their only occupations are hunting and war, for agriculture is left to their women.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as their hunting ſeaſon is over, which they go through with much patience and in which they exert great ingenuity, they paſs the reſt of their lives in entire indolence. They ſleep half the day in their huts, and obſerve no bounds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in their eating and drinking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Europeans diſcovered them, they had no ſpirituous liquors; but now, the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025347_0013_0FCCFEF0623CF038"/>acquirement of theſe is the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their purſuit.</p>
               <p>The indians are grave, even to ſadneſs, in their deportment upon any ſerious occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, obſervant of thoſe in company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful to the old, and of a temper cool and deliberate. They are never in haſte to ſpeak before they have thought well of the matter, and are ſure the perſon, who ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke before them, has finiſhed all he has to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They have, therefore, the greateſt contempt for the vivacity of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, who interrupt each other, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeak all together. In their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic councils and aſſemblies, every man ſpeaks in his turn, according as his years, his wiſdom, or his ſervices to his country, have ranked him. Not a word, not a whiſper, not a murmur is heard from the reſt while he ſpeaks; no indecent condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, no ill-timed applauſe. The younger claſs attend for their inſtruction, and here they learn the hiſtory of their nation; here they are inflamed with the ſongs of thoſe who celebrate the warlike actions of their anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and here they are taught what are the intereſts of their country, and how to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them.</p>
               <p>Though the American Indian is nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally humane and hoſpitable, yet, to the enemies of his country, or to thoſe who
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025347_0014_0FCCFEF36D9F5628"/>have privately offended him, he is impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable. He conceals his reſentments, he appears reconciled, till, by ſome treachery or ſurpriſe, he has an opportunity of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting an horrible revenge. No length of time is ſufficient to allay his reſentment, no diſtance of place great enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the object; he croſſes the ſteepeſt mountains, he pierces the moſt impervious foreſts, and traverſes the moſt hideous bogs and deſerts for ſome hundreds of miles, bearing the inclemency of the ſeaſons, the fatigue of the expedition, the extremes of hunger and thirſt, with patience and cheerfulneſs, in hopes of ſurpriſing his enemy, on whom he exerciſes the moſt ſhocking barbarities.</p>
               <p>The Americans have ſcarce any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; for, as they live by hunting, inhabit mean cottages, and are given to change their habitation, they are ſeldom very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Some appear to have little ideas of God; others entertain better notions, and hold the exiſtence of the Supreme Being, eternal and uncorruptible, who has power over all. Satisfied with owning this, which is traditionary among them, they pay him no ſort of worſhip.</p>
               <p>The darling paſſion of the Americans is liberty, and that in its fulleſt extent: to liberty the native Indians ſacrifice every
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025347_0015_0FCCFEF44BAE2878"/>thing. This is what makes a life of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and want ſupportable to them, and their education is directed in ſuch a manner as to cheriſh this diſpoſition to the utmoſt. They are indulged in all manner of liberty; they are never, upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, chaſtiſed with blows, and very rarely even chidden.</p>
               <p>Though ſome tribes are found in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica with a king at their head, yet his power is rather perſuaſive than coercive, and he is reverenced as a father, more than feared as a monarch. He has no guards, no priſons, no officers of juſtice. In ſome tribes, there are a kind of nobility, who, when they come to years of diſcretion, are entitled to a place and vote in the councils of the nation. But among the Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Iroquois, the moſt celebrated commonwealth of North America, and in ſome other nations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here is no other qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification abſolutely neceſſary for the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but age, with ability and experience in their affairs.</p>
               <p>Whenever any affair of conſequence is to be tranſacted, they appoint a feaſt, of which almoſt the whole nation partakes. There are ſmaller feaſts on matters of leſs general concern, to which none are invited but thoſe who are engaged in that particular buſineſs. At theſe feaſts it is againſt all
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025347_0016_0FCCFEF79A708A18"/>rule to leave any thing; ſo that, if they cannot eat all, what remains is thrown into the fire. They look upon fire as a thing ſacred, and in all probability their feaſts were anciently ſacrifices. Before the entertainment is ready, the principal perſon begins a ſong, the ſubject of which is the fabulous or real hiſtory of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the remarkable events which have happened, and whatever matters may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their honor or inſtruction. The others ſing in their turn, they have dances too, with which they accompany their ſongs, chiefly of a martial kind; and no ſolemnity or public buſineſs is carried on without ſuch ſongs and dances.</p>
               <p>The charge of the internal peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is likewiſe committed to the ſame council of the elders, which regulates whatever regards the external policy of the ſtate. Their ſuits are few, and quickly decided, having neither property nor art enough to render them perplexed or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
               <p>The loſs of any of their people, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by war or a natural dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, is lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole town he belongs to. In ſuch circumſtances no buſineſs is taken in hand, however important, nor any rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings permited, however intereſting the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, until all the pious ceremonies due to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025347_0017_0FCCFEF9D5C234A8"/>the dead are performed, which are always diſcharged with the greateſt ſolemnity. The dead body is waſhed, anointed, and painted, ſo as in ſome meaſure to abate the horrors of death. Then the women la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſs with the moſt bitter cries, and the moſt hideous howlings, intermixed with ſongs, which celebrate the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the deceaſed, and thoſe of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. The men mourn in a leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant manner. The whole village at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the body to the grave, which is then interred, habited in the moſt ſumptuous ornaments. With the body of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are placed his bow and arrows, with what he valued moſt in his life, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for the long journey he is to take. Feaſting attends this, as it does every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>
               <p>No inſtances of regard to their deceaſed friends are ſo ſtriking as what they call the Feaſt of the Dead, or the Feaſt of Souls. The day of this ceremony is appointed in the council of their chiefs, who give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for every thing that may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnificence. The neighbouring people are invited to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the feaſt, and to be witneſſes of the ſolemnity. At this time, all who have died ſince the laſt ſolemn feaſt of that kind, are taken out of their graves; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025347_0018_0FCCFEFBFACE69B0"/>have been intered at the greateſt diſtance from the villages are diligently ſought after, and brought to this great rendezvous of ſepulchral relicts.</p>
               <p>The opening of theſe tombs diſplays one of the moſt ſtriking ſcenes that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. — This humiliating portrait of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miſery, exhibited in ſo many images of death, wherein a thouſand various ſhapes of horror are depicted, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ravages that time has made; forms altogether a ſcene too indelicate to be here deſcribed. I know not which ought to affect us moſt, the horror of ſo ſtriking a ſight, or the tender piety and affection of thoſe poor people towards their departed friends.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange feſtival is the moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſolemn of any they have, not only on account of the great concourſe of natives and ſtrangers, and of the pompous re-interment they give to the dead, whom they dreſs in the fineſt ſkins they can get, after having expoſed them ſome time in this pomp, but for the games of all kinds which they celebrate upon the occaſion, in the ſpirit of thoſe, which the ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated upon ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions. In this manner do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſooth the calamities of this life, by the honors they pay to the dead. Though
<pb n="21"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0019_0FCCFEFD5C893CA0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>among theſe ſavage nations this cuſtom is impreſſed with ſtrong marks of the ferocity of their nature; yet an honour to the dead, a tender feeling of their abſence, and a revival of their memory, are ſome of the moſt excellent means of ſoftening our rugged nature into humanity.</p>
               <p>Though the women in America have generally the laborious part of oecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy upon themſelves, yet they are far from being the ſlaves they appear, and are not at all ſubject to the great ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which they are placed in countries where they ſeem to be more reſpected. On the contrary, they hold their councils, and have their ſhare in all deliberations that concern the ſtate; nor are they ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the part they act. Polygamy is practiſed by ſome nations, but it is not general. In moſt places, they content themſelves with one wife; but a divorce is admitted, and for the ſame cauſes that it was allowed among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans. No nation of the Americans is without a regular marriage, in which there are many ceremonies. Incontinent before marriage, after wedlock the chaſtity of their women is remarkable. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the adultreſs, as well as that of the adulterer, is in the hands of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band himſelf, and it is often ſevere, being
<pb n="22"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0020_0FCCFF01F4713778"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>inflicted by him who is at once the party and the judge. Their marriages are not fruitful, ſeldom producing above two or three children; and from hence we may derive the principal cauſe of the depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of America.</p>
               <p>The manner of their preparing for war, and their mode of carrying it on, ſeem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves. Almoſt the ſole oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of the American Indian is war, or ſuch an exerciſe as qualifies him for it. His whole glory conſiſts in this, and no man is at all conſidered until he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the ſtrength of his country with a captive, or adorned his hat with the ſcalp of one of his enemies. When the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients reſolve upon war, they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declare what nation it is they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to attack, that the enemy, upon whom they really intend to fall, may be off their guard; and they ſometimes even let whole years paſs over without committing any act of hoſtility, that the vigilance of all may be unben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the long continuance of the watch, and the uncertainty of the danger.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, they are not idle at home. The principal captain ſummonſes the youths of the town to which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, the war-kettle is ſet on the fire, the war ſongs and dances commence, the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025347_0021_0FCCFF04A65BA038"/>hatchet is ſent to the villages and allies of the ſame nation, and the moſt hideous howlings continue, without intermiſſion, day and night, over the whole tract of country. The women add their cries to thoſe of the men, lamenting thoſe whom they have either loſt in war or by natural death, and demanding their places to be ſupplied by their enemies.</p>
               <p>The fury of the nation being thus raiſed to the greateſt height, and all longing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue their hands in blood, the war captain prepares the feaſt, which conſiſts of dog's fleſh. All that partake of this feaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive little billets, which are ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements they take to be faithful to each other, and obedient to their commander. None are forced to the war; but, when they have accepted this billet, they are looked upon as enliſted, and it is then death to recede. All the warriors in this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have their faces blackened with char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, intermixed with daſhes and ſtreaks of vermillion, which give them a moſt horrid appearance. Their hair is dreſſed up in an odd manner, with feathers of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds.</p>
               <p>In this aſſembly, which is preparatory to their military expedition, the chief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the war ſong, which having contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for ſome time, he raiſes his voice to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025347_0022_0FCCFF0609CF2390"/>the higheſt pitch, and turning off ſuddenly in a ſort of prayer, he addreſſes himſelf to the God of war, whom they call Areſkoni. "I invoke thee (ſays he) to be favorable to my enterpriſe! I invoke thy care of me and my family! I invoke ye likewiſe, all ye ſpirits and daemons good and evil! all ye that are in the ſkies, or on the earth, or under the earth, to pour deſtruction on our enemies, and to return me and my compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions ſafely to my country!" All the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors join him in this prayer with ſhouts and acclamations. The captain renews his ſong, ſtrikes his club againſt the ſtakes of the cottage, and begins the war-dance, accompanied with the ſhouts of all his companions, which continue as long as he dances.</p>
               <p>On the day appointed for their departure, they take leave of their friends, and change their clothes, or what moveables they have, in token of friendſhip. Their wives and female relations go out before them, and attend at ſome diſtance from the town. The warriors march out all dreſſed in their fineſt apparel and moſt ſhowy ornaments, regularly one after another, for they never march in rank. Their chief walks ſlowly on before them, ſinging the death ſong. while the reſt preſerve the moſt profound ſilence. When they come up to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="25"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0023_0FCCFF06F9C5EAC0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>they deliver to them all their finery, put on their worſt clothes, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as their commander directs.</p>
               <p>The Indians ſeldom engage in a war upon motives common to Europe: they have no other end but the glory of victory, or the benefit of their ſlaves, which it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to add to their nation, or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their brutal fury; and it is very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that they take any pains to give their wars even the colour of juſtice. They fall ſometimes on one nation, and ſometimes on another, and ſurpriſe ſome of their hunters, whom they ſcalp and bring home as priſoners. Their ſenators wink at this, or rather encourage it, as it tends to keep up the martial ſpirit of the people, enures them to watchfulneſs and hardſhips, and gives them an early taſte for blood. The qualities of an indian war are vigilance and attention, and to give and avoid a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; and patience and ſtrength to endure the intolerable fatigues and hardſhips which always attend it.</p>
               <p>They often enter a village, while the ſtrength of the nation is employed in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and maſſacre all the helpleſs old men, women and children, or make priſoners of as many as they can manage, or have ſtrength enough to be uſeful to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They often cut off ſmall parties of
<pb n="26"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0024_0FCCFF094C30F0F0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>men in their huntings; but when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an army of their enemies, their way is to throw themſelves flat on their faces among the withered leaves, the colour of which their bodies are painted exactly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. They generally let a part paſs unmoleſted, and then, riſing a little, they take aim, being excellent markſmen, and ſetting up a tremendous ſhout, which they call the war-cry, they pour a ſtream of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket bullets on the enemy, having long ſince laid aſide the uſe of arrows. The party at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked returns the ſame cry. Every man in haſte retires behind a tree, returns the fire of the adverſe party, as ſoon as they ariſe from the ground to give the ſecond diſcharge.</p>
               <p>Having fought ſometime in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the party which thinks it has the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ruſhes out of its cover, with ſmall axes in their hands, which they dart with great addreſs and dexter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their cry, intimidate their enemies with menaces, and encourage each other with a boaſtful diſplay of their own brave ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thus, being come hand to hand, the conteſt is ſoon decided, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors ſatiate their ſavage fury with the moſt ſhocking inſults and barbarities to the dead, biting their fleſh, tearing their ſcalps from their heads, and wallowing in their blood, like the wild beaſts of the foreſt.</p>

The fate of their priſoners is indeed miſerable. During the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The conquerors enter the town in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; the war captain waits upon the head men, and in a low voice gives them a circumſtantial account of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the expedition, of the damages the enemy have ſuffered, and his own loſs in it. This being done the public orator relates the whole to the people. Before they yield to the joy which the victory occaſions, they lament the friends they have loſt in the purſuit of it. The parties moſt nearly concerned are apparently afflicted with a deep and real ſorrow; but, by one of thoſe ſtrange turns of the human mind, faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any thing by cuſtom, as if they were diſciplined in their grief, upon the ſignal for rejoicing, in a moment the tears are wiped from their eyes, and they ruſh into an
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025347_0026_0FCCFF0C5F6E4F78"/>extravagance and phrenzy of joy for their victory. All this time the fate of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners remains undecided, until the old men meet, and determine concerning their diſtribution.</p>
               <p>It is uſual to offer a ſlave to each houſe that has loſt a friend, giving the preference according to the greatneſs of the loſs. The perſon who has taken the captive at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him to the door of the party's cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, where he delivers him, and with him gives a belt of wampum, to ſhew that he has fulfilled the purpoſe of the expedition, in ſupplying the loſs of a citizen. They for ſome time view the preſent that is made them, and according as they think him or her, for the ſex matters not, proper or improper for the buſineſs of the family, or as they take a capricious liking or diſpleaſure to the countenance of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, or in proportion to their natural bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, or their reſentment for their loſſes, they decide whether they will receive him into the family, or ſentence him to death. If they be received into the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, happy is their lot, as they are then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted into the place of the father, ſon or huſband that is loſt; and they have no oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mark of their captivity, but that of not being ſuffered to return to their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to attempt which would be certain
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025347_0027_0FCCFF0DD2615A50"/>death. On the contrary, if they diſlike the captive, the throw away the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then it is no longer in the power of any one to ſave him, the nation is aſſembled as upon ſome great ſolemnity, a ſcaffold is raiſed, and the priſoner tied to the ſtake. He inſtantly begins his death ſong, and prepares for the enſuing ſcene of cruelty with moſt undaunted courage.— On the other ſide, they prepare to put it to the utmoſt proof, with every torment that the mind of man ingenious in miſchief can deviſe.</p>
               <p>It would be too ſhocking for the ear of our youthful reader to be told what inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tortures are inflicted on him, till at laſt, one of the chiefs, out of compaſſion, or weary with cruelty, generally puts an end to his life with a club or a dagger. The body is then put into the kettle, and this barbarous employment is ſucceded by a feaſt equally inhuman.</p>

               <p>We do not dwell upon theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cruelty, which ſo much degrade human nature, out of choice; but as all, who mentions the cuſtoms of this people, have very particularly inſiſted upon their behavior in this reſpect, and as it ſeems neceſſary, in order to give a true idea of their character, we do not chooſe wholly
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025347_0029_0FCCFF10BA97C568"/>to omit it. It ſerves to ſhew, in the ſtrongeſt light, to what an inconceivable degree of barbarity the paſſions of men let looſe will carry them. It will point out to us the advantages of a religion that teaches a compaſſion to our enemies, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known nor practiſed in other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; and it will make us more ſenſible, than ſome appear to be, of the value of commerce, the benefits of a civiliſed life, and the lights derived from literature, which, if they have abated the force of ſome of the natural virtues by the luxuries which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, have taken out likewiſe the ſting of our national vices, and ſoftened the ferocity of the human race, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervating their courage. On the other hand, the conſtancy of the ſufferer in this trying ſcene, ſhows the wonderful powers of an early inſtitution, and a ferocious thirſt of glory, which makes men imitate and exceed what philoſophy, and even religion, do not produce.</p>
               <p>Having thus taken a curſory review of the cuſtoms and manners of the original natives of North America, we ſhall now proceed to give an account of the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Britiſh colonies, and ſhew from what ſmall beginnings time has raiſed them to an immenſe republic, under the title of the United and Independent States

               <p>SEVERAL of the moſt zealous and eminent proteſtants, in the reign of Edward VI. oppoſed the popiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and habits though otherwiſe united to their brethren in religious tenets.

               <p>Upon the acceſſion of Queen Elizabeth, in 1558, the refugees returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, loaded with experience and learning, but in the utmoſt diſtreſs and poverty. Thoſe of the clergy who could comply with the Queen's eſtabliſhment, were quickly preferred; but the reſt, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to preach a while, were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and reduced to their former indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>

The clergy and laity, who wiſhed for greater eccleſiaſtical purity, ſtruggled hard for the aboliſhment of popiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and habits, or at leaſt, leaving the uſe of them indifferent in divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by which, they obtained nothing but the honorable nick name of PURI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANS. Queen Elizabeth had enough of the blood of Henry the Eighth, to make her impatient of any oppoſition to her will, eſpecially in matters of religion, in which ſhe had an high opinion of her own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and, during her whole reign, ſhe kept down the puritans with an uniform and inflexible ſeverity. The merits, however, of their ſufferings, the affected plainneſs of their dreſs, the gravity of their deportment, and the uſe of ſcripture phraſes on the moſt ordinary occaſions, and even their names, which had in them ſomething ſtriking and venerable, as being borrowed from the Old Teſtament, gained them a general eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem among ſober people of ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.</p>
               <p>When King James came to the throne, he had a very fair opportunity of pacifying matters, or, at leaſt he might have left them in the condition he found them. On the contrary, he ſuffered them to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but not deſtroyed; they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, and yet left powerful; and the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025347_0032_0FCCFF166AD35D18"/>then miniſtry, like thoſe who lately loſt us our colonies, expoſed their own weakneſs, ignorance, and baſeneſs, by an ill-timed ſeverity.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate matters remained, until the acceſſion of Charles the Firſt, when they were far from being mended. This prince, andowed with ſome virtues, had very few amiable qualities. As grave as the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans themſelves, he could never eagage the licentious part of the world in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and that gravity being turned againſt the puritans, made him more o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He gave himſelf up entirely to the church and churchmen, and he finiſhed his ill-conduct, in this reſpect, by conferring the firſt eccleſiaſtical dignity of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a great ſway in temporal affairs, upon Dr. Laud, who, hardly fit to direct a college, was entruſted with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an empire.</p>
               <p>The puritans conſidered the moſt dreary realms, and the moſt unfrequented regions, where they could enjoy liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as ſuperior to the moſt ſplendid palaces, where they were to be governed by Laud. In conſequence of theſe diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, a little colony ſailed from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and eſtabliſhed itſelf at a place called New Plymouth, on the continent of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The were but few in number, they landed in a bad ſeaſon, and were ſupplied only from their private funds. The winter was premature, and extremely cold. The country was every where covered with wood, and afforded very little for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of perſons ſickly with ſuch a voyage, or even for the ſuſtenance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant people Nearly half of them periſhed by the ſcurvy, by want, and the ſeverity of the climate; but thoſe who ſurvived, not diſpirited with their loſſes, nor with the hardſhips they were ſtill to endure, ſupported by the vigor which was then the character of Engliſhmen, and by the ſatisfaction of finding themſelves out of the reach of the ſpiritual arm, were enabled to procure in this ſavage country, a tolerable livelihood, and by degrees a comfortable ſubſiſtence for themſelves and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>The people of New Plymouth, having cleared the way for other ſufferers to ſettle, in America, with leſs difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than what they had experienced; the fame of their plantation ſpreading through the weſtern part of England, and the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in church and ſtate growing every day more oppreſſive, the territory of the Maſſachuſett's Bay was purchaſed of the Plymouth council, in 1628, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025347_0034_0FCCFF1904A7C1D8"/>ſoon formed, who conſulted on ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling a plantation, to which non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puritans might emigrate, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their own principles in full ſecurity.</p>
               <p>In 1630, a large company arrived at Salem, conſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing of more than fifteen hundred perſons, from different counties in England. From the beginning of the colony, until the emigration ceaſed, in 1640, through a change of affairs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there arrived in 298 veſſels, about 21,200 ſettlers, men, women, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or four thouſand families.</p>
               <p>They did not however, all confine themſelves to this colony: ſeveral families removed to Connecticut River, by mutual agreement with their fellow emigrants, who remained behind. Plantations were formed at Hartford, Windſor, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield. The inhabitants being ſoon after fully fatisfied, that they were out of the Maſſachuſett's limits, and of courſe its juriſdiction, entered into a combination among themſelves, became a body politic, without reſtraining the freedom of their civil government to the memberſhip of their churches, and proceeded to the choice of magiſtrates and repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>Two large ſhips arrived at Maſſachuſett's Bay, in 1637, with paſſengers from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Great pains were taken to prevail
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025347_0035_0FCCFF1B129E6F08"/>upon them to remain in the colony; but they hoped, by moving to a conſiderable diſtance, to be out of the reach of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral governor, with whom the country was then threatened. They ſent to their friends in Connecticut to purchaſe of the natives the lands lying between them and Hudſon's River. They then laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a flouriſhing colony, of which New Haven was the capital. Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut and New-Haven continued two diſtinct colonies for many years. At length the general court of Connecticut determined to prefer an addreſs and petition to Charles the Second, profeſſing their ſubjection and loyalty to his majeſty, and ſoliciting a royal charter; and John Winthrop, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who had been choſen governor, was appointed to negociate the affair with the king. He ſucceeded, and a royal charter was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, conſtituting the two colonies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one body corporate and politic.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roger Williams, a paſtor of the church of Salem, being baniſhed from the Maſſachuſetts, on account of ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſputes, went to the Narraganſet country, accompanied with twelve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and had land give him by the Indian Sachem Canonicus; of whom he afterwards purchaſed the large tract, lying between Pawtuchet and Pawturat rivers,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025347_0036_0FCCFF1C64AF24D0"/>(the great falls and the little falls, as the Indian name ſignifies) and ſtiled it <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> from a ſenſe of God's merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to him in his diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The authority and power of Miantonomy, another Sachem, and his uncle Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icus, awed all the indians round to aſſiſt him and his few aſſociates. When the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Maſſachuſetts general court, occaſioned by what they called an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian diſputes, baniſhed many, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced others to leave the colony, the heads of the party were entertained in a friendly manner by Mr. Williams, who adviſed them to ſeek a ſettlement on Rhode-Iſland, in the year 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and was very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in procuring if of the indian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems.</p>
               <p>Newhampſhire and the Main were ſettled about the ſame time with the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, by different proprietors, who had obtained patents, and whoſe views were to enrich themſelves by the fiſhing trade at ſea, and the beaver trade aſhore.</p>
               <p>The colony of New-York demands our next attention. The Dutch had ſettled it, and named it the New Netherlands. Charles the Second reſolved upon its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in 1664; and in March granted to his brother, the Duke of York, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion extending from the weſtern banks of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025347_0037_0FCCFF1D8D35A720"/>the Connecticut to the eaſtern ſhore of the Delaware, together with Long-Iſland, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring on him the civil and military pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government.

The Dutch governor being unable to make reſiſtance, the New Netherlands ſubmitted to the Engliſh crown, in September, without any other change than of rulers. Few of the Dutch removed, and Nichols inſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the exerciſe of his power, as deputy-governor for the Duke of York, the proprietary.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, 1664. New Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, which was alſo taken from the Dutch, who were conſidered as having no right to any of their ſettlements in theſe parts of America, were included in the grant to the Duke of York.

               <p>We come next to ſpeak of Maryland. The firſt emigration to this part of America conſiſted of two hundred gentlemen of conſiderable fortune and rank, with their adherents, chiefly Roman Catholics, who hoped to enjoy liberty of conſcience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a proprietary of their own profeſſion. They ſailed from England in November, and landed in Maryland the beginning of 1633. Gov. Calvert, brother to Lord Baltimore, very wiſely and juſtly purchaſed, by preſents of various goods, the rights of the Indians, and with their free conſent took poſſeſſion of their town, which he called St. Mary's. The country was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled with ſo much eaſe, and furniſhed with ſo many conveniencies, that emigrants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thither in ſuch numbers as ſoon to
<pb n="41"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0039_0FCCFF2286D62EE0"

               <p>Carolina follows Maryland in the order of exiſtence. A few adventurers emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated from the Maſſachuſetts, and ſettled round Cape Fear, about the time of the Reſtoration They conſidered mere oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupancy, with a transfer from the natives, without any grant from the king, as a good title upon the lands they poſſeſſed. They deemed themſelves entitled to the ſame civil privileges as thoſe of the country from whence they had emigrated. For years they experienced the complicated miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of want. They ſolicited the aid of their countrymen, and the general court of Maſſachuſetts, with an attention and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity which did it the greateſt honor, ordered an extenſive contribution for their relief,</p>
               <p>The final ſettlement of the province was effected equally through the rapacity of the courtiers of Charles the Second, and his own facility in rewarding thoſe, to whom he was greatly indebted, with a lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality that coſt him little. The pretence, which had been uſed on former occaſions, of a pious zeal for the propagation of the goſpel among the indians, was ſucceſſively employed to procure a grant of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe region, lying between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025347_0040_0FCCFF2382D30D90"/>of North latitude, and the river of St. Matheo, under the thirty firſt degree. In March, 1663, this territory was erected into a province by the name of <hi>Carolina,</hi> and conferred on Lord Clarendon, the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Craven, Lord Berkeley, Lord Aſhley, Sir George Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret, Sir John Colleton, and Sir William Berkeley, as abſolute lord proprietaries, for ever, ſaving the allegiance due to the crown.</p>
               <p>Pennſylvania and the Delaware counties next demand our attention. Mr. William Penn, one of the joint purchaſers of the weſtern part of the Jerſeys, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the moſt exact information of the country to the weſtward of the Delaware, while engaged in the adminiſtration of the joint purchaſe, became deſirous of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeperate eſtate.</p>
               <p>He preſented a petition to Charles the Second in June, 1680, ſtating not only his relationſhip to the late admiral, but that he was deprived of a debt due from the crown, when the Exchequer was ſhut. He prayed for a grant of lands, lying to the northward of Maryland, and weſtward of the Delaware; and added that by his intereſt, he ſhould be able to ſettle a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which might, in time, repay his claims. Having a proſpect of ſucceſs, he
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025347_0041_0FCCFF25383436D0"/>copied from the charter of Maryland the ſketch of a patent, which in November was laid before the attorney general for his opinion.</p>
               <p>Penn had the ſame object in view as Lord Baltimore had, the guarding againſt the exertions of prerogative, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had taught both were very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. The attorney general declared the clauſe of exemption from taxation il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal; and chief juſtice North being of the ſame opinion, and obſerving its tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, added the ſaving of the authority of the Engliſh parliament; ſo that it was ſtipulated by the king, for himſelf and his ſucceſſors, that "no cuſtom or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution ſhall be laid on the inhabitants or their eſtates, unleſs by the conſent of the proprietary, or governor and aſſembly, or by act of parliament in England."</p>
               <p>The next year, 1681, the patent was granted, in conſideration of "the merits of the father, and the good purpoſes of the ſon, in order to extend the Engliſh empire, and to promote uſeful commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities." It was provided by fit clauſes, that the ſovereignty of the king ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that acts of parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning trade, navigation, and the cuſtoms, be duly obſerved. Penn was empowered to aſſemble the freemen, or their delegates,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025347_0042_0FCCFF2840D60CE0"/>in ſuch form as he ſhall think proper for raiſing money for the uſe of the colony, and for making uſeful laws, not contrary to thoſe of England, or the rights of the kingdom. A duplicate of the acts of the aſſembly was to be tranſmitted, within five years, to the king in council, and the acts might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void within ſix months if not approved —It now remains only to give a conciſe account of the ſettlement of Georgia.</p>
               <p>In 1732, a number of gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the vaſt benefit that might ariſe from the tract of land, lying between the Savannah and the river Alatamaha, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the king for a charter, which was accordingly granted in June. They meant that the country ſhould be made a bulwark for the ſouthern colonies againſt the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, and ſhould give employment to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people, who were burthenſome at home to their friends and pariſhes.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of Auguſt, Sir Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Heathcote recommended, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to the directors of the Bank, the intereſt of the colony. His ſpeech had the deſired effect, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the court, after his example, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed largely towards the undertaking, as did great numbers of the nobility, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, clergy and others; and the parliament granted 10,000<abbr>l.</abbr> By the beginning of

               <p>Mr. Oglethorpe, one of the truſtees, generouſly attended the firſt ſet of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants to Carolina, where they arrived in good health in, January 1733. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolinians made them a preſent of one hundred breeding cattle, beſides hogs, and twenty barrels of rice, and furniſhed them with a party of horſe, and with ſcout boats, by the help of which they reached the Savannah, where Mr. Oglethorpe, ten miles up the river, pitched upon a ſpot for a town, and in February the building of the firſt houſe commenced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oglethorpe was waited upon by a numerous deputation from the lower Creek nation, with whom he concluded a treaty, and ſoon after ſet out for Charles-town on his return to England, bringing with him ſeveral chiefs and a war captain.

               <p>The Georgians made a ſurpriſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in clearing their lands, and building their houſes, and as an encouragement, the Britiſh parliament granted them a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of 26,000<abbr>l.</abbr> which, with very great private donations. were expended upon ſtrengthening the ſouthern part of Georgia.</p>

Towards the end of the month of April, 174<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Commodore Warren arrived from the Weſt Indies, with a ſixty gun ſhip, and two of forty. He was ſoon after joined by another of forty, which had reached Canſo a ſhort time before. The men of war failed immediately to cruiſe before Louiſbourg. The forces ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and landed at Chapeaurouge Bay the laſt day of April. The tranſports were diſcovered from the town early in the morning, which gave the inhabitants the firſt knowledge of the deſign.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day after landing, four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red men marched round, behind the hills, to the northeaſt harbour, where they got about midnight, and ſet fire to all the dwellings and ſtorehouſes, till they came within a mile of the grand battery. The clouds of thick ſmoke proceeding from the pitch, tar, and other combuſtibles, prevented the garriſon's diſcovering the enemy, though they were but at a ſhort diſtance.</p>
               <p>They expected the body of the army upon them, and therefore deſerted the fort, having thrown their powder into a well; but the cannon and ſhot were left, which proved of great ſervice to the beſiegers. The army had near two miles to tranſport their cannon, mortars, &amp;c. through a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025347_0047_0FCCFF3452A5DD60"/>which required great labour to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh. The men were yoked together, and during the night made great advances.</p>
               <p>While the forces were buſily employed on ſhore, the men of war, and other veſſels were cruiſing off the habour, as often as the weather would permit. On the 18th of May, they captured a french 44 gun ſhip, having 560 men on board, and ſtores of all forts for the garriſon.</p>
               <p>It was given out, that an attack would be made by ſea with the ſhips, on the 18th, while the army did the like by land. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a general ſtorm was really intended or not, the French appeared to expect it, from the preparations making on board the men of war, and ſeemed not inclined to attempt to withſtand it.</p>
               <p>On the fifteenth, a flag of truce was ſent to the general, deſiring a ceſſation of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, that they might conſider of articles for a capitulation. Time was allowed, but their articles were rejected by the general and commodore, and others offered, which were accepted by the French, and hoſtages given on both ſides. The town was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence delivered up on the ſeventeenth. As this was a time when veſſels were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from all parts at Louiſbourg, the French flag was kept flying as a decoy. Two Eaſt Indiamen, and one South-ſea ſhip, of the value of 600,000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, were taken
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025347_0048_0FCCFF35890DB020"/>by the ſquadron, at the mouth of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, into which they failed as uſual, not knowing that the place had been taken by the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The French having been very troubleſome in the back ſettlements of our colonies, it was concluded to take effectual methods to drive them from the Ohio. The reduction of Niagara, Crown Point, and their forts in Nova Scotia, was alſo reſolved on. General Braddock was accordingly ſent from Ireland to Virginia, with two regiments of foot; and on his arrival, when joined by the reſt of the forces deſtined for that ſervice, he found himſelf at the head of 2200 men. He had bravery, but wanted other qualifications to render him fit for the ſervice to which he was appointed. The ſeverity or his diſcipline made him unpopular among the regulars, and his haughtineſs deprived him of the eſteem of the Americans. His pride diſguſted the indians, and led him to deſpiſe the country militia, and to ſlight the advice of the Virginian officers.</p>
               <p>Colonel Waſhington earneſtly begged of him, when the army was marching for fort Du Queſne, to admit of his going before, and ſcouring the woods with his rangers, which was contemptuouſly refuſed. The general had been cautioned by the Duke of Cumberland to guard againſt a ſurpriſe, and yet he puſhed on heedleſsly with the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, conſiſting of 1400 men, till he fell
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025347_0049_0FCCFF37012A3F90"/>into an ambuſcade of 400, chiefly indians, by whom he was defeated and mortally wounded, on the 9th of July, 1755.</p>
               <p>The regulars were put into the greateſt panic, and fled in the utmoſt confuſion; but the militia had been uſed to indian fighting, and were not ſo terrified. The general had diſdainfully turned them into the rear, where they continued in a body unbroken, and ſerved under Colonel Waſhington as a moſt uſeful rear guard, which covered the retreat of the regulars, and prevented their being entirely cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Previous to this and agreeable to the views of the Britiſh miniſtry, the Maſſachuſetts aſſembly raiſed a body of troops, which were ſent to Nova Scotia, to aſſiſt Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Lawrence in driving the French from their ſeveral encroachments within that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
               <p>The expedition againſt Niagara was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to Governor Shirley, but failed thro' various cauſes.</p>
               <p>Sir William, then Colonel, Johnſon, was appointed to go againſt Crown Point. The delays, ſlowneſs, and deficiency of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prevented the ſeveral colonies joining their troops till about Auguſt. In the mean time the active enemy had tranſported forces from France to Canada, marched them down to meet the provincials, and attacked them; but, meeting with a repulſe, loſt ſix hundred
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025347_0050_0FCCFF38A4A7D9A0"/>men, beſides having their general Baron Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſkau wounded and made priſoner.</p>
               <p>The next year, the Maſſachuſetts raiſed a great armament to go againſt Crown Point; but Lord London, on his arrival, did not think it proper that the forces ſhould proceed, owing to a temporary miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Lordſhip and the general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>In the year 1758, happily for the Britiſh nation, the great Mr. Pitt was placed at the head of the miniſtry, when the face of affairs was ſoon changed, the war was proſecuted with unexampled ſucceſs, and the enemy was at length driven out of America.</p>
               <p>Mr. Iſrael Mauduit, the Maſſachuſetts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, in 1763, gave early notice of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial intentions to tax the colonies; but the general court not being called together till the latter end of the year, inſtructions to the agent, though ſolicited by him, could not be ſent in proper time.</p>
               <p>The next year however, 1764, the houſe of repreſentatives came to the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions: "That the ſole right of giving and granting the money of the people of that province, was veſted in them as their legal repreſentatives; and that the impoſition of duties and taxes by the parliament of Great Britain, upon a people who are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Houſe of Commons, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely irreconcileable with their rights."—"That no man can juſtly take the property
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025347_0051_0FCCFF3C684900E8"/>of another without his conſent; upon which original principle, the right of repreſentation in the ſame body, which exerciſes the power of making laws for levying taxes, one of the main pillars of the Britiſh conſtitution, is evidently founded."</p>
               <p>Theſe reſolutions were occaſioned by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of what had been done in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Houſe of Commons. It had been there debated in March, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>After various propoſitions for taxing the colonies, Mr. Grenville's intended ſtamp act was communicated to the American agents. Many of them did not oppoſe it, half their number being placemen or depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025347_0052_0FCCFF3DC59DBE80"/>other tax, that might be equivalent in its produce to the ſtamp tax. The colonies ſeemed to conſider it as an affront, rather than as a compliment. The miniſter would not be content with any thing ſhort of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpecific ſum, and proper funds for the payment of it. Had not the ſums been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his wiſhes, he would have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and he would ſcarcely have been ſatisfied with leſs than 300,000<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum, which was judged abſolutely neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>No ſatisfactory propoſals being made on the ſide of the Americans, Mr. Grenville adhered to his purpoſe of bringing forward the ſtamp bill, though repeatedly preſſed by ſome of his friends to deſiſt. Richard Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had been choſen agent for the Maſſachuſetts, who, with Mr. Franklin and other, lately come from Philadelphia, waited on Mr. Grenville, in February 176<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate againſt the ſtamp bill and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in caſe any tax muſt be laid upon America, the ſeveral colonies might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to lay the tax themſelves. Mr. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, however, adhered to his own opinions, and ſaid that he had pledged his word for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſtamp bill to the houſe, and that the houſe would hear their objections.</p>
               <p>The bill was accordingly brought in, and in March, the ſame year, received the royal
<pb n="55"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0053_0FCCFF4074FD4EC0"

The framers of the ſtamp-act flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themſelves, that the confuſion which would ariſe from the diſuſe of writings, would compel the colonies to uſe ſtamp paper, and therefore to pay the taxes impoſed. Thus they were led to pronounce it to be a law which would execute itſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grenville, however, was not without his apprehenſions that it might occaſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> military officers in the colonies to quarter their ſoldiers in private houſes. This ſeemed intended to awe the people into a compliance with the other act. Great oppoſition being made to it, as under ſuch a power in the army, no one could look on his houſe as his own, that part of the bill, was dropt; but there ſtill remained a clauſe when it paſſed into a law, to oblige the ſeveral aſſemblies to provide quarters for the ſoldiers, and to furniſh them with firing, bedding, candles, ſmall beer, rum, and ſundry other articles, at the expence of the ſeveral provinces. This clauſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in force after the ſtamp act was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
               <p>Theſe proceedings of the mother country gave riſe to great diſturbances in America. Some perſons of conſequence at Boſton, to manifeſt their abhorrence and deteſtation of a party in England, who they ſuppoſed were

One of them, as appeared by the labels af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed thereto, was intended to repreſent the ſtamp officer; the other was a jack-boot, with a head and horns peeping out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>p.</p>
               <p>The report of this novelty drew great numbers from every part of the town and the neighboring country. This affair was left to take its own courſe, ſo that an enthuſiaſtic ſpirit diffuſed itſelf into the minds of the ſpectators. In the evening, the figures were cut down, and carried in funeral proceſſion, the populace ſhouting, <hi>Liberty and property forever! No ſtamps, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They then went to a new building, erected by Mr. Oliver, which they pulled down, falſely ſuppoſing it to be deſigned for the ſtamp-office. As ſoon as they approached Mr. Oliver's houſe, they beheaded the eſſigy, at the ſame time breaking all his windows, and demoliſhed his gardens, fences, barns, and every thing elſe that came in their way.</p>

               <p>People in England were differently affected by the diſturbances in the colonies. Some were for ſupporting the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all events, and for enforcing the ſtamp act, if needful, with the point of the ſword; while others were for quieting the colonies by the repeal of it. Happily for them, Mr. Grenville and his party were thrown out of place, and were ſucceeded by the Marquis of Rockingham, when, on the 22d of February, 1766, this obnoxious act was repealed.</p>
               <p>In May, 1767, Mr. Charles Townſend, then chancellor of the Exchequer, moved the Houſe of Commons for leave to bring in bills for granting a duty upon paper, glaſs, painters colours, &amp;c. in the Britiſh American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
<pb n="58"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0056_0FCCFF46486DCE70"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>for ſettling ſalaries on the governors, judges, &amp;c. in North America; and for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the duties on teas exported to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, and granting a duty of three pence a pound on the importation in America. Two bills were at length framed, and in June and July received the royal aſſent.</p>
               <p>Theſe acts occaſioned freſh, diſturbances in America, where matters were carried to a much greater height than bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, Lord Hillſborough wrote to General Gage, in June, 1768, to ſend troops to Boſton, in order to preſerve the peace of that town.</p>
               <p>The introduction of troops into Boſton was attended with very ſerious conſequences. The inhabitants became exceedingly riotous. and ſome of the rabble puſhed their ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo far, as to oblige the ſoldiers to fire on them, in their own defence. This happened on the 5th of March, 1770, when three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were killed, five dangerouſly wounded, and a few ſlightly.</p>
               <p>This was far from removing the evil, and only tended to widen the breach. Under the notion of zeal for liberty, the rabble ran into the moſt exceſſive licentiouſneſs, and were every where guilty of the moſt lawleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and tyrannical proceedings, pulling down houſes, deſtroying the property of every one that had fallen under their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſupporting the authority of parliament, was the only cauſe aſſigned by the miniſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for retaining the tea duty at the very time when he acknowledged it to be as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commercial a tax, as any of thoſe that had been repealed upon that principle.</p>
               <p>The Eaſt India company, feeling the bad effects of the colonial ſmuggling trade in the large quantities of tea, which remained in their warehouſes unſold, requeſted the repeal of the three-pence per pound in America, and offered, that on its being complied with, government ſhould retain ſix-pence in the pound on the exportation. Thus the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preſented the happieſt opportunity that could have been offered for honorably remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of difference with America. This afforded an opening for doing juſtice, without infringing the claims on either ſide. The miniſter was requeſted and intreated, by a gentleman of great weight in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and a member of parliament, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the oportunity; but it was obſtinately rejected.</p>
               <p>New contrivances were ſet on foot to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the tea, attended with the three penny d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The company at laſt adopted the ſyſtem, and became their own factors. They ſent 600 cheſts of tea to Philadelphia, the like quantity to New York and Boſton, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what was conſigned to other places.

               <p>Theſe and other deciſive proceedings of the Boſtonians, induced the Britiſh miniſtry to bring in a bill into parliament, "for the immediate removal of the officers concerned in the collection of the cuſtoms at Boſton, and to diſcontinue the landing and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lading and ſhipping of goods, wares, and merchandizes, at Boſton, or within the harbour thereof."

On the other hand, the people of Maſſachuſetts Bay, ſupported and ſpurred on by the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were determined not to ſubmit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to repel force by force.

               <p>Theſe proceedings of the people, and their manifeſt diſpoſition to reſiſtance, alarmed the general, who thought it neceſſary, for the ſafety of the troops, as well as to ſecure the important poſt of Boſton, to fortify the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at the neck, which afforded the only communication, except by water, between the town and the continent.</p>
               <p>In England, petitions were preſented from the merchants of London, and almoſt all the trading towns in the kingdom; and Mr. Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Dr. Franklin, and Mr. Lee, alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented petitions from the American congreſs; but government treated them with indifference and contempt.</p>
               <p>Lord Chatham perſevered in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his conciliatory ſcheme with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and accordingly brought into the houſe of Lords the outlines of a bill, which he hoped would anſwer that ſalutary purpoſe; but the miniſtry rejected it. At the ſame time, Lord North gave a ſketch of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he intended to purſue, which were to ſend a greater force to America, and to bring in a temporary act, to put a ſtop to all the foreign trade of the different colonies of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England, particularly their fiſhery on the banks of Newfoundland, till they returned to their duty.</p>

While matters were thus going on at home, General Gage, at Boſton, received intelligence that cannon and carriages were depoſited in the neighborhood of Salem. He accordingly ſent a body of troops from the caſtle to ſeize them, but the Americans found time to out them away, and the troops returned without effecting any thing.</p>
               <p>A ſkirmiſh having happened at Lexington, between the king's troops and a party of the militia, General Gage no ſooner received this intelligence than he detached Lord Piercy to Concord, with ſixteen companies of foot, and a number of marines, 900 men in the whole, and two pieces of cannon, to ſupport Colonel Smith.</p>
               <p>The junction of the Brigade under Lord Perey, with the detachment under Colonel Smith, gave the laſt a breathing time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as they now had cannon, which awed the provincials from preſſing upon the rear in a direct line; but the whole force did not venture to halt long, as the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The regulars, when near Cambridge, were upon the point of taking a wrong road, which would have led them into the moſt eminent danger; but were prevented by the direction of a young gentleman reſiding at the college. They made good their retreat a little after ſun-ſet, over Charleſtown neck to Bunker's hill, but ſpent and worn down by the exceſſive fatigues they had undergone, having march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that day between thirty and forty miles. Here they remained ſecure till the next day, when they croſſed at Charleſtown ferry, and returned to Boſton. In this ſkirmiſh, the regulars had 65 killed, 180 wounded, and 28 made priſoners. The provincials had 50 men killed, 34 wounded, and four miſſing.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to the mother country, where the reſtraining and fiſhery bill met with great oppoſition in both houſes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

               <p>THE neceſſity of ſecuring Ticonderoga was early attended to by many in New England. General Gage had ſet the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of attempting to ſeize upon military ſtores, and by ſo doing had commenced hoſtilities, ſo that retaliation appeared warrantable.</p>
               <p>Colonel Allen was at Caſtleton, with about 270 men, 230 of which were <hi>Green Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Boys,</hi> ſo called from their reſiding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the Green Mountains, the Hampſhire Grants being ſo denominated from the range of green mountains that run through them. Sentinels were placed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on all the roads to prevent any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence being carried to Ticonderoga.</p>
               <p>Colonel Arnold, who now joined Colonel Allen, reported, that there were at Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga, 80 pieces of heavy cannon, 20 of braſs, from four to eighteen pounders, ten or a dozen mortars, a number of ſmall arms, and conſiderable ſtores; that the fort was in a ruinous condition, and, as he ſuppoſed, garriſoned by about forty men. It was then ſettled, that Colonel Allen ſhould have the ſupreme command, and Colonel Arnold was to be his aſſiſtant.</p>
               <p>Colonel Allen with his 230 Green Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Boys, arrived at Lake Champlain,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025347_0066_0FCCFF58B9FA7FB0"/>oppoſite to Ticonderoga, on the ninth of May, at night. Boats were with difficulty procured, when he and Colonel Arnold croſſed over with 83 men, and landed near the garriſon The two colonels advanced along ſide each other, and entered the port, leading to the fort, in the grey of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A ſentry ſnapped his fuſee at Colonel Allen, and then retreated through the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered way to the parade. The main body of Americans then followed, and drew up. Capt. de la Place, the commander, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in bed. Thus was the place taken without any bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>On the 15th of June, 1775, the congreſs proceeded to chooſe by ballot a general to command all the continental forces, and George Waſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngton, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was unanimouſly elected.</p>
               <p>The next day, orders were iſſued by the Americans, for a detachment of a thouſand men, to march at evening, and entrench upon Bunker's hill. By ſome miſtake, Breed's hill, high and large like the other, but ſituated on the furtheſt part of a peninſula, next to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, was marked out for the intrenchment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Bunker's. The provincials proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore to Breed's hill; but were prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed going to work till near twelve o'clock at night, when they purſued their buſineſs with utmoſt diligence and alacrity; ſo that by the dawn of the day, they had thrown up a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025347_0067_0FCCFF5CB74FA330"/>ſmall redoubt, about eight rods ſquare. Such was the extraordinary ſilence that reigned among them, that they were not heard by the Britiſh on board their veſſels in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring waters. The ſight of the works was the firſt notice that the Lively man of war had of them, when the captain began firing upon them about four in the morning.</p>
               <p>The guns called the town of Boſton, the camp, and the fleet, to behold a novelty, which was little expected. The proſpect obliged the Britiſh generals to alter the plan they intended to have purſued the next day. They grew weary of being cooped up in Boſton, and had reſolved upon making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of Dorcheſter heights; but the preſent provincial movement prevented the expedition. They were now called to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt poſſeſſing themſelves of Breed's hill, on which the provincials continued working, notwithſtanding a heavy fire from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's ſhips, a number of ſloating batteries, and a fortification up Cop's hill, in Boſton, directly oppoſite to the little American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt. An inceſſant ſhower of ſhot and bombs was poured by the batteries upon the American works, and yet but one man was killed.</p>
               <p>The Americans continuing laboring inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably till they had thrown up a ſmall breaſt-work, extending from the eaſt ſide of the redoubt to the bottom of the hill; but
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025347_0068_0FCCFF5EC5804F58"/>they were prevented completing it from the intolerable fire of the enemy. By ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable error, the detachment, which had been working for hours, was neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, nor ſupplied with refreſhments, but were left to engage under theſe diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>Between twelve and one o'clock, and the day exceedingly hot, a number of boats and barges, filled with regular troops from Boſton approached Charleſtown, when the men were landed at Moreton's Point. They conſiſted of four battallions, two companies of grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ten of light infantry, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of field artillery; but, by ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, their ſpare cartridges were much too big for them: ſo that, when the Americans were at length forced from their lines, there was not a round of artillery cartridges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>
               <p>Major Gen. Howe and Brigadier Gen. Pigot had the command. The troops formed, and remained in that poſition, till joined by a ſecond detachment of light infantry and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadier companies, a battalion of the land forces, and a batttalion of marines, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole to about 3000 men. The Gererals Clinton and Burgoyne took their ſtand upon Cops-hill, to obſerve and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the bloody and deſtructive operations that were now commencing. The regulars formed in two lines, and advanced delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025347_0069_0FCCFF60528155D0"/>frequently halting to give time for the artillery to fire, which was not well ſerved. The light infantry were directed to force the left point of the breaſt-work, and to take the American line in flank. The grenadiers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to attack in front, ſupported by two battalions, while the left, under Gen. Pigot inclined to the right of the American line. One or two of the continental regiments had been poſted in Charleſtown, but afterwards removed to prevent their being cut off by a ſudden attack; ſo that the Britiſh were not in the leaſt hurt by the muſquetry from thence,</p>
               <p>Gen. Gage had for ſome time reſolved upon burning the town, whenever any works were raiſed by the Americans upon the hills belonging to it: and while the Britiſh were advancing nearer to the attack, orders came to Cop's hill for executing the reſolution. Soon after a carcaſs was diſcharged, which ſet fire to an old houſe near the ferry way; the fire inſtantly ſpread, and moſt of the place was ſoon in flames; while the houſes at the eaſtern end of Charleſtown were ſet on fire by men who landed from the boats.</p>
               <p>The regulars derived no advantage from the ſmoke of the conflagration, for the wind ſuddenly ſhifting, carried it another way, ſo that it could not cover them in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. The provincials had not a rifleman among them, not one being yet arrived from

However, they were almoſt all markſmen, being accuſtomed to ſporting of one kind or other from their youth. A number of Maſſachuſetts people were in the redoubt, and the part of the breaſt-work neareſt it. The left of the breaſt-work, and the open ground ſtretching beyond its point to the water-ſide, through which there was not an opportunity of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work, was occupied partly by the Maſſachuſetts forces, and partly by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Connecticut.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh moved on ſlowly to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, inſtead of uſing a quick ſtep; which gave the provincials the advantage of taking ſurer and cooler aim. Theſe reſerved their fire, till the regulars came within ten or twelve rods, when they began a furious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſmall arms, which ſtopped the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, who kept up the firing without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing. The diſcharge from the Americans was ſo inceſſant, and did ſuch execution, that the regulars retreated in diſorder, and with great precepitation towards the place of landing. Their officers uſed every effort to make them return to the charge, with which they at length complied; but the Americans again reſerved their fire till the regulars came within five or ſix rods, when the enemy was a ſecond time put to flight.</p>

General Howe and the officers redoubled their exertions; and General Clinton, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how the army was ſtaggered, paſſed over, without waiting for orders, and joined them in time to be of ſervice. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans being in want of powder, ſent for a ſupply but could procure none; for there was but a barrel and a half in the magazine. This deficiency diſabled them from making the ſame defence as before; while the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh reaped a further advantage by bringing ſome cannon to bear, ſo as to rake the inſide of the breaſt work from end to end. The regular army now made a deciſive puſh, and the fire from the ſhips and batteries was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled. The provincials were of neceſſity ordered to retreat.</p>
               <p>It was feared by the Americans, that the Britiſh troops would puſh the advantage they had gained, and march immediately to the head quarters at Cambridge, about two miles diſtant, and in no ſtate of defence. But they advanced no farther than to Bunker's<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The loſs of the Britiſh according to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Gage, amounted to 1054, of whom 226 were killed; of theſe 19 were commiſſioned officers, including a lieutenant colonel, two majors, and ſeven captains. Seventy other
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025347_0073_0FCCFF67DB87E5B8"/>officers were wounded. Among thoſe more generally regretted, were Lieutenant Colonet Abercromby, and Major Pitcairn.</p>
               <p>The provincials had 139 killed, 278 wounded, and 36 were miſſing, in all 453.</p>
               <p>In the opinion of many, General Howe was chargeable with a capital error in land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attacking as he did. It might ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate from too great a confidence in the forces he commanded, and in too contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous an opinion of the enemy he had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. He certainly might have entrapped the provincials, by landing on the narroweſt part of Charleſton neck, under the fire of the floating batteries and ſhips of war. Here he might have ſtationed and fortified his army, and kept up an open communication with Boſton by a water carriage, which he would have commanded through the aid of the navy, on each ſide of the peninſula. Had he made this manae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In July, the congreſs received a letter from the convention of Georgia, ſetting forth, that the colony had acceded to the general
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025347_0074_0FCCFF6947FE10F8"/>aſſociation, and appointed delegates to attend the congreſs.</p>
               <p>The acceſſion of Georgia to the colonies occaſioned their being afterwards called <hi>The Thirteen United Colonies.</hi> The firſt hoſtilities that happened in this part between the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite parties, commenced about the middle of November, when a number of royaliſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Americans, and obliged them, after three days, to ſurrender a fort they had taken poſſeſſion of, in which they expected to make an effectual reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In the month of November, the New-York convention having reſolved upon the removal of the cannon from the battery of the city, Captain Sears was appointed to the buſineſs. Captain Vandeput, of the Aſia man of war, was privately informed of the deſign, and prepared to oppoſe its execution. Learning when it was to be attempted, he appointed a boat to watch the motion of the people aſſembled for the purpoſe about the dead of night. The ſailors in the boat giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignal, with a flaſh of powder, of what was going forwards, the perſons on ſhore miſtook it for an attempt to fire a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket at them, and immediately aimed a volly of ſhot at the boat, by which a man was killed. Captain Vandeput ſoon after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a firing from the Aſia with grape ſhot, ſwivel ſhot, 18 and 24 pounders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing a ſingle perſon, and wounded
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025347_0075_0FCCFF6B77FDD4F0"/>only three, two ſlightly, the other loſt the calf of his leg. He then ceaſed for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, ſuppoſing that the people had deſiſted from their purpoſe, while they were only changing their mode of operation.</p>
               <p>Capt. Sears provided a deceiving party, intended to draw the Aſia's fire from the line of the working party. He ſent the former behind a breaſt-work, by which they were ſecured by dodging down upon obſerving the flaſh of the Aſia's guns. When all was in readineſs, they huzzaed, and ſung out their notes as though rugging in uniſon, and fired from the walls; while the working party ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently got off twenty-one eighteen pounders, with carriages, empty cartridges, rammers, &amp;c</p>
               <p>Upon hearing the noiſe and ſeeing the fire of the muſketry the captain ordered the Aſia to fire a whole broadſide towards that part of the fort, where the deceiving party had ſecured themſelves, without intending any particular injury to the city. However ſome of the ſhot flew into the city, and did damage.</p>
               <p>This affair happened at a very late hour, between twelve and two, and threw the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens into the utmoſt conſternation. The diſtreſs of the New Yorkers was very much encreaſed by a painful apprehenſion, that Capt. Vandeput would renew his firing upon the city. A removal of men, women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025347_0076_0FCCFF6D219D4920"/>and goods inſtantly commenced, and continued for ſome time. Matters were however ſo far adjuſted, as to quiet the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the people, in reference to their ſuffering further from the fire of the Aſia. To prevent it, the convention permitted Abraham Lott <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to ſupply his majeſty's ſhips, ſtationed at Newyork, with all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as well freſh as ſalted, for the uſe of thoſe ſhips.</p>
               <p>In the month of November, the general aſſembly of Rhode-Iſland paſſed an act for the capital puniſhment of perſons, who ſhould be found guilty of holding a traiterous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the miniſtry of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or any of their officers or agents, or of ſupplying the miniſterial army or navy, employed againſt the United Colonies, with proviſions, arms, &amp;c. or of acting as pilots on board any of their veſſels. They alſo paſſed an act for ſequeſtering the eſtates of ſeveral perſons, whom they conſidered as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemies to the liberties of America.</p>
               <p>On the night of the 26th of Auguſt, about 2000 American troops entrenched on Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hill, within point blank ſhot of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh on Bunker's hill; and nothwithſtanding a continual fire almoſt all the day following, they had only two killed and two wounded. The Britiſh finding that their firing did not anſwer, relaxed, and ofter a while deſiſted
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025347_0077_0FCCFF6F2807E108"/>entirely, and the Americans remained quiet in their new poſt.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of September, General Waſhington received a very acceptable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of 7000 pounds weight of powder, which had been very ſcarce in the American army.</p>

Schuyler, who approved it, and all things were got in readineſs. They ſet out on the expedition on the 13th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, under the command of Col. Arnold, aſſiſted by the Colonels Green and Enos, and Majors Megis and Bigelow, the whole force amounting to about eleven hundred men.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of October, Capt. Morvat deſtroyed 139 houſes, 278 ſtores and other buildings, the far greater and better part of the town of Falmouth, in the northern part of Maſſachuſetts. The inhabitants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with a reſolve of the provincial congreſs, to prevent tories carrying out their effects, gave ſome violent obſtruction to the loading of a maſt ſhip, which drew upon them the indignation of the Britiſh admiral.</p>

In the mean time, Gen. Montgomery was ſent forward to Ticonderoga, with a body of troops; and being arrived at the Iſle aux Noix, he drew up a declaration, which he ſent among the Canadians by Col. Allen and Major Brown, aſſuring them, that the army was deſigned only againſt the Engliſh gariſons, and not againſt the country, their liberties, or religion.</p>
               <p>Col. Allen and Major Brown being on their return, after executing the commiſſion, with which the general had entruſted them, the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Allen, to halt, and propoſed, that the Colonel ſhould return to Longueil, procure canoes and croſs the river St. Lawrence, a little north of Montreal, while he, the major, croſſed a little to the ſouth of the town, with near 200 men, as he had boats ſufficient. The plan was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and Col. Allen paſſed the river in the night. The major, by ſome means, failed on his part, and Col. Allen found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the next morning, in a critical ſituation, but concluded on defending himſelf. Gen. Carleton, learning how weak Colonel Allen was, marched out againſt him with about forty regulars, together with Canadians, Engliſh and Indians, amounting to ſome hundreds, The colonel defended himſelf with much. bravery; but being deſerted by ſeveral, chiefly Canadians, and having had fifteen of his men killed, was under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025347_0079_0FCCFF71AFD62F70"/>of ſurrendering with thirty one effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and ſeven wounded. He was directly put in irons.</p>
               <p>On the 4th of October, a party of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who had joined and greatly aſſiſted the beſiegers, entrenched themſelves on the eaſt ſide of the lake, on which the enemy ſent an armed ſloop with troops to drive them away; but the Canadians attacked the ſloop with vigour, killed a number of the men, and obliged her to return to St. John's in a ſhattered condition.</p>
               <p>On the 7th, the main body of the army decamped from the ſouth, and marched to the north ſide of the fort. In the evening, they began to throw up a breaſt work, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to erect a battery of cannon and mortars. The continental troops brought ſuch a ſpirit of liberty into the field, and thought ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelves, that they would not bear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubordination or diſcipline. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals could not, in truth, direct their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and would not have ſtayed an hour at their head, had they not feared that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be too generally followed, and ſo have injured the public ſervice. There was a great want of powder, which, with the diſorderly behaviour of the troops, was a damp to the hope of terminating the ſiege ſucceſsfully. The proſpect, however, ſoon brightened, for the Americans planned an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon Chambleé, and in batteaus carried
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025347_0080_0FCCDB8088D19180"/>down the artillery, paſt the fort of St. John's. After a ſhort demur, it ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the majors Brown and Livingſton. The greateſt acquiſition was about ſix tons of powder, which gave great encouragement to the provincials.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of November, Gen. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery preſſed on to Montreal, which, not being capable of making any defence, Gov. Carleton quitted it one day, and the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can general entered it the next.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the advanced ſeaſon of the year, Gen. Montgomery marched on for the capital, and on the 5th of December appeared before Quebec. The garriſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of about fifteen hundred, while the beſiegers were ſaid to conſiſt of little more than half that number. Upon his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the city, he ſent forward a flag of truce, which was fired upon by order of Sir Guy Carleton. At this Gen. Montgomery was ſo provoked, that the next day he wrote to Sir Guy, and in his letter, departed from the common mode of conveying his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he made uſe of threats and language which in his cooler moments he would have declined.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of the inclemency of the ſeaſon, he ſet about erecting works. His batteries were compoſed of ſnow and water, which ſoon became ſolid ice. He planted on them five pieces of ordnance, twelve and nine
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025347_0081_0FCCFF75F906BD58"/>pounders, with one howitzer; but the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was inadequate, and made no impreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the evening, a council was held by all the commanding officers of Col. Arnold's detachment, and a large majority were for ſtorming the garriſon, as ſoon as the men were provided with bayonets, ſpears, hatchets and hand grenades. The plan of ſtorming the garriſon was wholly the work of General Montgomery, who, in the council of war held on the occaſion, ſhewed the neceſſity. practicability, and importance of it, in ſuch a clear and convincing manner, that they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to the meaſure. The attempt had the appearance of raſhneſs; but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was perſuaded that men, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved ſo bravely, would follow him, and that Sir Gay Carleton's forces would not fight, when actual ſervice commenced.</p>
               <p>On the 31ſt of December, the troops aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at the hour appointed. They were to make the attack by the way of Cape Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, at the general's quarters on the heights of Abraham, and were headed by the Gen. himſelf. Col. Arnold was made to attack through the ſuburbs of St. Roe. Col. Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton and Major Brown were to make a falſe attack upon the walls, to the ſouthward of St. John's gate, and in the mean time to ſet fire to the gate with the combuſtibles prepared for that purpoſe. The colonel was alſo to give the ſignals for the combination of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025347_0082_0FCCFF78DE8C9650"/>which were to begin exactly at five o'clock. It is ſaid that Capt. Fraſer, of the regulars, who was then on piquet, going his rounds, ſaw the rockets fired off as ſignals, and, forming a conjecture of what was going forward, beat to arms without orders, and ſo prepared the garriſon for defence.</p>
               <p>The different routes the aſſailants had to make, the depth of the ſnow, and other obſtacles, prevented the execution of Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton's command. The general moved with his diviſion, attended by a number of carpenters, to the piquets at Cape Diamond. Theſe were ſoon cut with the ſaws, and the general pulled them down himſelf. He then entered, attended by the carpenters and ſome of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
               <p>On their entrance, their guides forſook them, which alarmed the general and other officers, who were unacquainted with the paſs and ſituation of the enemy's artillery. However, they preſſed on, and the general, obſerving that the troops did not follow with ſpirit, called out, "Fie, for ſhame! will the New York troops deſert the cauſe in this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moment? Will you not follow when your general leads? Puſh on, brave boys, Quebec is ours." A few acted with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, advanced, and attacked the guardhouſe, when the enemy gave a diſcharge of grape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from their cannon, and alſo of ſmall arms, which proved fatal to the general, his

               <p>The diviſion under Col. Arnold was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unſucceſsful. The Colonel received a wound in one of his legs from a muſket ball, and was carried to the general hoſpital. His men maintained their ground till ten o'clock, when, all hopes of relief being over, they were obliged at laſt to ſurrender priſoners of war. In this attack the provincials loſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an hundred men. Gen. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery was ſhot through both his thighs and his head. His body was taken up the next day, an elegant coffin was prepared, and he was ſoon after decently interred. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral was tall and ſlender, well limbed, of eaſy, graceful, and manly addreſs. He had the love, eſteem, and confidence of the whole army; he was of a good family in Ireland, and had ſerved with reputation in the late war with France. His excellent qualities and diſpoſition procured him an uncommon ſhare of private affection, and his abilities of public eſteem. His death was conſidered as
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025347_0085_0FCCFF825B2280B0"/>a greater loſs to the American cauſe, than all the others with which it was accompanied.</p>
               <p>When the continental troops had connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the unſucceſsful attack on Quebec, there aroſe a diſpute who ſhould command, and whether it was adviſeable to raiſe the ſiege, or wait till a reinforcement ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive. A council of war agreed, that Col. Arnold ſhould command, and ſhould continue the ſiege, or rather the blockade, which was accordingly done, apparently at no ſmall riſk, as they had not more than four hundred men fit for duty; but they retired about three miles from the city, and poſted themſelves advantageouſly.</p>

               <p>LET us now return to Boſton and its envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and ſee what was tranſacting there. On the 15th of February, 1776, the ſtrength of the ice having been tried in one place, and the froſt continuing, Gen. Waſhington was deſirous of embracing the ſeaſon for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over it, from Cambridge ſide into Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. He laid before the council of war the following queſtion: "A ſtroke well aimed at this critical juncture may put a final period to the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and reſtore peace and tranquility ſo much to be wiſhed for; and therefore, whether part of Cambridge and Roxborough bays being frozen over, a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral aſſault ſhould not be made on Boſton?"</p>
               <p>Gen. Ward oppoſed the idea, ſaying, "The attack muſt be made with a view of bringing on an engagement, or of driving the enemy out of Boſton, and either end will be anſwered much better by poſſeſſing Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter heights." When the votes were called for, the majority were againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. It was however determined to poſſeſs themſelves of Dorcheſter heights, which was accordingly afterwards accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of March, the Britiſh admiral informed Gen. Howe, that if the Americans poſſeſſed thoſe heights, he could not keep
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025347_0087_0FCCFF859856A2F8"/>one of his majeſty's ſhips in the harbour. Every deſign of Gen. Howe to force the American works on the hill being fruſtrated, a counſel of war was called, when it was agreed to evacuate the town as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The time that had been gained by the Americans for ſtrengthening their works, took away all hopes of any ſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be made on them by the Britiſh forces. The Americans had provided a great number of barrels, filled with ſtones, gravel and ſand, which were placed round the works, ready to be rolled down, with a view to break the lines of any hoſtile advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing troops, when aſcending the hills.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of March, there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hurry and confuſion in Boſton, every one, in the royal intereſt, being buſy in preparing to quit the town, and to carry off every thing that was valuable. A flag was ſent out from the ſelect men, acquainting Gen. Waſhington with the intention of the troops, and that general Howe was diſpoſed to leave the town ſtanding, provided he could retire uninterrupted. Gen. Waſhington bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under no obligation, but expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in words, which admitted of a favorable conſtruction; and intimated his good wiſhes for the preſervation of Boſton. At four o'clock, in the morning, of the 17th, the embarkation was completed, and before ten the whole fleet was under ſail, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025347_0088_0FCCFF87DFFFD948"/>ſoon after took poſſeſſion of the town.</p>
               <p>Let us now take a view of what was do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Virginia. Towards the cloſe of 1775 the Liverpool frigate arrived at Norfolk from Great Britain. Soon after, the captain ſent a flag of truce, and demanded to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether his majeſty's ſhip of war would be ſupplied from the ſhore with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The reply was in the negative; and the ſhips in the harbor being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally annoyed by the riflemen from behind the buildings and warehouſes on the wharfs, it was determined to diſlodge them by deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the town.</p>
               <p>Previous notice was given, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children, and other innocent perſons, might remove from the danger. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the new year was ſignalized at four o'clock in the morning, by a violent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade from the Liverpool, two ſloops of war, and the governor's armed ſhip the Dunmore, ſeconded by parties of ſailors and marines, who landed and fired the houſes next the water. Where buildings, inſtead of being covered with tile, ſlate, or lead, are covered with ſhingles, (thin light pieces of fir or cedar, half a yard in length, and about ſix inches broad) let the wind be ever ſo moderate, they will, upon being fired, be likely to communicate the conflagration to a diſtance, ſhould the weather be dry, by the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025347_0089_0FCCFF88CD6E2028"/>burning ſhingles being driven by the force of the flames to the tops of other houſes.</p>
               <p>Thus the whole town was reduced to aſhes, that the Americans might have no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould they be inclined to eſtabliſh a poſt on the ſpot. A few men were killed and wounded at the burning of Norfolk, the moſt populous and conſiderable town for commerce of any in Virginia. It contained about 6000 inhabitants, and many in affluent circumſtances. The whole loſs was eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at more than three hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. However urgent the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, it was an odious ſight to ſee the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, Lord Dunmore, a principal actor in burning and deſtroying the beſt town in his government. The horrid diſtreſſes brought upon numbers of innocent perſons, by theſe operations, muſt wound the feelings of all who are not hardened by a party ſpirit.</p>
               <p>While matters were thus tranſacting in America, the miniſtry at home gave into great expences, to ſupply the army at Boſton with freſh proviſions and other articles. Sir Peter Parker and Earl Cornwallis, with the Acteon and Thunder bomb, ſailed from Port mouth for Corke, to convoy the troops and tranſports there to America; but, owing to ſome delays, the fleet did not ſail before the 13th of February. It conſiſted of forty-three ſail, and about 2500 troops.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025347_0090_0FCCFF8A3B99CC18"/>
On the 14th of March, a freſh attempt was made in the houſe of lords, to prevent a continuance of hoſtilities, which ſo far ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that in the May following, letters patent, by his majeſty's orders, paſſed under the great ſeal, conſtituting Lord Howe and Gen. Howe, to be his majeſty's commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for reſtoring peace to the colonies in North America, and for granting pardon to ſuch of his majeſty's ſubjects there, then in rebellion, as ſhould deſerve the royal mercy. The ſame month Commodore Hotham, with all the tranſports, having the firſt diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of Heſſians on board, ſailed from St. Helen's for North America. But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Canada, and attend to what was going forward in that quarter.</p>
               <p>The blockade of Quebec was continued; but the fears of the Americans were great, as they had no more than 400 men to do duty, while there were upwards of three times the number in the city; they were in daily expectation that the beſieged would ſally out upon them. At length a ſmall reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arrived, which enabled them to take a little more reſt, though the army was again ſoon reduced by the ſmall pox that broke out among them.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of May, ſeveral regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments arrived from England, and the Britiſh forces in Canada were eſtimated at about 13,000 men. The general rendezvous was
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025347_0091_0FCCFF8DF4FEB238"/>appointed to be at Three Rivers, half way between Quebec and Montreal. The Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans now formed a plan to ſurpriſe the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh troops, and for that purpoſe marched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover of the night, on the 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h of June, is order to attack them a little before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break. Gen. Thompſon, who commanded in this expedition, had procured a Canadian guide, who was either ignorant or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for, a little before ſun riſe, he found his forces were out of the proper road. They returned, but loſing their way by the ſide of the river, they were ſoon in view of ſome of the enemy's boats, between which and the flanking par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſeveral balls were exchanged. They then quickened their pace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued advancing in ſight of the ſhipping, with drums beating and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es playing, as they knew they were diſcovered. The general, judging there was no poſſibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity of paſſing the ſhips, without being expoſed to all their fire, and yet determining to perſiſt in the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, filed off at a right angle from the river. He meant to take a circuitous route, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er the town on the back ſide. A bad moraſs interpoſed, the troops entered it, and the men were almoſt mired. About nine o'clock, they came to a cleared ſpot, formed, and got into ſome order about ten. They advanced, but before the rear had got off the place of formation, the front received a heavy fire from the enemy, which ſtruck them with
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025347_0092_0FCCFF8F77D843C0"/>terror. The fire was inſtantly repeated, and though the balls flew over the heads of the troops, without doing any material execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they gave way, and crowded back, in the utmoſt confuſion, which left them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a leader, ſo that every one did as he pleaſed. They turned their ſaces up the river and haſtened through the ſwamp as faſt as poſſible. About eleven they began to collect, and ſoon learned from the Canadians, that the enemy had ſent a detachment, with ſeveral field-pieces by land, to cut off their retreat, and a party by water to ſeize their boats. About four they were told, that the enemy had ſecured the bridge before them, which it was ſuppoſed they muſt paſs. They were alſo convinced that a large body were cloſely in their rear. Col. Maxwell ordered all who had collected together to halt, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the officers to him, and ſaid, "What ſhall we do? Shall we fight thoſe in the front or in the rear? Shall we tamely ſubmit? or ſhall we turn off into the woods, and each man ſhift for himſelf?" The laſt propoſal was preferred, but the enemy was ſo near, that the rear of the Americans was expoſed to another tremendous fire, while going down the hill into the woods, but the halls flew over them without injuring any. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was entruſted with the care of the boats, had removed them in time to a ſecure place; ſo that the loſs of the Americans,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025347_0093_0FCCFF90469D67B8"/>which muſt otherwiſe have been much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, amounted only to about 200 priſoners.</p>
               <p>The troops that eſcaped began to collect about ten the next day, and by noon were conſiderably numerous. They got along by degrees, and by ſun ſet the day following ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived oppoſite Sorel. Gen. Thompſon and Col. Irwin, the ſecond in command, with ſome other officers were taken. The killed and wounded of the king's troops were tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling.</p>
               <p>The king's forces having joined at Three Rivers, proceeded by land and water to Sorel, off which the fleet arrived in the evening a few hours after the rear of the Americans had left it. A conſiderable body was landed, and the command of the column given to Gen. Burgoyne, with inſtuctions, to purſue the continental army up the river to St. John's, but without hazarding any thing till another column on his right ſhould be able to co-operate wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion to put nothing to hazard, when not abſolutely neceſſary, gave the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans the opportunity of eſcaping. Had Burgoyne been inſtructed to preſs on with the utmoſt expedition, great numbers of the provincials muſt have been made priſoners, and but few would have crofied Lake Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Thus ended the expedition againſt Quebec.</p>

To return to Boſton. The Britiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Banks, omitting to leave cruiſers in the bay, afforded an opportunity to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican privateers of taking a number of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers. Three days after his quitting it, the George and Annabella tranſports entered, after a paſſage of ſeven weeks from Scotland, during the courſe of which they had not an opportunity of ſpeaking with a ſingle veſſel, that could give them the ſmalleſt information of the Britiſh troops having evacuated Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. They were attacked in the morning by four privateers with whom they engaged till the evening, when the privateers bore away, and the tranſports puſhed for Boſton harbor, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They ſtood up for Nantaſket road, when an American battery opened upon them, which was the firſt ſerious proof they had of the ſituation of affairs at the port to which they were deſtined. They were too far embayed to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reat, as the wind had died away, and the tide was half expended. The privateers, with which they had been engaged, joined by two others made towards them. They prepared for action; but, by ſome misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Annabella got a ground ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern of the George, that the latter expected but a feeble ſupport from her muſketry. About eleven at night, the privateers anchored
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025347_0095_0FCCFF9343CFB158"/>cloſe by, and hailed them to ſtrike the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh flag. The mate of the George, and every ſailor on board, the captain excepted, refuſed to fight any longer; but the officers and privates of the ſeventy firſt regiment ſtood to their quarters till all their ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was expended, when they were forced to yield. They had eight privates and a major killed, beſides ſeventeen wounded. The number of Highlanders taken were 267 privates, 48 officers, beſides Lieut Col. Campbell.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of June, Gen. Howe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Sandy Hook in the Greyhound fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. He ſoon received from Gov. Tryon a full account of the ſtate and diſpoſition of the province, as well as of the ſtrength of the Americans. Gen. Waſhington's army was ſmall, rather below 9000 fit for duty. Of this little army, it was ſaid, at leaſt 2000 where wholly deſtitute of arms, and nearly as many with arms in ſuch condition as to be rather calculated to diſcourage than animate the uſer. On the 2d of July, Gen. Howe's troops took poſſeſſion of Staten Iſland.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of July, congreſs reſolved itſelf into a committee of the whole upon the ſubject of independence; but neither colonies nor members being unanimous, it was poſtponed till the next day. On the fourth, they had it under further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the declaration of independence
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025347_0096_0FCCFF94CDA28250"/>was agreed to and adopted. The title of it was,
<q>"A declaration by the Repreſentatives of the United States of America in Congreſs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The preamble follows in theſe words.—"When, in the courſe of human events, it becomes neceſſary for one people to diſſolve the political bands, which have connected them with another, and to aſſume, among the powers of the earth, the ſeperate and equal ſtation, to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent reſpect to the opinions of mankind require that they ſhould declare the cauſes that impel them to the ſeperation.</p>
               <p>"We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal—that they are endowed by their creator with certain unali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable rights, among which are life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the purſuit of happineſs—that to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e theſe rights, governments are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted among men, deriving their juſt powers from the conſent of the governed—that whenever any form of government becomes deſtructive of theſe ends, it is the right of the people to alter or aboliſh it, and to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new government, laying its foundations upon ſuch principles, and organizing its powers in ſuch form, as to them ſhall ſeem
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025347_0097_0FCD000C877587D8"/>moſt likely ſo effect their ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Prudence, indeed, will dictate, that governments long eſtabliſhed, ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient cauſes; and accordingly all experience hath ſhown, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abuſes and uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſufferance of theſe colonies, and ſuch is now the neceſſity that conſtrains them to alter their former ſyſtems of government.</p>
               <p>The declaration proceeds to give a hiſtory of repeated injuries and uſurpations, all hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in direct object the eſtabliſhment of and abſolute tyranny over thoſe ſtates.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of July, at twelve o'clock the declaration of independence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed at the ſtate-houſe in Philiadelphia, amidſt the greateſt acclamations. The next day, in conſequence of general orders, it was read at the head of each brigade of the continental army at New York, and every where received with loud huzzas, and the utmoſt demonſtrations of joy. The ſame evening, the equeſtrian ſtatus of the king
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025347_0098_0FCCDB899EBB7A38"/>was laid proſtrate on the ground, and the lead of which it was made was doomed to be run into bullets.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of Auguſt Lord Dunmore quitted Virginia, and joined the Britiſh forces. He arrived with Lord Campbell and Sir Peter Parker off Staten Iſland. His lordſhip continued on the coaſts, and in the rivers of Virginia, till the cloſeneſs and filth of the ſmall veſſels, in which the fugitives were crowded, together with the heat of the weather, the badneſs and ſcarcity of water and proviſions, produced a peſtilential fever, which made great havock, eſpecially among the negroes, many of whom were ſwept away.

               <p>On this iſland are ſeveral paſſes through the mountains or hills, which are eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible, being very narrow, and the lands high and mountainous on each ſide. Theſe were the only roads that could be paſſed from the ſouth ſide of the hills to the American lines, excepta road leading round the eaſterly end of the hills to Jamaica. An early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention had been given to the importance of theſe paſſes. To the ſecond of them, the ſmall American parties, patroling on the coaſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired upon the approach of the Britiſh boats with the troops. Lord Cornwallis puſhed on immediately with the reſerve and ſome other ſorces: but finding the Americans in poſſeſſion of the paſs, in compliance with orders he riſked no attack.</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:025347_0100_0FCCDB8C8D405198"/>
The Americans had on each of the three paſſes or roads a guard of Soo men; and to the eaſt of them in the wood, Col. Mites was placed with his battalion to guard the road from the ſouth of the hills to Jamaica, and to watch the motion of the enemy on that ſide, with orders to keep a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reconnoitring to and acroſs the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica road. The centinels were ſo placed as to keep a continual communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the three guards on the three roads.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of Auguſt, Gen. Howe, having fully ſettled a plan of ſurprize, Gen, de Heiſter, with his Heſſians, took poſt at Flatbuſh in the evening, and compoſed the centre. About nine o'clock the ſame night, the principal army, containing much the greater part of the Britiſh forces under the commands of Gen. Clinton, Earl Percy, and Lord Cornwallis, marched in order to gain the road leading round the eaſterly end of the hills to Jamaica, and ſo to turn the leſt of the Americans. Col. Miles whoſe duty it was to guard this road, ſuffered the Britiſh to march not leſs than ſix miles, till they were near two miles in the rear of the guards, before he diſcovered and gave notice of their approach.</p>
               <p>The next day, before day-break, Gen. Clinton arrived within half a mile of the road, when he halted, and ſettled his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the attack. One of his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025347_0101_0FCCDB8E493698C8"/>in with a patrol of American officers on horſeback who were trepanned and made priſoners. Gen. Sullivan, though in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that they would bring him intelligence, neglected ſending out a freſh patrol on finding himſelf diſappointed. Clinton, learning from the captured officers, that the americans had not occupied the road, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached a battalion of light infantry to ſecure it, and advancing with his troops upon the firſt appearance of day, poſſeſſed himſelf of the heights that commanded the road.</p>
               <p>About midnight, the guard, conſiſting all of New Yorkers and Pennſylvanians, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that there was danger at hand, fled without firing a gun, and carried to Gen. Parſons, who commanded them, the account of the enemy's advancing in great numbers by that road. Gen. Grant's movements were to divert the attention of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans from the left, where the main attack was to be made by Gen Clinton. By day-light, Gen. Parſons perceived, that the Britiſh were got through the wood, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending on the north ſide. He took twenty of his fugitive guard, being all he could collect, and poſted them on a height in front of the Britiſh, about half a mile diſtant, which halted their column, and gave time for Lord Sterling to come up with his forces, amounting to about 1500, who poſſeſſed

               <p>The engagement began ſoon after day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, by the Heſſians from Flatbuſh under Gen Heiſter, and by Gen Grant on the coaſt; and a warm ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>ade, with a briſk fire of ſmall arms, were eagerly ſupported on both ſides for ſome conſiderable time. The Americans oppoſing Gen. Heiſter were the firſt who were appriſed of the march of the Britiſh troops under Gen. Clinton They accordingly retreated in large bodies, and in tolerable order, to recover their camp; but they were ſoon interrupted by the right wing under Gen. Clinton, who, having halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreſhed his forces after paſſing the heights, continued his march, and getting into the rear of the left of the Americans, about half paſt eight o'clock, attacked them with his light infantry and light dragoons, while quitting the heights to return to their lines. They were driven back, and again met the Heſſians, and thus were they alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately chaced and intercepted. In theſe deſperate circumſtances, ſome of their regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, overpowered and out numbered as they were, forced their wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the camps through all the dangers with which they were preſſed.</p>
               <p>The Americans under Lord Stirling, who were engaged with Gen. Grant, behaved with great bravery and reſolution; but were
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025347_0103_0FCCFF99961EC010"/>ſo late in their knowledge of what paſſed elſewhere, that their retreat was intercepted by ſome of the Britiſh troops, who, beſides turning the hills and the American left, had traverſed the whole extent of country in their rear. Several broke through the enemy's lines and got into the woods. Gen. Parſons, with a ſmall party, eſcaped by doing the ſame; numbers threw themſelves in the marſh at Gorvan's Cove, ſome were drowned, and others periſhed in the mud. However a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body eſcaped to the lines. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the country, and the variety of the ground, occaſioned a continuance and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſmall engagements, purſuits and ſlaughter, which laſted for many hours before the ſcene cloſed.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh troops diſplayed great valour and activity on this occaſion. So impetuous was their ardor, that it was with difficulty they could be reſtrained, by Gen. Howe's orders, from attacking the American lines. They would probably have entered them, had not the works been completed the night before the action, by cloſing an opening on the right, and placing an abattis before it. The Americans were moſt completely ſurpriſed and effectually entrapped. Col. Smallwood's Maryland regiment ſuffered extremely, and was almoſt cut to pieces, loſing 259 men. The loſs was much regretted, on account of their being young men of the beſt-families in
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:025347_0104_0FCCFF9B057C4430"/>the country, All who were engaged in the actions of this day did not diſplay the ſame courage; nor was it to be expected from ſuch raw troops. Many eſcaped from the want of diſcipline; for they broke at the ſight of danger and ſaved themſelves by flight, whereas otherwiſe they muſt have been killed or taken. Large bodies however were cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. Gen. Sullivan, Lord Stirling, and Gen. Udell, beſides three colonels, four lieutenant colonels, three majors, 18 cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, 43 lieutenants, 11 enſigns, an adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, three ſurgeons, and two volunteers, were made priſoners, together with 1006 privates, in all 1007. As among the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners the wounded were included, an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of between four and five hundred for killed, drowned, periſhed in the woods, the mud, and the like, may be reckoned about the mark; the loſs of the Britiſh, in killed and wounded, did not exceed 318, of whom only 61 were killed. After the battle, the Americans retreated to New-York, to which place they croſſed over under the favour of a fog, taking with them all their military ſtores, and leaving nothing behind them hut a few pieces of cannon and ſome trifling matters.</p>

               <p>AFTER the affair of Long Iſland, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors were uſed by the Americans to keep up the ſpirits of the people, by puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing accounts of the extraordinary bravery of their troops, and the deſtruction they made of the enemy. But that matters were not very promiſing appears from a letter of Gen. Mercer who commanded the flying camp, dated Sept. 4th, wherein he writes. "Gen. Waſhington has not, ſo far as I have ſeen, 5000 men to be depended on for the ſervice of a campaign; and I have not 1000. Both
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025347_0106_0FCCFF9DDB3D4FF8"/>our armies are compoſed of raw militia, perpetually fluctuating between the camp and their farms; poorly armed, and ſtill worſe diſciplined. Theſe are not a match for, were their numbers equal to, veteran troops, well fitted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Gen. Howe, having fully prepared for a deſcent on New-York Iſland, embarked a ſtrong diviſion of the army under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Gen. Clinton and others, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> boats, at the head of Newtown inlet, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place higher up, where they could not be obſerved by the Americans, who expected the attack would be made on the ſide next to the Eaſt river, and had therefore thrown up lines and works to defend themſelves.</p>
               <p>On the 15th of September, about eleven o'clock, Gen. Howe's troops landed, under the cover of five ſhips of war, in two divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Heſſians in one place, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in another. As ſoon as Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton heard the firing of the men of war, he rode with all diſpatch towards the lines; but to his great mortification, found the troops poſted in them retreating with the utmoſt precipitation; and thoſe ordered to ſupport them, Parſons's and Fellows's Brigade fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every direction, and in the greateſt
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025347_0107_0FCCFFA0040E7F78"/>confuſion. His attempts to ſtop them were fruitleſs, though he drew his ſword, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to run them through, and cocked and ſnapped his piſtols.</p>
               <p>On the appearance of a ſmall party of the enemy, not more than ſixty or ſeventy, their diſorder was encreaſed, and they ran off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firing a ſingle ſhot, leaving the general in a hazardous ſituation, ſo that his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to extricate him out of it, caught the bridle of his horſe, and gave him a different direction.</p>
               <p>Three large ſhips were ſlationed in the North river, oppoſite to thoſe in the Eaſt river, and both kept up a conſtant cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ading with grape ſhot and langrage quite acroſs the iſland. The Heſſians, upon their landing, ſeized and ſecured, in a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing building, as enemies, ſome perſons who had been placed there to ſerve as guides, which for a while ſubjected them to a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>When the regulars were completely land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they advanced towards the Kingſbridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road. The American brigades, which had fled on the enemy's approaching the lines, did not ſtop till they were met by Col. Glover's and five other brigades, who were haſtening down to them. As ſoon as they joined, the whole marched forward, and took poſt on ſome heights, when ſuddenly 8000 of the enemy appeared on the next height, and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025347_0108_0FCCFFA20AD9DCD0"/>halted. Gen. Waſhington at firſt conſented, that his troops ſhould march forward, and give them battle; but, on a ſecond conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he gave counter orders, as he could not have any dependence on the militia and the flying camp, which compoſed half the number then preſent. When the Americans retired, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> proſpect of action remained, the Engliſh took poſſeſſion of New York.</p>
               <p>Gen. Waſhington, while moving the army from New York, into the country, was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to march and form the troops, ſo as to make a front towards the enemy, from Eaſt Cheſter almoſt to White Plains, on the eaſt ſide of the highway, thereby to ſecure the march of thoſe who were behind on their right and to defend the removal of the ſick, cannon and other matters of conſequence; but the want of many neceſſary articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably retarded their march.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of October, the royal army moved in two columns, and took a poſition they thought the moſt advantageous. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, however, that Gen. Waſhington's lines were much ſtrengthened by additional works, he deferred all further attack till the arrival of more troops. Several ſkirmiſhes had already taken place, but nothing deciſive had yet happened.</p>
               <p>On the laſt day of October, Gen. Howe, being joined by the troops from Lord Percy, made diſpoſitions for attacking the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can

Gen. Waſhington gained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of his danger from a deſerter, when he drew off moſt of his troops at night, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally evacuated his camp early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt of November, and took higher ground towards the North Caſtle diſtrict; leaving a ſtrong rear guard on the heights and in the woods of White Plains. Orders were given by Gen. Howe to attack this corps; but the execution of it was prevented by a violent rain.</p>
               <p>Though this affair at White Plains made ſo much noiſe at the time in which it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, no general action took place, and the Americans retreated, leaving the Engliſh in poſſeſſion of New York and the Jerſeys.</p>
               <p>Gen. Waſhington, however, ſoon after made a deſcent on Jerſey, and at Trenton ſurpriſed and took priſoners 23 Heſſian offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and 886 men of the ſame nation. In the evening, Gen. Waſhington repaſſed the Delaware, and retired to Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>From this period to the month of June, 1777, nothing paſſed in Jerſey but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſcene of blood and ſlaughter among detached parties, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let us now turn to the Britiſh operations in the North, which were taken out of the hands of Sir Guy Carleton, and committed to the charge of Gen. Burgoyne. The forces allotted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The main body under Gen. Burgoyne, proceeded up Lake Champlain, landed and encamped at no great diſtance from Crown Point, where he met the indians in congreſs, and afterwards, in compliance with their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, gave them a war feaſt. He made a ſpeech to them, calculated to excite their ardor in the common cauſe, and at the ſame time to repreſs their barbarity. He conjured
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025347_0111_0FCCFFA6F193ECD0"/>them to kill thoſe only who oppoſed them in arms; that old men, women, children, and priſoners, ſhould be held ſacred from the knife or hatchet, even in the heat of actual conflict; that they ſhould ſcalp thoſe only whom they had ſlain in fair oppoſition; but that under no pretence ſhould they ſcalp the wounded. or even dying, much leſs kill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in that condition: they were promiſed a compenſation for priſoners, but informed, that they ſhould be called to account for ſcalps.</p>
               <p>On the near approach of the right wing of the royal army on the Ticonderoga ſide, the Americans abandoned their works towards Lake George, and left Gen. Phillips to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the advantageous poſt of Mount Hope, without making any reſiſtance, which would have been ineffectual, and could have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered no good purpoſe. That apparent ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs and want of vigour, with which they were chargeable, was not occaſioned by cowardice, but actual imbecility.</p>
               <p>Gen. Burgoyne's troops proceeded with much expedition, in the conſtruction of their works, the bringing up of artillery, ſtores, and proviſions; but what gave the greateſt alarm was, the rapid progreſs they made in clearing a road, and getting artillery on Sugar Hill. When once they had erected a battery on this height, only a few hours more would

               <p>Gen. St. Clair, having received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by ſpies, that in twenty four hours the inveſture would be completed. when he ſhould he cut off from all poſſibility of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, Gen. Schuyler not having force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient at fort Edward to relieve him he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to evacuate his poſts, though he knew it would produce ſuch aſtoniſhment as had not happened ſince the commencement of the war. He plainly perceived, that if he continued there, he ſhould loſe the army but ſave his character; whereas, by aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the place, he ſhould ſave the army, and loſe his character. A council of war was called, and it was unanimouſly concluded upon to evacuate as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>At two o'clock in the morning of July the 6th. Gen. St. Clair left Ticonderoga. About three the troops were put in motion for the evacuation of the Mount; but Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov having ſet fire to his houſe, contrary to poſitive orders, the whole Mount was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by it, ſo that the enemy had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing every thing that paſſed, which damped the ſpirits of the Americans, and induced them to puſh off in a diſorderly manner.</p>
               <p>In the morning, Gen. Frazer, perceiving the evacuation, and that the Americans were retiring, commanded a purſuit with his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025347_0113_0FCCFFA9B942DBF8"/>conſiſting of the light troops, grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſome other corps. Gen. Reideſel, with moſt of the Brunſwickers, was ordered by Gen. Burgoyne to join in the purſuit, either to ſupport Frazer, or to act ſeperately. The latter continued the purſuit through the day, and receiving intelligence, that St. Clair's rear was at no great diſtance, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his troops to lie that night on their arms. In the morning he came up with the Americans, commanded by Col. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who had, beſides his own, the regiments of colonels Francis and Hale. The Britiſh advanced boldly, and the two bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hale being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of the danger, never brought his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment to the charge, but fled; ſo that Warner could bring into action no more than about 700 men. The conflict was bloody: Francis fell fighting with great bravery, and Warner, his officers and ſoldiers, behaved with much reſolution and gallantry; ſo that the Britiſh broke and gave way, but ſoon formed again, and running on the Americans with their bayonets, the latter were put into no ſmall confuſion, which was encreaſed by the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

St. Clair heard when the firing began, and would have ſupported Warner, but the troops that were neareſt, two militia regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would not obey orders, and the others were at too great a diſtance. Hale, who had attempted to get off by flight, fell in with an inconſiderable party of Britiſh, and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf and a number of his men pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The Americans loſt 324 in killed, wounded and priſoners, and among the laſt were 12 officers.

               <p>Let us now return to ſee what was doing by Gen. Howe. The Britiſh fleet and army which lay at Sandy Hook, were deſtined for the reduction of Philadelphia, in purſuance of a plan which had been ſettted between Sir William Howe and Lord George Germain, but did not ſail 'till the 23d of July. The
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025347_0115_0FCCFFAE896CC7E0"/>land forces conſiſted of thirty ſix Britiſh and Heſſian battalions, including the light infantry and grenadiers, with a powerful artillery, a New York corps, called Queen's Rangers, and a regiment of light horſe, eſtimated all together at about 16,000 men. The fleet conſiſted of 267 ſail. Gen. Howe's thus abandoning Burgoyne, equally excited the aſtoniſhment of friends and enemies.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of June the congreſs reſolved that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen ſtripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen ſtars, white in a blue field, repreſenting a new conſtellation.</p>
               <p>It was not till the third of September that the royal army began to move forwards. On its advancing near to the Americans, theſe abandoned their ground, perceiving that it would not anſwer their firſt expectation. They croſſed Brandywine at Chad's ford, and took poſſeſſion of the heights on the eaſt ſide of it, with an evident intention of diſputing the paſſage of the river; but the ſuperior numbers of the regular forces at laſt obliged them to retire.</p>
               <p>A little after ſunriſe on the 11th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, a warm engagement commenced, which laſted till the approach of night. On this occaſion, the Americans ſhewed great reſolution and courage; but a few hours more of day light might have ſo animated the conquering reg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025347_0116_0FCCFFAFBB54E760"/>as to have produced, thoſe exertions, which would have been productive of a total and ruinous defeat to the Americans. It was ſaid by the Americans themſelves, that in this action, their loſs in killed, wounded, and priſoners, was about twelve or thirteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; and that the royal army did not ſuffer, on their part, ſhort of ſeven or eight hundred, in killed and wounded. The Americans alſo loſt ten ſmall field pieces, and a howitzer, of which all but one were braſs.</p>
               <p>The evening after the battle, a party of regulars was ſent to Wilmington, who took the governor of the Delaware ſtate, Mr. M'Kenley, out of his bed, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a ſhallop lying in the creek, loaded with the rich effects of ſome of the inhabitants, together with the public records of the county, and a large quantity of public and private money, beſides articles of plate, and other things.</p>
               <p>After various motions of the regular army, on the 26th of September General Howe made his triumphal entry into Philadelphia, with a ſmall part of his army, where he was moſt cordially received by the generality of the quakers, and a few other royaliſts. The bulk of his troops were left in and about German town, a village forming one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtreet for near two miles. Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's army was encamped near Shippach-creek about eighteen miles from thence.

The miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fate of Miſs M'Rea was particularly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, by her being dreſſed to receive her promiſed huſband, when ſhe met her murderer employed by you. Upwards of one hundred men, women, and children, have periſhed by the hands of the ruffians, to whom it is aſſerted, you have paid the price of blood." Gen. Burgoyne, in his reply of the 6th of the ſame month, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his own character; ſhewed that Miſs M'Rea's death was no premeditated barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and declared, that every other charge, exhibited by Gen. Gates, was ill founded and erroneous.</p>
               <p>The murder of Miſs M'Rea exaſperated the Americans, and from that and other cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties occaſion was taken to blacken the royal party and army. The people deteſted that army which accepted of ſuch Indian aid, and loudly reprobated that government which could call in ſuch auxiliaries. Gen. Gates was not deficient in aggravating, by ſeveral publications, the exceſſes that had taken place, and with no ſmall advantage to his own mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary operations.</p>
               <p>On the 18th of September, Gen. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, having been very ſhort of proviſions, at length received a ſupply for about thirty
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025347_0119_0FCCFFB4D46E8B88"/>days, together with other neceſſary ſtores He then reſolved upon paſſing the Hudſon's river with the army, which having executed, he encamped on the heights and on the plains of Saratoga. The Americans, obſerving the motions of the royal army, marched out 3000 ſtrong, in order to attack him, but ſound that to be prudentially impracticable. However, they drew up in full view of him, and there remained till dark.</p>
               <p>The next day ſome of the American ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties fell in with thoſe of the Britiſh, and with great boldneſs began the attack about one o'clock at noon. The firing was no ſooner heard by Gen. Phillips, than he made his way with a part of the artillery, through the woods, and rendered eſſential ſervices. Each commander ſupported, re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inforced, and ordered different regiments to engage. The battle was hot and obſtinate on both ſides, till about half paſt two o'clock, when it ceaſed for half an hour. The Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican and Britiſh lines being fully formed, the action was renewed, and became general at three. Both armies appeared determined to conquer or die, and there was one continual blaze of fire for three hours without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; the report of the muſkets reſembled an inceſſant roll beating on a number of drums.—The Americans and Britiſh alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drove and were driven by each other.—Three Britiſh regiments, the 20th, the 21ſt,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025347_0120_0FCCFFB5C1DD1CA0"/>and the 62d, were in a conſtant and cloſe fire for near four hours. All ſuffered conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſs: the 62d, which was 500 ſtrong when it left Canada, was now reduced to leſs than 60 men, and to four or five officers. Few ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been characteriſed, by more obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in attack or defence, than was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Both parties claimed the victory, though neither had much advantage to boaſt of.</p>
               <p>From this time till near the middle of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, battles and ſkirmiſhes continually took place between the two armies, and the Britiſh were ſadly reduced and weakened. On the 13th Gen. Burgoyne, finding that the troops had only three days proviſions, in ſtore, on ſhort allowance, and no apparent means of retreat remaining, called into council all the generals, field officers, and captains com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding troops. There was not a ſpot of ground in the whole camp for holding the council of war, but what was expoſed to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non or rifle ſhot; and while the council was deliberating, an eighteen-pound ball croſſed the table. By the unanimous advice of the council, the general was induced to open a treaty with Gen. Gates. The firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the latter were rejected, and the ſixth article with diſdain, wherein it was required, that the Britiſh army ſhould lay down their arms in their entrenchments. Burgoyne's counter-propoſals were unanimouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and being ſent to Gates were
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025347_0121_0FCCFFB7397E79B0"/>agreed to, on the 15th, without any material alteration.</p>
               <p>Gen. Gates being fearful of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that might follow, ſhould Gen. Vaughan with his troops come up in time to Burgoyne's aſſiſtance, determined upon bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter to an immediate iſſue. On the morning of the 17th, he got every thing in readineſs for attacking the royal army. This done he took out his watch, the time agreed for ſigning being come. He then ſent Col. Greaton on horſeback to Burgoyne with a meſſage, requiring the general to ſign, and allowed him no more than ten minutes to go and return. He was back in time, the treaty was ſigned, all hoſtile appearances ceaſed, and the Americans marched into the Britiſh lines to the tune of Yankee Doodle. They were kept there until the royal army had marched out of their lines, and depoſited their arms at the place appointed by the treaty.</p>
               <p>The delicacy with which this buſineſs was conducted reflects the higheſt honor upon the American general. It intimated that he was ſenſible of the mortification attending a reverſe of fortune, and that he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aggravate the painful feelings of the royal troops, by admitting the American ſoldiers to be eye witneſſes to the degrading ſpectacle of piling their arms. When the arms were depoſited agreeable to treaty, the
<pb n="121"
                      facs="unknown:025347_0122_0FCCFFB959202CB8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>royal troops were ſerved with bread by the Americans, as they had not any left, nor flour to make it. They had only one day's ſalt meat remaining.</p>
               <p>The treaty was ſtiled, "A convention between Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne and Major Gen. Gates." Among other articles it was ſtipulated, "That the troops under Lieut. Gen. Burgoyne ſhall march out of their camp with the honors of war, and the artillery of the entrenchments, to the verge of the river. where the arms and artillery are to be left.—The arms to be piled by word of command from their own officers. A free paſſage to be granted to the royal army to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, upon condition of not ſerving again in North America during the preſent conteſt; and the port of Boſton to be aſſigned for the entry of tranſports to receive the troops, whenever Gen.

               <p>The return ſigned by Gen. Burgoyne, at the time of the convention, made the Britiſh army, including Germans, amount to 5791, which was very ſhort of the number they had on ſetting out from Canada. The train of braſs arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>TOWARDS the end of October, 1777, the royal army, under the command of Sir William Howe, removed to Philadelphia. Meaſures being concerted between the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and admiral for clearing the Delaware of its obſtructions, the former ordered batteries to be erected on the weſtern or Pennſylvanian ſhore, to aſſiſt in diſlodging the Americans from Mud iſland.

               <p>The expedition againſt Mud Iſland met with better ſucceſs, the Americans being drive from thence, and forced to retire to Red bank.</p>
               <p>On the night of the 18th of November, Lord Cornwallis marched with a conſiderable force, and the next day croſſed the Delaware, in his way to Red bank, which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans abandoned, leaving behind them the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>On the third of May, 1778, Mr. Simeon Deane arrived in America expreſs from France, with very important diſpatches.—The The congreſs was immediately convened, and the diſpatches opened and read, among which, to their inexpreſſible joy, were a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of commerce and a treaty of alliance, concluded between his moſt chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the king of France and the United States of America.

               <p>The congreſs, after receiving the treaties, had a ſtronger feeling of their own import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than before, and reſolved, "That the cummiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Gen Howe was ſucceeded in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army by Sit Henry Clinton, who arrived at Philadelphia on the eighth of May.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth of February the treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and the United States were ſigned. The alliance batween theſe two powers was known to the Britiſh miniſtry ſoon after they were ſigned. Mr. Fox, in a debate in the Houſe of Commons five days afterwards, aſſerted, that the number of men loſt to the army, in killed, diſabled, deſerted, and from various other cauſes, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of hoſlilities with America to that period, amounted to above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>

               <p>The ſpeech was long, able, and eloquent, and kept him up two full hours. A dull melancholy ſilence for ſome time ſucceeded. It was heard with profound attention, but without a ſingle mark of approbation. Aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, dejection, and fear, over-clouded the whole aſſembly. It was conjectured, that ſome powerful motive had induced miniſtry to adopt ſuch an alteration of meaſures. This idea was confirmed by the poſitive aſſertion of Mr. Fox, that a treaty had been ſigned at Paris between the colonies and France, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 13th of March, the French am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador delivered a reſcript to Lord Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, in which he informed the court of London, that the king had ſigned a treaty of friendſhip and commerce with the United States of America. The knowledge of this tranſaction was communicated under the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of cultivating the good underſtanding between France and Great Britain.</p>

On the 21ſt of March, a public audience and reception were given to the American commiſſioners, Meſſ. Franklin, Deane, and Lee, by the French monarch. They were introduced by Monſ. Vergennes, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the king with the uſual formalities and ceremonies. The ſtriking acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the plenipotentiaries from the United States mortified the miniſtry and crown of Great Britain, and may be pronounced the political phenomenon of Europe.

               <p>From this time, the courts of London and Verſailles were buſied in fitting out their fleets, which met each other in the month of July.

Several ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes happened between the Americans and the regulars with various ſucceſs, till on the goth of June the royal army arrived in the neighborhood of Sandy Hook. During the courſe of the march from Philadelphia, the royal army was much reduced, upwards of 800 having deſerted, a great number of whom were Heſſians.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of July, the army paſſed over a bridge of boats croſs a narrow channel to Sandy Hook, and were afterwards carried up to Newyork.

Count d'Eſtaing anchored on the 8th at night at the entrance of the Delaware. The next morning he weighed and ſailed towards the Hook, and on the evening of the 11th anchored without it. Had not bad weather and unexpected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimen's prevented, the Count muſt have ſurpriſed Howe's fleet in the Delaware, as the latter would not have had time to eſcape
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025347_0134_0FCCFFD0C5DABFB0"/>after being appriſed of his danger. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleet muſt have been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a ſurpriſal, and that muſt have accaſioned the inevitable loſs of the royal army, which would have been ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by the French ſquadron on the one ſide, and the American forces on the other, that the Saratoga cataſtrophe muſt have been repeated. Lord Howe's fleet conſiſted only of ſix ſixty four gun ſhips, three of fifty, and two of forty, with ſome frigates and ſloops. Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d Eſtaing had twelve ſhips of the line, ſome of which were of great force and weight.</p>
               <p>On the and of July, the count ſailed from Sandy Hook, when about twenty ſail of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels bound to New York fell into his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. They were chiefly prizes taken from the Americans; but had he ſtayed a few days longer, Admiral Byron's fleet muſt have fallen a defenceleſs prey into their hands. That ſquadron had met with unuſual bad weather, and being ſeperated in different ſtorms, and lingering through a tedious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, arrived ſcattered, broken, ſickly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſted, or otherwiſe damaged in various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of diſtreſs, upon different and remote parts of the American coaſt. Between the departure of d'Eſtaing and the 30th of July, the Renown of 50 guns from the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Raiſonable and Centurion of 64, and the Cornwall of 74 guns, all arrived
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025347_0135_0FCCFFD3082DBC18"/>ſingly at Sandy Hook. By d'Eſtaing's ſpeedy departure a number of proviſion ſhips from Cork eſcaped alſo, together with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. They went up the Delaware within fifty miles of Philadelphia after Lord Howe had quitted the river, not having obtained any information of what had happened. The Britiſh miniſtry had neglected countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deſtination, though orders for the evacuation of Philadelphia had been ſent off ſo early, as to have admitted of their receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ind freſh inſtructions where to have ſteered before ſailing. Great rejoicings were made at New York upon their ſafe arrival, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as proviſions were much wanted both by the fleet and army.</p>
               <p>Let us now quit the military operations for the preſent and take a view of the pending negociations. Gov. Johnſtone, meaning to avail himſelf of former connections, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to commence or renew a private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with ſeveral members of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and other perſons of conſideration. In his letter to them he uſed a freedom with the authority under which he acted, not cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary with thoſe entruſted with delegated power, and afforded ſuch a degree of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the Americans in the paſt reſiſtance they had made, as is ſeldom granted by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociators to their opponents. In a letter to Joſeph Reed, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of April 11th, he ſaid "The man, who can be inſtumental in

                  </gap> that are affected by the quartel and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, than ever was yet beſtowed on human kind."</p>
               <p>On the 16th of June, he wrote to Robert Morris, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> "I believe the men, who have conducted the affairs of America, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being influenced by improper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but in all ſuch tranſactions there is riſk, and I think that whoever ventures ſhould be ſec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I think that Waſhington and the preſident have a right to every favour that a grateful nation can beſtow, if they could once more unite our intereſt, and ſpare the miſeries and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations of war."</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 21ſt of June, Mr. Reed received a written meſſage from Mrs Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſon, expreſſing a deſire to ſee him on bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which could not be committed to writing. On his attending in the evening, agreeable to her appointment, after ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious converſation, ſhe enlarged upon the great talents and amiable qualities of Gov. Johnſtone, and added, that in ſeveral conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025347_0137_0FCCFFD5FAB29898"/>with her, he had expreſſed the moſt favorable ſentiments of Mr. Reed; that it was particularly wiſhed to engage his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to promote the object of the Britiſh commiſſioners, viz. a re-union of the two countries, if conſiſtent with his principles and judgment; and that in ſuch caſe it could not be deemed unbecoming or improper in the Britiſh government to take a favorable notice of ſuch conduct; and that, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Mr. Reed might have ten thouſand pounds ſterling, and any office in the colonies in his majeſty's gift.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reed, finding an anſwer was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, replied, "I am not worth purchaſing; but ſuch as I am, the king of Great Britain is not rich enough to do it." However right, the principles might be, on which this inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating ſcheme of conciliation was adopted, its effects were inimical.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of July, congreſs ordered, "That all letters received by members of congreſs from any of the Britiſh commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, or their agents, or from any ſubject of the king of Great Britain, of a public nature, be laid before congreſs" The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding letters, being communicated, and Mr. Reed making a declaration of what had paſſed within his knowledge, congreſs reſolved, "That the ſame cannot be conſidered but as direct attempts to corrupt and bribe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; that as congreſs feel, ſo they ought to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025347_0138_0FCCFFD8AA1FDBF8"/>demonſtrate, the higheſt and moſt pointed indignation againſt ſuch daring and atrocious attempts to corrupt their integrity; and that it is incompatible with the honour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to hold any manner of correſpondence or intercourſe with the ſaid George John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> eſpecially to negociate with him upon affairs, in which the cauſe of liberty is concerned."</p>
               <p>The proceedings in this buſineſs were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the form of a declaration, a copy of which was ordered to be ſigned by the preſident, and ſent by a flag to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at Newyork.</p>
               <p>Theſe proceedings produced a very angry and violent declaration from Gov. Johnſtone, in which the immediate operations of paſſion and diſappointment were too conſpicious. The language of his publication but poorly agreed with the high and flatter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had ſo lately laviſhed on the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans in thoſe very letters, which were the ſubject of the preſent conteſt. It was dated the 26th of Auguſt, and tranſmitted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; together with a declaration of the ſame date from Lord Carliſle. Sir Henry Clinton, and Mr. Eden, which went to a ſolemn and total diſavowel, ſo far as related to the preſent ſubject, of their having had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:025347_0139_0FCCFFD9CF326D38"/>
Thus were all hopes of further negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with congreſs at an end. Had Lord North, and the reſt of the miniſtry then in being, adopted theſe corrupting meaſures in the more early part of the Amrican diſputes, it is poſſible he might have ſucceeded; but to attempt it at a time when the ſpirits of the Americans were raiſed to the higheſt pitch by their new alliance with France, was ſurely little ſhort of folly and madneſs.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of Auguſt, the Hon. Sieur Gerard was introduced to the congreſs, in quality of miniſter plenipotentiary, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a letter from his maſter the king of France to <hi>his very dear great friends and allies;</hi> and the compliments Monſ. Gerard received on this occaſion, were very different from thoſe ſentiments the Americans lately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of their <hi>now</hi> faithful allies!</p>
               <p>On the 14th of September, congreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the election of a miniſter plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary to the court of France, when Dr. Benjamin Franklin was elected by ballot. His inſtructions were dated the 26th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, and by them he was directed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if poſſible, the French king's conſent to expunge two of the articles of the treaty of commerce. The doctor was to inculcate the certainty of ruining the Britiſh fiſhery on the banks of Newfoundland, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Britiſh marine, by reducing Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifax and Quebec.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>THE campaign in the northern ſtates hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced nothing advantageous to the Britiſh, and the winter being the proper ſeaſon for ſouthern expeditions, Sir Henry Clinton concluded upon turning his arms againſt Georgia. He might propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the reduction of all the ſouthern ſtates, and he ſtrongly inclined to it, by reaſon that theſe ſtates produced the moſt valuable articles of commerce for the European market, and carried on a conſiderable export trade, which appeared no otherwiſe affected by the war, than as it ſuffered from the Britiſh cruiſers. The rice was devoted to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of its enemies, while it was wanted for the ſupport of the royal ſleet and army in America. A plan of operations was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed with Gen. Prevoſt, who commanded in Eaſt Florida; and it was intended, that Georgia ſhould be invaded both on the north and ſouth ſides at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>This expedition was committed to Col. Campbell, and the forces appointed to act under him amounted to full 2500, which ſailed from Sandy Hook, on the 27th of November, being eſcorted by a ſmall ſquadron under Commodore Hyde Parker. The fleet arrived at the iſle of Tibee, near the mouth of the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025347_0142_0FCCFFDE44E03310"/>Savannah, and on the 29th of December, the troops effected a landing. They were no ſooner landed, than they were led to attack the fort, which the Britiſh perſiſted in with ſo much ſpirit and rapidity, that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans retreated with precipitation and diſorder. No victory was ever more complete: thirty-eight officers, and 415 non-commiſſioned and privates, 48 pieces of cannon, 23 mortars, the fort with its ammunition and ſtores, the ſhipping in the river, a large quantity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, with the capital of Georgia, were all within the ſpace of a few hours, in the poſſeſſion of the Britiſh troops.</p>
               <p>The 30th of December was appointed as a thankſgiving-day, by order of congreſs. The affairs of the United States were at this period in a moſt diſtreſſed, deplorable, and ruinous condition. Idleneſs, diſſipation, and extravagance, ſeemed to have engroſſed the attention of the generality of the American ſons of liberty; and ſelf-intereſt, ſpeculation, and an inſatiable thirſt for riches a peared to have got the better of every other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and almoſt of every order of men. Party diſputes and perſonal quarrels were too much the general object, while the moment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concerns of the empire, a vaſt accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated debt, ruined finances, depreciated mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey, and want of credit, which naturally brings on the want of every thing, were but ſecondary conſiderations, and poſtponed by
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025347_0143_0FCCFFDFC6A92788"/>congreſs from time to time, as if their affairs were in the moſt flouriſhing ſituation. The paper currency in Philadelphia was daily ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at length even ſo low as fifty per cent, yet an aſſembly, a concert, a dinner, or ſupper, which coſt two or three hundred pounds, did not only take men off from act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but even from thinking of what ought to have been neareſt their hearts. Some of the moſt diſintereſted and patriotic Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans felt more diſtreſs from this review of things, than they had done at any other time, from the diſappointments and loſſes in the courſe of the war.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Mons. Gerard, the French ambaſſador, manifeſted a deſire, that the war might not be prolonged by too high and unreaſonable demands, and that the United States would reduce their ultimatum as low as poſſible. He ſtrongly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moderation, as the fate of war was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and he hinted, that a deciſive naval engagement in favour of the Britiſh, might give a great turn to their affairs.</p>
               <p>The South-Carolina delegates, rather with a view to conqueſt, than from any ſpecial apprehenſion of danger to their own or neighbouring ſtates, from the troops under Gen. Clinton, requeſted the Congreſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Gen. Lincoln on whoſe character they juſtly repoſed great confidence, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all the forces to the ſouthward. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

               <p>On the 2d of March, the American offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the day reported, that reconno t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parties of the enemy's horſe and foot had been ſeen within their piquet the night pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding. Gen. Aſhe, who had croſſed the Savannah, with about 1200 troops, beſides 200 light horſe, returned on the evening of the ſame day to his camp. In ſhort, the conduct of Gen. Aſhe was ſo puſillanimous, that he made no preparations to impede the march of the Britiſh, and, ſoon after their appearance, he and his troops fled with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, without firing a gun.</p>
               <p>In the month of May Sir Henry Clinton diſpatched Sir George Collier and Gen. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews, with about 2000 men, beſides 500 marines, to make a deſcent upon Virginia. They ſailed for Portſmooth in that Province, and upon their arrival landed their troops at a diſtance, then marched and took immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate poſſeſſion of the town, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenceleſs. The remains of Norfolk, on the oppoſite ſide of the river, fell of courſe into their hands. On the approach of the fleet and army, the Americans burnt ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, others were ſaved and poſſeſſed by the Britiſh. The guards were puſhed forwards eighteen miles by night to Suffolk, where they arrived by day light and proceeded to

                  </gap>night that the fleet and army continued upon the coaſt, the loſs of the Americans was prodigious. Above 130 veſſels of all ſorts, including ſome privateers, and ſhips of force, were deſtroyed or taken by them; ſeventeen prizes were brought away, beſides 3000 hogſheads of tobacco, which fell into their poſſeſſion at Portſmouth. Except the houſe of a widow and the church, they burnt every houſe in Suffolk, and all the principal houſes of gentlemen in this route ſhared the ſame fate.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of May, the troops were joined to others going up the North river to attack the poſts of Stoney Point and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plank, where the Americans had begun to conſtruct ſtrong works, for keeping the lower communication open between the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern and ſouthern ſtates. Gen. Vaughan landed with the greater part on the eaſt-ſide, while the remainder, accompanied by Sir Henry Clinton, advanced further up, landed on the weſt ſide, and took poſſeſſion of Stoney Point without oppoſition. Directly oppoſite, the Americans had completely fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed a ſtrong ſort, which was defended by

There were not ten guns mounted on the lines when the enemy firſt appeared, and in a few days the number exceeded eighty. The garriſon was between two and three thouſand, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 150 militia. The damage it ſuſtained was trifling as the men fired under cover, and few of the aſſailants fired at all.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee what the northern army was doing. In the middle of December, a part of Gen. Waſhington's army was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bread and for the reſt he had not, either on the ſpot or within reach, a ſupply ſufficient for foor days. Both officers and men were almoſt periſhing through want for a fortnight.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025347_0149_0FCCFFED4F15B990"/>The deficiency proceeded from the abſolute emptineſs of the American magazines in every place, and the total want of money and credit to repleniſh them. So that the general was obliged to call upon the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of the Jerſey ſtate, to expreſs his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and to declare in plain terms, that he and his army were reduced to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative of diſbanding or catering for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unleſs the inhabitants would afford them aid.

On the 12th of April, the Britiſh opened their batteries againſt Charleſtown, and a conſtant fire was kept up between both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties until the 20th. On the 18th of April, Sir Henry Clinton received a reinforcement of 3000 men from New York; and on the 12th of May, Gen. Lincoln, after having made the moſt vigorous defence he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, was obliged to capitulate. It was ſtipulated, that the continental troops and ſailors ſhould remain priſoners of war until exchanged, and be provided with good and wholeſome proviſions, in ſuch quantities as were ſerved out to the Britiſh troops. The militia were to return home as priſoners on parole, which, as long as they obſerved, was to ſecure them from being moleſted in their property by the Britiſh troops. The officers of the army and navy were to keep their ſwords, piſtols, and baggage, which laſt was not to be ſearched; but their horſes were not to go out of town, but might be diſpoſed of by a perſon left for the purpoſe. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, at an hour appointed, was to march out of the town to the ground between the works of the place and the canal, where they were to depoſit their arms. The drums were not to beat a Britiſh march, nor the colours to be uncaſed. All civil officers and citizens, who had borne arms during the ſiege, were to be priſoners on parole; and with reſpect to their property in the city, they were to have

               <p>The capital having ſurrendered, the next object of the Britiſh was to ſecure the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubmiſſion of the inhabitants.

Ternay, might ſoon be expected on the American coaſt. This induced him to reimbark for New-York, leaving Lord Cornwallis with about 4000 men, which were deemed fully ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his purpoſes.</p>
               <p>On the 4th of September was ſigned the plan of a treaty of commerce between the ſtates of Holland and the United States of America, Monſ. de Neufville, being prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly authorized by the regency of Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, engaged, that as long as America ſhould not act contrary to the intereſt of the ſtates of Holland, the city of Amſterdam would never adopt any meaſure that might tend to oppoſe the intereſt of America; but would, on the contrary, uſe all ts' influence upon the ſtates of the ſeven United Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces of Holland, to effect the deſired connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This buſineſs was conducted by Mr. Adams on the part of America.</p>
               <p>Lord Cornwallis went on ſucceſsfully in South Carolina. On the 16 h of Auguſt he engaged the forces under Gen. Gates, and completely routed them after a long and obſtinate conteſt. Gen. Gates was borne off the field by a torrent of diſmayed militia.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025347_0154_0FCCFFF586CF54F8"/>They conſtituted ſo great a part of his army, that when he ſaw them break and run with ſuch precepitation, be loſt every hope of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and his only care was, if poſſible, to rally a ſufficient number to cover the retreat of the other troops. He retired with Gen. Caſwell to Clermont, in hope of halting them in their late encampment; but the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they fled, the more they diſperſed, and the generals giving up all as loſt, retired with a few attendants to Charlotte.</p>
               <p>The Americans loſt eight field pieces, the whole of their artillery, with all their ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition waggons, beſides 150 others, and a conſiderable quantity of military ſtores, and the greateſt part of their baggage. The numbers ſlain cannot be preciſely aſcertained, no returns of the militia ever being made after the action: but it is ſuppoſed, that the Americans loſt about 700 on this occaſion. Though Cornwallis's victory was complete, yet, from the account the Britiſh gave of the action, it may be inferred, that it was dearly bought, upwards of 500 of their own troops being killed or wounded.</p>
               <p>A minute repreſentation of the retreat of the Americans from Charlotte to Saliſbury, would be the image of complicated wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Care, anxiety, pain, humiliation, and dejection, poverty, hurry and confuſion, promiſcuouſly marked the ſhocking ſcene. Painful objects preſented themſelves to view;

               <p>Lord Cornwallis, nowithſtanding his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, was reſtrained for ſome time from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his conqueſts, by the loſs he had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the battle, the extreme heat of the weather, the ſicklineſs of the ſeaſon and the want of neceſſary ſupplies; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at Cambden.</p>
               <p>In the month of September, a diſcovery of the utmoſt importance was made, which was a ſcheme for delivering Weſt Point into the hands of Sir Henry Clint on. Gen.

He continued his extravagant courſe of living, was unſucceſsful in trade and privateering, his funds were exhauſted, and his creditors importunate, while his luſt for high life was not in the leaſt abated. He had exhibited heavy accounts and demands againſt the public; and the commiſſioners, upon examination, rejected about one half of the amount. He appealed to congreſs, and a committee was appointed, who were

This provoked him to outrageous expreſſions and proceedings. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at the treatment he had met with, embarraſſed in his circumſtances, and having a growing expenſive family, he turned his thoughts towards bettering his circumſtances by new means. In 1779, a correſpondence commenced between Gen. Arnold and Major Andre, adjutant-general to the Britiſh army, a riſing young officer of great hope and merit.</p>
               <p>For the ſpeedy completion of the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was carrying on between Sir Henry and Gen.

Before this, a written correſpondence through other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, had been maintained between Arnold and Andre at New York, under the names of Guſtavus and Anderſon. √</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of September, the neceſſary arrangenents being made, a boat was ſent at night from the ſhore to the Vulture, to fetch Major Andre, which brought him to the beach without the poſts of either army, where he met Arnold The major continued with him during the day following, and at night, the boatman refuſing to conduct him

Col. Jameſon, the continental officer who had the command of the ſcouting parties, amounting to 800 men, chiefly militia. Arnold's conduct with regard to this body of men, and in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, had excited ſuch ſuſpicions in the breaſt of the lieutenant-colonel, and the reſt of the officers, that they had determined upon ſeizing the general at all events, had he come down and ordered them nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe papers were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by Jameſon.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had Arnold received the Major's letter, than he haſtened on board the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had the plot ſucceeded, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences muſt have been ruinous to the Americans. The forces under Arnold's command muſt have either laid down their arms, or have been cut to pieces. Their loſs, and the immediate poſſeſſion of Weſt-Point, and all its neighbouring dependencies, muſt have expoſed the remainder of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's army ſo, to the joint exertion of the Britiſh forces, by land and water, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruin could have been the reſult with reſpect to the Americans.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of September Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington appointed a board of fourteen general officers, with the aſſiſtance of the judge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:025347_0160_0FCCFFFE81301F78"/>general, to examine Major Andre's caſe, and to determine in what light it ought to be conſidered. Andre, diſdaining all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge and evaſion, and ſtudying only to place his character in ſo fair a light, as might prevent its being ſhaded by preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, voluntarily confeſſed more than he was aſked, and ſought not to palliate any thing relating to himſelf, while he concealed, with the moſt guarded and ſcrupulous nicety, whatever might involve others. The board ſhewed him every poſſible mark of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſufficiently witneſſed how much they felt for his ſituation. However, public juſtice obliged them to declare, "that Major Andre ought to be conſidered as a ſpy from the enemy; and that agreeable to the law and uſage of nations, it is their opinion he ought to ſuffer death."</p>
               <p>Several letters paſſed between the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Clinton and Waſhington relative to this unhappy affair; but nothing was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſaving the unfortunate major. On the 2d of October, the tragedy was cloſed. The major was ſuperior to the terrors of death; but the diſgraceful mode of dying, which the uſage of war had annexed to his unhappy ſituation, was infinitely dreadful to him. He was deſirous of being indulged with a profeſſional death, and had accordingly written, the day before, a pathetic letter, fraught with all the feelings of a man of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025347_0161_0FCD0000DAAA3F88"/>and honor, in which he requeſted of Gen. Waſhington, that he might not die on a gibbet. The general conſulted his officers on the ſubject. Pity and eſteem wrought ſo powerfully, that they were all for ſhooting him, till Greene inſiſted on it, that his crime was that of a common ſpy; that the public good required his being hanged; and that, were he ſhot, the generality would think there were favorable circumſtances entitling him to notice and lenity. His obſervations convinced them that there would be an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in granting the major's requeſt, while tenderneſs prevented its being divulged.</p>
               <p>When Major Andre was led out to the place of execution, as he went along he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf familiarly to all thoſe with whom he had been acquainted in his confinement. —A ſmile of complacency expreſſed the ſerene fortitude of his mind. Upon ſeeing the preparations at the fatal ſpot, he aſked with ſome emotion, "Muſt I die in this manner?" He was told it was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He replied "I am reconciled to my fate, but not to the mode." Soon after, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf, he added "it will be but a momentary pang;" and ſpringing upon the cart, he performed the laſt offices to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a compoſure that excited the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and melted the hearts of all the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators. —Being told the final moment was at hand, and aſked if he had any thing to ſay,

               <p>SIR Henry Clinton, on the 15th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1780, in obedience to the orders ſent him to proſecute the war with vigour in North Carolina and Virginia, diſpatched Gen. Leſlie from New York to the bay of Cheſapeak, with near 3000 choice troops. He was to co-operate with Lord Cornwallis, who was expected to be far advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if not to have reached Virginia. In a few days, the fleet arrived in the bay, and the troops were landed in different parts of Virginia.</p>
               <p>On the 20th of June, the French and Spaniſh fleets formed a junction in the Weſt Indies. They amounted to 36 ſail of the line which, with their united land forces, formed ſuch an apparent ſuperiority, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thoſe ſeas or iſlands ſeemed capable of reſiſting; but the Spaniſh troops, being too much crowded on board their tranſports, together with the length of the voyage, the change of climate and diet, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a moſt mortal and contagious diſorder was generated, which firſt infected their own ſeamen, and at length ſpread, though not with ſo fatal an effect, through the French fleet and land forces. Beſides the great mortality on the paſſage, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards landed 1200 ſick on their firſt arrival
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025347_0164_0FCD00061DB88D10"/>at Dominique, and a much greater number afterwards at Gaudaloupe and Martinico. Thus the ſpirit of enterprize was damped, and ſome part of their ſtrength diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>In the month of September, Mr. Laurens was taken on his way from congreſs to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on the banks of Newfoundland. A packet of papers being thrown over-board, and not ſinking ſuddenly, was ſaved by the boldneſs and dexterity of an Engliſh ſailor, and moſt of them were recovered from the effects of the water On his arrival in England, he was committed, upon a charge of high treaſon, as a ſtate priſoner to the Tower, under an order ſigned by the three ſecretaries of ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> By the medium of his papers, adminiſtration came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the eventual treaty of amity and commerce between America and Holland.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this diſcovery, ſtrong remonſtrances were made to the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but, as no ſatisfactory anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, Sir Joſeph Yorke received orders to withdraw from the Hague; and, on the 20th of December, general repriſals were iſſued againſt the ſhips, goods, and ſubjects, of the States General.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of January, 1781, General Greene's troops conſiſted of about 1110. The next day, Col. Lee's partizan legion arrived from the northward, conſiſting of about 100 horſemen, well mounted, and 120
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:025347_0165_0FCD0007834E9690"/>infantry; and on the 13th the legion was detached on a ſecret expedition. They puſhed on for Georgetown, where they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed ſeveral officers, and took them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners Major Irwin, and many more of the garriſon were killed; but the principal part fled to the fort, which Lee was not in a condition to beſiege. While this enterprize was carrying on, the enemy aimed a blow at Morgan, who was adviſed by Greene not to riſque too much.</p>
               <p>Gen. Leſlie, in compliance with his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, left Virginia, and arrived at Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, and joined Lord Cornwallis, who wiſhed to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The execution of this buſineſs was entruſted to Lieut. Col. Tarleton, who was detached with about 1100 men for that purpoſe. On the 17th of January, Tarleton came up with Morgan, when an action com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, which terminated much to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of Tarle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on.</p>
               <p>Tarleton was very much cenſured for his conduct in this battle, which he was ſuppoſed to have loſt by his un-officer like impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Lord Cornwallis, with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of regaining the priſoners, and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Morgan's corps, inſtantly concluded on a purſuit, which Morgan was aware of, and took his meaſures accordingly.</p>

On the 31ſt of January, Greene ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Morgan in the command of the ſouthern army, when a kind of military race commenced between the purſuing Britiſh and the fleeing Americans; but Greene got off before Cornwallis could overtake him.</p>
               <p>Lord Cornwallis, being afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from Greene's movements, that he intended to venture an engagement, on the 14th of May ſent off his baggage under a proper eſcort, and the next morning at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, marched with the remainder of his army, amounting to about 2400 men, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troops grown veterans in victory, either to meet Greene on the way, or attack him in his encampment.</p>
               <p>The battle took place near Guilford court-houſe; and after a hard ſtruggle of near two hours, the Americans retreated in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Reedy Fork, and croſſed the river, about three miles from the field of action. Greene loſt his artillery, and two ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waggons, the greateſt part of the horſes being killed before the retreat began.</p>
               <p>In the month of February, repriſals hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been commenced againſt the Dutch, Rodney and Vaughan received inſtructions from Great Britain to direct their views to the reduction of the Dutch iſland of St. Euſtatia.

All the ſtorehouſes were filled with various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and the very beach was covered with hogſheads of ſugar and tobacco. The value was eſtimated conſiderably above three millions ſterling. But this was only a part; for above 150 veſſels of all denominations, many of them richly laden, were captured in the bay, excluſive of a Dutch frigate of 38 guns, and five ſmaller. The neighboring ſmall iſles of St Martin and Saba were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Rodney being informed, that a fleet of about 30 large ſhips, all richly laden, with ſugar and other Weſt India commodities, had ſailed from Euſtatia for Holland juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arrival, under convoy of a flag ſhip of
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025347_0168_0FCCDB881DF284E8"/>60 guns, he diſpatched the Monarch and Panther, with the Sybil frigate in purſuit of them. Theſe ſoon overtook the convoy, when the Dutch admiral refuſing to ſtrike his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and all remonſtrances proving ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, a ſhort engagement took place between his ſhip, the Mars and the Monarque. He died bravely in defence of his ſhip, when ſhe inſtantly ſtruck, and the whole convoy was taken.</p>
               <p>The keeping of Dutch colours flying at Euſtatia, rendered it for ſome time a decoy to French, Dutch, and American veſſels, a conſiderable number of which fell accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly into the hands of the conquerors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble.</p>
               <p>Preparations began to be made, on the 21ſt of June, for the army under Gen. Waſhington to take the field The Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans marched towards White Plains, where they were joined by the French troops under Rochambeau.</p>
               <p>Sir George Rodney, in conſequence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerning the French fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Count de Graſſe, detached the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Sir Samuel Hood and Drake, with ſeventeen ſail of the line, to cruiſe off Fort Royal for the purpoſe of intercepting him. On the 28th of April, ſome of Sir Samuel's headmoſt ſhips returned haſtily in ſight, and with ſignals announced the appearance of a ſuperior fleet, and a numerous convoy, to
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:025347_0169_0FCD000DC1B94CA8"/>the windward of Point Salines. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral made a ſignal for a general chace to windward, and at night it was determined by the admirals to continue the line a-head, ſo that getting as much as poſſible to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they might cloſe in with Fort Royal at day-light, and cut off the enemy from the harbour.</p>
               <p>In the morning the French appeared, their convoy keeping cloſe in with the land, while Count de Graſſe drew up his fleet in a line of battle for their protection. Admiral Hood uſed every manaeuvre to bring him to action; but he being to windward, and ſo having the choice, preferred a long ſhot diſtance. A partial engagement enſued. The van and the neareſt ſhips, in the centre of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, were expoſed to a long and heavy weight of fire, in their ſtruggles to cloſe the French, and get to the windward; but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered principally in their maſts, hulls, and rigging. The action laſted about three hours, when Admiral Hood perceiving, that not one ſhot in ten of the French reached, and that his attempts to gain the wind were fruitleſs, ceaſed firing, and the Britiſh fleet bore away for Antigua.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to the tranſactions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lord Cornwallis. One great object of the Britiſh force was the eſtabliſhment of a ſtrong poſt and place of arms, and ſuch as might render them perfectly maſters of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapeak

                  </gap>k; and within an hour after they received an expreſs from Count de Graſſe, with the joyful account of his arrival and ſituation. By the 15th of September, all the troops were arrived and landed at Williamſburgh, and preparations were made with all poſſible diſpatch for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the army in a ſituation to move down towards York town.</p>
               <p>On the 30th of September, Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis was cloſely inveſted in York Town. The trenches were opened by the combined armies on the 6th of October, at 600 yards diſtance from Cornwallis's works. On the 9th they opened their batteries, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firing all night, without intermiſſion: The next morning the French opened their batteries on the left, and a tremendous roar of cannon and mortars was continued for ſix or eight hours without ceaſing.</p>
               <p>The French and Americans continued to carry on the ſiege with great ſucceſs On the 16th their ſeveral batteries were covered with near 100 pieces of heavy ordnance; while the Britiſh works were ſo deſtroyed that they could ſcarcely ſhow a ſingle gun. Thus was Lord Cornwallis reduced to the neceſſity of preparing for a ſurrender, or of
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025347_0171_0FCD0013790C5308"/>attempting an eſcape. He determined upon the latter. Boats were prepared under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent pretences, for the reception of the troops by ten at night, in order to paſs them over to Glouceſter-Point. The arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were made with the utmoſt ſecrecy. The intention was to abandon the baggage, and to leave a detachment behind to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for the town's people, and for the ſick and wounded, his lordſhip having already prepared a letter on the ſubject, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Gen. Waſhington after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The firſt embarkation had arrived at Glouceſter Point, and the greater part of the troops were already landed, when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was before moderate and calm, inſtantly changed to a moſt violent ſtorm of wind and rain The bouts with the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troops were all driven down the river, and the deſign of paſſing over was not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely fruſtrated, but the abſence of the boats rendered it impoſſible to bring back the troops from Glouceſter. Thus weakened and divided, the army was in no ſmall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. However, the boats returned, and the troops were brought back in the courſe of the forenoon with very little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſs.</p>
               <p>Things were now haſtening to a period, which could be no longer protracted; for the Britiſh works were ſinking under the weight of the French and American artillery. All hopes of relief from New York were over,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025347_0172_0FCD00156D116E08"/>and the ſtrength and ſpirits of the royal army were broken down and exhauſted by their conſtant and unremitting fatigue. Matters being in this ſinuation on the 17th of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, Lord Cornwallis ſent out a flag with a letter to Gen. Waſhington, requeſting a ceſſation of arms for twenty four hours, and that commiſſioners might be appointed for digeſting the terms of capitulation. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were accordingly appointed; and on the ſide of the allies, were Viſe. de Noailles, and Lieut. Col. Laurens, whoſe father was in cloſe confinement in the Tower of London, while the ſon was drawing up articles, by which an Engliſh nobleman and a Britiſh army became priſoners.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of October, the poſts of York Town and Glouceſter were ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The honour of marching out with colours flying, which had been denied to Gen. Lincoln, was now refuſed to Lord Cornwallis, and Lincoln was appointed to receive the ſubmiſſion of the royal army at York Town, preciſely in the ſame way his own had been conducted about eighteen months before. The troops that ſurrendered priſoners exceeded 7000; but ſo great was the number of ſick and wounded, that there were only 3800 capable of doing duty. The officers and ſoldiers retained their baggage and effects. Fifteen hundred ſeamen ſhared the ſame fate as the garriſon. The Gauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loupe
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:025347_0173_0FCD0017158EC898"/>frigate of 24 guns, and a number of tranſports, were ſurrendered to the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. About twenty tranſports had been ſunk or burnt during the ſiege. The land forces became priſoners to congreſs; but the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſhips were aſſigned to the French admiral. The Americans obtained a fine train of artillery, conſiſting of 75 braſs ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and 69 iron cannon, howitzers, and mortars.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of October, a fleet deſtined for the relief of Lord Cornwallis arrived off the Cheſapeak; but, on receiving the news of his ſurrender, they returned to New York. The fleet conſiſted of 25 ſhips of the line, two fifties, and eight frigates. When they appeared off the Cheſapeak, the French made no manner of movement, though they had 36 ſhips of the line, being perhaps ſatisfied with their preſent ſucceſs, Every argument and perſuaſion was uſed with the Count de Graſſe to induce him to aid the combined army in an operation againſt Charleſtown; but the advanced ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the orders of his court, and his own engagements to be punctual to a certain time, fixed for his ſuture operations, prevented his compliance. His inſtructions had fixed his departure on the 15th of October, and he had already exceeded that time. On the 27th the troops under the Marquis St. Simon began to embark for the Weſt Indies, and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:025347_0174_0FCD001802FBCB40"/>about the 5th of November de Graſſe ſailed from the Cheſapeak.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <p>ON the 27th of November, the king of England went to the houſe of peers, and opened the ſeſſions of parliament. Warm debates took place on account of the ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner in which the American war was continued; but Lord North and his party, who thought they had not yet carried things far enough, maintained a conſiderable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in the houſe of commons. Mr. Burke had made ſeveral motions, relative to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of Mr. Laurens from the Tower. However, at length, Mr. Laurens was brought before Lord Mansfield, on the laſt day of the vear, in conſequence of an order from the ſecretary of ſtate, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon certain conditions.</p>
               <p>The naval force of France and Spain in the Weſt Indies, in the month of February, 1782, amounted to 60 ſhips of the line, and their land forces when joined would have formed a conſiderable army. Jamaica had no more than ſix incomplete battal ons of regular troops and the militia of the iſland to defend it; and therefore in caſe of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, muſt have been ſoon conquered. The arrival of Sir George Rodney with twelve ſail of the line at Barbadoes, and his ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent junction with Sir Samuel Hood's
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:025347_0176_0FCD001BECC97828"/>ſquadron, together with the arrival of three ſhips of the line from England a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, perhaps providentially ſaved Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica from falling into the hands of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Engliſh fleet at St. Lucia amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 36 ſhips of the line, and the force un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der de Graſſe at Martinico to 34. The metal of the French is always heavier than that of the Engliſh, in equal rates, ſo that in this point the French had the advantage.</p>
               <p>The van of the Britiſh fleet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir Samuel Hood, the centre by Sir George Redney, and the rear by Admiral Sir Francis Drake. The three diviſions of the French fleet were under Count de Graſſe, Monſ. de Vaudreuil, and Monſ. de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainville.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of April, the French fleet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to turn out of Fort Royal harbor early in the morning, with a great convoy under their protection, all bound to the French or Spaniſh ports in Hiſpanicla. De Graſſe, in order to avoid an encounter on his paſſage, meant to keep cloſe in under the iſlands, till be had eluded the purſuit of the Engliſh. However their departure from the bay was ſo ſpeedily communicated by ſignals from the frigates, and the Engliſh fleet was in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="175" facs="unknown:025347_0177_0FCD001E3230FBD8"/>maſters of the time of departure. The Engliſh gained ſight of them under Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique at night, and afterwards regulated the purſuit by ſignals.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, Count de Graſſe formed the line of battle, and thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded an opportunity to his convoy for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on their courſe, while he remained to abide the conſequences. The van of the Engliſh fleet firſt cloſed with the French centre, while the Engliſh centre and rear were becalmed. The action commenced about nine o'clock on the ninth. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleur, Sir Samuel. Hood's own ſhip, had at times ſeven and generally three ſhips firing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and none of the diviſion eſcaped encountering a diſproportionate force. The firm and effectual reſiſtance with which they ſupported all the efforts of the enemy's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, was to the higheſt degree glorious. At length the leading ſhips of the centre were enabled to come up to their aſſiſtance. Theſe were ſoon followed by Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his ſeconds the Namur and the Duke, all of 90 guns: they made and ſupported a moſt tremendous ſire. De Graſſe now changed the nature of the action, and kept at ſuch a diſtance during the remainder of the engagement, as might prevent any thing deciſive happening. The reſt of the Engliſh fleet coming up De Graſſe withdrew his ſhips from the action,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:025347_0178_0FCD001F81F17790"/>and evaded all the efforts of the Engliſh commanders for its renewal. Two of the French ſhips were ſo damaged, that they were obliged to quit the fleet, and put into Guadaloupe. On the ſide of the Engliſh. the Royal Oak and the Montague ſuffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely; but they were capable of being repaired at ſea, ſo as not to be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of quitting the fleet.</p>
               <p>On the 11th the French fleet weathered Guadaloupe, and gained ſuch a diſtance, that the body of their fleet could only be deſcried from the maſt-heads of the Britiſh centre, and all hopes of Sir George Rodney's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with them ſeemed to be at an end. In this critical ſituation, one of the French ſhips, which had ſuffered in the action, was perceived, about noon, to fall off conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from the reſt of the fleet to leeward. This produced ſignals from the Engliſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral for a general chaſe, which was ſo vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orous, that the Agamemnon, and ſome others of the headmoſt of the Engliſh line, were coming up ſo faſt with this ſhip that ſhe would aſſuredly have been cut off before evening, had not her ſignals and eminent danger induced de Graſſe to bear down with his whole fleet to her aſſiſtance. This movement put it out of the power of the French to avoid fighting. The purſuing Engliſh fell back into their ſtation, and a cloſe line was formed.—.The French alſo
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:025347_0179_0FCD00210DF33A60"/>prepared for battle with the greateſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the night paſſed in preparations on both ſides.</p>
               <p>About ſeven o'clock in the morning, of the 12th of April, the battle commenced, and was continued with unremitting fury until near the ſame hour in the evening. As the Engliſh came up, they ranged ſlowly along the French line, and cloſe under their lee. Being ſo near, every ſhot took effect, and the French ſhips being ſo full of men, the carnage in them was prodigious. The Formidable, Admiral Rodney's ſhip, fired near eighty broadſides, and it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the reſt were not idle. The French ſtood and returned this dreadful fire with the utmoſt firmneſs, each ſide fighting, as if the the honor and fate of their country were that day to be decided.</p>
               <p>Sir George Rodney in the Formidable, with his ſeconds the Namur and the Duke, and immediatly ſupported by the Canada, between twelve and one o'clock, bore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and with full ſail athwart the French line and ſucceſsfully broke through, about three ſhips ſhort of the centre, where Count de Graſſe commanded in the Ville de Paris of 110 guns. Being followed and ſupported by the remainder of his diviſion, and wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round cloſe about the enemy, he effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſeperated their line. This bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture proved deciſive. The battle laſted
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025347_0180_0FCD00236AE08448"/>till ſun-ſet, for the French fought with the greateſt bravery.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh fleet having now gained the wind of the French, their general confuſion was completed. Hood's diviſion had been long becalmed and kept out of action; but his head ſhips and part of his centre, as far at leaſt as the Barfleur, which he himſelf commanded, came up at this juncture, and contributed to render the victory more deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. The Caeſar, Glorieux, and Hector, ſoon ſtruck their colours but not till after they had made the moſt noble defence.</p>
               <p>Count de Graſſe was nobly ſupported even after the line was broken; and the Diadem, a French 74, went down by a ſingle broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in a generous exertion to ſave him. The Ville de Paris was almoſt reduced to a wreck, but de Graſſe ſtill held out. At length, Hood in the Barfleur approached him juſt at ſun-ſet, and poured in a moſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive fire. The Ville de Paris ſupported all theſe ſhocks for a quarter of an hour after, when ſhe ſtruck to Sir Samuel Hood. It was ſaid, that, at the time ſhe ſtruck, there were but three men left alive and unhurt on the upper deck, and that the Count was one of them.</p>
               <p>The Caeſar was unfortuna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly ſet on fire, and blew up in the night of the action. A lieutenant and fifty Engliſh ſeamen periſhed, with about 400 priſoners. The number of
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025347_0181_0FCD0024B82CE7B8"/>the French ſlain in this engagement, and that of the ninth, was computed at three thouſand and near double that number wounded. The ſmall ſuperiority of Britiſh ſhips in point of number, contributed nothing to the ſucceſs of the day, as more of Hood's diviſion than that difference amounted to, were prevented coming into action through the want of wind. The whole loſs of the Engliſh, in killed and wounded in the two actions, was ſtated only at 1050, of which 253 were killed on the ſpot.</p>
               <p>In the Ville de Paris were found thirty ſix cheſts of money, deſtined to pay the ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the troops in the deſigned attack on Jamaica. Sir Samuel Hood being ſent in purſuit of the ſcattered enemy, on the 19th he came up and took the Jaſon and Caton, of 64 guns each, and two frigates.</p>
               <p>Thus the French loſt eight ſhips of the line: ſix were in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, one had been ſunk, and the Caeſar blew up after her capture. The Engliſh having join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off Cape Tiberoon, and the French having no force to the windward. Sir George Rodney proceeded with the diſabled ſhips and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes to Jamaica, as well for their repair, as the greater ſecurity of the Iſland, ſhould the combined fleet ſtill venture upon the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their former deſign. Sir Samuel Hood was left with about 25 ſhips of the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025347_0182_0FCD00263B806FE8"/>line to keep the ſea, and watch the motions of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to North America, where all parties ſeemed to be heartily tired of the war. On the 5th of May, Sir Guy Carleton arrived at New York, and on the 7th he wrote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o Gen. Waſhington, and ſent him ſome public papers, that his excellency might learn from them, the diſpoſition that prevailed in the government and people of Great Britain, relative to the making of a peace with America.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh adminiſtration having reſolved upon abandoning all offenſive operations in America, the ſcheme of evacuating all the weakeſt poſts in the United States was adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Accordingly, on the 11th of July Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah was evacuated, and the Americans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took poſſeſſion of it, the works and town being left perfect.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of December, Gen. Leſlie, who commanded at Charleſton completed the embarkation of his troops on his quitting that town. Gen. Wayne, with the legion and light infantry, had been before their works for ſeveral days, by order of Gen. Greene. It was hinted to him from Gen. Leſlie, through a certain medium, that if they were permitted to embark without interruption, every care ſhould be taken for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the town. Wayne was directed to accede to the propoſal, the Britiſh alſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:025347_0184_0FCD002A1C9E56F8"/>not to fire on the town after getting on board. The conditions being fully underſtood by both parties, Charleſtown was evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and poſſeſſed without the leaſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the American advance following cloſe on the Britiſh rear. The governor was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into his capital the ſame day; the civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il police eſtabliſhed the day following, and on the third the town was opened for buſineſs. On the 17th the Britiſh croſſed the bar, and went to ſea.</p>
               <p>Every thing now ſeemed to announce the approach of peace. The American commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners expedited the negociation with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſſiduity, and on the 30th of November, proviſional articles were agreed upon and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to take effect whenever terms of peace ſhould be finally ſettled with the court of France. The buſineſs was finiſhed ſo privately and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly that the miniſters and embaſſadors, as well as others in and about the court of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, were ſurpriſed upon hearing the news.</p>
               <p>We muſt not here avoid mentioning an unfortunate event, which happened at the cloſe of the ſtill more unfortunate American war. Ten men of war, including Count de Graſſe's ſhips, with a large fleet of merchant. men from Jamaica ſuffered exceedingly by a tremendous gale of wind off Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on the 17th of September. The Ville de Paris and the Glorieux foundered, and only one man out of the complement of both
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:025347_0185_0FCD002B7AD3D080"/>ſhips eſcaped to tell the melancholy tale. The Hector alſo ſunk; but being deſcried in time by a ſnow that made towards them, the crew were ſaved. The Ramilies went down, but her people were ſaved by the merchantmen in company. The Centaur was likewiſe loſt, and all her company, except twelve, with the captain, who got into the only remaining boat. They traverſed a ſpace of near 800 miles on the Atlantic ocean, without compaſs or quadrant, and with a blanket for a ſail. They had only two biſcuits divided among them every twenty-four hours; and as much water during that ſpace to every man, as the neck of a wine bottle broken off would hold. At the expiration of ſixteen days when the laſt diviſion of biſcuit and water had been made, to their inexpreſſible joy, they diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the Portugueſe iſland of Fayal, where they ſafely arrived at night, and received every aſſiſtance their melancholy ſituation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of September, 1783, the defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive treaties between Great Britain, France, and Spain, were ſigned at Verſailles by the Duke of Mancheſter, and the plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries of ſaid court. On the ſame day, the definitive treaty with Great Britain and the United States of America was alſo ſigned at Paris, by David Hartley, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Britiſh plenipotentiary, and the plenipotentiaries of the ſaid ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:025347_0186_0FCD002D14CF4928"/>
By the articles of this treaty, his Britannic majeſty acknowledged the independence of the United States of New Hampſhire, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts Bay, Rhode iſland and Providence Plantations, Connecticut.. New York, New Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. He alſo relinquiſhed all claims to the government of them, and conſented to treat with them as a free and independent people: Their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries were alſo ſettled, and they were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberty of fiſhing and drying fiſh as uſual on the banks of Newfoundland.</p>
               <p>The particulars of the treaty between Great Britain, France, and Spain will be found in our Hiſtory of England, to which it more properly belongs.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the unhappy American war, which added to the national debt of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-country one hundred and twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, beſides the loſs of many thouſands of our braveſt officers, ſoldiers, and ſeamen, to the eternal infamy and diſgrace of thoſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, who adviſed and carried it on, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the general voice of the people!</p>
