            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Our SAVIOUR was told by ſome of His Diſciples, That there were ſome <hi>Gentiles</hi> deſirous of a private Admiſſion unto Him. Upon this Occaſion our SAVIOUR foreſees the ſpeedy Approach of the Hour, when he ſhould be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified among the Gentiles;</hi> and ſee a <hi>ſurrogate Iſrael.</hi> But at the ſame Time, He declares the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected way, in which He muſt arrive to this <hi>Glorification;</hi> the ſtrange and black <hi>Preliminary</hi> that muſt lead unto it. It muſt be, by <hi>Death;</hi> even by <hi>Death;</hi> As a Grain of <hi>Corn</hi> muſt lie for <hi>Dead</hi> in the Earth, before it fructifies. Our SAVIOUR having foretold what was to be <hi>His</hi> own Condition, He foretels, what muſt alſo be the Condition of <hi>them</hi> that will <hi>ſerve</hi> Him; He forewarns them to expect a Conformity to Him, in <hi>Sufferings,</hi> preparatory to the Beſſedneſs wherein He will have them to be aſſociated with Him. <hi>Hard Lines! Dark Strokes!</hi> No Man <hi>ſerve</hi> our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or hope to be <hi>with Him,</hi> unleſs he be willing to <hi>Die</hi> like Him, to <hi>Die</hi> for Him! <hi>Fleſh and Blood; What wilt thou ſay to This!</hi>—To fortify His Followers, our SAVIOUR now tells them, what will be the Conſequence, and what will be done for them. This particularly, That His <hi>Father</hi> will put wonderful <hi>Honours</hi> upon them. And this is the DOCTRINE which is now to animate us in the ways of our GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wonderful, wonderful, will be the Honours, which the True Servants of our SAVIOUR, will find His Eternal FATHER to beſtow upon them.</hi>

CHRIST is He whom they <hi>live</hi> upon. A CHRIST is the <hi>Fountain of Life</hi> unto them all.</p>
            <p>But we muſt' be more particular.</p>
            <p>Now, Firſt; You may be ſure, The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR muſt be ſuch as <hi>Believe</hi> on Him. 'Tis the Term for a <hi>Believer,</hi> 1 Cor.

The very firſt Thing in becoming a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> of our SAVIOUR is, to ſee and ſay, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Thou art no leſs than the CHRIST, the Son of the Living GOD; and all the Bleſſings of Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs and Sanctifying and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption are to be expected from thee alone; And for all theſe I come unto thee, as unto my only SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR: With a periſhing and a diſtreſſed Soul, I come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will go on to ſay, Secondly; The <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are ſuch as attend upon Him, for all that muſt bring them to <hi>live unto God.</hi> Our SAVIOUR has no <hi>Servants,</hi> but thoſe <hi>Regenerate</hi> ones, who have a <hi>new Biaſs</hi> upon their Minds, diſpoſing them to <hi>live</hi> not unto <hi>Themſelves</hi> but unto GOD; and find that in GOD, which they have heretofore, ſought in <hi>Idols.</hi> Now the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, have their Eyes unto <hi>Him,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> may do all that is needful for their <hi>living</hi> unto GOD. Their Addreſs to Him is that; Pſal. CXXIII. 2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, As the Eyes of Servants look to the Hand of their Maſters, ſo our Eyes are upon the Lord our God, until that He have mercy on us.</hi> That we may <hi>live</hi> unto GOD it is required, that we be <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> unto Him, and that the Sentence of <hi>Death,</hi> which His violated Law has paſſed upon us,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002666_0006_0FE5F9FB12943DA8"/>may be taken off. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR look to Him for this; and thus hope in Him; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Let thy SACRIFICE be the Expiation of my Sin, and my Reconciliation to GOD, whom I have offended by my Sin.</hi> That we may <hi>live</hi> unto GOD, it is requiſite, that we be <hi>directed</hi> from above. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR look to Him for this <hi>Direction,</hi> and ſo call on Him, <hi>O Lord, ſhew me thy Ways, teach me thy Paths.</hi> That we may <hi>live</hi> unto GOD, it is requiſite, that we be <hi>aſſiſted</hi> from above. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR look to Him for this <hi>Aſſiſtance;</hi> and ſo <hi>lean</hi> on Him, <hi>I can do all things thro' CHRIST who ſtrengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are ſuch as make it their Study to yield an univerſal and perpetual <hi>Obedience</hi> unto Him. Our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR demands it of all that would <hi>ſerve</hi> Him; Matth. XI. 29. <hi>Take my Yoke upon you.</hi> The <hi>Golden Yoke</hi> which our SAVIOUR will have all that <hi>ſerve</hi> Him, to take upon them, is that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> the Sum whereof is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart,</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Our SAVIOUR having delivered us from the <hi>Curſe,</hi> to which the <hi>Law</hi> condemns us for our Breaches of it, now requires us to make this <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Life,</hi> and endeavour the moſt exact <hi>Obedience</hi> to it, and Condemn, and Humble and Abaſe our ſelves, when we fall ſhort of Exactneſs in our <hi>Obedience.</hi> This endeavour after the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708"/>conſummate <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> is to be our Expreſſion of our <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to our SAVIOUR, for His Redeeming us from the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and Reſcuing us into a <hi>better Covenant.</hi> The <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> are now the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of our SAVIOUR; and by becoming His, we <hi>Eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Accordingly, if we would approve our ſelves the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, we muſt ſincerely intend and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, a full <hi>Obedience</hi> to all of <hi>His Commandments.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, labour to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Duty,</hi> which He demands from them; and they ſay, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> They labour to <hi>do</hi> all that they <hi>know</hi> to be their <hi>Duty;</hi> and they ſay, <hi>Lord, I count all thy Precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way.</hi> They lament it as their Miſery, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they Sin againſt the <hi>Law of CHRIST.</hi> They can ſay, <hi>His Commandments are not grievous.</hi> But it is their <hi>Grief,</hi> that His <hi>Commandments</hi> are no better obeyed with them. In the whole <hi>Courſe</hi> of their <hi>Life,</hi> they aim at <hi>Obedience</hi> unto their SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR. Yea, in all the <hi>Work</hi> of their <hi>Life,</hi> this is their Aim. Even the <hi>Work</hi> of their <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Calling, the <hi>Work</hi> of their <hi>Secular</hi> Buſineſs, is done upon this Intention; <hi>'Tis the Work which my SAVIOUR has aſſigned unto me!</hi> Their SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR is <hi>obey'd,</hi> in the moſt <hi>common Actions,</hi> which their <hi>Hand finds to do. Obedience</hi> to Him, is the <hi>Life of their Hand,</hi> in the doing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002666_0007_0FE5FB4065017708"/>
Fourthly. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are ſuch as chuſe it, and make it, their <hi>Main Concern,</hi> to bear <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> unto His <hi>Truths,</hi> &amp; His <hi>Ways,</hi> and therein to <hi>Glorify</hi> Him. We have the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, ſo ſpoken of, and ſpoken to; Iſa. XLIII. 10. <hi>Ye are my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſaith the Lord, and my Servants whom I have choſen.</hi> The Thing whereto theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the Lord are called, is that which is called, <hi>A confeſſing of our SAVIOUR,</hi> and, <hi>A ſhewing forth of His Praiſes.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, have their Souls enamoured on this Employment, this rare Employment, this high Employment; and they moſt heartily ſay upon it, <hi>This is all my Salvation, and all my Deſire.</hi> They would in all poſſible Methods <hi>Teſtify,</hi> That their SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR is the <hi>Lord of Glory;</hi> That His <hi>Truths</hi> are <hi>Faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation;</hi> That His <hi>Ways</hi> are <hi>pleaſant</hi> ones, and <hi>all His Paths are Peace.</hi> Yea, they would fill their <hi>Lives</hi> with ſuch <hi>Teſtimonies.</hi> And they would make it the <hi>chief End</hi> of their <hi>Life</hi> to bear ſuch <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> The Breathings of their very Souls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, are, <hi>O that I may cauſe the Name of my dear SAVIOUR, to be honourably thought of!</hi> To this End, their Souls do exceedingly breath after this; <hi>O that I may evermore ſet my Seal, unto all the Truths which my SAVIOUR has betruſted and enriched His Church withal.</hi> Their Souls do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently breathe after this; <hi>O that I may ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more give and ſhow my Approbation of the Ways which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158"/>my SAVIOUR has preſcribed as Holy and Juſt and Good.</hi> They would <hi>Live,</hi> yea, they would alſo <hi>Die</hi> for the bearing of ſuch <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> to the Cauſe of our SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are ſuch as make a free, a full, an everlaſting <hi>Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of themſelves and their All, unto Him. Concerning the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, there has been this Account given; 2 Cor. VIII. 5. <hi>They have given themſelves unto the Lord.</hi> Ask them, <hi>Whoſe are you?</hi> Every one of them will reply with all the Alacrity imaginable, <hi>I am the Lord's!</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, do in the moſt <hi>Voluntary</hi> manner, conſent and reſolve to be His, and make a <hi>Dedication</hi> of themſelves unto Him, for all that <hi>Service,</hi> which it may pleaſe Him to uſe them in. Coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD, they then ſign <hi>Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of their SAVIOUR. Upon this, they become deſirous, to be entirely the Lord's, and have their <hi>All</hi> uſed in what <hi>Service</hi> He will have it put unto; and they comply with that Call; <hi>Ye are bought with a Price; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Glorify GOD in your Bodie, and in your Spirit, which belong to GOD.</hi> Yea, not only for the Application of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and of their <hi>Spirits,</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi> of their SAVIOUR, but in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> alſo unto it, they become, <hi>A People of Free-will offerings.</hi> As their Voice is, <hi>CHRIST is my All,</hi> ſo their Voice is, <hi>CHRIST ſhall have my All.</hi> But will they ever grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002666_0008_0FE5FB41F789E158"/>of the <hi>Service?</hi> No; They all ſay, <hi>I love my Maſter, and I will not go out from him;</hi> ſo they have their <hi>Ears bored</hi> for a <hi>Service,</hi> which is all <hi>Delight</hi> unto them; All, a <hi>Delight in GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly. the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR are ſuch as appear in His <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and for the Defence of His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in the World. It was of old cried out; Exod. XXXII. 26. <hi>Who is on the Lords ſide?</hi> And it is a Diſtinction to be made, in every Generation. Upon this, the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, <hi>gather themſelves</hi> unto Him; and <hi>ſay unto their Father, and unto their Mother, I have not ſeen them; neither do they acknowledge their Brethren, nor know their own Children.</hi> The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of PIETY, is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of our SAVIOUR; ſo far as PIETY prevails, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our SAVIOUR advances, &amp; flouriſhes. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR will ſtill appear in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of PIETY Our SAVIOUR has His <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> in the World. The <hi>Enemies</hi> of PIETY are the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our SAVIOUR. They make Hoſtile Invaſions on His <hi>Kingdom;</hi> which lies in <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR will ſtill appear againſt theſe <hi>Enemies.</hi> They are <hi>Souldiers</hi> for Him; Liſted under His <hi>Banners;</hi> having His <hi>Marh</hi> on their Foreheads. They will openly aſſert His Intereſt, and oppoſe the Adverſaries thereof, and venture ther All in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo: <hi>Not love their Lives unto the Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR are ſuch as have <hi>no Will</hi> of their own; ſuch as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70"/>are entirely governed by the <hi>Will</hi> of their SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; entirely at His Diſpoſe. This is what <hi>Servants</hi> muſt come to! This is the Language always heard from the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR; Act. XXI. 14. <hi>The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are willing to Do, all thoſe things, whereof it may be ſaid, <hi>This is the Will of God in CHRIST Jeſus concerning you.</hi> The Things may be <hi>Hard Sayings,</hi> and their <hi>carnal Mind</hi> riſe up in Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Things, and they feel a rebellious <hi>Will</hi> ſtirring in themſelves; yet they conform to the <hi>Will</hi> of their SAVIOUR, and mortify and extinguiſh their own. Yea, If it be the <hi>Will</hi> of their SAVIOUR, that they ſhould <hi>ſuffer</hi> uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Things, here they yield a profound Submiſſion to His <hi>Will.</hi> They have learn'd <hi>in whatever ſtate they are, to be content,</hi> with the <hi>Will</hi> of their SAVIOUR; <hi>content</hi> with what <hi>ſtate</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> of their SAVIOUR ſhall order for them. They <hi>Sacrifice</hi> All to the Will of their SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR; All their Enjoyments are bound unto the <hi>Horns of the Altar,</hi> ſtanding ready to be <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</hi> They ſtill ſay, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, Not my Will, but thy Will be done!</hi> And this compliance with the <hi>Will</hi> of their SAVIOUR, is very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſpicuous, in their ſubmitting to <hi>Death,</hi> in the <hi>Time</hi> and in the <hi>Way,</hi> which our SAVIOUR ſhall appoint, when He will have no further <hi>Service</hi> from them. When the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR have that Order from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002666_0009_0FE5FB438D504B70"/>Him, <hi>Go up, and die!</hi>— 'tis without much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy complied withal: They ſay, <hi>O Thou Lord of my Life, if I have no more to do for thee, I am willing to die, and with a Love ſtrong as Death, go thro' the dark valley of the ſhadow of Death, to come unto thee!</hi> Theſe, theſe are the <hi>Servants</hi> of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Oh! That you would Examine your ſelves; <hi>Am I one of theſe? How far do I anſwer this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter?</hi> This I will ſay; <hi>Behold,</hi> Are ye the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord,</hi> O you who this Day <hi>ſtand in the Houſe of the Lord?</hi> Then, <hi>Bleſs the Lord.</hi> For, <hi>The Lord who made Heaven and Earth</hi> will <hi>bleſs you out of Zion,</hi> and bring you into <hi>Zion,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> proper for you, ſhall be denied unto you.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But this is what is in the ſecond place to be ſet before you; even the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of thoſe who come up to this <hi>Character.</hi> Wonderful, wonderful the <hi>Honours,</hi> which the true <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR ſhall receive of His Eternal FATHER. <hi>My Father will honour them,</hi> ſaith our SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>But let us Enquire, <hi>What are the HONOURS, which GOD will beſtow upon the Servants of our SAVIOUR?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, We might ſuperſede all further An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, with ſuch a general one as that; 1 Cor. II. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath entred into the Heart of Man, the things which GOD
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0"/>hath prepared for them that love Him.</hi> The <hi>Honours</hi> prepared for them that <hi>ſerve</hi> our SAVIOUR; O unutterable <hi>Honours!</hi> O inconceivable <hi>Honours!</hi> O Things <hi>far beyond all that we can ask or think!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will make one prefatory Remark on the <hi>Honours,</hi> which GOD will beſtow upon the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR; They will be ſuch <hi>Honours,</hi> and ſo beſtow'd, that the Glorious GOD Himſelf ſhall be <hi>honoured</hi> in them. There is a Difference between thoſe two; Joh. XII. 43. <hi>The praiſe of Men,</hi> and, <hi>The praiſe of GOD.</hi> The moſt of Men, if they <hi>honour</hi> us, and admire us, and applaud us, they terminate in the <hi>Creature;</hi> they look no further than <hi>us;</hi> GOD has not His Praiſes on the Occaſion; GOD, without whom, and before whom, we are <hi>Nothing,</hi> is not <hi>Remembred.</hi> All comes to <hi>Nothing,</hi> in <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances</hi> of none but <hi>Aſhes!</hi> A <hi>ſacrilegious Idolatry</hi> is committed. A true <hi>Servant</hi> of our SAVIOUR, even deprecates it as an <hi>Infelicity,</hi> to be made the Object in this <hi>Idolatry.</hi> He had rather be left <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidered,</hi> in the World. Yea, when he meets with <hi>Indignities</hi> from an ungodly Generation, it ſweetens them unto him, to think, <hi>I am deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Danger of being made an Idol among the Robbers of GOD.</hi> Yea, Oh! why ſhould we not preſs after the high Flight of <hi>Nierembergius,</hi> who writes at this rate; <hi>Lord, I had rather, could it be without Sin, that all ſhould</hi> hate me, <hi>than that they ſhould</hi> love me for my ſelf. <hi>If all the World hate
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002666_0010_0FE5FB451E44BFB0"/>me, I ſhould have but what is Mine. If they ſhould love me for my ſelf, they would uſurp what is Thine.</hi> This I will ſay, A true <hi>Servant</hi> of CHRIST will be lothe to receive any <hi>Honours,</hi> of which he cannot ſee, that GOD and His CHRIST is <hi>honoured</hi> in them. Such Diſpoſitions may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided as fanciful &amp; whimſical <hi>Extaſies,</hi> But, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> do thou preſs after them, and reſt not until thou arrive to more Perfection in them!</p>
            <p>But, the <hi>Honours</hi> to be beſtow'd on the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are ſuch as <hi>come</hi> from GOD. Surely then, they will alſo <hi>lead</hi> to GOD. GOD will have His <hi>Honours</hi> wondrouſly ſecured, expreſſed, obſerved in them. In ſhort therefore; The <hi>Honours</hi> will be <hi>Bleſſings</hi> wherein the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD unto the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR will be manifeſted. The Glorious GOD ſays unto the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, as in Rev. III. 9. <hi>I will make them to know, that I have loved thee.</hi> The <hi>Honours</hi> to be beſtow'd on them, will be in the <hi>Tokens</hi> of His <hi>Love,</hi> which a Gracious GOD will comfort them, and enrich them, and adorn them withal.</p>
            <p>But let the <hi>matter extend</hi> into a little more of Particularity. We ſhall be told, <hi>what ſhall be done to the Man,</hi> whom the FATHER of our SAVIOUR <hi>delights to Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; O ye <hi>Servants</hi> of an incomparable SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR; I am ſure, you count it the greateſt of <hi>Honours,</hi> to be the <hi>Servants</hi> of ſuch a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR. No <hi>Dignity,</hi> No <hi>Preferment,</hi> on Earth, to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002666_0011_0FE5FB46AFDAAFC8"/>be compared unto this! Will the Glorious GOD accept you to <hi>ſerve</hi> the <hi>King</hi> whom He hath placed on His Throne; and employ you in the <hi>Service</hi> of Him, that is the <hi>King of Kings</hi> and the <hi>Lord of all?</hi> I am ſure, you will ſay, <hi>This is Honour enough! My Ambition cannot ſoar higher than ſuch an Honour as this!</hi> How can you judge otherwiſe, when you call to mind, who are your <hi>Fellow-ſervants?</hi> I will not mention ſuch <hi>Worms of the Duſt,</hi> as the Roman Emperours, who have ſubſcribed themſelves, <hi>The Vaſſals of the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST.</hi> They ſhall vaniſh before the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> whom I am going to ſpeak of. The Bright <hi>Angels</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> all count it their <hi>Honour,</hi> to be the <hi>Servants</hi> of our JESUS on the Throne of GOD, and with Triumphs in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your <hi>Fellow-ſervants.</hi> The leaſt of thoſe <hi>Mighty Ones,</hi> is greater than the greateſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> on our little Globe; And of theſe <hi>Mighty Ones</hi> how many <hi>Myriads</hi> are there, to whom you make thoſe Acclamations in your <hi>ſerving</hi> of your SAVIOUR! Pſal. CIII. 20, 21. <hi>O ye His Angels, vaſt in ſtrength, Bleſs ye th' ETERNAL God; who do His Word, that ſo the Voice of His Word may be heard. O Bleſs ye the ETERNAL God, All ye His Marſhall'd Hoſts; Ye Miniſters who Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute His Will made known to you!</hi> Oh! How <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi> the Men, who have <hi>Angels</hi> for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions! Ye <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, Ye are <hi>come,</hi> Oh! how welcom!— to the <hi>Myriads of Angels,</hi> that fly about the <hi>City of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002666_0011_0FE5FB46AFDAAFC8"/>
Pertinently upon this, will come in a ſecond Satisfaction; While you are the <hi>Servants</hi> of your SAVIOUR, the <hi>Angels</hi> of your SAVIOUR will be your <hi>Guardians.</hi> You no ſooner come into the <hi>Service</hi> of your SAVIOUR, but, <hi>Lo, The Morning Stars do ſing together, and the Sons of God ſhout for Joy.</hi> They are glad of your coming be be ſo aſſociated with them; and they gladly come into a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> for you. To all the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, there belongs that Priviledge; Pſal. XCI. 11. <hi>He ſhall give His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge over thee.</hi> O Tranſcendent <hi>Honour!</hi> The meaneſt among the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, has this <hi>Honour;</hi> An <hi>Angel</hi> of GOD at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him, and befriends him; does unknown good Offices for him. <hi>This Honour have all the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this ben't enough, take a Third Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The FATHER of our SAVIOUR beſtows this <hi>Honour</hi> on them that <hi>ſerve</hi> Him; He will be their <hi>Father</hi> too. The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, are all of them, the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD. <hi>Ye are my Sons and my Daughters, faith the Lord Almighty!</hi> And now, <hi>ſeemeth it a light thing unto you,</hi> to be the <hi>Children</hi> of that Infinite GOD who is the <hi>moſt high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth! Children,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>Heirs</hi> of an Infinite GOD, and therefore ſhall <hi>inherit all things!</hi> O ye <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, Fall into that agreeable Rapture; 1 Joh. III. 1. <hi>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father has beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0"/>be called the Children of God!</hi> Will GOD the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER put <hi>Honour</hi> upon them that <hi>ſerve</hi> our SAVIOUR? GOD the SPIRIT will do ſo too; and this <hi>Honour</hi> does alſo proceed from the FATHER.</p>
            <p>Behold, a Fourth Satisfaction! The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, are all of them, the <hi>Temples</hi> of the Holy SPIRIT. Unto ſuch it is ſaid, 1 Cor. III. 16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of GOD, and the Spirit of GOD dwelleth in you?</hi> Oh! What an <hi>Honour</hi> have you now a proſpect of! This <hi>Honour, Know ye not,</hi> that that if you are the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, you are the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of GOD? His Holy SPIRIT will ſay, <hi>Here will I dwell, for I have deſired it!</hi> The Holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT will make you the <hi>Excellent in the Earth;</hi> more <hi>Excellent</hi> than the moſt Illuſtrious Temples of a <hi>Solomon</hi> or a <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> The <hi>Houſes of His Glory,</hi> and glorified in being <hi>filled</hi> with His <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Articles of <hi>Honour</hi> will keep growing on our Hands. Let this go for a Fifth of them. A precious <hi>Eſteem</hi> with the <hi>Beſt of Men,</hi> is an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which they that <hi>ſerve</hi> the Beſt of Lords, are no ſtrangers to. A <hi>Good Name</hi> does belong to them; A <hi>Good Name,</hi> which is <hi>better than precious Ointment;</hi> A <hi>Good Name,</hi> which is <hi>rather to be choſen than great Riches.</hi> He was not in the wrong, who gave this Definition of <hi>Honour; 'Tis a good Eſteem with good Men for good Things.</hi> The <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, take the right Path to this <hi>Honour;</hi> and it may be ſaid of them, as
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002666_0012_0FE5FB484BCA47B0"/>in Heb. XI. 2. <hi>They obtain a good Report.</hi> It was by <hi>David</hi> thought an <hi>Honour; Let thoſe that fear thee, turn to me.</hi> It was by <hi>Paul</hi> thought an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; That my Service may be accepted of the Saints.</hi> This <hi>Honour</hi> is granted unto the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR; They are, as we read <hi>Mordecai</hi> was, <hi>Accepted of the Multitude of their Brethren.</hi> And, if they are Perſons of greater Eminency for their <hi>Diligence,</hi> their <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> their <hi>Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the more Eminent often does GOD make them in their Eſteem among His People. If thro' the Diſpleaſure of GOD againſt a People that muſt be denied the Benefit of their Talents; or if thro' <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> prevailing in thoſe who ſhould be wiſer, they may at any time <hi>want Acceptance;</hi> This will be no Real Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their true <hi>Honour,</hi> or a juſt Eſteem among thoſe who are moſt capable to put <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> upon <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> And therewithal, they have the <hi>Honour</hi> of having may <hi>Prayers</hi> made for them, among the People of GOD. Yea, They may come to have a <hi>Great Name,</hi> as well as a <hi>Good Name:</hi> It may be, A <hi>Name among the Great Men of the Earth,</hi> is granted unto them. And as they <hi>Live Deſired,</hi> ſo they <hi>Die Lamented.</hi> We read of one, <hi>All did him Honour at his Death.</hi> We read of another; <hi>They buried him honourably, becauſe he had done good in Iſrael.</hi> We read of a Third, <hi>They Lamented him,</hi> and continued long <hi>to ſpeak of him in their Lamentations.</hi> The <hi>Memory</hi> of theſe <hi>Juſt Ones,</hi> GOD makes it better than what has been
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002666_0013_0FE5FB49DF5ACB60"/>often called by flattering Survivers, <hi>A bleſſed Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Honoured</hi> are the <hi>

            </p>
            <p>I will ſay, Sixthly; The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, often have the <hi>Honour</hi> to be <hi>vilified</hi> by the <hi>vileſt of Men;</hi> and by thoſe who <hi>exalt</hi> none ſo much as the <hi>vileſt of Men.</hi> Enquire of your <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s and your <hi>Luthers</hi> and your <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi> and all great Reformers, if it be not ſo. There is a ſort of People, whoſe <hi>Ill Will,</hi> and <hi>Ill Word,</hi> is an <hi>Honour</hi> to thoſe whom it falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 'Tis a <hi>Diſgrace</hi> unto a Man, and it brings a Suſpicion upon his Innocency [<hi>Quid mali feci?</hi>] to be in the <hi>good Graces</hi> of ſuch <hi>evil Men.</hi> We read concerning ſome <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR; Act. V. 41. <hi>They rejoiced, that they were counted worthy of the Honour, to ſuffer Shame for His Name.</hi> The <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, ſhall have the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and <hi>Calumnies,</hi> and <hi>Obloquies,</hi> from thoſe wretched People, who have that Brand upon them, <hi>The Haters of GOD.</hi> And ſome <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR, who are <hi>in Labours more abundant,</hi> often have a notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of it, That when they have been upon ſome <hi>ſpecial Service</hi> of the Lord, the <hi>Devil</hi> (who has a moſt inveterate <hi>Hatred,</hi> where he ſees a CHRIST moſt <hi>Honoured,</hi> and ſtudied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled;

The Men of GOD, are but <hi>Honoured,</hi> in all the Venom, that <hi>Satan</hi> and his Inſtruments may ſpit upon them.</p>
            <p>All this while, I feel my ſelf ſtill in <hi>this World.</hi> The laſt Article is enough to render the proof of <hi>that</hi> very ſenſible! But then, laſtly, Let us get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, into the <hi>World to come. There, there,</hi> will be <hi>Honours</hi> indeed; Oh! what <hi>Honours!</hi>— be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the <hi>Servants</hi> of our SAVIOUR; Eternal <hi>Honours</hi> beſtowed by His Eternal FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER! The <hi>Honours</hi> wherein that Promiſe will be accompliſhed; Rev. II. 10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> O unfainting <hi>Servants</hi> of your SAVIOUR; Was there ever any <hi>Honour</hi> upon Earth, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto what you ſhall receive, when you ſhall at your <hi>Departure,</hi> find a kind Reception with your Almighty SAVIOUR, and being by His Angels, <hi>preſented Faultleſs before the preſence of His Glory with exceeding Joy,</hi> hear Him ſaying to you, <hi>Well done, good and faithful Servant; enter into thy Maſters Joy!</hi> But then, can you comprehend, what will be your <hi>Honours,</hi> when your SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR ſhall come, to be <hi>Glorified in His Saints, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002666_0014_0FE5FB4B6F836808"/>to be admired in all them that believe!</hi> What your <hi>Honours,</hi> when the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> ſhall arrive, wherein the <hi>Book of Remembrance will be opened,</hi> and all the <hi>Service</hi> you have done for your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR will be <hi>Remembred</hi> and <hi>Rewarded!</hi> What your <hi>Honours,</hi> when you ſhall be <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto GOD, and have <hi>Power over Nations</hi> given you! What your <hi>Honours,</hi> when you ſhall <hi>ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of your Father,</hi> and you ſhall be <hi>filled with all the fulneſs of GOD!</hi>— All Words are here ſwallowed up! O Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible <hi>Happineſs; O Honours,</hi> infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond every Thing here below! <hi>Honours,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Batoons,</hi> and <hi>Sceptres</hi> themſelves laid in the Ballance, are but <hi>Baubles,</hi> and Lighter than Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But methinks, There ſhould be made a brief Touch upon one Enquiry more; Who is the <hi>Fountain of theſe Honours?</hi> 'Tis the FATHER of our SAVIOUR. And why does our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR ſpeak of His FATHER, as concerned in the <hi>Honours</hi> beſtowed upon them that <hi>ſerve</hi> Him? Truly, The <hi>Love</hi> of the FATHER to our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, 'tis <hi>Infinite, Infinite!</hi> He has once and again proclaimed it, <hi>This is my beloved SON.</hi> He is called, Col. I. 13. <hi>The Son of His Love.</hi> Such, I tell you truly, ſuch is the <hi>Love</hi> of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty FATHER to the Perſon, who is the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of His Glory, and the expreſs Image of His Perſon,</hi> that He will infinitely <hi>plague them that hate Him.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002666_0014_0FE5FB4B6F836808"/>And when they that are Baptized into His Name, ſhall be in a <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> to Dethrone Him, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Him, Ungod Him, 'tis impoſſible to give a more <hi>Bitter Provocation</hi> to His Majeſty. Verily, It provokes a <hi>Wrath unto the uttermoſt. O our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Mother, we are Mourning, we are Trembling for thee!</hi>— On the other hand, What will He do for them whom His <hi>Love</hi> does <hi>conſtrain</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> Him? O become the <hi>Servants</hi> of your SAVIOUR; 'Tis to <hi>ſerve</hi> the SON of GOD, and a SON Infinitely <hi>Dear</hi> unto Him; Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more <hi>Dear</hi> than all other Beings. What a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence</hi> will His FATHER give to them that <hi>ſerve</hi> Him? To do <hi>Service</hi> for your SAVIOUR, is to put <hi>Honour</hi> on Him. <hi>Honour, Honour,</hi> ſhall be the <hi>Recompence.</hi> With <hi>Honour</hi> from His FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, ſhall it be <hi>Retaliated.</hi> If you will <hi>ſerve</hi> Him, you muſt undergo much <hi>Diſhonour</hi> among His Adverſaries: <hi>They ſhall ſay all manner of Evil againſt you falſly for my ſake,</hi> faith our SAVIOUR. An <hi>Honour</hi> from His FATHER will be your <hi>Compenſation.</hi> 'Tis what His <hi>Dear SON,</hi> has deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you; His <hi>Interceſſion</hi> has demanded it; <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, I will that they have Glory,</hi> ſays our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR. And, <hi>Him the FATHER heareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now comes the <hi>Concluſion of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what can this be any other, than an Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible Demand upon the whole Auditory? Oh! Become the true <hi>Servants</hi> of the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002666_0015_0FE5FB4D0822AFF8"/>CHRIST; Come Immediately into the <hi>Service</hi> of your SAVIOUR. Deſpiſe not, Refuſe not, the <hi>Honours,</hi> which the FATHER of your SAVIOUR has to beſtow upon them that <hi>ſerve</hi> Him. Don't beſpeak for your ſelves that <hi>Shame and Everlaſting Contempt,</hi> which is to be the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſal is now made; Joſh. XXIV. 15. <hi>Chuſe you this Day, whom you will ſerve.</hi> But, Oh! Make a <hi>wiſe Choice;</hi> A <hi>Choice</hi> which a <hi>Dying Man</hi> would abide by. As for the <hi>other Lords,</hi> which have <hi>had Dominion</hi> over you, Abhor their <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> Renounce their <hi>Service,</hi> Abandon their curſed <hi>Service.</hi> But, O Embrace the <hi>Service</hi> of your Lovely SAVIOUR; And <hi>Bind</hi> your ſelves unto it; <hi>Bind</hi> your ſelves as faſt as ever you can; and with the Firmeſt, but yet the Humbleſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. <hi>Bind</hi> your ſelves in thoſe Terms; Pſal. CXVI. 16. <hi>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having done this, Then contrive what you can, how to make your <hi>All Serviceable</hi> unto the Intereſts of your SAVIOUR. And often pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on that Noble Queſtion, <hi>What Service may I do for my Admirable SAVIOUR?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Engage, Embark in a <hi>Service,</hi> which never yet any one Repented of!</p>
            <p>But then, If ſuch as Theſe may be judged, [And moſt certainly, a <hi>Good Judgement</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them ſo!] <hi>The Words of the Wiſe,</hi> May they be <hi>as Goads,</hi> and come with a ſingular

               <hi>Pungency</hi> and <hi>Cogenoy</hi> unto the <hi>Candidates of the Miniſtry</hi> riſing as the <hi>Hopes of the Flocks</hi> among us!</p>
            <p>O you whoſe Friends have ſet you apart for the Service of your SAVIOUR in the Work of the Goſpel; Be perſwaded <hi>Betimes</hi> to <hi>Conſecrate</hi> your ſelves unto it; and come into this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>O my SAVIOUR, To ſerve Thee, ſhall be the Chief End, and the Grand Work of my Life!</hi> Come into this Diſpoſition; <hi>To be a Servant of a Glorious CHRIST, ſhall be the very Top of my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition!</hi> This Diſpoſition; <hi>If a Glorious CHRIST will pleaſe to accept of Service from me, This is the higheſt Advancement that I can be Ambitious of!</hi> Be continually full of <hi>Projections,</hi> what <hi>Service</hi> you can do for a Glorious LORD. If any Thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you a <hi>Service</hi> for that Glorious LORD, and for His Kingdom, wait not for any further <hi>Motive,</hi> to beſpeak your Induſtrious and Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous coming into it. Be armed againſt all the <hi>Diſcouragements,</hi> and all the <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and all the <hi>Temptations,</hi> which Fidelity in that <hi>Service</hi> will certainly expoſe you to. Th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> you are certain, That whenever you attempt any ſignal <hi>Service</hi> for your LORD, you ſhall preſently find ſome notable <hi>Humiliation</hi> ordered for you, yet with a true <hi>Spirit of Martyrdom</hi> go valiantly thorough all, that you have before you. [<hi>The Lord is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour!</hi>] Be arm'd in a View of the <hi>Honours,</hi> which the FATHER of your SAVIOUR will one Day bring you to! If

            </p>
            <p>If the Glorious <hi>GOD of your Life</hi> ſhall order it, that a <hi>Premature Death,</hi> ſhall prevent the <hi>Service</hi> you intend for Him, He will <hi>accept your willing Mind;</hi> and reſerve <hi>Inexpreſſible Opportunities</hi> for you in that Heavenly World, where tho' the <hi>Saints reſt from their Labours,</hi> yet we read, <hi>They reſt not</hi> from the Praiſes of the Lord. It is not a place or ſtate of <hi>Idleness;</hi> every one has his <hi>Work</hi> there aſſign'd unto him.</p>
            <p>A promiſing STEVENS, and HOLBROKE, and PIERPONT, and THOMPSON, and ſome others, may thus <hi>take the Wings of the Morning,</hi> and in the <hi>Morning</hi> of their <hi>Youth,</hi> take their Flight unto the Bliſsful Regions. But if <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>ſhort-liv'd Brethren</hi> might ſpeak from thence, they would certainly ſay unto us, <hi>O ſerve the Glorious LORD, and never count any Service too much to be done for Him. No Man ſhall be a Loſer by any Service he does for Him! 'Tis impoſſible for any one to make too early a Dedication of himſelf unto the Service of this Glorious LORD. All the Labours, and all the Sorrows, and all the ſad Things, which muſt be undergone in the Service, are abundantly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed in this Glorious World. One Hour here makes amends for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, we will greatly Lament the <hi>Loss</hi> therein ſuſtained by our Churches, and the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002666_0016_0FE5FB4E9C87F868"/>Dark <hi>Signs of the Times,</hi> in ſuch Eclipſes. Yea, we will <hi>ſpeak</hi> of them in our <hi>Lamentations.</hi> It would be a worſe than a <hi>Stoical Apathy</hi> to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe who have begun to do ſome <hi>Service</hi> for our Glorious LORD, and have been <hi>ſingularly Furniſhed</hi> for it, but might <hi>not be ſuffered to continue</hi> in it <hi>by reaſon of Death,</hi> I know not why a Modeſt <hi>Commemoration</hi> may not be allow'd unto Mr. THOMAS WALTER; Who had not paſſed <hi>Four times Seven</hi> Years of a <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> before a Period unto all Proſpect of any further <hi>Service</hi> from him here, is haſtened upon him.</p>
            <p>I am not without Apprehenſion, that it may be ſome ſmall <hi>Service</hi> unto the Beſt Intereſts, for me to take a brief Notice of ſomething that may render his Memory <hi>Valuable,</hi> and ſomething that may render it <hi>Profitable,</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>The former part of his Life,—I paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Silence:</hi> But ſomething that occurr'd in the <hi>Cloſe</hi> of it, may be not altogether unworthy of ſome Notice with us.</p>
            <p>After ſuch un Uncommon Symptom of <hi>Merit</hi> in him, as his being Ordained by his Venerable <hi>Grandfather,</hi> and Inſtalled a <hi>Collegue</hi> with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable <hi>Father,</hi> in the Paſtoral Care of a precious Flock, who for their Generous <hi>Love unto their Miniſters,</hi> have ſet an Example to all the Churches in the Country; he ſoon gave Demonſtrations of thoſe Rare <hi>Abilities,</hi> which <hi>exceedingly Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi>

            <p>But that which makes him deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred with the more <hi>Honour</hi> among us, is, That his Heart was fixed in his Purpoſes and Endeavours to employ all thoſe Bright <hi>Abilities</hi> in the <hi>Service</hi> of CHRIST and for the <hi>Churches of This Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a ſtrong Champion for thoſe <hi>Doctrines of Grace,</hi> in which <hi>thoſe Churches</hi> have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; And a great Reader of the Books which aſſert thoſe <hi>Doctrines;</hi> among which thoſe of a Judicious OWEN had a ſpecial Reliſh with him; ever <hi>Lamenting,</hi> ever <hi>Confuting,</hi> the Things which he ſaw <hi>tending to Corrupt</hi> the young Minds of thoſe that are under a Deſignation to <hi>feed the Flocks in the high Mountains of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I muſt add, That his faithful and ſteady Adherence to the <hi>Puritan</hi> Principles of <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> and— <hi>What ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>—was very conſiderable; when <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of, I know not what <hi>Glory,</hi> to deſert them, could not ſeduce him to an <hi>Infamous Apoſtaſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Miniſtry</hi> was notably calculated for THIS, above all Intentions; That a Glorious CHRIT may in the whole Syſtem and Buſineſs of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> be duly Acknowledged, and have a due Homage paid unto Him. And he preſſed this Advice upon ſome Candidates of the Miniſtry, with whom he was acquainted; <hi>Preach CHRIST, my Friend, Preach CHRIST, as
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002666_0017_0FE5FB5030A579D8"/>much as ever you can.</hi> And the FATHER of our Glorious LORD, has put this <hi>Honour</hi> upon Him, that many of His People have expreſſed an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinany Eſteem</hi> for him; And more than Two or Three of his <hi>Acute Compoſures</hi> have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. On the <hi>Laſt</hi> of theſe, I may make this Remark; That tho' it be compoſed with a great ſtrength of <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> and be embelliſhed with more than a little <hi>Erudition,</hi> yet he wrote with his own <hi>Hand,</hi> in a manner nothing of it: But Languiſhing under much <hi>Pain,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Weakness</hi> as kept him on his Bed continually, it was all written from his <hi>Mouth,</hi> by the Pen of a beloved Friend, unto whom he dictated. A Specimen <hi>This,</hi> of thoſe <hi>Intellectual Powers</hi> in him, which if he had lived, would have anon brought him into the Number of the famous <hi>Gualterus</hi>'s and <hi>Waltherus</hi>'s, that make a Figure in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of <hi>Literators.</hi> And yet, theſe <hi>Powers</hi> were always beautified and varniſhed with a conſpicuous <hi>Modeſty</hi> in him, which cauſed him to aſſume unto himſelf no more, than if he had been, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old, (in imitation of the Apoſtles Elegancy, in his <hi>Elachiſtoteros</hi>) elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called himſelf, <hi>Omnium Poſtremiſſimus.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0"/>of that <hi>Engliſh Diſeaſe,</hi> a <hi>Conſumption:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he over and over again went thorough that <hi>Process of Repentance,</hi> in which he made his juſt Reflections on all the Errors of a <hi>Vain Youth,</hi> which a <hi>diſadvantageouſly Good Temper</hi> might have betray'd him to: Often ſaying, <hi>I have been a wretched Fool; the greateſt Fool in the World!</hi> And he underwent the <hi>ſaving Work</hi> of the Holy SPIRIT in <hi>Repetitions</hi> of it; Firſt exceedingly <hi>Convincing</hi> and <hi>Abaſing</hi> of him; then ſhewing him the <hi>Remedy</hi> provided for him in a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, and helping him to make his Flight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and cauſing him thereupon to grow in his confirmed <hi>Reſolutions</hi> to live unto GOD.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Repetitions</hi> of theſe Operations, did not hinder it, but that on the Day before he died, he had a Soul wonderfully diſtreſſed with Fears of his Miſcarrying at the laſt: Saying, <hi>Oh! 'Tis a great Thing to Die!</hi>— Under theſe Diſtreſſes he importunately call'd for the Inſtructions and Aſſiſtances of <hi>One</hi> for whom he had ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; Who, in Conjunction with his <hi>Father,</hi> again ſet before him the <hi>Glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed GOD,</hi> which he had himſelf preached unto others. What paſſed ſhall not be now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; only one or two Paſſages it may not be amiſs to mention. When it was urged upon him; <q>You have been a notable <hi>Diſputant</hi> in your Time; what they call a <hi>Logician:</hi> you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood an <hi>Argument.</hi> I pray, what will you make of this <hi>Argument?</hi> The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is; <hi>Our
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002666_0018_0FE5FB51C65D45C0"/>Glorious LORD, the true Witness, who delivereth Souls, hath ſolemnly declared, HIM THAT COMES UNTO ME, I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.</hi> Your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is; <hi>But I come unto Him; and heartily and earneſtly Beg of Him, and would Hope in Him, to do for me and on me, every thing that He does to them that come unto Him.</hi> Now the <hi>Concluſion;— Therefore I fear that He will not Receive me, but caſt me off!</hi> Is this a Right <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion?</hi> Did you uſe to Argue ſo?</q> His Anſwer was, <hi>I find I have a Buſy Adverſary; And he would make this perverſe Concluſion for me!</hi>—</p>
            <p>His Father then came upon his <hi>Unbelief</hi> with ſuch victorious and overwhelming Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <q>My dear Son, Were our SAVIOUR viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly here, as once in the Days of His Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhould you go proſtrate your ſelf before Him, and beſeech of Him to have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on you, and give you an Heart to Love Him, can you imagine, that He would Reject you? Now, what a ſtrange thing is this <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief:</hi> to be diſcouraged from <hi>That</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries an infinite Encouragement in it! As if His <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> or our <hi>Access</hi> to Him were the leſs for His being on the Throne of His <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </q> This alſo removed not the Deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. But the Servants of GOD, (whereof there were more than <hi>Two or Three</hi>) in the Chamber, then joined in pouring out Supplications for him, That the <hi>Comforter</hi> who ſhould <hi>relieve his Soul,</hi> might not be <hi>far from</hi> him; and that he
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18"/>might be <hi>filled with Peace and Joy in Believing;</hi> and that he might <hi>finiſh well,</hi> and with ſuch Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over the <hi>Laſt Enemy,</hi> as might Revive thoſe who were now praying for him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the People of GOD.</p>
            <p>From <hi>This Hour</hi> (It was now Saturday-noon) <hi>Satisfactions</hi> and <hi>Conſolations</hi> continually grew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. He ſaid, when ſome of us parted with him, <hi>If I periſh, I will periſh in the Hands of my SAVIOUR: And, tho' He ſlay me, I will truſt in Him!</hi> His <hi>Fears</hi> were anon ſwallowed up in the <hi>Hopes,</hi> of a <hi>Glory</hi> now prepared for him: Yea, in the <hi>Joys</hi> of a <hi>Salvation</hi> which he had after a ſuitable Agony, gain'd the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of. He now longed for his <hi>Departure,</hi> to be <hi>with CHRIST.</hi> He kept ſaying, (as his admired <hi>Calvin</hi> before him) <hi>How long, Lord, How long? Oh! Come quickly!</hi> And, <hi>Why is His Chariot ſo long a coming; Why tarry the Wheels of His Chariot?</hi> But then, he asked, whether he <hi>did well,</hi> in <hi>longing</hi> ſo much to be gone?</p>
            <p>He ſaid, <hi>I ſhall be the moſt Glorious Inſtance of Sovereign Grace in all Heaven!</hi> And he added, <hi>I have no more to do here; but I ſhall Serve and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify CHRIST to all Eternity!</hi> And then, <hi>Lord, Now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He laid mighty Charges on ſome <hi>Young Perſons</hi> that were near him; <q>To fear GOD, and prize His CHRIST <hi>Betimes;</hi> and by no means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay <hi>Repentance</hi> one Day longer: For the longer they delay'd it, the more Backward they would
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002666_0019_0FE5FB5356D3BC18"/>find themſelves unto it. <hi>He ſaid;</hi> They might think, that for them to engage in the Ways of PIETY, would be to abandon all Joy and Pleaſure; but this is a great Miſtake: Let them try the Practice of it, and it will never be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Morning of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> [Jan. 10.] arrived, he expreſſed an Expectation, that He ſhould be <hi>That Day in Paradiſe.</hi> His Father told him, <q>I am going to the <hi>Houſe of GOD,</hi> which is the <hi>Gate of Heaven;</hi> but I hope, You are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Heaven it ſelf,</hi> to join with the <hi>Aſſembly Above.</hi>
               </q> He replied, O! <hi>I love that Glorious Church!</hi> His Father added, <q>I am going alſo to the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the Lord; but I hope, You are going to <hi>Drink of the Fruit of the Vine New</hi> with CHRIST in the <hi>Kingdom of his Father.</hi>
               </q> He replied, <hi>O! And without Price!</hi> At Noon, his Father going to the Afternoon Service, and ſuppoſing that he ſhould not (as he <hi>did not</hi>) ſee him any more, took his Farewel of him, in thoſe Words; <hi>My Child, The Lord JESUS receive thy Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Echo</hi> from him to it was,— <hi>And the Lord fit it for His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception!</hi> He continued in Heaven-ward Aſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till towards the cloſe of the Afternoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Service, when he fell a ſmiling: And one asking him the Reaſon of it, he only made an <hi>Unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi> Anſwer, which intimated as if an <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſort,</hi> in <hi>Singing</hi> the Praiſes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer now entertained him. So he expired; which I doubt not at all to expreſs in the Terms
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002666_0020_0FE5F9FA419F5FF0"/>I find in the Epitaph of a noted Perſon, <hi>Anima CHRISTI appetentiſſima, in CHRISTI Gremium evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made this brief Report, not without ſome View, that it may do ſomething of that <hi>Good,</hi> which if he had lived, <hi>he</hi> would have done more Abundantly, I ſhall now add no more but This; GOD will <hi>Honour</hi> the YOUNG MEN, whom the <hi>Service</hi> of His CHRIST ſhall be dear unto!</p>
