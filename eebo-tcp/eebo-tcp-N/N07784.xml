            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE the Study of <hi>Ethics</hi> makes ſo great a Part of an academical Education, and there are Profeſſors of that Science in moſt of the Univerſities in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> I have, for many Years paſt, been in Queſt of ſome Syſtem of that Kind, proper to be recited by the Students; but can find none well adapted to that Purpoſe. For though there are many Treatiſes which contain good Rules of external Conduct, yet the Obligation to act according to thoſe Rules, is not juſtly ſtated; and ſeveral inſufficient and falſe Foundations are laid down by Authors of conſiderable Note.</p>
            <p>It ſeems neceſſary that the Students ſhould firſt be well inſtructed in the true Nature of <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> and the Foundation of our <hi>Obligations</hi> to practiſe it, before they read the practical Rules which are formed thereupon.</p>
            <p>As this Treatiſe was deſigned, principally, for the Uſe of the Students of this College, I have, to ſave the Charge of Printing, wrote in as conciſe
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009931_0003_0F7B3B8656D26840"/>
a Manner, as can be intelligible, on ſuch a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and metaphyſical Subject. If any Expreſſions ſhould ſeem doubtful, I may be preſent to explain and enlarge upon them: And if this ſhould happen to fall into the Hands of any Gentleman at a Diſtance, who ſhould ſuppoſe that any Expreſſion is capable of ſuch a Conſtruction, as is not conſiſtent with Truth, I would aſk the Favour of an Opportunity to explain myſelf.</p>
            <p>In treating upon the divine Ideas, I have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally follow'd the Sentiments and Expreſſions in <hi>Norris's Ideal World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this Treatiſe contains only ſhort Hints or Heads to be paraphras'd upon, but few Copies are printed at preſent; propoſing that if God ſhould ſpare my Life, and give me ſome Relaxation from my preſent Multiplicity of Buſineſs, to publiſh a more full and complete Treatiſe upon this Subject, which I look upon to be of great Importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contains the moral Part of all <hi>true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which is the Foundation of the Whole: Tho' no fallen Creature can become <hi>truly virtuous,</hi> but in Conſequence of an Atonement, and the renovating Influences of the divine Spirit: And I ſuppoſe that Men generally form their Sentiments of the peculiar Doctrines of Chriſtianity, according to ſome few <hi>moral Principles,</hi> which they <hi>at firſt</hi> ſet out upon, relating to the Holineſs and Strictneſs of the divine Law, and the Nature of <hi>moral Obligation.</hi>

            <p n="1">§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Ethics or Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, makes a conſiderable Part of an academical Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and is nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with true Religion, it is of great Importance that it ſhould be <hi>clearly ſtated,</hi> and fixed upon the right <hi>Foundation.</hi> — Authors are generally agreed in the Rules of external Conduct, for the general Good of Communities and particular Perſons; but differ greatly in the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Obligation</hi> to obſerve thoſe Rules, and in the <hi>Criterion of moral Good and Evil.</hi> Moſt Authors have treated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ethics</hi> as a Syſtem of <hi>moral Rules</hi> of Conduct, ſummarily comprehended in the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and as the moral Part of practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But then the ſeparating of this from the Doctrines or Principles of Religion, upon which it is founded, has been the Occaſion of ſeveral
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009931_0005_0F7B3B89EAD1F1D0"/>
Miſtakes; and particularly this, that many have treated <hi>Ethics</hi> only as the Laws of Nature and Nations, or a Syſtem of <hi>civil Laws,</hi> generally obtaining among Mankind, and calculated prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to promote the temporal Good of public Communities and particular Perſons, in their enjoying the natural Pleaſures and Happineſs of the preſent Life. Others have, as it were, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blended both theſe together, and from thence have formed a Syſtem of what they call the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nature,</hi> whereby every Man may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Favour of God and eternal Happineſs, by his own Powers, without a Mediator or any divine Revelation. <hi>Ethics,</hi> in this View, have very much paved the Way to Deiſm; and therefore have been juſtly oppoſed by many good Men.<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Dr. C. MATHER (in his <hi>Introductio ad Miniſterium</hi>) calls it <hi>Impietas in Artis Formam redacta.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. And as Men have had very different Views of the ultimate End and Deſign of <hi>Ethics;</hi> ſo they have ſet out upon very different <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foundations,</hi> to build their ſeveral Syſtems upon: Some upon the Foundation of <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> and Happineſs; ſome upon univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and ſome upon <hi>moral Taſte;</hi> and others upon various other firſt Principles, which are either falſe, or but conſequential Appendages to the true Foundation. To rectify theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and to ſettle the Nature of <hi>moral Virtue and Obligation</hi> upon its juſt and true Foundation, is the Deſign of the preſent Eſſay.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009931_0006_0F7B3B8AA2B6BBE8"/>§ 3. And, therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the Nature and Standard of moral Virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Obligation, which every moral Agent is under, to be conformed to that Standard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Way whereby we may come to the Knowledge of that Standard, and of ſuch a Temper and Conduct as is a Conformity to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I ſhall exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider the Nature and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of moral Virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moral Virtue</hi> is a Conformity to the <hi>moral Perfections of God;</hi> or it is an Imitation of God, in the moral Perfections of his Nature, ſo far as they are imitable by his Creatures. And the moral Perfections of God are the <hi>ſole</hi> Foundation and Standard of all that Virtue, Goodneſs and Perfection which can exiſt in the Creature.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. For God is a being infinitely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect. He has all thoſe Perfections which are contained or implied in the Words <hi>good, right, excellent, amiable,</hi> and all other Words of the like Import—all thoſe Perfections which can poſſibly exiſt, or that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of by the moſt perfect Intelligent: For there can be no Limitation of Perfection in a neceſſary and <hi>ſelf-exiſtent</hi> Being.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. Indeed we get the Idea of a Perfection from thoſe ſmall Degrees of Perfection which we obſerve in the Creatures, and then we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all Perfections to God, in an infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009931_0007_0F7B3B8ACEAE4918"/>
and unite them all in the Idea of ONE ALL-PERFECT BEING.</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. So that, in the Order of our Conceptions, we conceive of a Perfection as exiſting in the Creature, <hi>before</hi> we conceive of it as exiſting in God, and generally (it may be) before we have any Idea of God at all. And therefore we are apt to conceive (or, at leaſt, to uſe ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as if we did conceive) ſome Perfections to have an independent Exiſtence <hi>out of</hi> God, and <hi>prior</hi> to him; and as if we would <hi>try</hi> him by that Standard, and approve of his Qualities according as we conceived them to be agreeable to it. But this is a great Miſtake: For all Perfection is originally in God, as the <hi>primary</hi> Foundation and Standard, and from that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is communicated to the Creatures, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous limited Degrees, according to their ſeveral Ranks and Orders.</p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. As his Being includes and comprehends all Perfection; ſo no Perfection can poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the Creature, or be conceived by him, but what firſt exiſted in the Creator: Neither can it have any innate Excellency or permanent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, but only ſo far as it reſembles Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God, and is dependent upon him. The Perfection of the Creature conſiſts in his <hi>Reſemblance</hi> or <hi>Conformity</hi> to God; but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God conſiſts in his being <hi>what he is,</hi> or like to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as the primary Standard; without any antecedent or concomitant Rule or Standard to meaſure himſelf by.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009931_0008_0F7B3B8B86B59720"/>§ 8. <hi>Self-Exiſtence</hi> or neceſſary Exiſtence, without any antecedent Cauſe or Foundation, is the firſt <hi>fundamental</hi> Perfection we conceive of in God; and from <hi>that</hi> all other Perfections neceſſarily <hi>reſult;</hi> ſuch as Eternity, Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Omnipreſence, Omniſcience, Omnipotence, Wiſdom, &amp;c. Indeed, all Perfection in God is, in ſome Reſpect, <hi>one;</hi> that is, all Perfection is, in him, <hi>one</hi> ſimple, uncompounded, uniform Thing: But our Minds are not capacious enough to form ſuch a comprehenſive, clear Idea; and therefore we muſt conceive of each particular Perfection, <hi>diſtinctly</hi> by itſelf, or our Ideas of them will be confuſed.</p>
            <p n="9">§ 9. We uſually conceive of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections under two general Heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural Perfections;</hi> ſuch as Eternity, Immutability, Omniſcience, Omnipotency, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moral Perfections;</hi> ſuch as Holineſs, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, Goodneſs and Truth; which are called the <hi>moral Rectitude</hi> of the divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural</hi> Perfections, ſuch as Knowledge, Power, &amp;c. may exiſt, in a great Degree, in a Being utterly deſtitute of <hi>moral</hi> Goodneſs or Holineſs; and be perverted to the worſt Ends and Purpoſes, as they are in the Devils. But <hi>moral</hi> Perfections, ſuch as Juſtice, Goodneſs, and Truth, have an <hi>immutable</hi> Excellency and Amiableneſs in them, and cannot be directly perverted, without deſtroying their very <hi>Nature.</hi> There is indeed a neceſſary Connection between the natural and moral Perfections of God; for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009931_0009_0F7B3B8C44CD08D0"/>
Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth preſuppoſe ſome Degree of Knowledge and Power by which they are exerciſed; and Knowledge and Power muſt be regulated by Juſtice and Goodneſs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they loſe the Excellency of their Nature, and are to be dreaded rather than loved.</p>
            <p n="10">§ 10. When God makes a <hi>Creature,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to him ſome Degree of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, though, being limited, they cannot exiſt in the ſame Form and Manner, but under different Circumſtances from what they are in the Creator. Theſe <hi>different</hi> Degrees of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, thus communicated, conſtitute the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ranks</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of the Creatures. To the Inanimates he communicates but little more than bare Exiſtence. On the Vegetables he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes a uniform Motion of the nutritive Parts, with a proper Coheſion. To Animals he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates an animal Motion and Life, with an Inſtinct to preſerve their Lives and continue their Species, in which they diſcover a Sagacity very nearly reſembling Reaſon. To <hi>Man</hi> he has communicated the ſuperior Powers of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and Underſtanding, whereby he is capable of forming ſome Ideas of the natural and moral Perfections of God and his Works; of compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ideas of Things, and of drawing juſt Inferences and Deductions.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To conſider the <hi>Obligation</hi> which every rational Creature and moral Agent is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be conformed to the <hi>moral Perfections of God.</hi> This <hi>Obligation</hi> ariſes,</p>
            <p n="1">I. And principally, from the <hi>infinite and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Perfection</hi> of the divine Nature: For as
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009931_0012_0F7B3B8EFB1657C0"/>
God is the moſt perfect Being, ſo the moſt <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State</hi> of any other Being, muſt conſiſt in being <hi>like to him.</hi> As he is the only <hi>ſelf-exiſtent</hi> Being, the original Standard of all Perfection, and all Creatures derive their ſeveral Degrees of Perfection from <hi>him,</hi> he muſt be the <hi>only Rule</hi> and Pattern for <hi>them;</hi> and their higheſt Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt conſiſt in being <hi>like to</hi> the original and <hi>all-perfect</hi> Standard. The <hi>greater</hi> Degree of divine Perfection any Creature enjoys, the <hi>more</hi> perfect he muſt be.</p>
            <p n="15">§ 15. Every Creature of God was originally made perfect, <hi>in his own Model</hi> or <hi>Degree;</hi> that is, its Degree of Perfection was uniform, ſo as to have no Part or Quality deficient, incongruous or repugnant to any other Part; or to have any two Diſpoſitions or Qualities, which, in their own Nature, or under any Circumſtances, could operate <hi>contrary</hi> to each other. The Perfection, therefore, of a rational Creature, muſt be to <hi>continue</hi> in that <hi>perfect</hi> State in which he was created: But to <hi>loſe</hi> any Part of it, or to acquire any <hi>contrary</hi> Diſpoſition or Quality, is a Defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the moſt <hi>perfect Pattern and Standard,</hi> and a Deſtruction of the Works of God. This, in Scripture is called ANOMIA, a Deviation from the perfect Law of <hi>moral Rectitude,</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>divine Nature.</hi> It is alſo called <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Depravity</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> and as it is the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of wrong Action, it is called <hi>Original Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">§ 16. And if a Creature has deviated from this Standard of Perfection, <hi>heretofore;</hi> that will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009931_0013_0F7B3B8F7511EC18"/>
not juſtify his Deviation from it, for the <hi>Time to come.</hi> For it will remain an eternal and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table TRUTH, reſulting from the Nature of God and the Relation of a rational Creature to him, that <hi>his</hi> Perfection conſiſts in a Conformity to the Perfection of <hi>God;</hi> and that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his former Tranſgreſſion or Defect has brought upon him a preſent Indiſpoſition, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs or <hi>Incapacity</hi> of ſuch a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity: For ſuch an Indiſpoſition or Incapacity is ſo far from being a Juſtification of his preſent State, or an Evidence of his being ſtill in a State of Perfection, that, on the contrary, it is yet a further Deviation from the moſt perfect Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard; for a rational Creature's Indiſpoſition or Incapacity of being like to God, renders him the more unlike to him.</p>
            <p n="17">§ 17. Indeed all the Works of God, as they come from him, are perfect; and every Part of them congruous and conſiſtent with each other; ſo that whenever he makes a <hi>moral Agent,</hi> he endues him with a perfect Diſpoſition and full <hi>Powers</hi> to do his Duty, and be <hi>perfect,</hi> as ſuch a Creature: But if he afterwards, by any Means, contracts a contrary Diſpoſition, or loſes his <hi>Power, that</hi> no ways alters the Nature of his <hi>Perfection,</hi> or the Nature of his <hi>Obligation.</hi> The Perfection of the Creature conſiſts in a Conformity to God, <hi>after</hi> he has indiſpoſed or incapacitated himſelf for it, as much as it did <hi>before.</hi> Notwithſtanſting all he can do, the ſame Truth will <hi>eternally</hi> remain, that <hi>his higheſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009931_0014_0F7B3B9000FA84D0"/>
Perfection conſiſts in a Conformity to God;</hi> and it is impoſſible that any Action of his ſhould <hi>annul</hi> or make it void.</p>
            <p n="18">§ 18. It is alſo inconſiſtent with the divine Perfections to ſuppoſe that God ſhould <hi>releaſe</hi> or <hi>diſcharge</hi> any moral Agent from his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a perfect Conformity to the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; or that he ſhould <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> any other Thing in the Room of it, as that he ſhould only do his <hi>Endeavour,</hi> or <hi>as well as he can,</hi> or the like. For in every Thing wherein he falls ſhort of a <hi>perfect Conformity</hi> to God, in the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mind, or Courſe of his Actions (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in which he is placed among the Creatures) it is his <hi>moral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> ANOMIA or Sin. And God's Favour and Approbation is neceſſarily extended to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to the Degree of their Likeneſs and Conformity to him.</p>
            <p n="19">§ 19. Every rational Creature and moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent is <hi>obliged</hi> to be perfect and conformed to God, in the higheſt and ſtrongeſt Senſe in which that Word <hi>Obligation,</hi> is ever uſed. And all thoſe Obligations which ariſe from Self-Intereſt, Hope, Fear, Gratitude, &amp;c. are but <hi>low and faint,</hi> in Compariſon of this. Yea, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is frequently ſaid (by way of Analogy) to be <hi>obliged</hi> to act according to his own Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But this Obligation, in a more <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>primary Senſe,</hi> is ſaid to be incumbent upon his Creatures.</p>
            <p n="20">§ 20. II. This Obligation ariſes, in a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009931_0015_0F7B3B91ABBA5DD0"/>
Senſe, from the <hi>declared Will or Law of God:</hi> That is, as the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what the <hi>divine Perfections</hi> are; and what Temper and Conduct in <hi>us,</hi> is a Conformity to them: For this we could not certainly know, unleſs it was declared to us by the divine <hi>Law;</hi> which is therefore the <hi>more immediate Rule</hi> of our Conduct. Indeed if it could be ſuppoſed that two or more Actions, under ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, were <hi>equally,</hi> agreeable to all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, then, by his abſolute <hi>ſovereign</hi> Authority, he might enjoin either of them, by a particular poſitive Law.</p>
            <p n="21">§ 21. III. This Obligation is increaſed by that <hi>ſovereign Power and Authority</hi> which God has over us, as he is our Creator and we his Creatures. For as our Exiſtence depends upon his <hi>meer</hi> Good-Will and Pleaſure, we ought to exiſt in ſuch a <hi>Manner</hi> and for ſuch <hi>Purpoſes</hi> as are <hi>agreeable</hi> to him, and no other. And he being our ſovereign Lord and Proprietor, it is direct <hi>Injuſtice</hi> to uſe or diſpoſe of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> contrary to his <hi>Will:</hi> And therefore a Compliance with the <hi>Will</hi> of our Proprietor, is but a Conformity to his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> which is one of his divine Perfections.</p>
            <p n="22">§ 22. So that all <hi>moral Virtue and Obligation,</hi> in whatever Light we view it, is to be reſolved into a <hi>Conformity to the divine Perfections;</hi> and all the real Goodneſs and Excellency we can have, and all the Obligation we can be under, is to be <hi>like to God.</hi> The Good or Happineſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009931_0016_0F7B3B926811FEE0"/>
which reſults to <hi>us,</hi> from a Conformity to the divine Perfections, or the Fear of Puniſhment if we neglect it, do not properly <hi>make</hi> or <hi>create</hi> any Obligation; though they may be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Motives and Incentives to act <hi>according</hi> to the Obligations we were <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently</hi> under.</p>
            <p n="23">§ 23. But this Principle, that <hi>the moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God are the ſole Foundation and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of moral Virtue and Obligation;</hi> has been denied by many celebrated Authors: and ſeveral other Foundations have been ſubſtituted in the Room of it: ſuch as, Self-Intereſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—univerſal Benevolence—moral Taſte and Senſe — Conformity to Reaſon — to the moral Fitneſs of Things—acting according to Truth, and the like. But all theſe are either imperfect Deſcriptions of, or Conſequences from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfections of God, or elſe they have no juſt Foundation at all. I ſhall particularly examine each of them.</p>
            <p n="24">§ 24. I. Some aſſert that a Principle of <hi>Self-Love, Self-Intereſt,</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> is the only <hi>Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation,</hi> and of all Religion. That the <hi>only</hi> Motive to Acts of Juſtice and Kindneſs towards our Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is that they may in their Turns do the ſame to us. That the <hi>only</hi> Motive and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Obedience to the Laws of God, is to procure the divine Favour, to obtain Rewards
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009931_0017_0F7B3B930CC73998"/>
and avoid Puniſhments. That we are not bound to pay any <hi>Regard to God,</hi> but only ſo far as he is <hi>ſubſervient to us</hi> and our Happineſs. And that, whatever Men may pretend, there cannot <hi>poſſibly</hi> be any <hi>other</hi> Obligation, Motive or Spring of Action, in human Nature, but only <hi>Self-Love</hi> and a Regard to our <hi>own</hi> Intereſt and Happineſs.

            </p>
            <p n="25">§ 25. Now I concede that God has implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Principle of <hi>Self-Love</hi> and Self-Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all Animals: and that all Brutes and the greater Part of Mankind are in <hi>fact</hi> govern'd by that <hi>alone.</hi> And it is an Inſtance of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in his providential Government of the World, that, ſince the greater Part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in this fallen State, are deſtitute of any higher or better Principle, he has implanted <hi>this,</hi> which keeps the World in ſome good Order and Regulation. Men are generally agreed, that <hi>Lying, Stealing, Robbery, Piracy,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>bad;</hi> and they ſeem generally to hate them; not from a Senſe of the real MORAL EVIL of theſe Things in <hi>themſelves,</hi> or their Contrariety to the holy <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of God; but as being contrary to the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of the Community, and of <hi>ourſelves.</hi> And therefore whenever we hear that any ſuch Acts are done, every one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately has this Reflection, "It may be <hi>my</hi> Turn to be robbed next, and I wiſh the Actor was puniſhed, in order to prevent it." I alſo ſuppoſe that a meer <hi>natural Man,</hi> in no Degree illuminated by the Divine Spirit, cannot in any <hi>human Way,</hi> be convinced of any <hi>moral Evil</hi> in Sin, but only by the natural ill Conſequences
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009931_0019_0F7B3B948537A9B0"/>
which attend it. Since therefore this Principle of Self-Love is implanted by God, and anſwers many good Ends, it is not to be eradicated; but regulated by, and made ſubſervient to a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which is infinitely higher and better, viz. a Conformity to the moral Perfections of God; which is the <hi>Standard</hi> of the higheſt Perfection of human Nature.</p>
            <p n="26">§ 26.

            <p n="28">§ 28.

If we conceive of Juſtice and Truth only as <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to Goodneſs, then the Juſtice of God's <hi>Right of Dominion</hi> over us, conſiſts <hi>only</hi> in its Advantage to us: and the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of any Puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God, conſiſts <hi>only</hi> in this, that it is for the <hi>Good</hi> of the Creatures; and there is no Evil in God's declaring a <hi>Falſhood,</hi> but only as it may bring <hi>Miſery</hi> upon the Creatures. Which Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions evidently confound our <hi>clear</hi> Ideas of the divine Perfections, and all Morality.</p>

            <p n="36">§ 36. Another more plauſible Standard of <hi>moral Virtue</hi> and <hi>Obligation,</hi> is <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Many Authors talk much of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as if it was an <hi>infallible</hi> Guide; but do not ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>different Senſes</hi> in which that Word is uſed; ſometimes to denote the rational <hi>Objects</hi> perceived, and ſometimes the <hi>perceiving Power</hi> of the Mind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Objective Reaſon</hi> ſignifies the OBJECTS perceived by our Minds; ſuch as God, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Ideas and Works, as participating of ſome Degree of his Perfections; together with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009931_0029_0F7B3B9CCD69C6E0"/>
all the various Modes and Relations of theſe Things one to another. All <hi>juſt</hi> Conceptions and <hi>true Propoſitions</hi> concerning any of theſe Things, are called <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the Object. As if I lay down theſe Propoſitions, that <hi>Every ſelf-exiſtent Being is eternal and immutable.</hi> That <hi>God is to be worſhiped and obeyed by his Creatures.</hi> Moſt Men will ſay that theſe Propoſitions are REASON, or agreable to <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Now <hi>Reaſon,</hi> taken in this Senſe, according to Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> or God's Conceptions of his own Perfections, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or as they are exhibited in his Works; and may, in ſome Reſpect, be ſaid to be <hi>God himſelf,</hi> as conceived of by himſelf. And ſo far as the Divine Ideas are, in any Way or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree communicated to <hi>us,</hi> and are the Objects of <hi>our</hi> Conception; <hi>our Reaſon</hi> ſeems to be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation from and Part of the infinite <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, <hi>repleniſhing</hi> and <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating</hi> our Minds. Reaſon, in this Senſe, is an <hi>infallible Guide,</hi> and comes near to the Standard I have before laid down. But I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this is not the Meaning of thoſe Authors who ſet up the <hi>Oracles</hi> of human Reaſon, Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to divine Revelation.</p>
            <p n="37">§ 37 (2) <hi>Subjective Reaſon</hi> has <hi>Man</hi> for the <hi>Subject,</hi> and ſignifies a <hi>Power in the human Mind,</hi> whereby a Man is able, in ſome Meaſure, to conceive of the Objects before mentioned, and to draw neceſſary Inferences and Deductions from them, both of a ſpeculative and practical Nature.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009931_0030_0F7B3B9DADC2A920"/>
Now Reaſon, conſidered as a <hi>Power</hi> or Faculty in Man, though it is a very great and noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment, vaſtly ſuperior to the <hi>brutal Inſtinct,</hi> yet it is ſubject to many <hi>Imperfections</hi> and Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itations, and, in this fallen State, to many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions and pernicious Errors. And this ariſes partly from wrong Conceptions of the Objects, and partly from wrong Deductions from our own Conceptions. For in order to reaſon right, we muſt have not only juſt and <hi>clear Conceptions</hi> of the Objects reaſoned upon (at leaſt ſo far as as we pretend to reaſon upon them) but clear Perceptions of the <hi>Relation</hi> of our own Ideas, in order to draw juſt Inferences and Deductions from them.</p>
            <p n="38">§ 38. Reaſon if tolerably well capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Principles of <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> and the neceſſary Means of promoting the Happineſs of Mankind in their private and political Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. From hence proceeded the juſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Inſtitutes of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> among the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> which were ſo well calculated to promote their publick Peace and natural Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Yet even in theſe Things, Reaſon is but an imperfect Guide; for in ſome Countries many evident <hi>Vices, plainly</hi> detrimental to the natural Happineſs of Mankind, were <hi>allowed</hi> by the <hi>publick</hi> Laws. But then Reaſon goes but a very <hi>little</hi> Way in determining the Principles of human Actions, conſidered as <hi>moral, religious,</hi> or <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, or relative to the future Happineſs; unleſs a Man reaſons upon the <hi>Data</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009931_0031_0F7B3B9E52E28C88"/>
of divine Revelation. Indeed Revelation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Man to be a <hi>rational Creature,</hi> capable of underſtanding the Propoſitions deſigned to be communicated to him, of <hi>comparing</hi> one with another, and of forming a <hi>conſiſtent Scheme</hi> of the whole. But then there muſt be ſome <hi>Data</hi> or <hi>firſt</hi> moral Principles given by God himſelf, for human Reaſon to act and build upon, or otherwiſe he has no <hi>ſure</hi> Foundation for any juſt Inferences and Deductions. Thus if a Man ſets out upon this Principle, that his <hi>own</hi> Happineſs is the ſole and ultimate End of <hi>his</hi> Creation; or that a Conformity to his own Senſe and Taſte of Things, is the <hi>only</hi> Thing neceſſary to procure the divine Favour and eternal Happineſs, how juſtly ſoever he may reaſon upon theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet if they prove to be falſe, the whole Superſtructure will <hi>fail</hi> him.</p>
            <p n="39">§ 39. Beſides, Reaſon conſidered as a meer <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Faculty</hi> in Man, cannot poſſibly be the Criterion of Virtue, or the <hi>original</hi> Standard to which human Actions <hi>ought</hi> to be conformed; ſince it is only a <hi>Power in us</hi> to <hi>find out</hi> and know what that Standard is, and the <hi>Meaſure</hi> by which we try the Conformity of our own Actions to that Standard; as a Scale or Pole is the Meaſure by which we determine the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of an Edifice to the Plan laid by the Architect. Reaſon therefore, conſidered as a Power in <hi>us,</hi> ſuppoſes a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Standard by which our Actions are to be <hi>tried;</hi> which is the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009931_0032_0F7B3B9F0B35A4E8"/>
moral Perfections or Law of God, to which our Actions ought to be conformed.</p>
            <p n="40">§ 40. Furthermore; Reaſon, conſidered as a meer human Power or Qualification can never have ſuch a tranſcendent Excellency and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to be the Criterion of the divine Favour, Approbation and eternal Felicity, or claim ſuch a <hi>ſupreme Authority</hi> and Empire, as to be the Foundation of all moral Obligation; for this would make Man, or one of his own Faculties to be his ſupreme Law-giver and Governor. And it is plainly contrary to the cleareſt Dictates of Reaſon we are Maſters of, to deny this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Dignity and Authority to the infinite <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God,</hi> and yet to give it to ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, limited and imperfect Thing as <hi>human Reaſon,</hi> I ſay not this to depreciate or <hi>decry</hi> human Reaſon, but to allow its juſt Excellency and Dignity, without making of it to interfere with the eternal, immutable, and abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>all-perfect God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">§ 41. Beſides, human Reaſon, without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Data or Principles to proceed upon, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under Prepoſſeſſions and wrong Inclinations, is very <hi>various</hi> in its Dictates; ſo that what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be reaſonable to <hi>one</hi> Perſon or Nation, appears to be utterly unreaſonable to <hi>another;</hi> and that even in ſome of the plaineſt Inſtances of Virtue and Vice, which one would think might be better regulated even by the Principles of Self-Intereſt and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="42">§ 42. Laſtly, Reaſon is of ſuch a <hi>general</hi>

Nature, as that it cannot be the ſpecial Criterion of moral Virtue and Obligation; for if ſo, then every Thought, Word or Action in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Law, Mechanicks or Agriculture, which is agreable to Reaſon, would be a moral Virtue; which I think no Man ever yet aſſerted. There muſt therefore be ſome Criterion or Rule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine moral Virtue and Obligation, which is more particular and preciſe than the general Idea of human Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="43">§ 43. Some confound Reaſon with <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and ſay that God has implanted in every Man a natural Conſcience, whereby he is able, with his own Reaſon, to know what is right and wrong, and the Will of God, and to act accordingly. Now, <q>Conſcience is the Judgment which a Man forms concerning his own Actions, as agreable or diſagreable to the Law and Will of God:</q> and this ultimately reſolves the Rule into the <hi>divine Law;</hi> and as the divine Law reſults from the divine Nature and Perfections, this Rule is ſo far right, and the ſame which I have before laid down. But then Reaſon is not the Law it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but only the Means to find out the Law. And Conſcience is not the Law itſelf, but only his Judgment upon the Law; which Judgment is ſometimes right and ſometimes wrong: which plainly ſuppoſes an antecedent <hi>ſuperior Standard.</hi>

Therefore, to lay it down, as a <hi>firſt</hi> Principle, that we are obliged to keep to hiſtorical Truth, is to lay that down as a <hi>firſt</hi> Principle, which needs a <hi>preceding</hi> one to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. And therefore it is ultimately to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into this fundamental Principle, that we are <hi>obliged</hi> to be conformed to the eternal and immutable <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God. Without this, a Conformity to the Truth of <hi>Facts</hi> or <hi>hiſtorical Truth,</hi> can only be a <hi>natural Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi> at moſt; but has Nothing in it of the Nature of <hi>moral Virtue</hi> or Obligation.</p>
            <p n="48">§ 48. VII. Another ſuppoſed Standard of moral Virtue and Obligation, is <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong.</hi> That whatſoever is morally <hi>right,</hi> is a moral Virtue; and whatſoever is morally <hi>wrong,</hi> is a Vice. That the higheſt Obligation of every moral Agent (whether God or Man) is to be conformed to that which is <hi>right,</hi> and to abſtain from that which is <hi>wrong.</hi> That every Man naturally has in his own Mind the Idea of Right, and by this, as the ultimate Standard, he judges
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009931_0039_0F7B3BA5CC747230"/>
of all Beings and Actions, beyond which there is a <hi>ne plus ultra.</hi> To which I reply,</p>
            <p n="49">§ 49. (1.) That the Idea of <hi>Right</hi> plainly contains theſe three diſtinct Ideas;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Idea of a <hi>Rule</hi> or Standard, to which any Action or Thing ought to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in order to its being denominated <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Idea of the Thing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Standard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Idea of the Relation of theſe two Objects, that the latter is conformed to the former.</p>
            <p>If the Mind ſees a <hi>Conformity</hi> of the Action or Thing to its Standard, then it judges it to be <hi>right;</hi> and if it ſees a Non-conformity, then it judges it to be <hi>wrong.</hi> Therefore the Idea of Right, cannot be the Idea of the Standard itſelf, but is an Idea <hi>ſubſequent to</hi> and conſequent upon it; and plainly preſuppoſes a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Standard to which the Thing ought to be <hi>conformed</hi> in order to its being denominated <hi>right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="50">§ 50. (2.) This Principle ſets up a Thing which is <hi>not</hi> God, to be a Standard for <hi>God;</hi> a Rule to <hi>try</hi> him by, and to which he ought to be conformed. Which is to ſuppoſe a Being or Thing antecedent to the <hi>firſt,</hi> and higher than the higheſt; which is manifeſtly abſurd. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by obſerving various Inſtances of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Things to their Standard, a Man may get a general <hi>abſtract</hi> Idea of <hi>Right,</hi> before he has the Idea of God; but then, if he traces back his own Ideas to the <hi>firſt</hi> Source, he
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009931_0040_0F7B3BA6F2AACF58"/>
muſt recur to one eternal and <hi>ſelf-exiſtent</hi> Being who is the Original and Foundation of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and <hi>Standard</hi> of all that is right—Here he comes to a <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> and not before. And to ſet up any Thing which is not God, as being <hi>eternal,</hi> immutable and independent, is to ſet up <hi>another</hi> God, with ſome of his eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and as a Standard <hi>ſuperior</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="51">§ 51. (3.) The general, abſtract Idea of <hi>Right,</hi> being a Conformity of a Thing to its <hi>Standard,</hi> there will be as <hi>many and various</hi> Ideas of Right, as there are <hi>Standards</hi> of Conformity. Thus a <hi>right Line</hi> is made by a ſtrait Rule or Scale. A Traveller takes the <hi>right Way,</hi> when he takes that which will bring him <hi>quickeſt</hi> or <hi>eaſieſt</hi> to the Place deſigned: that being the <hi>Standard of Right</hi> in his Mind. A natural Man, when he does that which he conceives to be moſt for his <hi>own Intereſt</hi> and Happineſs (which is his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End) does what he conceives to be <hi>right:</hi> and a Man acting under the Direction of divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> makes a Conformity to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature and Perfections to be his Rule and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of <hi>Right.</hi> And every Man conceives that to be <hi>wrong,</hi> which is a Non-conformity to the Standard he fixes upon, let it be <hi>what it will.</hi> But if it could be ſuppoſed that a Man has <hi>no Standard</hi> of Right in his own Mind, then the Idea of <hi>Right</hi> itſelf immediately vaniſhes; for there can be no <hi>relative</hi> Ideas where there is no Conception of the Subjects from whence thoſe Relations reſult. Indeed, if by Right is meant
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009931_0041_0F7B3BA762D4C368"/>
the divine Perfections, eſpecially God's Juſtice and Truth, or a Conformity to them, as the original Standard; this is the ſame Criterion I have before laid down. But if by Right is meant any <hi>Entity</hi> or Relation <hi>neceſſarily</hi> exiſting <hi>out of</hi> God, not derived <hi>from</hi> him or dependent <hi>upon</hi> him, and to which <hi>he</hi> is obliged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as the Standard of <hi>his</hi> Perfection; ſuch a Conception is a <hi>meer Imagination,</hi> and is, in Effect, a ſetting up of <hi>another</hi> God not only <hi>beſides</hi> him, but <hi>above</hi> him; which is ſo far from being the Foundation of <hi>true</hi> Religion and Morality, that it ſeems to be a Kind of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="52">§ 52. VIII. The laſt ſuppoſed Foundation of moral Virtue and Obligation, which I ſhall mention, is <hi>Obedience to the Will and Commands</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> with this <hi>ultimate View,</hi> to obtain his Favour and Rewards, and thereby to <hi>promote my own Happineſs.</hi> This is the ſame Principle I mentioned before; but only Obedience to God is here propoſed as a <hi>ſubordinate Means</hi> to promote Self-Intereſt, <hi>as an ultimate End.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Nature of an <hi>ultimate</hi> End is not at all altered or made better, by the Goodneſs of the ſubordinate <hi>Means</hi> propoſed in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Although I am never ſo careful to do that which is agreable to the divine Law, yet, upon this Principle, I regard God only as he is <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to me; for if I obey him upon no other Motive but only <hi>the expected Wages,</hi> I view him only as a Servant to me.

            <p n="1">1. The divine Perfections are the <hi>primary,</hi> the <hi>ultimate</hi> and <hi>ſole</hi> Foundation and Standard of all moral Virtue and Obligation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law or Will of God is the <hi>next</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Rule to us, as it declares what theſe Perfections are; and what Temper and Conduct in us, is a Conformity to them.

that is meant by <hi>moral Senſe, Taſte</hi> or <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> it may be conceded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The greater Part of Mankind are, in <hi>Fact,</hi> governed by a meer natural Principle of <hi>Self-Love;</hi> and a Regard to the <hi>public</hi> Good, ſo far as they <hi>conceive</hi> their <hi>own</hi> Intereſt and Happineſs to be involved in it.

            <p n="56">§ 56. Having ſhewn that the <hi>moral Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of God are the <hi>ſole</hi> Criterion and Standard of all <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> in the Creature; and the Inſufficiency of all <hi>other</hi> Foundations; I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſhew, That divine Revelation, is the <hi>only</hi> Way and Means whereby we can <hi>know</hi> what the Perfections of God are, and what <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> and <hi>Conduct in us,</hi> are a Conformity to theſe Perfections. I ſuppoſe that the Angels and glorified Saints in Heaven, by their own Reaſon, could not ſo perfectly find out the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of God, but that there is a Neceſſity of ſome particular <hi>Revelations</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: And that <hi>Adam,</hi> in a State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, could not, by his own <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> know what Uſe he might make of all the Trees in the Garden: and therefore God told him, <hi>that of every Tree of the Garden he might freely eat;</hi> but of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he might not eat, nor ſo much as touch it.</hi>

It is certain that Man, in his <hi>fallen</hi> and <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened</hi> State, ſtands in Need of divine Revelation to inſtruct him in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> of God, to teach him his <hi>Duty,</hi> and how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Reſtoration</hi> to the divine Favour.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:009931_0059_0F7B3BB7C1ED5110"/>
               <hi>Laſt Place,</hi> exhibit a brief and general Scheme of moral Virtues and Duties;</p>
            <p n="1">I. To God. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>love</hi> him. Love is a pleaſing Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of any Object; or ſuch an Approbation of an Object, as is accompanied with Pleaſure. And this ariſes both from the <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> of the Object in itſelf; and from a <hi>ſimilar</hi> Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mind; whereby a Perſon is diſpoſed to approve of, to be pleaſed with, and delighted in ſuch an Object. And as God is the moſt perfect, amiable and excellent Being, we ought to love him with all our Hearts and Souls; and other Beings only ſo far as they bear a Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to him, or for his Sake.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>fear</hi> him. A Principle of Aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God neceſſarily produces a <hi>Fear</hi> of doing any Thing which may gain his <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> or Diſapprobation; for this neceſſarily implies ſome Contrariety or Diſſimilitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>truſt</hi> in him and depend upon him, in the Way of our Duty. This neceſſarily flows from a realizing View of the divine Perfections; eſpecially Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To <hi>worſhip</hi> him. An <hi>internal</hi> Senſe and Approbation of the divine Perfections, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exert and expreſs itſelf in <hi>external</hi> Words and Actions; which alſo have a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſtrengthen and increaſe the Senſe and Habit of our own Minds, and to produce the ſame Diſpoſition in the Minds of others.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:009931_0060_0F7B3BB9D65D99E8"/>5. To <hi>repent</hi> of Sin. A Mind which is, in the main, conformed to the moral Perfections of God, will neceſſarily be diſpleaſed with and hate every Thing which is contrary thereunto; which will always be accompanied with a Grief and Sorrow; eſpecially as the Fault is within himſelf.</p>
            <p>From this ſame Principle, all other Duties to God may, by the Aſſiſtance of divine Revelation, be eaſily deduced.</p>
            <p n="68">§ 68. II. Thoſe Duties which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſpect our <hi>Neighbours</hi> or Mankind in general. The ſame divine Principle will diſpoſe us to view <hi>all Mankind</hi> as the Creatures of God, originally made in his Image (and ſtill retaining ſome Diſpoſitions which may in ſome Reſpects be called good) as Fellow-Subjects to the ſame King, as Fellow-Servants of the ſame Lord; and treat them according to the Rules of Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We ſhould <hi>love</hi> them. That is we ſhould approve of and take Delight in what is good in them; as it bears a Reſemblance to ſome of the divine Perfections. We ought indeed to <hi>hate</hi> their bad Diſpoſitions and Actions, but not their Perſons: eſpecially ſince we don't know, but that they may yet be the Objects of God's eternal Favour: We ought, at leaſt, to love them with a <hi>Love of Benevolence:</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to promote their temporal and eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; ſo far as is conſiſtent with other Duties.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009931_0061_0F7B3BBA95F5A888"/>
And that from a Principle of Obedience to God who has commanded us <hi>to love our Neighbour as ourſelves</hi> and <hi>to do good to all Men.</hi> And for this Reaſon, becauſe to do ſo, is to be <hi>like to God</hi> and the Children of our Father which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought to conduct towards them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Juſtice.</hi> We ſhould never invade the Right and Property of another: but freely permit him to uſe and enjoy whatſoever is his <hi>own.</hi> And that becauſe we hereby act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature and Will of the ſupreme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of all Things; who has commanded us to <hi>render to every one his Due—to owe no Man any Thing; and not to defraud or go beyond our Neighbour in any Matter.</hi> And that becauſe <hi>the righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs;</hi> and that <hi>to do Juſtice is more acceptable than Sacrifice;</hi> and that <hi>diverſe Weights and diverſe Meaſures are an Abomination to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>punitive</hi> Juſtice, or rendering to every Man that Miſery or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which is his due; ſo far as any Man is, by the Word or Providence of God, made his Miniſter <hi>to execute Wrath on him that doeth Evil,</hi> he is bound to do it according to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of God, and thoſe ſubordinate Rules which are given him to judge by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ought to obſerve <hi>Truth</hi> in all our Words and Declarations: ſo as never deſignedly to <hi>deceive</hi> our Neighbour. For Truth is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Perfection of God and cannot be infringed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009931_0062_0F7B3BBAD110F138"/>
upon by us, without a practical Denial that God is true. Deut. xxxii. 4. <hi>He has ſtiled himſelf the God of Truth;</hi> has commanded us to <hi>ſpeak the Truth.</hi> Epheſ. iv. 25. And has declared that he <hi>hates a lying Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Every Man ought to perform the Duties incumbent upon him as a <hi>Member of Society,</hi> or as reſulting from the various Relations he ſtands in to others. From divine Inſtitutions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Compacts, various Relations ariſe, ſuch as, Huſband and Wife, Parents and Children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Subjects, Fellow-Citizens, or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of leſſer Communities having an equal Right with ourſelves; from which many <hi>Duties</hi> do reſult, according to the Rules of Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth; of which many Authors have treated largely and well: all which are to be obſerved in Conformity to the divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Law. Render therefore to every one their Due. Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Tribute to whom Tribute,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatſoever Things ye would that others ſhould do unto you, do ye the ſame to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="69">§ 69. III. Thoſe Duties which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate to <hi>ourſelves.</hi> From the ſame Principle of Juſtice and Goodneſs, every Man, conſidering himſelf as <hi>one</hi> of the Creatures of <hi>God;</hi> ought to endeavour to promote <hi>his own</hi> Happineſs, as well as the Happineſs of <hi>others;</hi> and therefore ought to cultivate and improve his rational Powers and moral Habits; to regulate
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009931_0063_0F7B3BBB94CFA6E8"/>
the Appetites and Inclinations of his Body, ſo as to render it the moſt proper Organ of his Soul: and in general to promote his own Perfection and Happineſs; ſo far as is conſiſtent with thoſe Duties which more immediately relate to God and his Fellow-Men; acting with a principal View of Conformity to the Perfections and Law of God; and with a ſubordinate and additional Stimulous or Incitement of acting according to natural Inclination and Self-Intereſt: as a Means appointed by God more fully and effectually to incite him to do that which was his <hi>antecedent</hi> Duty. But to act upon this laſt Motive <hi>alone,</hi> without any Regard to the <hi>former,</hi> is to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Principle very little ſuperior to the brutal Inſtinct.</p>
            <p n="70">§ 70. This is a <hi>ſhort and general Scheme</hi> of all the Duties incumbent upon Men, together with the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Obligation they are under to perform them. Upon theſe Principles a Man may ſafely and profitably read the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Syſtems of <hi>Ethics;</hi> which, though they are generally built upon wrong Foundations, yet the external Rules of Practice are generally <hi>right</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> For Self-Love, extended to a public View of Things (that is, the Intereſt which each Individual has in the publick Good) will, in moſt Inſtances, lead Men to the ſame Rules of external Conduct, as reſult from a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the divine Perfections. And ſince ſuch a Conformity does naturally produce our own Good and Happineſs, we may take the <hi>inverſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009931_0064_0F7B3BBC49B53EA8"/>
Method;</hi> and, by obſerving what is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to our <hi>own Good,</hi> may, in many Inſtances, find out what is agreable to the <hi>divine Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> tho' in a much more <hi>uncertain</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Manner.</p>
            <p n="71">§ 71. For in this <hi>inverſe</hi> Method of finding out our Duty, ſome Errors have crept into moſt Syſtems of <hi>Ethics;</hi> and one which I apprehend to be very groſs, viz. That, in many Caſes, <hi>it is lawful for Men to</hi> LYE; particularly to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are not of <hi>Years of Diſcretion;</hi> to thoſe who are <hi>ſick, mad,</hi> or <hi>non compos Mentis;</hi> to <hi>Enemies;</hi> and generally in all Caſes where a Man can ſave himſelf or his Friend from any unreaſonable Suffering. The Authors generally go upon this Principle, that the ſole Criterion of <hi>moral</hi> Good, is <hi>natural</hi> Good or Happineſs. That the Evil of Lying, in any Caſe, does not conſiſt in <hi>Contradiction to Truth;</hi> but in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> it does to others. Therefore it is <hi>lawful to lye</hi> in all Caſes where no <hi>Injury</hi> accrues to any particular Perſon; or, upon the Whole, more Good than Hurt. Some Authors (who think it is a little too <hi>bare-faced,</hi> or contrary to the common Senſe of Mankind, to aſſert, in expreſs Terms, that it is lawful to <hi>lye</hi>) ſay, that an <hi>Untruth</hi> or falſe Aſſertion, in ſuch Caſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>no Lye;</hi> or, if it is ſo called, yet it is <hi>no Crime.</hi> Mr. <hi>Grove,</hi> in his Ethics, Part II. Chap.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:009931_0065_0F7B3BBD018173C8"/>
XI. ſays this is now become pretty generally the Senſe of the learned World. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">See Grotius de Jure Pacis &amp; Belli, Liber III. Cap. 1. Puffendorf de Jure Naturae &amp; Gentium Obſervat. 250. In Eng. Book IV. Chap. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="72">§ 72. However conſiſtent this Opinion may be with the Principles of theſe Authors, or how generally ſoever it may be received, yet it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears to be contrary to the immutable <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Law of God.</hi> And I fully agree with the great Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> that <q>the Eſſence of a Lye conſiſts in the <hi>deſigned Falſhood aſſerted;</hi> and not barely in the <hi>Injury</hi> which attends it, tho' that is an Aggravation;</q> and that <q>
                  <hi>every Lye is a Sin,</hi> abominable to God. <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Ameſii Medulla Lib. II. Cap. 21. De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiae Caſibus, Lib. V. Cap. 53.</note>
               </q> Indeed it may be demonſtrated that this Principle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Self-Intereſt, taken in a large extenſive Senſe, as including the Intereſt which each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual has in the general Good of Mankind, for a long Courſe of Time. For this Opinion and Practice will neceſſarily deſtroy all Faith and Confidence among Men: and I <hi>never can believe</hi> a Man, in any Caſe where I can imagine that he can ſuppoſe it will be for his own or his Friend's immediate Intereſt to tell a Lye.</p>
            <p n="73">§ 73. But as every Man will run the Venture of his own Intereſt as he pleaſes; I think we can build upon no certain Foundation in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:009931_0066_0F7B3BBDC9D68248"/>
but the <hi>divine Perfections and Law.</hi> Truth is an <hi>eternal, immutable</hi> and <hi>inflexible</hi> Perfection of the divine Nature; and cannot be limited, even in our Conceptions, by any other Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as the Exerciſe of the divine Power ſeems to be limited by Wiſdom; but it never can be <hi>wiſe</hi> in God to act contrary to his own <hi>Truth.</hi> A Conformity therefore to this Attribute, muſt be <hi>perfect</hi> and without Exception; and no Fault of our own or others, can give us a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>any Caſe</hi> to act contrary to it. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, in this Caſe, is abſolute and without any Limitation. Epheſ. iv. 25. <hi>Put away Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Speak the Truth every Man to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> 1 Theſ. iv. 6. <hi>Let no Man go beyond,</hi> or defraud, <hi>his Neighbour, in</hi> ANY MATTER; <hi>for God is the Avenger of ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="74">§ 74. As to the Inſtances of <hi>approved Decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> pretended to be found in <hi>Scripture;</hi> they are all eaſily ſolved by this one <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> There is a plain Diſtinction between my aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Propoſition which is <hi>falſe;</hi> and my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting a Propoſition which is <hi>true,</hi> and another thro' a Miſtake, not of my Propoſition, as it is really intended by me, but of ſome relative Circumſtances, draws a <hi>falſe Inference</hi> from what I ſaid. In this Caſe he <hi>deceives himſelf,</hi> thro' his own Raſhneſs and Want of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if it be in a Caſe in which I am under no Kind of <hi>Obligation</hi> to tell him the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:009931_0067_0F7B3BBF1EFA2530"/>
               <hi>whole</hi> Truth, or every Truth which has any remote <hi>Relation</hi> to what I ſaid; then it is no Fault in me, to <hi>let him alone,</hi> to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And that even though, by knowing his Diſpoſition, I <hi>expected</hi> before-hand, that he would make ſuch a <hi>wrong Inference.</hi> But if I was under <hi>any Obligation,</hi> by the divine Law, my own Promiſe or otherwiſe, to tell him the <hi>whole</hi> Truth in that Matter, and do not; then indeed I am guilty of a <hi>great Fault</hi> by my Neglect: but that alone does not conſtitute a Lye in the firſt Propoſition. But then my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion muſt be in plain and expreſs Words, which being taken according to the <hi>common Uſe</hi> of Language, or other known <hi>inſtituted Signs,</hi> ſhall <hi>truly</hi> convey my Ideas. For if I uſe any Kind of <hi>Equivocations</hi> or mental Reſervations, with a Deſign that he ſhould <hi>miſunderſtand</hi> me, then I <hi>deceive him,</hi> and that in ſuch a Manner as is but little, if any Thing better than a <hi>plain Lye.</hi> But if he, from <hi>my Words,</hi> takes up the true Propoſition, as it was contained in <hi>my Mind;</hi> and then inconſiderately draws a <hi>falſe Inference</hi> from it, and acts accordingly; he deceives <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> and not <hi>I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="75">§ 75. As ſuppoſe, I ſee a <hi>Madman</hi> with a Sword in his Hand, purſuing another, who is at preſent out of Sight; and I tel him, that four Minutes ago I ſaw him go into ſuch a Houſe, and he thereupon ſuppoſes, that he is there <hi>now,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:009931_0068_0F7B3BBF912A1E88"/>
and accordingly goes in there to ſeek him: and I don't tell the Madman that I afterwards ſaw him come out, and go another Way: this is no <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Deception</hi> in me; for I told him the <hi>Truth</hi> and the whole <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo far as I was obliged or undertook to do it: and what followed was his <hi>miſtaken Inference</hi> from the <hi>Truth</hi> which I told him. Indeed if he had aſked me if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he was there <hi>now,</hi> and I had anſwered <hi>Yes,</hi> I ſhould have been guilty of <hi>Lying.</hi> But then I might have refuſed to give him any Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer at all, without any Violation of Truth.</p>
            <p n="76">§ 76. So in <hi>Stratagems in War:</hi> if I retreat or flee before my Enemy; and from this Action he infers that I am beat, diſcouraged, or will <hi>fight no more:</hi> and ſo purſues me with Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and gives me an Advantage againſt him; and then I turn back and take it, as I before <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,</hi> I am guilty of <hi>no Lye</hi> or active <hi>Deception:</hi> I only let him alone to <hi>deceive himſelf,</hi> by not revealing to him a Truth which I was under no Obligation to diſcover. But if I ſtrike my Colours, hold up a Flag of Truce, or uſe any other known, <hi>inſtituted</hi> Sign of Submiſſion or Ceſſation of Arms; and he thereupon comes to me unarmed; and I fall upon him and kill him; I am guilty of perfidious <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Murder;</hi> becauſe I acted contrary to my <hi>own</hi> Declaration.</p>
            <p n="77">§ 77. This Diſtinction and Rule is plain: all the Danger in the Application of it will be this;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009931_0069_0F7B3BC028BFDE98"/>
— a Man, in ſome Caſes, may think himſelf <hi>not oblig'd</hi> to diſcover a Truth, when he really is obliged, from the Principles of Juſtice, Truth or Goodneſs. But a preciſe Determination of the Boundaries of Obligation, in all ſuch Caſes, would require conſiderable Time, and does not belong to the preſent Queſtion. Upon the whole therefore it appears, that a Man ought not, in ANY Caſe, or under any Circumſtances whatſoever, knowingly to <hi>declare</hi> or <hi>aſſert</hi> any Propoſition or Thing which is a <hi>Lye, falſe</hi> or <hi>untrue:</hi> and if he does, he contradicts and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly denies the <hi>Truth</hi> and Law of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things, duly conſidered, will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to direct us how to diſtinguiſh between the <hi>juſtifiable</hi> and <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> Inſtances of <hi>ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuppoſed Deception,</hi> recorded in the ſacred Scripture.</p>
