            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>MEMOIRS OF</hi> Charles Dennis Ruſoe D'Eres, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I WAS born in the city of Quebec<note n="*" place="bottom">Metropolis of Lower Canada.</note>, on the ſeventh day of April, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty one, of parents much reſpected. My father, whoſe name was Luois Ruſoe D'Eres, in early life acquired the blackſmith's buſineſs; ſoon after his freedom from his maſter, he ſettled in the city, and by induſtry in a ſhort time acquired much property. My mother was a deſcendant from a family of good reputation in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec. My parents lived in the conjugal life upwards of twenty-five years, during this period, my mother bore ſixteen children, of which number I was the youngeſt; twelve of my father's children died previous to my birth. My mother died ſoon after I was born. My being left by my mother, at ſo early a period of life, naturally drew my father's attention to me, I therefore ſoon engroſſed his affections, and was careſſed by him and his family; retiring from buſineſs he frequently dandled me on his knee, and with tears droping from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038422_0003_1011E95443A50F48"/>
his eyes, would, with a deep ſigh, exclaim ah, my little ſon! thy mother, under whoſe watchful eye thy educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would (under the ſmiles of Providence, have been conducted with the cloſeſt attention, and doubtleſs with happy ſucceſs, is now no more; in you I behold traces of her countenance, &amp; at times almoſt loſe the keenneſs of my ſorrows, occaſioned by my loſs in her. May you, my dear ſon, be continued for my comfort, through the future ſtages of my life, and a prop to thy fond father through his declining days. Such language as the foregoing, I was frequently entertained with, but alas! his joy and good wiſhes for future days of happy enjoyment were ſoon, too ſoon cut off, as by the ſubſequent Narrative will appear.</p>
            <p>My father being frequently called from a private to a public life, had many opportunities in political ſcience to improve his mind; about this time, that is, when I arrived at the fourteenth year of my age, 'twas frequently mentioned in private circles of friends in Quebec, that a rupture would ſoon take place between Great Britain, and ſome (at leaſt) of her American Colonies. My father obtained the beſt information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diſpute, ſoon determined in favour of the Colonies, and being fully perſuaded that their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Britiſh miniſtry, would prove ſucceſsful, he ardently wiſhed for an opportunity of proving his faith by his works. In October, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-five, General Montgomery, with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038422_0004_1011E957CA034B20"/>
a large number of troops from Newengland, entered the borders of Canada, with an intention of reducing it to the American ſtandard. The troops made rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards Quebec, without much oppoſition. The then commander in chief of Canada<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lton.</note>, iſſued his proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamation, giving liberty to ſuch of the Inhabitants of Quebec as choſe to leave the city, to depart within a limited time, with ſuch of their perſonal property as they ſhould chooſe to carry, promiſing thoſe perſons a reſtoration of ſuch real property as they ſhould leave behind them (provided the rebellious army ſhould not ſucceed in their propoſed plan) my father availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this, and moved with his family, and ſuch of his perſonal property, as were portable to St. Nicola, nine miles from Quebec. Leaving in the city, real property to a large amount, conſiſting of a ſpacious dwelling-houſe, built with ſtone and lime, and covered with tin, over which were layed ſeveral coats of paint, to preſerve the tin from ruſt—a large blackſmith's ſhop with tools ſufficient to employ many workmen: he then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed in the King's works, with many other buildings for domeſtic uſe. My father ſoon became acquainted with General Montgomery, with whom he took an active part againſt the Britiſh government, and was honored with a Captain's commiſſion, and with the army marched to Quebec, with a view to reduce it to the American faith. A general conſultation among the officers, took place reſpecting the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038422_0005_1011E959579B3298"/>
mode of procedure againſt the city; the reſult whereof, was, to ſtorm it. An attempt accordingly took place on the laſt day of December, one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy five. In the attempt the valiant Montgomery fell, with ſome of his officers and men, the major part of his army were taken and impriſoned; ſome few only eſcaped, among thoſe, were my father &amp; only brother. My father, apprehenſive of the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his &amp; their conduct, in taking up arms againſt the King, endeavoured not only to ſecret himſelf &amp; ſon from the royal hunters; but alſo to ſecure as many of his followers, as was in his power. He owning a coal hut in the woods, not far from St. Nicola, concluded there to hide them; to this place they retired, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tarry until the Britiſh wrath ſubſided; but even in this retreat they were diſcovered. My Father hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned this, immediately furniſhed as many of them as was in his power, with proviſion, a pocket compaſs, and other neceſſaries, bid them ſhift for themſelves; while he and his ſon returned to St. Nicola, to provide themſelves with neceſſaries, intending to flee to a more diſtant and more ſafe retreat: all which by ſecret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, reached the ears of the Commander in Chief at Quebec, who immediately ſent an officer, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men to St. Nicola, and made my father, brother, &amp; myſelf, though young, priſoners; my two ſiſters made their eſcape, by jumping out of the chamber windows. The officer ordered his men to fire my father's houſe, and turn the cattle out of the barn, and to burn that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038422_0006_1011D05C6AB56150"/>
alſo, which was ſoon done, and in a few moments both buildings were levelled with the ground. We were carried priſoners to the city, in the night, and confined in the guard houſe; next day at ten o'clock (the time of relieving the guard,) we were brought before the general officers, who, after a lengthy trial, pronounced the following ſentence, viz. that my father and brother ſhould be confined in the common goal, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until the then war ſhould cloſe; they then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, attentively viewing me, obſerving my ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; youthfull appearance, being then fourteen years and eight months old, ſaid one to the other, what ſhall we do with this little yankee, this little rebel? it will not do to put him in goal, he will die there in 2 or 3 days, let us ſaid one, give him to the Indians; let them take him, kill him, ſcalp him, or do what they will with him. My dear father, on hearing this ſentence paſſed on me, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fell to the ground. I in the utmoſt agony cried and begged to be releaſed from the ſentence, but all to no purpoſe. I ſprang to my father, claſped my arms round his neck and kiſſed him. On his recovery, he pleaded earneſtly that I might not be given to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; but all in vain, they violently pulled me from him and puſhed me towards the Indians, ſaying, take that little Yankee, that little Rebel, and kill, or ſcalp him; do with him as you pleaſe; on which one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian took me by the hand and forced me from my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038422_0007_1011E95F18012C10"/>
connections: ſaying, go with us, we no kill you; we no hurt you; he French boy.</p>
            <p>I ſoon learned that the Indians, to whom I was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, were of the Scanyawtauraguohrooote tribe, and that they lived no leſs than fifteen hundred miles from Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec. Thus far, reader, I have led you on in my narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive without a realizing ſenſe of my certain doom; now, nothing left me but a ſmall glimmer of hope, that at ſome far diſtant period, if life remained I might once more realiſe my freedom and enjoy the tender em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of an affectionate and tender father, brother and ſiſters; but oh! how can I deſcribe my ſituation! forced from my father, and forbid the tender embrace of a beloved brother and of near, dear and truly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſiſters, now under the controul of ſavages of the wilderneſs, whoſe tender mercies are cruelty. My at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the beloved city, was ſo great, that my dread of future evil, did not prevent my keeping my wiſhful eyes on it; particularly on that part in which my father dwelt.</p>
            <p>The Indians retired from Quebec to the country, not forgetting to take me with them; I found that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was in vain, I therefore, with apparent cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, trip'd along with them, frequently turning my glazed eyes towards them, and viewing, with horror,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038422_0008_1011E962DA49ACE0"/>
their Indian dreſs, and uncouth appearance; but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my fears, they uſed me tenderly in their way; the Squaws appeared more mild and tender, than the men; fawned over and flattered me, and by this mean, I became more familiar with them, and frequently uſed to run to them for protection, when I thought myſelf in danger from the men; for ſeveral days, I ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat or drank with them, their proviſion and mode of living, being ſo diſagreeable to me, that I was much reduced for want of proper food. After being with them about fifteen days, I became in a meaſure, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, and uſed much familiarity with them. One day an Indian Chief, took me by my hand, and with apparent good humour, told me I muſt be dreſſed like them, and bid me pull off my breeches, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly did; he then put on me a clout, and belt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-faſhion, and threw my breeches into the fire, where they were ſoon conſumed; he with a hearty laugh, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to ſtrip off my other garments, which I read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily obeyed, and they ſhared the ſame ſate with my bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; he then completely dreſſed me in an Indian uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, conſiſting of a blanket, feathers,  giving me a ſtone pipe and tobacco pouch; then painted my face, according to their cuſtom, and told me that was to make me look fine; then flattered me, ſaying, you be good boy me give you little tomahawk, fine cap and broaches; me no give you name now, me ſee how you behave, then give you name; you be bold like big man,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038422_0009_1011E964637B86D0"/>
me give you name like great King; you be coward, and be like Squaw, me give you little name like Squaw.</p>
            <p>About three months after I was given to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, they received the thanks of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for their good behaviour,) and large preſents, and were permitted to return to their own country. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their courſe to fort Michilimackinac, nine hundred miles northweſt of Montreal; nothing very material, for or againſt me, turned up during this route; each day I attentively liſtened to their language, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees learned to ſpeak to, and anſwer them tolerably well; in this, the Squaws were peculiarly helpful. At the above deſcribed place, we tarried two months, where the Indians built birch canoes, ſufficient to carry five hundred perſons with their implements for hunting, and fiſhing. There we drew proviſion from the king's ſtore; but not allowed rum for daily uſe, with which the Indians appeared tolerably ſatisfied, having the promiſe of as much as they could drink the laſt day of their tarry. After completing their canoes, the day of departure arrived, and they received a large quantity of rum, of which they drank ſo freely, that they ſoon became intoxicated, almoſt to a man, ſo that but a few were able to take care of the preſents, made them as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove related. This ſtate of intoxication laſted until the next day, when, inſtead of departing, they begged for more rum, but being denied, they ſoon became tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038422_0010_1011E9671594FE70"/>
and attempted to break into the king's ſtores, which was ſoon effected. They turned out a number of hogſheads of rum, the garriſon being unable to prevent it; of courſe, the Indians ſoon became drunk, and a general clamour ſucceeded, with fighting, Sanop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Squaw, and Squaw againſt Sanop, to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that many were in danger of loſing their limbs, if not life alſo. This fray continued until the rum was wholly exhauſted. During this frolick, about ſixty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Shawanee tribe, came in birch canoes load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fur, propoſing to trade at the fort; the Indians, of whom I now was counted one, ſoon began to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Shawanee Indians, engaged them with hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fury, and ſlaughtered the whole number in the moſt barbarous manner, cutting open their bodies, while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, tearing out their bowels, plucking their hearts from their bodies, and greedily eating them, even while palpitating in their hands; inceſſantly yelling and whooping during the carnage, which was followed by a total deſtruction of their canoes, and furs.</p>
            <p>After ſpending five days in the manner above deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, we took our departure from Michilimakinak down Lake Superior. Here it may not be amiſs to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe Michilimakinak, and Lake Superior.</p>
            <p>Michilimackinac, is an iſland near the entrance of Lake Superior, and takes its name from the appearance
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038422_0011_1011E96ADC21C070"/>
of a certain iſland, lying about ſix, or ſeven miles northeaſt, within ſight, which at a diſtance appears not unlike an animal, called a Tortoiſe; the word Michili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makinak, in the Indian language, ſignifying a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe. On this iſland of Michilimakinak, is a ſtockaded fort, uſually defended with one hundred men; here are about thirty or forty dwelling-houſes, one of which, belongs to the governor, and another to the commiſſary; ſeveral traders from different quarters alſo, dwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its fortifications; here trade is carried on with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, from almoſt all parts of America.</p>
            <p>Lake Superior, is ſo called on account of its ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in magnitude to any of the lakes on the continent of America, and is ſuppoſed to be the largeſt body of freſh water on the globe; in circumference, is ſaid to be ſixteen hundred miles.<note n="*" place="bottom">According to French Charts.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Having deſcribed, as I propoſed, the iſland of Michilimakinak, and Lake Superior, according to the beſt information I am able to obtain, I now proceed in my narrative.</p>
            <p>Steering in our canoes (as near as I could gueſs,) northweſt, we were ſoon overtaken with a heavy gale of wind, which continued three days and nights; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, we laboured hard to keep our canoes before the wind, to prevent upſetting, not being able to gain
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038422_0012_1011E96D803CB6F8"/>
the ſhore on either ſide, by reaſon of huge rocks and banks, which in many places were nearly perpendicular. On the fourth day the wind abated, towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we diſcovered an iſland to which we paddled and landed thereon; where we tarried four or five days to refreſh ourſelves, and to catch ſome game and fiſh, to recruit our ſtores. Here we caught many fiſh of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds; the lake abounding in fiſh, ſuch as Trout, Pike, Pickerel and Porch, with many others, for which I want names.</p>
            <p>Having provided ourſelves with proviſion, conſiſting of fiſh, and fleſh, ſuch as the iſland afforded, we took our departure from the iſle, and continued our voyage notherly, and in about thirty days, catching fiſh as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as occaſion required, not quitting our canoes day nor night, we were obliged to eat our ſweet morſels uncooked; realizing that barking ſtomacks ſtrain no compliments. We arrived at the mouth of Maccatah River, which comes from ſtupendous mountains, lying far north from this river's mouth, which is about thirty feet wide, the waters whereof, are of an extraordinary quality, being very thick, of a greeniſh colour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for uſe. This river runs from the mountains with great rapidity; at the bottom of which, at its entrance into the lake, are diſcovered large rocks of a rediſh caſt, which our Indians called blood-ſtone, at a ſhort diſtance north, from this river's mouth, a very ſingular opening
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038422_0013_1011E96F0E12C0B0"/>
appears on the ſide of a mountain, apparently cut through ſolid rock, which is very hard each ſide of the entrance, is of a black colour, and very ſmooth; the entrance is about thirty feet diameter, and continues of this magnitude ſome way into the mountain; many of the Indians repeatedly with lighted torches, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to trace it to its utmoſt extent; but hitherto have failed, not being able to keep torches burning for any length of time, gave over ſearching further. The rock at the entrance is ornamented with curious carvings of various kinds, ſuch as animals of different forms, ſome appear ſuſpended from the rock, of different ſhapes, in a moſt curious manner, all which our Indians could not account for. The eldeſt of them obſerved, that ſuch has been its appearance ever ſince they had any knowledge of the place. But what I have now to relate is ſtill more marvellous.</p>
            <p>During our tarry at this place were heard, at all times, voices, not unlike the crying of young children, as if in the utmoſt diſtreſs. In the morning are plainly ſeen on the ſmooth ſand on the beach, at the mouth of this horrible cavern, marks like foot-ſteps of children; and, although ſmoothed down in the morning, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing morning ſimilar marks will appear, as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as the preceeding day. From this place we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our courſe north for two days and one night in our canoes, and arrived at the Red River, which takes
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038422_0014_1011E971969718A8"/>
its riſe from Lake Superior, and runs a ſouthweſterly courſe very rapidly; in which are many falls. We paddled down this river forty days, frequently ſhooting over falls with ſuch force, that our canoes ſometimes would ſkip out of the water; but ſuch was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that they would always fall on their bottoms, being properly balanced by their navigators falling flat on their backs within them. Many falls were ſo tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, that we were obliged to haul out our canoes and carry them on our backs by land, until paſſing the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, ſlide them into the river and purſue our courſe. We arrived at an iſland in this river, after forty days ſail from its mouth. Here we tarried five or ſix days to furniſh ourſelves with a new recruit of proviſion. Soon after our landing, ſix Indians, belonging to the Annoowechen Tribe, made us a viſit in their canoes, conſtructed ſomething different from ours, both in form and ornament. Thoſe Indians came, as they ſaid, with an intention to inform us of ſomething greatly to our advantage, and if we would make them ſome good preſents, we ſhould be let into the ſecret—whereupon, we gave each one a blanket, and they then informed us, that the Annoowechen Tribe had heard of our return from Canada, and of our poſſeſſing many valuable preſents, made us, when there; and of their intention to ſurpriſe and rob us before the next morning. They ſoon departed, and we being fore-warned, put ourſelves in the beſt poſture for defence; knowing that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038422_0015_1011E97454FC92E8"/>
robbers were not prepared with fire arms—hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing wherewith to make the aſſault, excepting axes made of flint ſtone, fixed in the end of a ſplit ſtick; theſe axes were their principal weapons for war; we having fire arms, ammunition and tomahawks in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did not fear them, be their number ever ſo large. However, we put ourſelves in the beſt poſture for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and kept a good look out through the night. Juſt before the dawn of day (it being very calm weather) we could hear their paddles ſtrike the water; and they ſoon came in ſight. I counted forty-two canoes— the ſmalleſt number in a canoe was fourteen, and in ſome were more than twenty. We permitted them to advance till they came near the ſhore, and then fired upon them, which made terrible havoc. They being unacquainted with fire arms, were put into the greateſt confuſion—ſome crawled to the ſhore, others jumped into the water, and attempted to ſave themſelves by ſwiming—a ſmall number eſcaped. Forty of them we took alive, and killed all except ten, who were reſerved for future diverſion. After the battle was over, we counted among the dead on ſhore, and in the water, two hundred and fifty, without any loſs on our ſide. Soon after, the forenoon of that day, ſeveral of them were moſt inhumanly ſlaughtered by the toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk and knife, cutting open their bodies, and with their hands ſcooping up the warm blood out of their bodies, while alive, and drinking it greedily,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038422_0016_1011E977C44F1A88"/>
whooping and dancing merrily, as if partaking of the moſt agreeable repaſt. Some of our Indians obſerving my backwardneſs to join them, ordered me to do as they did—with which I was obliged to comply ſo far, as to ſcoop up blood into my hands, and daubed it over my mouth and face, to make them believe I drank it; they then ſaid I was good man.</p>
            <p>The priſoners who ſurvived, were kept confined without any ſuſtenance, and every day were whipt and tortured, by burning their fingers; forcing them into their pipes, when ſmoaking, and there confining them, until burnt to the bone; whooping and dancing round them—this was their practice day by day, until this ſcene changed, by a ſcene more horrible, which cannot be realized by my readers; nothing but occular dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtration can bring this to a proper point of view, to this day, (a recollection of the ſcene) it being tranſacted before my eyes, at a period of life, when the ſmalleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion muſt make a laſting continuance—even now, makes me to ſhudder. The manner of ſacrifice, is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The priſoner, deſtined for each day's diverſion, was led from among his companions to the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bound with ſtrong cords, (prepared from ſinews of wild animals,) to a poſt fixed in the ground, to which the victim is ſtrongly tied, having his hands faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened behind him, his back towards the poſt, and in ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038422_0017_1011E979522FEDF8"/>
a manner, that he could ſtep round from ſide to ſide, keeping his back towards the fixed poſt. At a ſmall diſtance, in a circular form round the unhappy ſufferer, fire was then kindled, conſiſting of pitch pine ſplinters, with other combuſtible matter, ſo as to make a ſmall, but conſtant fire. As ſoon as the man feels the heat, he moves with a view to fly from the fire; but alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis fruitleſs, for turn which way he will, he ſtill feels the force of the increaſing element—our Indians then ſhew their joy, by whooping, dancing, rattling their kettles, prepared for this purpoſe, by putting ſmall ſtones and bullets into them. This diverſion continues until the ſufferer appears nearly exhauſted. The priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner during his ſuffering never ſhews the leaſt reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but often would ſay, you no underſtand beſt way to torment—at the ſame time pointing out differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modes of puniſhment; exultingly would whoop and ſay, me die like man, ſo died my father, my grand-father, and all good fighters die like men.</p>
            <p>When the priſoner appears nearly expiring, which is known by his faultering voice, and declining head; the by-ſtanders then, to increaſe his anguiſh, heat the bails of their kettles red hot, and throw them over the expiring priſoner's head, which cauſes him to revive and greatly enhances his torment, in his laſt moments. This awful ſcene was repeated day by day, until all the priſoners were executed. We tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </gap>. By this time I became more Indian-like, and tolerably content with my lot, endeavouring to mimic them in all their manners; finding it beſt to be a conformiſt—for by this, I found that they were pleaſed, and I ſoon became their favourite.</p>
            <p>From this iſland we departed, and paddled half a day, ſteering ſouth, till we ſtruck the ſouth ſhore of Red River; we hauled our canoes out of the river, and trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled fifteen miles, obſerving a ſoutherly courſe, carrying our canoes, &amp;c. over mountains, valleys and rocks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we came to the river, called Rontooroo; we in our canoes following this river (which appear'd narrow on our firſt entrance) forty-five miles—here the river is nine miles from ſhore to ſhore. After ſailing ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, further down the wideſt part of this river, which kept a ſoutherly courſe, I eſpied near the centre of this river, a very large iſland (on which I afterwards learned our tribe lived,) on a nearer approach to it, I could ſee a very large number of buildings in a form new to me, theſe were wigwams, conſtructed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and ſpread over a large extent. They appeared in the form of a Cone, circular, broad at the bottom, and gradually falling in at the top, which ended in a ſmall point, with a hole in the centre, to carry off ſmoke, &amp;c. The wigwams appeared nearly of equal height, which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038422_0019_1011E9802FC2AF40"/>
was about twenty feet. I was much ſtartled at the ſight, thinking that we ſhould ſoon engage our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and a horr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> ſcene of war would enſue. I aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Indian what that appearance before us meant? A Squaw came to me and told me not to be frightened. On our nearer approach to the ſhore, I diſcovered a number of flags-hoiſted; ſome appeared very broad, and long, and of various colours, whereon were drawn figures of animals of different kinds, and neatly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The inhabitants, of all ages, and ſexes, ran towards the ſhore, whooping and dancing with great vehemence, at which I was terrified to that degree, that I fainted, expecting ſoon to be devoured by them. A number of Squaws came to me, threw water in my face, and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bottoms of my feet, ſides, and belly. I ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and we landed. The people on ſhore hauled our canoes out of the water, and took care of our baggage,  all which, they carried from the water's edge, to different wigwams, in a manner, before to me unknown, which was by placing them at arms length over their heads, whooping extravagantly as they paſſed along. On our coming to the centre of the wigwams, in an open ſpace, large fires were kindled, over which were hung on poles, a number of large braſs kettles, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indian corn, and meat of different kinds. At a ſmall diſtance from the fire, a large number of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en diſhes were piled up bottom upwards. At this place, preparation was made for a feaſt, prepared for

A large bone falling to my ſhare, I took it from my diſh, and with a ſtone, tried to break it in order to ſuck the marrow out of it; at that time I did not fully comprehend the mode of regulating ſo important a feaſt; one of the chiefs attentively viewing me, ſaw my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, immediately ſprung from his ſeat, and with an open knife in his hand, made directly towards me; I was much alarmed, and ſtarting from my ſeat on the ground, ran, the Indian ſoon overtook me, and with an apparent deſign to take my life, caught hold of my arm; I made all the reſiſtance in my power, by ſcratching, biting, and kicking him, but all to no purpoſe; for he forced me back to my ſeat, and bid me eat all in my diſh, and that I muſt not crack a bone; he then retired to his ſeat. This manoeuver ſo affrighted me, that I could not eat any more. At a ſmall diſtance from the place of feſtivity, was prepared a large pile of dry wood,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038422_0021_1011E9848369DEF0"/>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To this place, the Indians having finiſhed their brotherly feaſt, repaired about ſun ſet, each perſon riſing from his ſeat, all at once, every one carrying his diſh in his hand, and advancing near the fire, threw the bones into it. Various inſtruments for muſic were alſo brought forward, conſiſting of ſmall kettles, containing bullets and ſmall ſtones, and a ſmall piece of hard wood ſcooped out ſo large as to contain about two quarts; into theſe were thrown ſmall pebbles, each one containing an equal quantity; this piece of wood was conſtructed in an orbicular form, into which was fixed a handle about ſix inches in length; with theſe inſtruments, adding the Indian whoop, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all at the ſame time, with dancing round the fire— all engaging without diſtinction of age or ſex, ſtruck me with an agreeable ſurpriſe.

The nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pipe was then brought forward, of curious conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made of ſtone; the bowl was ſo large as to contain ſeveral pounds of tobacco, with curious engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the outſide; the ſtems<note n="*" place="bottom">Conſiſting of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the bowl was placed a large block of wood, ſo as to keep it upright; directly under each joint of the ſtems, was placed blocks, continued to its extremity, at which another block was alſo fixed, upon which, each Indian was to ſit and ſmoke in the following order.</p>
            <p>As the ſtem conſiſted of ſeven joints, ſeven Indians were alternately called to thoſe laſt fixed blocks; the great pipe being lighted, the firſt ſeven came forward, one after the other, ſitting down, and drawing three whiffs a piece, withdrew. This continued ſeven at a time, coming on and going off, in the ſame manner, until the whole aſſembled multitude, went through this ceremony. This was their method of renewing and confirming their covenants on all great occaſions, to ſtrengthen and unite their nation in a ſtrict adherence to their laws, thereby to regulate their proceedings in war, defenſive or offenſive, in peaceful covenants with other tribes, on the ſafe return of long abſent friends, at marriages, &amp;c. Thoſe ceremonies were ever conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and kept as ſacred and binding as a ſolemn oath. Any one refuſing to ſmoke at this pipe, were ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and treated as enemies to our tribe, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the national law; therefore, liable to be killed with impunity, by any who had ſmoked the great pipe.

            <p>My reader will naturally conſider me as now about to encounter many new, and apparently inſurmountable trials. Being far removed, not leſs (as I conceive) than 15 or 16 hundred miles from my native country, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more to enjoy domeſtic peace, which is and has been the happy lot of many, among their friends; no more to enjoy the fraternal embrace of the kindeſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt of fathers; deprived of ſweet interviews with the beſt of brothers, and two moſt deſirable ſiſters; add to all this, a total deprivation of even the moſt diſtant proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a tolerable education in my own country, and native language. My education at the time of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to the Indians, was, as it were, but in embrio. Now inexpreſſible ideas would alternately fill my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind; deprived of the comforts and convenience of life; not fully underſtanding the Indian language, thereby unable to communicate my ideas of want, and ſorrow, that I might meet with ſome mitigation at leaſt though from ſavages.

blunders, merely for want of a thorough knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their language; add to this the diſagreeable manner of preparing and eating their food; their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſleeping; their frequent Indian yellings, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more or leſs to inhance my lonely feelings.

               </gap> conſidered as my future home. Soon after my arrival, an Indian Squaw obſerving my diſconſolate ſtate, and youthful appearance, made me a viſit, fawned over me, and claimed me as her ſon, and told me I ſhould live with her. I gladly accepted the invitation, went with her and ſoon became her favourite; ſtrictly obſerving ſuch of her orders as I could underſtand; conſtantly following her wherever ſhe went. Here I cannot but notice the interpoſition of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, in raiſing up this old Squaw, at once, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not only my friend, but what is ſtill much greater, my mother alſo. With this Squaw, I enjoyed myſelf tolerably well. My following her about, and frequent viſits, made with her among our neighbors, was partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly noticed by our young Indians, inſomuch, that they would frequently retort upon me, and ſay, you no leave your mother, you great pappooſe; this netled me,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038422_0026_1011E99240553098"/>
and I ſoon became acquainted with, and followed them for awhile in their diverſions. One day in my walk with my comrades, I obſerved a building of a different form, from any I had ſeen on this iſland. I was informed that this building was ſome years before, built by a Spaniard to carry on the gun-ſmith's buſineſs, who had accumulated great wealth, conſiſting of furs, &amp;c—our Indians envying him—killed him. I with my friends, entered this houſe, which was built with ſquare tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, confined at each end, in the ſame manner as log houſes are built in this country; here we found vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tools, ſufficient to carry on the black-ſmith's, gun-ſmith's, and ſilver-ſmith's buſineſs; a thought ſtruck my mind, that an opportunity now preſented for me to advance myſelf in property and friendſhip with my new friends. I learnt that the Indians did not make any uſe of this building nor tools; I ſoon obtained liberty to improve them as my own. My father having in Canada carried on the black-ſmith's work before I left him, as well as after my return, gave me frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to handle his tools in ſome little meaſure, in my earlieſt life—I now commenced black-ſmith. The firſt work I attempted, was to make a ſcalping knife in imitation of their's, which I ſoon effected, much to their liking; I then mended ſome kettles, made ſeveral tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahawks, ſteel-traps, mended gun-locks, &amp;c. I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a favourite among them, and of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence with them; ſtill boarding with my old mother,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038422_0027_1011E993CAC76640"/>
the Squaw, whoſe name was Chawwenſee. Many of my comrades importuned me to live with them, court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my company, and favours, but my mother I count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my beſt friend, therefore kept with her. My ſhop was frequently crouded with them, admiring my workmanſhip; ſaying, I could work as well as the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iard;—they ſoon became clamorous, frequently ſaying, you muſt go eat with us; to prevent any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I often gratified them, by eating with them. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that broaches were a favourite ornament among them began to make ſome but poorly executed, a number coming inone day, I bid them throw all their broaches into one crucible, which they did telling them he that threw in the greateſt number ſhould have the largeſt number of new ones, and the prettieſt. The crucible being filled I ſoon melted them all together, turning the ſilver thus melted into a braſs kettle, it ſoon became one ſolid body, after it cooled I took it into my tongs and began to heat it, as I heat my iron, and began to hammer it, telling one of them to ſtrike with me, the ſilver broke in pieces, I ſaid ſtop, ſtop, we muſt take a welding heat. I then put it into the fire, and blew it briſkly, then attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take it out, ſound nothing in my tongs; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians then began to whoop &amp; laugh, jumping about the ſhop, clapping their hands with many contemptuous ſneers, this I could not well reliſh, however it paſſed off tolerably well, they then ſaid you muſt go with us to Tartarrac<note n="*" place="bottom">A Spaniſh ſettlement in New Spain.</note> where lived many gold ſmith's, who
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038422_0028_1011E998B8788EE8"/>
would learn me to make broaches. I aſked them how far it was to that place? they ſaid, little way, nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles. I had now lived with them about two years, and learnt their language, and habituated my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to their mode of living. I conſented, it being near autum, the uſual time of their going to Tartarrac to trade.</p>
            <p>We ſet out in our canoes, conſiſting of forty-five, with a ſmall quantity of proviſion. The number who embarked with me, were ſeven hundred, men, ſquaws and children—carrying with us fur and ginſang, fit for a Spaniſh market. I was then poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the largeſt ſhare of any one. This river on which we embarked is very wide and deep, and by our Indians called Tartarrac River.</p>
            <p>Our voyage, which was nearly of forty days contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, and without any impediment by rapids, not having occaſion to travel by land any part of this great diſtance, ſometimes ſtoping to catch fiſh, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required, we arrived ſafe at the city above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with our furs, &amp;c. On our entering the city, we were kindly received, and began our trade—our Indians prefered rum and other ſpirits, in preference to any other articles, in exchange for theirs—and now a moſt horrible ſcene commenced, the Indians partaking too freely of the good creature, were generally drunk,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038422_0029_1011E99B300C6658"/>
and with tomahawks and ſcalping knives, fell on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcrimination, father againſt ſon, and ſon againſt father, ſanops and ſquaws, all endeavoring to kill the firſt perſon they met with. The city being in an uproar, we were all turned without the walls, and prevented entering until the tumult ſhould ſubſide, which was not until the next morning. During the night the noiſe and confuſion was kept up—I was much diſtreſſed leaſt I ſhould be killed among them, but eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped unhurt. Early in the morning, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we found four of our number killed, and many others badly wounded. The inhabitants learning our peaceful ſtate, fired a cannon in token of their readineſs to renew our trade with them—we all marched in and began to trade, which went on for a time well; but the juſt deſcribed ſcene ſoon was diſcovered, and began to take place, occaſioned by rum—we were all turned out as before related. This receiving into, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the city, laſted four days. Such was my ſituation, that I had no opportunity to learn the method to make broaches. In this confuſion, the fifth day we left the city without knowing how our accounts with the Spaniards ſtood; we took to our canoes, paddling up the river for thirty-nine days and nights, until we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at our iſland; ſupplying ourſelves with fiſh, by catching them in the river, and eating them without cooking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:038422_0030_1011E99CC3C51A68"/>On our return, we found that nothing material had happened (to our friends we left behind) during our abſence. I continued my buſineſs at my forge for ſome time, but the hunting ſeaſon coming on, our young men prepared to hunt the Buffalo, and by general invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation I joined them.</p>
            <p>We took our departure from our iſland early in the morning, and from the oppoſite ſhore, weſterly we trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled through the woods about fifteen or twenty miles— here, in a convenient place we halted, in the wilderneſs, to reconnoitre our party, conſiſting of fifteen hundred, and to arrange our matters, ſo as to make a ſecure and ſucceſsful hunt. Our firſt work was, to form a hedge fence, beginning at a notherly point, thence extending ſoutherly, forming two ſides of a triangle, to ſome miles extent; the fence was built ſufficiently ſtrong, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the flight of the Buffalo on that quarter, then from the ſouthermoſt point of the fence extending to a proper length eaſterly, a living fence was built in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: about a hundred men were formed thus, the firſt with his left hand claſping the firſt ſtake in the fence, at its ſouthermoſt extent, thence ſtanding in an eaſtern direction, the length of his arm, thence extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his right arm its whole length, one other man ſtands fimly fixt, with arms extending as the former, and ſo on in the ſame manner until the whole number are in this manner, conſiſting of a hundred men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:038422_0031_1011E9A0509F3408"/>
formed. This fence ſerves but to frighten the Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falos to that quarter, guarded by the impenetrable hedge; the men forming their part of the fence after extending to a proper length eaſterly, are continued then in a circular form, towards the northern point of the hedge, leaving a ſpace of about one mile between the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Having thus completed our fence, a number of men ſufficient for the purpoſe, ſcoure the woods, collecting a large number of Buffalos, (for this is a Buffalo hunt,) not regarding animals of an inferior bulk or value. The animals rouſed and put in motion from different quarters, are by their drivers collected into one general company, which is done without much trouble, as they naturally herd together—the hunters ſcatter as much as they can, but not ſo far as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the game from retreat in the rear; thus drove on, they enter the opening, as above deſcribed. The ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals now encloſed, the men forming the northern part of the line join, the hunters cloſe up towards the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of the incloſure—the herd finding no eſcape on the quarter forming the hedge fence, fly to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter, from which they are ſoon driven by the living fence, formed as above deſcribed; all things now prepared, a number of the moſt expert hunters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among the animals, which generally conſiſt of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large number of old and young, fat and lean. The fateſt and beſt are prefered, leaving the poor and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for future ſupplies. Having killed as many as we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:038422_0032_1011E9A1E17C8E38"/>
choſe, the remainder we ſet at liberty. This hunt is performed in as ſecret a manner as poſſible, to prevent the neighboring tribes from entering our borders, and ſharing with us, in our diverſion and profits. The Buffalos killed at this time, are brought together and dreſſed, by ſkinning and taking out their entrails—the meat is preſerved by ſmoke, as is practiced by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, when deſirous of preſerving their meat any length of time, which when ſmoked, is fit for uſe. The manner of ſmoking meat is thus, a long and narrow building, built by ſetting up poles in the ground at equal diſtance one from the other, in two ſtrait lines, interwoven with ſlim, pliable poles, covering over from ſide to ſide of the thus fixed poles with bark, they are completed, fit to receive the meat—this receiver is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and ſoon completed, as they are temporarily ſet up wherever we meet a ſufficient quantity of meat worth ſmoking. The ſkins taken from thoſe animals are dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed immediately, with the brains and marrow of the original owners, which when dreſſed, leaving the hair on, are fit for trade with the northern tribes; with whom they are exchanged for mogaſons, &amp;c. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are careful to carry each man a ſmall quantity of ſalt, not to uſe with their meat, but as an antidote againſt the bite of rattle ſnakes, which often happens, and to extract any other poiſon. Having ſmoked our meat, dreſſed our ſkins, &amp;c. we returned with our boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our dwellings, each one receiving his equal ſhare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:038422_0033_1011E9A44574D5D8"/>On my return, I went on with my buſineſs in my ſhop as heretofore; ſuch was the demand for toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, traps, &amp;c. that I now began to fix prices for my work, and told them I would not work any longer without pay, they ſaid what muſt we give you? I ſaid, I want better clothes and more broaches; they then brought me the beſt blanket that could be found, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a large number of broaches of the beſt workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; alſo a very handſome gun, with the accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fit for hunting, &amp;c. Thus encouraged, I ſtrove to pleaſe them, which I happily effected in a ſhort time; they frequently viſited me at my ſhop, loading me with preſents of fur, ginſang, and many other ſmaller matters.</p>
            <p>This pleaſing ſcene continued but for a ſhort time, being interrupted by news, that a tribe not far diſtant, had encroached on our hunting ground. On this, a council of war was held, conſiſting of the whole tribe, myſelf included, not one man miſſing. A ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was held, every man without diſtinction was allowed freely to give his opinion of the important queſtion. Shall we make war, and drive off the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? or ſhall we allow them to enter our borders and hunt with impunity? they all appeared ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make war with and drive from our lands the inſulting foe.</p>
            <p>I attentively liſtened to the debate, but was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to diſſent from them in opinion. I well
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038422_0034_1011E9A65530F510"/>
knew that my advice would be liſtened to, and be by them counted of much weight. I therefore with the importance of a councellor, demanded ſilence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to what I was about to ſay on the ſubject— they all, with ſilence, liſtening ſat. This making war, ſaid I, upon a ſlender cauſe like unto the preſent, is not juſtifiable, 'tis bad policy, we have no certain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing but report, no one will ſay he ſaw this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, and deſtruction made on our hunting ground, 'tis but hearſay report; my advice, therefore is, that ſome one truſty, mild (if any one can be found) mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our tribe be appointed, and properly authoriſed to go from this nation, to the Rahatoree Tribe, the ſuppoſed intruders, and there make proper enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to facts touching their conduct towards us; if they have intruded, and it is properly ſubſtantiated, let him immediately return, then we will adopt, and purſue the beſt meaſures in our power for retalliation; if the report ſhould prove groundleſs, let him go prepared further to ſtrengthen our friendſhip.</p>
            <p>My advice was approved of by the whole council, and was immediately put in practice in the following manner. One of the number was choſen and made ready agreeably to the preſcribed method. The meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was dreſſed in our uſual mode—to make him reſpectable, he was ornamented with wampum, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of beeds, belts,  becoming one of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038422_0035_1011E9A9E9A22078"/>
he haſtily proceeded on his journey—on his arrival made known his meſſage. By enquiring into their conduct, whether they had made any intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Scanyawtauragahrooote Tribe; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, that they had hunted on their lands, and that they would whenever they ſaw fit; if our tribe diſliked it, they might take what meaſures they thought beſt, to prevent it. Upon this our envoy ſoon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reported to proper perſons of our nation, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therefor. This report having been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, the general cry was War! War! the whole tribe aſſembled, the national pipe, already deſcribed, was by ſpecial order brought forward, and all who were inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go on this expedition, were to ſmoke three whiffs a piece. The number who ſmoked on this occaſion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of five thouſand. Here an important queſtion aroſe, whether we ſhould be ſucceſsful or not—to determine this 'twas neceſſary to conſult—the Powow<note n="*" place="bottom">A praying Indian, conſulted on all important occaſions.</note> muſt be called; who living at ſome diſtance, was ſent for, and ſoon made his appearance. The place into which the Powow was placed, was prepared by fixing a number of flexible poles in the ground, thus, one end drove down, bending over, the other end fixed into the ground, forming an arch, and ſo on, as to form a ſpace ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to contain one perſon only—the ſpaces between theſe poles were filled up with interweavings of bark, rine and twigs, ſo cloſely as not to admit light; each
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:038422_0036_1011E9AC563545B0"/>
end was alſo ſecured, ſo cloſe as to exclude the leaſt ray. In this diſmal place the juggler was placed, confined on his back with ligatures, croſſways and lengthways of his body, in ſuch a manner, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent motion in any one member, except his head. He being thus confined, a number of Indians came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and formed a circle round him, ſetting on the ground croſs legged, with blankets covered over their heads, obſerving a profound ſilence—in a ſhort time the Powow begins to mutter in a low voice, which riſes in a language new and ſtrange, for a long time, then a noiſe is heard like a ruſhing wind, ringing of bells,  in about fifteen minutes, the priſoner is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly releaſed, and runs violently to the water, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by his croſs legged brethren, and there contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſo long as to dive three times, thence ruſhing from the water ran to his former retreat, there lay without ſpeaking, not eating or drinking for twenty-four hours, then eats and drinks plentifully; after which, informs the gaping multitude that the expedition ſhould prove ſucceſsful, that but nine hundred men would oppoſe them. Upon this agreeable information, our iſland rang with whooping and dancing, rejoicing and boaſting at the advantage they had of five thouſand oppoſing nine hundred. Orders were then given, that all thoſe who had ſmoked the great pipe, ſhould immediately prepare to march, which began by painting their faces in the following manner: the right
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038422_0037_1011E9AEC30A9850"/>
ſide red with half the noſe, the left ſide of the face and noſe black, the top of the head, which is without hair, of different colours chequer-wiſe, all which denote courage without fear. Each man fixed on his warlike weapons, and were ready—the preparation took up but two days.</p>
            <p>With twenty canoes we left our iſland, cautiouſly paddled to the main. On ſtriking the ſhore, we hauled up our canoes, and carried them on our backs, crept through the buſhes ſome miles, until we came to a great lake; on an iſland in this lake, our enemies dwelt. We, without noiſe, put our canoes into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and paddled within a few rods of the iſland; here we made a halt, and diſpatched a ſmall number to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connoitre the iſland—of this party I was one—(here it muſt be obſerved, that our canoes were of various ſizes, ſome would carry twenty-ſix or thirty men; the largeſt ſix men could carry with eaſe.) On our near approach, we ſaw a number paddling round the iſland, as if to keep a good look out, for they expected us; we ſoon returned to our party, and informed what we had ſeen; upon this, our whole body cautiouſly moved on, it being dark, as we came near, keeping a profound ſilence—our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies' arrows whiſtled about our ears; we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in quick motion, and ſilent—they had much the advantage among the buſhes, and we in open ſight, and before we recovered the ſhore, they killed 25 of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038422_0038_1011E9B1689407F0"/>
our number, three of their arrows ſtuck into my cap, I being in one of the foremoſt canoes. The night being calm, we ſoon went on ſhore, and purſued the enemy in all directions—the iſland being ſmall, we ſoon found their lurking places, and deſtroyed many. As ſoon as day light appeared, here a dreadful carnage enſued, accompanied with ſavage yelling, which ſerved but to increaſe ſavage fury. Our enemies finding our number much exceeded theirs they endeavoured to make off; ſome by ſwimming from the iſland, ſome took to their canoes, but we prevented them, by cloſely purſuing and knocking them in head, ſome we ſhot in the water; ſome who had reached their canoes, we alſo ſhot. This carnage went on with increaſing fury, until nearly all of them were killed, or taken alive; a ſmall number however, reached the oppoſite ſhore;—their canoes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo fell chiefly into our hands; many we ſtove in pieces, others we kept for our own uſe. Among the priſoners, we culled fifty of the talleſt and beſt men, to carry our ſpoils, &amp;c. to our iſland, we alſo reſerved one boy, the others we took, were directly killed in a moſt ſavage and brutal manner. Thus in about twenty-four hours after landing, we killed and took the whole number of the enemy, conſiſting of five hundred. Upon examining our party, we miſſed ninety-two of our number, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe killed on our landing.</p>
            <p>This iſland being now in peace, with our priſoners and ſpoil, we left it, and without any material hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038422_0039_1011E9B45B1CEB00"/>
we arrived at our iſland. On our ſafe return, we were received with the uſual ceremonies, performed on ſimilar occaſions of conqueſt, as has been already related. After a ſhort refreſhment, a council was held, to determine in what mode to execute the priſoners; the reſult was, to bring them out the next morning, and in the moſt public manner proceed as follows: ſixteen ſtakes fixed into the ground, at about fifty feet one from the other; at each ſtake one priſoner was tied his face towards the ſtake, his hind parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the perſecutors; then a large number of ſquaws appeared, every one armed with a club of three feet in length, and four inches in circumference. Round each unhappy ſufferer, a ſtrong guard is placed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any ſquaw from liberating a priſoner, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen without this precaution;— this done, the ſquaws march in a ſingle file, giving every priſoner one blow on his naked back; when they came to the boy, the ſquaws unitedly begged his life, which by the Indian Chiefs was granted, and given to me, who afterwards became ſingularly uſeful, and tarried with me during my ſtay with the Indians; after the ſquaws had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their part, then an equal number of boys, each one with his pipe filled with tobacco and fire, went up, thruſting the ſufferers' fingers into the pipe, when hot, confining them until the finger was bliſtered; then a number of other boys came on, and with blunt arrows, ſhot at them, never miſſing the mark—this continued
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038422_0040_1011E9B702173B88"/>
for three days. The priſoners were kept in the ſame poſition, without any ſuſtenance during the whole tranſaction, all which they bore without any ſeeming reluctance, although irritated with reflections on their paſt conduct, as cowards, and of unequal ſtrength to oppoſe our tribe, and by bringing food before them, and frequently put to their mouths, of which they were forbid to taſte. At the expiration of the third day, their bodies appeared one general wound; then dry wood was brought and piled around each vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, and ſet on fire at each corner; when enſued dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, &amp;c. round the conſuming pile, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as hath already been related on ſimilar occaſions.</p>
            <p>This more than brutal ſcene being finiſhed, which took up ſome days, the tormentors and other ſpectators went each one to his wigwam, I to my ſhop, with my boy, whom I conſidered as my apprentice. My buſineſs daily increaſing, and cuſtomers punctual in payment, gave me peculiar pleaſure, ſo that I almoſt forgot my former mode of living, and ſweets of a relative life; frequently diverting myſelf by fiſhing, and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near home.</p>
            <p>The diſadvantage I had laboured under, during my peregrination, rendered it almoſt impoſſible to keep a true Kalendar; my reader, therefore, muſt not expect an exact account of the times, in which the ſeveral tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038422_0041_1011E9BA8CBDA090"/>
took place, as mentioned in this detail, although perfectly true.</p>
            <p>And now about this time, another tramp to Tartar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac was planned, and preparation was accordingly made, by collecting together our fur, ginſang, &amp;c. Thus prepared, we ſet off in our canoes, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put on ſhore on either ſide of the river, to catch Wild Turkeys, and other ſmall game. One day as I was travelling through ſome woods near the river, I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied a Monkey, and ſoon caught him, and carried him in my canoe to Tartarrac here we arrived in the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al time ſpent in paddling do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I took my Monkey<note n="*" place="bottom">They live on nuts and other vegetables, ſpontaneouſly growing in the woods.</note> under my arm, travelled through ſeveral ſtreets trying to ſell him; at length I ſaw a boy ſtandng near an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant houſe, I aſked him in Indian language, if he would buy my Monkey? he anſwered, his maſter was gone from home, but if I would ſtop he would go up ſtairs and aſk his miſtreſs—he then took a key from his pocket, ran up ſtairs, ſoon returned and aſked my price? I ſaid, three dollars—he took my Monkey, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to his miſtreſs—returned, and in lieu of my Pug, gave me my price; I was then invited to eat, which I gladly accepted.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038422_0042_1011E9BC75D2EA58"/>
and immediately went up ſtairs to his lady, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Monkey in her lap, enquired how ſhe procured him? ſhe anſwered, a young Indian left it with her—he aſked if it might be bought? ſhe anſwered, the owner is below. He immediately came down to me, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if I owned the Monkey? if I would ſell him? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied yes, will take what you pleaſe to give, (for I found he knew nothing of my trade with his wife.) After I had eat and drank ſufficiently, he aſked me to go with him to his ſtore? I followed him, and he gave me two dollars in money, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ree dollars in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles I wanted, and found there. Now the Monkey is his, the money and ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> he gave are mine.</p>
            <p>In ſtaring round the ſtore, I ſaw a number of odly form'd things, appearing ſomething like croſs belts, locked together with padlocks; the boy being preſent, the merchant left the ſtore—I having an itching deſire to know the exact form, and uſe of them, I took up one in my hand, viewing it attentively, I found ſome part lined and ſtuffed with wool; I aſked the boy, (who could converſe in our language) what it was? and of what uſe? he told me that the Spaniards were jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their wives, and to prevent an unlawful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other men, this inſtrument was contrived, and always by the huſband put on and locked round his wife, in ſuch a manner, as to prevent any immodeſt connections between different ſexes—this the huſband
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038422_0043_1011E9BF014276C8"/>
never neglected, when about to leave his wife, even but for a ſhort time. That was the invariable practice, as the boy told me with his maſter, which accounts for the boy's taking a key from his pocket, and going up ſtairs, when I offered to ſell him my Monkey; for the huſband never leaves his houſe, until his wife is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly equiped, and locked up in her chamber, the key of which, and of the padlock, is delivered to the maid or boy of the family, who keeps them until the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the huſband, and to him only, are the keys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is the jealouſy of the Tartarrac Spaniard, that if a huſband finds his wife converſing with any other man, it often proves fatal to one or both.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I left the ſtore and joined my brethren, to whom I communicated my good luck. We went on with our trade tolerably well, in purchaſing ſome iron, ſteel, led and powder, with many other neceſſary articles, all which I carefully ſtowed in our canoes—the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our trade, &amp;c. devolving principally on me. Having now brought the Indians into ſuch ſubjection, that I could ſay to one come, and he came, to another go, and he went.</p>
            <p>We tarried four days only, at this time in Tartar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac. The fourth and laſt day, our Indians began to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038422_0044_1011E9C1AD18E048"/>
break over the orders, and drank too freely—the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night became a ſcene of horror and bloodſhed. I had as much as I could do, to keep them from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying one another—by my exertion, the greater part of their weapons were kept from them; however, one young Indian found means to procure a tomahawk, and did much miſchief, before I had knowledge of it. An old ſquaw came running to me, and inform'd that two of them, father and ſon, had engaged. I ſprung for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, catched a club, ran to them, ordered the ſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to give up his weapon; which he, knowing my voice, gave to me—turning myſelf from them, they made a moſt hideous yell—I turned, and found the ſon had got his father by his head, which he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pulled down, and againſt his up-lifted knee, broke his father's neck. The ſon immediately abſconded, and has never been ſeen with us ſince. No other death happened through the night. The force of the liquor having abated, a new ſcene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow took place as follows: The whole number ſeated themſelves in companies on the ground, croſslegged; each one throwing his blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket over his head—all ſeated in a circular form, a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous yelling commenced; each one lamenting his own misfortunes, the loſs of his grand father, his father, and other friends. This continued for ſome hours, after which, we prepared to return.</p>
            <p>My viſits to Tartarrac, to me were very agreeable, having an opportunity of converſing with people who
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038422_0045_1011E9C4694162D8"/>
conducted much as the people of Canada. Their bread I was much pleaſed with.</p>
            <p>Our buſineſs being conducted much as heretofore, we took to our canoes, and in the uſual time returned to our friends. On my return, I and my boy went on with our buſineſs—our Indians employed in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diverſions, for the men never perform any manual labour, except making inſtruments for war. The ſquaws always perform the harveſt work, ſuch as to plant and dreſs the corn, bring from the woods ſuch game as the hunters from time to time recover.</p>
            <p>In about ſix months after our return, ſome of our warriors formed a plan to rob a diſtant nation of their furs, &amp;c. (for they continue peaceable but for a ſhort time together.) This nation was called the White In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and lived about three hundred miles north. Five hundred of the ſprieſt and moſt enterpriſing of our Indians, of whom I was counted one, went through the ceremonies uſually practiſed on like occaſions, ſet out on the propoſed robbery, without any proviſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending wholly on hunting for a ſupply.</p>
            <p>We marched with proper guides for three weeks. Coming near to the place of deſtination, we made a halt, and conſulted the beſt method to fall upon them. 'Twas agreed that a number ſufficient for the purpoſe,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:038422_0046_1011E9C7D1B43230"/>
(for they were a harmleſs, defenceleſs people) ſhould divide themſelves into ſmall companies of two each— every company take a different rout in a circuitous march round the mountain.<note n="*" place="bottom">They dug into a mountain, and ſecreted themſelves and property in caves.</note> My companion, with whom I travelled, took orders and departed, both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying fire arms and ammunition, with a ſtrict charge to return at a certain time, as had been agreed on, whether ſucceſsful or not.</p>
            <p>We travelled five days, without making any diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; at length, on the ſixth day, as we were chatting together, my friend eſpied a man ſtanding naked, with a bow in his hand, at the entrance of a cave—I ran to him, and with my tomahawk diſpatched him—he did not ſhoot, although armed with bow and arrow. The way being prepared for our entrance into the cavern in ſearch for plunder, a diſpute aroſe between us, who ſhould enter firſt; we at length determined by caſting lots, and the lot fell on me. I with a lighted torch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, my friend followed with his tomahawk cloſe to my heels—here we met with many difficulties; I with my torch in my left hand, my tomahawk in my right; he with his loaded gun in one hand and tomahawk in the other; we crawled on our hands and knees, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to breathe, much leſs to whiſper. After
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038422_0047_1011E9CA866BE7D8"/>
moving on for ſome conſiderable length, we were ſtopt by a ſhort turn to the right; from thence creeping forward with as much ſilence as poſſible, I found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn to the left; in this courſe we ſteered for ſome time, at length I diſcovered by the light of my torch, a large opening, apparently of about fifteen or twenty feet ſquare. In this opening we diſcovered a number moving about. I then began to realiſe my ſituation, to be more critical than ever before or ſince—no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, for we could not turn to get out, our enemies before us, and we knew not in what manner they were prepared to receive us.<note n="*" place="bottom">This cave, into which we entered, for the reader's better underſtanding, I will deſcribe. The entrance is juſt wide e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to admit one perſon at a time, gradually deſcending a few feet, arched over with timber, then on a level until we come to the turns, then through to the next as above, and ſo on to the opening, in which we found the people—this opening was arched at its top with large beams of cedar, &amp;c.</note> On our nearer approach, we raiſed our voices into yelling and whooping, in order to intimidate them, and prevent their making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence—this ſucceeded, and prevented their making the leaſt defence. They all, conſiſting of four women, five men and three children, huddled together in one corner —here as was previouſly agreed on, I waved my torch to keep it burning, and to give my companion every aſſiſtance in my power to execute his part, which was
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:038422_0048_1011E9CE5309BBC8"/>
to kill all we ſhould find within. The executioner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his part, by killing the whole with his toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk. Thoſe perſons appeared quite different from any I had ever before ſeen.</p>
            <p>The adults appeared about five feet high, very large, round heads, flat noſes, wide mouths, very large and white teeth, very long, ſtrait and very white hair, pale countenance, having no occaſion to ramble abroad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to hunt for food and bedding; a ſmall portion of each ſerving them—they are ſtrangers to fire and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, living a moſt indolent life. We found no kind of tool with them, excepting one made ſomething like a hatchet, having a ſtone made flat at one end, and faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened into a ſtick ſplit at one end. The bottom of the cavern was covered over with ſkins, piled up one on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to a conſiderable height, conſiſting of Buffalo, Bear, Fox and of almoſt every ſpecies of animals, common to that part of the country.<note n="*" place="bottom">Their manner of catching their game, is by diging pits in the ground, ſlightly covering them with ſome ſmall twigs cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered over with leaves, into which the animal falls, and is eaſily taken.</note> In one corner of this room, we found a quantity of meat, ſtinking horribly; this appeared to be their only food; howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we were obliged to feed on ſome through neceſſity. We carried out ſome of the beſt fur, as Beaver and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:038422_0049_1011E9CFDD887490"/>
Raccoon, and at the mouth of the cave, loaded our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with as much ſpoil as we could ſtand under, and as expeditious as poſſible, travelled on to our head quarters, where we found our ſeveral companions, who had as before deſcribed, performed their ſeveral routs; they were ſucceſsful, and joined the main body, loaded with like plunder. Hereupon a general ſhout took place with claping of hands, &amp;c. being much pleaſed with our good luck. The whole company freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of ſuch fare, as our friends had in our abſence (which was nine days from the time of our departure) prepared—the whole body, each one taking his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſhare of baggage, began our retreat homewards.</p>
            <p>During our march from a neighbouring pond, we heard noiſes, as of many water fowls, which we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded had collected in the pond. We were much elated at this, having a keen appetite for fowl; a number were ſent off to ſearch the pond, myſelf mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one, we ſoon reached it; but to our ſurprize found the fowl had (confiding in their truſty wings) left the water—caſting our eyes over the pond, we diſcovered a very large white Bear diving frequently, as if for fiſh— he at length fixed himſelf on a large flat rock on one ſide, looking into the water, ſtriking his fore paw, as though catching fiſh, at every ſtroke lifting up his paw, as if to ſee its contents—I being eager, fired from the ſhore at the Bear, but without effect; my ball as I
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:038422_0050_1011E9D2D52646B0"/>
could plainly ſee ſtruck his ſide, his hair being very thick and long, prevented my killing him; on which, an experienced gunner ſteped up, obſerving his raiſed paw, aimed at the ſpace between the under ſide of the paw and body, ſhot and killed him inſtantly. This was a lucky event; we ſoon drew him from the water— which in ſome meaſure made up for our diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the water fowls. We dreſſed our game, and with it joined our brethren, the main body, and ſoon renewed our march homewards, which we in three weeks performed.</p>
            <p>After making an equal diſtribution of plunder, each one retired to his home and employment. Our great men now began to think it high time to honor me with the Inſignia of their tribe, and to give me a new and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic name, having in many excurſions witneſſed my valor. I dreaded the operation; however, was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>The mark by which the Tribe I belonged to was diſtinguiſhed from all others, was that of the ſun on the inſide of the right leg, and of the moon and ſeven ſtars on the outſide of the ſame leg. This was performed on me by pricking with a ſharp needle into my right leg, the various preſcribed forms, in red and blue colours. Having marked my leg, they proceeded to mark my face, which I much oppoſed, determined not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:038422_0051_1011E9D5F3E20738"/>
—I therefore ſtruggled, and endeavoured to eſcape by biting, kicking,  they however went on and ſlightly marked my face—they proceeded to pluck my hair from my head, excepting a ſmall part on the back the bigneſs of my hand—they proceeded to dreſs me; at this I made no further oppoſition, not willing to loſe the good opinion my friends had formed of me, which by this time, became of no ſmall conſequence to me. They painted my head in chequers of different colours; then fixed a gold ring in my noſe, ſilver drops to my ears; then faſtened a ſtrap to my lock of hair behind, which reached to the ground, filled with broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from top to bottom; then tied a ſtring of beads of various colours round my neck, interſperſed with differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent coloured feathers, all fixed into a leather collar of curious workmanſhip; a leather ſtrap ornamented as above was thrown over my ſhoulders, at each end were fixed two ſilver plates with engravings; on one, the form of a Buffalo, on the other, that of a Panther; to this they added the beſt blanket the Tribe poſſeſſed, ornamented with five hundred broaches; my ſhirt a gay calico; my buſkins red, moggaſons yellow, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with beads and feathers of many colours, tied together with party coloured ribbands, two Peacock feathers ſtuck into my lock of hair, completed my dreſs —then proceeded the formality of giving me ſome great name; the greateſt and moſt learned were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on this occaſion. After a long conſultation,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:038422_0052_1011E9D8BAFE14D0"/>
'twas agreed on, and a Chief whoſe office it was, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up to me, and in a loud voice proclaimed my name, Roooſtontee Cowawoo.<note n="*" place="bottom">Signifying great, majeſtic, acquired by great and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like deeds, &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After this ceremony cloſed, I retired to my ſhop, and with my apprentice, carried on my buſineſs; the Indians frequenting it as uſual; at all times coming in, and with deference and reſpect, approached me, knowing my important ſtation. Thus inveſted with the higheſt honor, they could confer on me, I realiſed my importance and power, and ſoon began a reform among them—all my inſtructions were attentively o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. In this way I went on for ſome length of time; receiving and making congratulatory viſits from, and to my neighbours.</p>
            <p>Some time after, one of my familiar acquaintance propoſed a ſhort hunt for ſmall game. I readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and we two ſet off, prepared with traps, guns and ammunition.</p>
            <p>After travelling five days, we came to an extenſive plain, totally diveſted of any kind of vegetable, and nothing but ſand, dry and light; which on a gentle breeze of wind is put in motion—ſometimes the wind when raiſed to a high degree, and blowing one way for
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:038422_0053_1011D0640D2C73A8"/>
any conſiderable time, puts the ſand into a quick and violent motion, and rolls it up into the appearance of waves, forming deep troughs between each roll or wave; whenever this happens, no one can paſs over this track<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs waſte. Soon after our coming to this place, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a ſtrong wind from the north aroſe, and formed the ſurface of this plain, into the appearance as juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Near by we were obliged to camp, and tarried four days, until the ſtorm abated. Our tarry here, was attended with difficulty, not having a ſufficiency of food, and no opportunity of ſupply preſented, we were reduced to the laſt morſel. In our feeble ſtate, (a calm ſeaſon,) we attempted to croſs over this, apparently, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable heath. On our way we found two human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies almoſt petrified by the heat of the ſun, and warm ſand, which through the whole, retained ſuch a degree of heat as to bliſter our feet.</p>
            <p>During our, encampment and travel over the ſand, our guides (which were the ſun by day, and moon and ſtars by night) forſook us, being cloudy the whole time. On examining our ſtores, we found but one pound of ſmoaked Buffalo for us both. We marched on northerly, towards our village; having the ſun for our guide, (it now pleaſantly appearing.)</p>
            <p>After four days travel from the ſand, we came to a ſpacious meadow; here I failed for want of food, ſat
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:038422_0054_1011E9DB82F81DD8"/>
down, and expected here to end my days; but my companion kept up his courage, and travelling a ſmall diſtance from me, eſpied a Deer laying down behind a windfall—he ran back to me, and told me he had found good meat. He ſoon killed the Deer, and opening his body, devoured in a naked ſtate the entrails; this I could not partake of. My friend chopped up ſome meat and made broth, which I greedily ſwallowed, which was the moſt delicious morſel I ever taſted, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome days before received no kind of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except our leather belts cut up and ſoaked in water.</p>
            <p>One night, ſoon after laying down to ſleep, we were rouſed with a heavy ſhower of rain, attended with tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous thunder and ſharp lightning—this further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled me, having nothing to ſcreen me from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this feeble ſtate I continued ſome days— my companion fixed his traps in different parts of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, baited with fleſh we had cut and prepared from the dead bodies we found in the ſand—he caught many Beaver, &amp;c. During our tarry here, the weather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rainy and the ſun beclouded, ſo that we could not leave the ſwamp, not knowing which way to ſteer.</p>
            <p>One day juſt before ſun ſet, we happily diſcovered our retreat from this diſmal ſwamp, by the ſun. We immediately improved this opportunity for eſcape by
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:038422_0055_1011E9DE833BC628"/>
bundling up our furs,  and by the help of the moon decamped, ſteering a north courſe, and by morning hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found ourſelves quite out of the meadow<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſwamp or meadow, was of forty miles extent, and pearly ſquare, covered with flaggs and ruſhes to a great height —near the center, I lay in my feeble ſtate.</note>—we then lay down and ſlept ſoundly until noon—eat hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily of the veniſon my friend killed in the ſwamp, ſome part we ſmoaked; here we tarried until the next day, in order to recruit and reſt our weary limbs. On our way home, each night we prepared and ſet traps for Fox, Sable, Beaver and Mink; each morning we found that our traps caught more or leſs, ſo that before we came to our homes we collected a very large quantity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that our bundles were too heavy for us to carry. We travelled on, and in a few days after came ſafely to our friends; from whom we met a hearty welcome, which was ſhown by claping of hands, whooping and dancing round us.</p>
            <p>Soon after my return, I was ſeized with a violent fever, of the pleuretic kind, which continued for a long time, and ended in a long intermitting fever. Here I realiſed the comforts of the cloſe attention of a friend, who ſtuck by me cloſer than a brother; I mean the aid of my adopted mother, the Indian ſquaw before mentioned. She never left me, day nor night, during
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:038422_0056_1011E9E19607A218"/>
my illneſs, which continued five months—her friendly hand adminiſtered ſuitable anodynes, prepared from ſuitable herbs and roots, ſpontaneouſly growing in that country. She frequently would call in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring aged, and moſt experienced ſquaws,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſquaws with them, are their ſurgeons and phyſicians.</note> and with them, conſult the beſt means of application, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficult to recover, ſpared no coſt nor pains to obtain and prepare them for my uſe. In this ſickneſs, I was reduced very low, laying in bed<note n="†" place="bottom">My bed was made of the ſkins of Buffalo and Beaver, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little from the ground.</note> ſo long as to rob my back and ſides of their natural covering, my ſkin; all which, my faithful nurſe replaced by exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal applications.</p>
            <p>After my long and tedious confinement, I too ſoon went abroad—my buſineſs urged me to work; I being the only blackſmith in our Tribe, too reſolutely began to work, and thereby brought on a relapſe, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain confined me to my wigwam, and a long, feeble ſtate of health enſued—I again had recourſe to my nurſe and doctor, my mother; ſhe attentively conſidered my caſe, pronounced it deſperate, paſt recovery, unleſs prevented by my ſteady adherence to her preſcriptions; I promiſed ſtrictly to obey, and cheerfully gave myſelf into her hands—ſhe undertook my cure, and ſoon check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:038422_0057_1011E9E5D776ED70"/>
my diſorder, by giving me Buffalo's blood to drink lukewarm—I drank more or leſs every day, until my complaints were no more.</p>
            <p>My ſtrength gradually increaſing with my return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health, I ſoon recovered; but before I entered on ſhop buſineſs, I viſited our chiefs, with a view to carry on my propoſed plan of reform among them; ſetting forth the advantage, that the more civilized part of mankind enjoyed than they in their rude and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated ſtate. I began by informing them of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my father's particular mode of family govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of conducting his domeſtic buſineſs, &amp;c.  to all which, they gave attention, and anſwered, by firſt ſhaking their heads in diſapprobation of my plan, then ſneeringly would ſay, you tell a pretty good ſtory, but ours is much better than yours, our nation greater and more ancient than yours—we live great while in the world, and know much more than your nation; our ways are preferable to yours, we will be Indian. I found my attempts were fruitleſs, therefore for the preſent dropt my plan, intending at ſome future time to purſue it, if a convenient opportunity ſhould offer.</p>
            <p>In a few days I went on with my buſineſs in my ſhop, my boy continuing with me, who by this time became very helpful, having acquired a conſiderable inſight into the buſineſs, which daily increaſing, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038422_0058_1011E9E769FC3EC8"/>
me much comfort and profit—our Indians conſtantly employing me in making their tomahawks, ſcalping knives, and traps; mending guns, and ſometimes mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new gun-locks; all which, they were obliged to go to Tartarrac for, previous to my coming among them.</p>
            <p>On delivering my work, I received my price in furs, ginſang,  carefully ſtoring them until an opportunity preſented to traffick at Tartarrac. My employers would frequently make me large preſents in addition to the ſtipulated price for my work—the ſquaws in particular, would make me many and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable ones, conſiſting of ſap-ſugar, annually made in February. Of this ſugar, I could collect on any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den emergency, large quantities. The ſquaws would enter my ſhop with the ſugar wrapped up in the fore part of their blankets; on their coming near, they would drop a low courteſy, ſaying, Roooſtontee, me give you good ſugar; I with a nod of my head, thanked them, pointing to a large cabin in one corner of my ſhop, bid them throw it up there, which they cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did; turning to go out, they would drop a courteſy and go off.</p>
            <p>I ſteadily purſued my work, not without frequent viſits from young Indians, my intimates. One day a number gathered, and began to banter one another,

and braging of their ſuperior abilities in jumping, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,  one in particular offered to bet fifty broaches againſt an equal number that he could jump higher than any one preſent—upon this an intimate of mine took him up and propoſed that I ſhould jump with him; we jumped one after the other; all agreed to decide the wager in my favour. Upon examining my antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, I found that he had no broaches with him; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his conduct and told him he was a rogue in bantering the company, without having it in his power to pay his bet; he promiſed to pay me ſoon, but neglected.</p>
            <p>One day he came into my ſhop with a good blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket loaded with broaches, I catched his blanket from his back and tore off fifty broaches, and threw his blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket under my bellows; he crawled under them for his blanket, expoſing his poſteriors; I ſnatched my rod from the fire, and whipped him ſo as to bliſter his back ſides, he yelled heartily, ran to the river and plunged in; this brought a number round me, haſtily enquiring the cauſe of ſo much noiſe; I told them my ſtory, they all juſtified me, and ſo the matter blew over.</p>
            <p>Some time after an Indian came to my ſhop, and aſked me to go with him to a neighbour's wigwam? I aſked for what purpoſe? he informed me that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian lately returned from Tartarrac had brought rum,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038422_0060_1011E9EDE6AB94F8"/>
and kept drunk for ſome time; that his ſquaw could not find his rum. I went with my friend to the tipler's wigwam, and we found him almoſt in a lifeleſs ſtate. We ſearched every place, likely for him to ſecreet his rum, but to no purpoſe; but as we came from the wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam, we found two ſturgeon fiſh, which my friend attentively viewing, ſuppoſed the rum might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed within them—he ripped open the fiſh, and in each he found a bottle of rum, artfully concealed; this we ſoon deſtroyed, and left the wigwam and the drunkard—returned to my ſhop and went on as uſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I and my boy turning off work to advantage.</p>
            <p>Soon after, as I and my boy lay in ſound ſleep at midnight, I was rouſed by a heavy voice from without, calling me by name, demanding entrance? I knew his voice,<note n="*" place="bottom">The drunkard.</note> and refuſed to let him in; he perſiſted, and ſaid he would come in, ſaying, I want to ſpeak with you very much; I bid him go home and come in the morning; he made every effort to force open my door, but not ſucceeding, he came to the window, and forced the ſhutter open, diſcharged his gun upon me—the ball entered the ſide of my ſhop about ſix inches from my head, as I lay on my bed. This rouſed me, and ſpringing up, I caught my gun which ſtood near me loaded with ball, (as was my practice always to keep my gun near
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038422_0061_1011E9F1048BFC78"/>
me at night, to defend myſelf againſt every intruder,) ſtepped up to the window and ſhot him, who dropt and died inſtantly.</p>
            <p>The firing of two guns in the dead of night, cauſed a general alarm through the village. A large number ſoon collected, and underſtanding the cauſe, took and put me under keepers, to be brought forth in the morning for trial. I contentedly ſubmitted, knowing my cauſe to be good, having acted on the defenſive only.</p>
            <p>In the morning I was conducted to the place of trial, which was in the open air, and at a ſmall diſtance from my ſhop. On my coming near to the council of trial, a thought ſtruck my mind, that if the trial ſhould go againſt me, I ſhould be tortured in a ſavage-like manner; determining to die on the ſpot, rather than ſubmit to their tortures, which I had frequently before ſeen on their enemies. I aſked liberty to return to my dwelling, to adjuſt ſome affairs there—I gave my word ſoon to return, which they (knowing my exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and importance with them,) without heſitation granted. I returned to my ſhop, and armed myſelf with two piſtols and a truſty knife; concealing them under my blanket. Thus prepared for every event, I returned to the court, who were formed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner; on a block of wood fixed one end in the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038422_0062_1011E9F5E7E39410"/>
ground, about ſix feet from its ſurface, ſat the chief juſtice; and at his feet on a ſmall block, ſat the crimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; on the right and left from the chief juſtice, ſat a number of the chiefs of the Tribe, in a circular form; all ſitting croſslegged. The court being thus ſeated, a profound ſilence enſued, which continued for two hours —they all ſat ſtaring on one another, as if at a loſs in what manner to proceed—at length the cauſe came on, the accuſer<note n="*" place="bottom">The deceaſed's brother.</note> ſtept forward, and affirmed that I had wantonly killed his friend by ſhooting him, who was in the lawful purſuit of his buſineſs. That I killed him, I did not pretend to deny; but affirmed that I killed him in my own defence; that he came to my ſhop at an unſeaſonable time of the night, and that with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to kill me, as I could plentifully prove—upon this, I begged leave to call forward the deceaſed's ſquaw, and the perſon preſent at finding the rum as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related—this was granted; the witneſſes came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſquaw affirmed that her ſanop, on coming out of his drunken fit, ſought for his rum, but could not find it; that on this he appeared much incenſed, enquired of her, who had got his rum; ſhe informed him that Roooſtontee and his friend had deſtroyed it; he raved round the wigwam and ſwore revenge, by killing Roooſtontee; and that he on the night in which he was killed, left his home, having loaded his gun
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:038422_0063_1011E9F8F760F0E0"/>
for the purpoſe of killing me. My friend aſſerted that he with me deſtroyed the deceaſed's rum;<note n="*" place="bottom">Which was done agreeably to a law, in that caſe made and provided.</note> and that the ſlain had frequently, after the rum frolick, ſwore revenge on me; which he (the witneſs) ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, expected would be put in practice, as the indians never paſs over an affront with impunity.</p>
            <p>The judge liſtened to the charge againſt me, and the evidence produced to ſubſtantiate my defence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ripe to pronounce for or againſt me.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for the reader to realiſe my feelings, at this moſt critical and important moment—before the tribunal of a ſavage, aſſiſted by ſavage council only, whoſe friendſhip at beſt is but momentary. Oh! thought I; if my tender and affectionate father could but view me in my preſent condition; how would his parental bowels move for me? on his knees, with up lifted hands, would he plead, Oh! ſpare my darling ſon once more; ſet him at liberty—I know his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence—let me once more embrace him, who was torn from my arms, doomed to bondage, and unjuſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered already too much, but for ſavage nature to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure—come ye who are fathers, liberate him, and view the parental embrace, not to be realiſed, but by parents
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038422_0064_1011E9FA944E45D0"/>
on ſimilar occaſions. All this, and much more might have been uttered, had my father been preſent; but alas! he is at too great a diſtance even to hear my cry.</p>
            <p>Such thoughts as I have juſt related, ſtruck me with ſolemn awe; with trembling heart I wiſhed for, but dreaded to hear the ſentence pronounced from the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge's lips. The judge held in his left hand a long ſtick, his right hand graſped the dreaded knife. He with majeſtic look, turned to the circled chiefs, and ordered them, one at a time, to give their opinions for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the priſoner as he ſhould direct. Thoſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and willing to acquit him, ſhould declare by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their right hands—the dreaded moment came, and they one at a time raiſed their right hands; the judge carefully cut a notch on the right ſide of his ſtick, for every one in favour; on the left ſide he cut one notch for every up lifted hand againſt me. This hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been attended to, the judge counted the favourable notches, and the unfavourable ones, and found the whole number (excepting two) were for ſetting me at liberty, and ſtrongly recommended me to the good will of my fellow villagers.</p>
            <p>This joyful event was publicly notified, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pipe brought forward and placed on the block, on which I ſat when on trial; to which the whole vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage aſſembled and ſmoked in token of approbating the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:038422_0065_1011E9FF14764BE8"/>
conduct of the judge in ſetting me at liberty; and in token of receiving me to their former favour and good will; no one (excepting thoſe two who had voted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me) refuſed to ſmoke at the great pipe. Thus the matter ended, and I went much pleaſed to my uſual employment.</p>
            <p>I worked in my ſhop daily, but not without fear from thoſe who appeared againſt me on trial, knowing an Indian's temper—they never forget a ſeeming inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and knowing that thoſe two were nearly related to the deceaſed—I therefore, always went armed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſome ſecret revenge would ſoon take place. However, my having gained the good will of our chiefs, by my heroic deeds on many former occaſions; and my conduct in defending myſelf, when aſſaulted by my adverſary, and manfully killing him, ſerved to keep up my ſpirits tolerably well. But time, that great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of paſt evils, however ſtrongly impreſſed on the mind, concurred in lulling me into too great a degree of ſecurity, expecting my enemies would forget, and paſs over the ſuppoſed injuries done them; but in this I was miſtaken, as by the ſequel will appear.</p>
            <p>Some time after having occaſion to ſet and burn a kiln of char-coal, at ſome diſtance from my home; one night as I was tending my coal without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with me, (having ſent my boy home to take his
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:038422_0066_1011EA00A4372610"/>
reſt) never leaving it myſelf day nor night, until fully burnt—ſome one from the neighbouring buſhes, fired upon me, the ball entered my left thigh juſt below my hip bone; I fell immediately, and lay bleeding on the ground, unable to help myſelf—I made ſeveral attempts to riſe, but in vain—hallowed for help for a long time; at length a friend hearing my voice, came to me, and by his friendly aid, ſupporting me in his arms, I ſafely returned to my dwelling.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Indian who ſhot at me, I afterwards learnt was one who on my trial voted againſt me; he immediately ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded, and I never ſaw him after.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On my return, my old doctor ſearched the wound, found that the ball was in my thigh, but could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it; ſhe applied ſome mollient plaſters, which in ſome meaſure eaſed my pain. After laying four days, ſhe delivered me of the ball, by ſqueezing the wound, which by this time had feſtered.</p>
            <p>I was under the doctor's hands twenty days before I was able to walk with crutches. My lameneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued five months. The fear made by this ſhot, is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to this day.</p>
            <p>Having in a good meaſure recovered, I reſumed my former buſineſs; my cuſtomers calling every day for
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038422_0067_1011EA0396FB0A98"/>
my work, having been for ſome time in want, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my long confinement.</p>
            <p>Nothing material turned up for, or againſt me for one year after. At length, wanting coal, I erected a new kiln, and in ſcraping up the leaves and dry duſt with my hands to cover it over, I rouſed a Rattle Snake; who in his anger bit my hand; at this I was much troubled, ſuppoſing the bite would prove fatal, but in this was pleaſingly diſappointed by an effectual cure wrought by a ſkilful ſurgeon, who ſoon came to my help, ſeveral of my neighbours accompanied her, who immediately wound a ſtrong cord<note n="*" place="bottom">Made from the ſinews of wild animals.</note> round my arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my elbow, binding it ſo tight as to prevent the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of blood below the cord; this done, ſhe with a flint ſcarified my hand, croſſing the wound in different angles; ſhe then with ſalt in her mouth ſucked the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the wound, on which ſhe ſtrewed ſome ſalt; this was repeated ſeveral times without looſening the cord until the next day; when the cord is taken off, the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubſides, a cure is effected, and my arm, which during the operation was numb and uſeleſs, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately recovered its wonted vigor. Several times after I was bitten by Rattle Snakes; like applications were made, which effected like cures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:038422_0068_1011EA06F7DA7640"/>Notwithſtanding I had got rid of one of my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies, one ſtill remained equally revengeful. This brought me to a diſagreeable ſituation, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obliged to carry defenſive weapons about me wherever I went, and never wiſhing to mingle with my comrades in their diverſions—before this, I ever was one of the foremoſt in all our amuſements.</p>
            <p>In this troubled ſtate I remained for ſome time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to unburden myſelf to any one; at length one of my moſt intimate friends being in my ſhop, having for ſome time obſerved my dejected countenance and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved behaviour, anxiouſly enquired the cauſe; I taking him to be one of my moſt confidential friends, told him the real cauſe. He was much touched with my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but bid me to keep up a good heart; that I was among my friends, who would defend me at all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. I told him I did not doubt of the good will of my neighbours, and added that if ever I ſhould fall by my enemie's arm, it would be in a ſly, ſecret manner— he would take the advantage of me by way laying my walks in the night, or when detained from home, as was the caſe when wounded by my former foe—to this my friend obſerved that this might happen, but he hoped not. He propoſed, that if the hatred continued, I ſhould leave this Tribe for two or three years, join ſome other Tribe, and there carry on my buſineſs, by that time he hoped my adverſary would be dead, or forget the injury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:038422_0069_1011EA0BAD782300"/>I thought much of this advice, and con'd it over frequently in my mind, not knowing how to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to others; for to put the plan into practice, I muſt conſult all our chiefs, or not obtain their conſent; without it I could not depart, nor paſs any Tribe to a more diſtant one, without firſt procuring my paſs and recommendation from the Tribe to whom I belonged, and ſo on from Tribe to Tribe, until I ſhould find ſome one Tribe who would give me proper encouragement to tarry with them.</p>
            <p>A ray of hope now fluſhed my mind, that I might once more viſit and enjoy my friends in my native country; I therefore determined to aſk leave of abſence for three years to viſit my friends, expecting that the chiefs would as readily grant me liberty to return to my friends, as to join ſome other diſtant Tribe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. Fluſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with this idea, I communicated my wiſhes to ſome choſen friends, they in my name went to the reſpective chiefs, who ſummoned a general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on the occaſion. After a lengthy debate, I obtained free liberty to be abſent for three years to viſit my friends, on my promiſe to return to them at the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the term, (extraordinaries excepted) allowing me four young men to attend me to the next Tribe.</p>
            <p>Having prepared myſelf by dreſſing in my beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, equiped with the beſt gun I ſhould chooſe, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:038422_0070_1011EA0D40E850A8"/>
every other neceſſary, I took my leave of my friends, not without great regret, apparent on both ſides—ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my friends collected to bid the friendly adieu; here I could not refrain ſhedding tears, eſpecially on leaving my truſty boy, who clung around me, begging that he might go with me; but our chiefs would not conſent, expecting he might be of ſervice to them in my abſence, as he had now become a conſiderable workman.</p>
            <p>With my waiters I departed in my canoe, ſteering for the main, which I ſoon recovered, and with our canoe, &amp;c. we directed our courſe through the woods to the neareſt water, as there is no travelling a great way through this country without canoes, by reaſon of the many lakes and rivers.</p>
            <p>After thus travelling fifteen days, we arrived on the borders of the next Tribe; here I made a halt, and ſent two of my waiters into their wigwams, with my paſs and recommendation from our Tribe, as was my conſtant practice to every Tribe through which I paſſed on my way to Canada. My waiters were kindly received, and obtained liberty to paſs through their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Tribe is called Scarreoſaw, which ſignifies the Mooſe Tribe.</note> The Tribe received me with peculiar ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowing my Tribe, and my rank among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:038422_0071_1011EA0F07999268"/>My tarry among them was but ſhort, puſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards home with all ſpeed. Here I diſmiſſed my waiters, who returned back to their homes; four others of the Scarreoſaw Tribe were allowed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the next Tribe, which was invariably prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by every Tribe through which I paſſed.</p>
            <p>Having procured ſome proviſion, with my new companions I took my leave and departed, obſerving a northern courſe. This Tribe at their own expence provided for me a canoe and proviſion. We travelled on for thirty-three days before we came to the next Tribe; each day on our encampment, at evening, we took care to cook (except when on the water) a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency for twenty-four hours, frequently killing fowl and other game as came in our way. I was received by this Tribe with every mark of friendſhip. Here I tarried a ſhort time.<note n="*" place="bottom">The name of this Tribe is Iſeneto, which ſignifies the Beaver Tribe.</note>
            </p>
            <p>During my ſtay among them, after diſmiſſing my former ſervants, this Tribe made the neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for my journey, in waiters, canoe and proviſion. In this people I obſerved a ſenſible difference between their language and ours, inſomuch that I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but very little of theirs, I muſt therefore be put to much difficulty in my travel, but the waiters who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:038422_0072_1011EA11B021CAE8"/>
waited on me, ſufficiently underſtood the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language to tranſact the neceſſary buſineſs, ſo that I found no great difficulty of being introduced to the ſeveral chiefs with whom I had occaſion to tranſact my neceſſary buſineſs—one Tribe ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the language of the next Tribe, and ſo on from Tribe to Tribe until my arrival within the limits of Canada. With my promiſes of future friendſhip with them, and not heſitating to mention my making them ſome valuable preſents on my return, (for they were informed by my waiters of the object of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) if ever put in practice, with the uſual ceremonies and neceſſaries I departed.</p>
            <p>On my way I croſſed a river very wide, the water appeared remarkably white, which I underſtood was cauſed by a bed of ſilver ore. Having travelled on in this manner for about nine months I came in ſight of a large pond, on the oppoſite ſide was a village, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of another Tribe. After croſſing this pond I ſent two of my men to the Tribe as I had practiced heretofore, my meſſengers after about an hour's abſence returned with the following ſtory, that on their arrival they enquired for the chief or head Indian of that Tribe, they were informed that the Tribe was under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a very old ſquaw, to her they delivered their meſſage, who replied that ſhe would receive me provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I could ſtand her trial of my courage as a good
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:038422_0073_1011EA16352E1708"/>
warrior,  ſaying that ſhe had a method whereby ſhe could diſtinguiſh a man of courage from a coward, that if I would conſent to ſtand the trial, ſhe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo far to receive me. On hearing this I entered the village, determining to ſtand trial, eagerly intent on my journey, determining to ſurmount every impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by the direction of my guides I ſoon found my lady's wigwam; on coming near, ſaw her ſtanding at the door with a piſtol in one hand, with the other hand ſhe caught hold of my right hand and diſcharged the piſtol, pointing it to my breaſt; at this I neither winked nor ſtarted back; ſhe ſaw my firmneſs, pulled me into her wigwam, entertained me and my attendance in the beſt manner according to their method of treating ſtrangers of the firſt rank.<note n="*" place="bottom">I learnt that it was her practice to treat all ſtrangers who wiſhed her patronage by trying them as above, if they flinched they were deprived of her good offices.</note> The next morning the old ſquaw informed me that ſhe would provide all the neceſſaries for my journey, I then diſmiſed the young men who attended me to this Tribe. The old Queen and I ſoon became acquainted, and in my broken way I communicated to her the motives for my undertaking this journey, and ſome ſketches of my former ſufferings,  to all which ſhe paid particular attention, and obſerving my ſprightly actions and warlike appearance, made me an offer of being one of her firſt officers and
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038422_0074_1011EA1AC54B29E0"/>
favourites, and that I ſhould marry her favourite daughter if I would tarry with her, with many other perſuaſive arguments. She endeavoured to prevent my purſuing my plan of returning to my friends, but all to no purpoſe—ſhe found that I would not tarry, made the neceſſary preparation for my departure, and in ſix days after my firſt acquaintance with her, I took my leave and departed, with four men, canoe and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. My joy increaſing on my nearer approach to my own country ſerved as wings to waft me on.</p>
            <p>I continued my journey from Tribe to Tribe in the ſame manner as before deſcribed. Some villages, the reſidence of each particular Tribe were diſtant one from the other, ſome forty, ſome fifty miles. On my way I croſſed a very large and rapid river, ſupplied by three remarkable large ſprings on the ſide of a large moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not far diſtant from the place of the river where I paſſed over. I cheerfully went on with my young men, canoe, &amp;c. for about one month after paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this river, I travelled on, and on the 19th day of June 1787, I arrived at Detroit after eleven years abſence.</p>
            <p>Although now among my countrymen, I but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed myſelf for ſeveral days, having been ſo long abſent I had almoſt forgot my French language, and the inhabitants took me for an Indian; however,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038422_0075_1011EA1DC80DA158"/>
one day I entered the ſtore belonging to a Mr. Baibie, his clerk attentively viewed me, ſaw ſomething in my countenance different from the countenances of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian companions, aſked me in French, if I was all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian? I anſwered him in the negative; on his queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me further, I informed him, though in a broken manner, of my misfortunes among the Indians, and that my father lived near Quebec, on my leaving him in the firſt of the year 1776; the clerk immediately called Mr. Baibie and informed him who I was, of my ſufferings, whether bound, &amp;c. This worthy man mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the account I had given of myſelf, took partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular notice of me, and gave me proviſion during my tarry at Detroit. Here I diſmiſſed my friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, the Indians who came with me to Detroit; they bid me an affectionate farewel and departed for their homes. Mr. Baibie furniſhed me with money to pay my paſſage over the Lakes St. Clair and Erie, I heartily thanked my benefactor, took my leave of him after I had ſpent ten days at Detroit, and departed, homewards bound, and arrived at Lake Erie in a few days Here I tarried but one day, from thence I went on by the way of Niagara Falls to Lake Ontario; here I tarried a few days, waiting for a paſſage over this Lake. I was much reduced, having ſold what trifles I could ſpare, at length hearing of a ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel arriving from Cataraque, I immediately went on board, and to my great joy, found the commander to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038422_0076_1011EA1FC0D16190"/>

            <p>While at Cataraque, being in a lonely, diſconſolate ſtate, deſtitute of money and friends, I met with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Geroge M'Lone, a merchant of probity and large property.</note> to whom I communicated my wants; he, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my diſtreſs, at once became my friend, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of compaſſion and large property, he took off my uncouth dreſs (Indian faſhion) and gave me one agreeably to the dreſs of the people with whom I now reſided—here I tarried for one month under the eye and aſſiſtance of my invaluable friend and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor—after which, as above related, I (my new dreſs giving me ſome uneaſineſs) aukwardly ſtrolled about for ſome time; at length finding a veſſel bound to Quebec, I engaged my paſſage thither, and after four days arrived at the city, the ſight of which gave me inexpreſſible joy.

fully known, but to them I was as a ſtranger—my joy on ſeeing them, many of whom being my former inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates at ſchool and juvenile excurſions, overflowed to that degree, that I could not reſtrain, but in a flood of voluntary tears of joy I ſtopped them, and caught them by the arm, with a ſobing heart, in broken French cried out, do you not know me? I am Charley, your once beloved and faithful companion in ſorrow and joy; I am he who you ſaw wontonly torn from your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from the embraces of an indulgent, tender father, and by the command of a tyrannical ruler, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly given to the Savages of the wilderneſs, with them I have encountered many dangers, ſurmounted unheard of (by you) trials; I have ſought you with weariſome ſteps, and here in this beloved, peaceful city I have found you. On their recogniſing me, they with open arms received and embraced me, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned friendſhip, one and all invited me to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective dwellings.</p>
            <p>With my quondam, boſom companions, I tarried but a few days, enjoying their ſincere congratulations on my ſafe return to the city, wherein my firſt young pulſe began to beat; my anxiety of ſeeing my dear father<note n="*" place="bottom">On my arrival at Quebec, I found that my father ſtill lived at St. Nicola.</note> and family, urged my departure.</p>

I was eager to inform her of the cauſe of my viſit; I therefore began to converſe with her, as who is the maſter and owner of this houſe? is he within? or gone ſome diſtance from home? to which ſhe anſwered, this houſe is owned and occupied by Mr. Louis Ruſoe D'Eres, who is now in his ſhop hard by; I then queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her about the owner's family? ſhe informed me that his family was but ſmall, having heretofore had a large one; that but three children were left, ſhe being one; that the family had been unfortunate, having parted with two ſons much beloved, one was gone to France to perfect his trade, being a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

to come. Thus I went on until an unexpected letter from Montreal marr'd all my comforts.</p>
            <p>Two Indian chiefs arrived at my father's with a letter from Colonel Campbell<note n="*" place="bottom">An officer of diſtinction at Montreal, and overſeer of the Engliſh trade with the Indians.</note> at Montreal. On their coming I was much alarmed, knowing them to belong to a Tribe through which I paſſed, when on my return to Canada. I communicated this to my father, who was much troubled and adviſed me to take no notice of his letter, which was to invite me to repair to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, there to undertake to go as interpreter among the Indians to negociate the buſineſs for the Engliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. My father anxiouſly enquired of the chiefs what Mr. Campbell wanted of me? why he had ſent for me? they replied, they knew nothing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I hearing of Colonel Campbell's gentleman-like character did not heſitate, but with the chiefs ſet off for Montreal.</p>
            <p>On my arrival Mr. Campbell informed me, that he was in want of an interpreter to go with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,  the Indians recogniſing my perſon, claimed me as having received many favours from them, when among them. On this I began to fear ſome trap was layed to carry me back to the Indians.</p>

               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:038422_0083_1011EA35C41B50B8"/>The very idea of returning among them was ſufficient to forbid my undertaking, I therefore diſcovered a backwardneſs; on which Mr. Campbell uſed many perſuaſive arguments to gain my conſent; as that I ſhould be allowed captain's pay with rations, and other priviledges annexed to that office; that thoſe Indians came for this purpoſe three hundred miles, and could not be denied; that the trade with them was of the greateſt conſequence to the Britiſh nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">This trade with the Indians conſiſted in furs of various kinds, large quantities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which were annually exported to England.</note> All this Mr. Campbell ſuppoſed was a ſufficient inducement for me to engage in this important miſſion, and propoſed that I ſhould take the oath of office and of allegiance to the Britiſh King, &amp;c. &amp;c. This ſenſibly touched me, at once realiſing my former treatment from that King's officers. I was ſo much irritated that I ſhew my reſentment in words, (perhaps too ſevere) this the Colonel reſented as pointed at him and his King; he called a guard to take me into cuſtody—this incenſed me but the more; I was ſo far from being intimidated, that I even damned him, and defied his guard. The Indians being now abſent, I turned my back, ran to the river, jumped into a boat, which fortunately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for my eſcape. In this boat I croſſed the St. Lawrence and with all ſpeed made towards St. Nicol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:038422_0084_1011EA3A66E30460"/>Colonel Campbell immediately diſpatched a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with a letter to governor Carlton at Quebec, containing an account<note n="*" place="bottom">As I afterwards learnt from Montreal, and that he conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered me as engaged in the Britiſh ſervice.</note> of my eſcape, and the neceſſity of apprehending me. This meſſenger arrived at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec nearly as ſoon as I arrived at St. Nicola, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days after my arrival, a ſerjeant with his guard properly equiped, came to my father's houſe in queſt of their prey—on hearing this I armed myſelf, went out to them, and informed them that I was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be taken alive, that I would kill the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſhould touch me—this brought on a parley, they informed me that they did not wiſh to injure me, that they had no orders for this; on this they retired to a neighbouring houſe, which gave me an opportun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to reflect on my ſituation and mode of my future conduct.</p>
            <p>On a mature deliberation of my preſent ſituation I thought it beſt to decamp,<note n="†" place="bottom">As I expected another viſit from them, and the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſucceſs.</note> and puſh for the United States, hoping there to find a ſecure aſylum from the Britiſh. This plan I communicated to my father, and to ſome few of my beſt friends—this they conſented to reluctantly, in hopes of my ſafe return to them at

ſome future period. Having their conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, I prepared myſelf as well as my time and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would allow.</p>
            <p>I left my father's family, directed my courſe to St. Johns, where I ſafely arrived; here I procured a paſs to Onion Rriver, Vermont State, and arrived without much difficulty, and let myſelf to General Allen, with whom I wrought one month; he not having any further employ for me, I then engaged with a Mr. Boynton an innkeeper for two months, to work at the blackſmith's and farmer's buſineſs; I alſo wrought at my trade with a Mr. Collins.</p>
            <p>One Evening at Mr. Boynton's, I found two men<note n="*" place="bottom">White and Chapin.</note> who came from Montreal, bound to Hatfield and Northampton—I ſuppoſing myſelf to be at too ſhort a diſtance from Mr. Campbell, and that he might by ſome means find out my place of abode; I therefore engaged a paſſage with the travellers in their carriage, intending to puſh further on towards Boſton or New-York.</p>
            <p>On our arrival at Northampton, they generouſly gave me half the ſum agreed on for my paſſage, having paid an equal proportion of our expence on the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I endeavoured to enter on ſome employment in

this town, but found none—parted with my two friends and left the town, having Boſton in view—travelled on the road leading thither; at length coming into Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, I again offered my ſervice, but finding none at my trade—at length I entered the houſe of a G—m M—e, and enquired if they wanted to hire a good hand to aſſiſt them in their domeſtic buſineſs? on my putting my queſtion, a rough looking, hard fac'd old man,<note n="*" place="bottom">This man I found to be the head of this family, and that he ruled it as with a rod of Iron.</note> ſetting by the fire place, turned to me, queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned me of my good qualities and ſkill in work? I anſwered that I was acquainted with the blackſmith's buſineſs, that I alſo had ſome knowledge of farming, and of other domeſtic employments, that I had ſought employment at my trade, but of late found none, that I was willing on proper encouragement to engage in farming,  to which he liſtened, and replied that he was not a mechanic, but that he was a farmer and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help; I ſaid I ſhould be glad to engage with him if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable: he made me an offer, which although ſmall wages I accepted, and covenanted to tarry with him ſeven months. Here opened a new ſcene, being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this new employ; however, I made the beſt of a bad bargain, and exerted every nerve to pleaſe my employer, but my attempts were fruitleſs. He treated me with rigor; turning me out early, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

me late in the meaneſt and moſt arduous labour; turning me from his table into the kitching among his negroes, and other menial ſervants, with whom I drew an equal ſhare of coarſe and rough food—at night I was obliged to turn in with a boy who invariably ſtuck to his rule of wetting his couch every night, not with tears only, but with a liquid, the Engliſh name of which being ſo diſagreeable I forbear to pronounce, although a monoſyllable. In this diſagreeable ſtate I wrought with him through the ſeven months, for which I enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. My employer treated me thus roughly thinking to oblige me<note n="*" place="bottom">As I afterwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With much difficulty I recovered my wages of this churl; who anſwered to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

After this I let myſelf out to work at my trade for fifteen months with a Mr. Abbot,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Abbot lived in Brookfield.</note> who carried on the ſmith's buſineſs with diſpatch, and to good advantage. My tarry with this man was moſt agreeable, he and his family treated me in every reſpect with humanity, and on all occaſions with tenderneſs. Here I became acquainted not only with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038422_0088_1011EA44D36C03F0"/>
of this, but of the neighbouring towns alſo. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the expiration of my term I engaged for with Mr. Abbot, I found an opening at Spencer, a neighbouring town ſuitable for my buſineſs—thither, on the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the term I engaged for, after receiving my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I removed, and with ſuitable encouragement ſet up for myſelf; ſoon became acquainted with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and gained much cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Thus ſeated, I began to turn my mind upon the comforts of a conjugal life, having previouſly gone through my portion of ſorrow and fatigue. I became acquainted with a female<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs Hannah Prouty, a maiden lady of good repute, and a branch of a reſpectable family.</note> of this town, to whom I made my addreſſes, and in a proper time, agreeably to the cuſtom of this country, made her my wife—this took place Auguſt 19th, 1794. In this town of Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer I tarried thirteen months after marriage, enjoying all the comforts of a domeſtic life, ſurrounded with many friends, formed by my new conjugal connection.</p>
            <p>This town is an inland ſituation, made up principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of farmers—my unaccuſtomedneſs to work ſuitably for them, led me to conſider this town not as a ſuitable place for my future reſidence and employ; I therefore fought for a town better ſituated for ſuch buſineſs, as I was moſt acquainted with and beſt calculated to purſue.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038422_0089_1011EA47B5ADDA10"/>
I made all the enquiry in my power for ſuch a town; at length, hearing much ſaid of a northern State,<note n="*" place="bottom">New-Hampſhire.</note> that buſineſs was carried on there to great advantage, I reſolved to try my luck in that quarter: with this view I left Spencer—travelled until I came to a town which on my firſt entrance agreeably ſtruck my mind— here I ſought employ, and luckily found a man<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. J.

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intimate and made him my confidential friend: he having learnt the hiſtory of my paſt life, and future wiſhes, encouraged me to ſet up my buſineſs in the town, by whoſe friendly advice and aſſiſtance I made an attempt, and found it ſucceſsful in gaining cuſtom and credit.</p>
            <p>Soon after my ſettlement in my new and laſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſent for my yokefellow, with whom I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>MUCH hath been ſaid and publiſhed (by the learned) on the origin of the aborigines of this country at different periods, ſince the firſt diſcovery and ſettlement of America, by Europeans. However plauſible their hypothetical mode of reaſoning may be, nothing as yet hath ever appeared ſufficiently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive on that ſubject, and I conceive never can be, as the materials neceſſary for compiling an authentic hiſtory never can be obtained; the natives not having it in their power to give any account from whence their anceſtors ſprang, nor even to give any account of matters that have taken place in modern times any further back, than by ſaying that ſuch and ſuch matters, as battles fought by them and victory on their ſide ſucceeded, &amp;c. ſo many moons paſt, (as they count by moons that alternately ſucceed after ſuch events.)</p>
            <p>Any further attempts, therefore, to trace Indian chronology ſo far as to reduce it to any tolerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſatisfaction, muſt be fruitleſs; however, I leave that to thoſe who are pleaſed with the ſtudy of artiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:038422_0091_1011EA4EDD8BF318"/>
and who are fond of drawing poſitive conſequences from (as they ſay) circumſtantial premiſes.</p>
            <p>As my reſidence among thoſe Indians to whom I was given was for a conſiderable length of time, the account I propoſe to give of them may be depended on, having been an eye witneſs to many of their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both in war and peace, myſelf being accounted, by them, as one, and that of no ſmall conſequence, both in the cabinet and in the field of Mars.</p>
            <p>That the reader may have a better idea of their manners, cuſtoms, &amp;c. &amp;c. I ſhall give it in chapters, as by the following ſequal may be read.</p>
            <p>My acquaintance with the Tribes of Indians in the vicinity of the iſland of Scanyawtauragahrooote, was but ſmall, although with that Tribe ten years. I ſhall therefore confine myſelf to as particular a deſcription of the Tribe, their manners, &amp;c. with whom I reſided. That Tribe was the moſt numerous (as I was informed by their chiefs) of any in that part of America, and moſt warlike, as I often realiſed this during my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, not having known them once to fail in their warlike feats, either defenſive or offenſive.</p>

               <p>THEY are in general tall and ſtrait limbed. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed perſon is rarely to be found among them. Their ſkin is of a copper colour—their eyes are large and very black, and of a piercing ſight, diſcovering objects, though ſmall, at a great diſtance, inſomuch, that they ſeldom fail of ſtriking the mark aimed at by the guide of the feathered arrow. Their teeth are well ſet, and ſeldom fail, even in old age—their breath ſweet as the gentle zephyr of an unclouded morning of May —their cheek bones are rather raiſed, more ſo in the female than the male; the former are more fleſhy, and ſhorter than the latter. The hair of both ſexes is very long, coarſe, and of the blackeſt hue; the females pride themſelves much in the length and ſtraitneſs of theirs; for this purpoſe they frequently apply Bear's greaſe, and a certain powder pulveriſed from the bark of elm or brown aſh; thus prepared, they hang to the extremity of their hair lead weights, which ſerves to facilitate the growth.</p>
               <p>The Indians are careful to prevent the growth of any hair upon any part of their body, the hairy ſcalp only excepted. The males extract their beards, &amp;c.

with nippers made of wire, procured from the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards.</p>
               <p>The males of all ranks, from the warrior to the pappooſe, are marked with the ſun on the outſide of the right leg, the moon and ſeven ſtars on the inſide of the ſame: thoſe of the males who have diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their extraordinary exertions in war, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acquired great names, are diſtinguiſhed from others by the ſingular dreſs of the head. The hair is plucked from the head, except a ſmall portion on the back part the bigneſs of a man's hand; the hair thus left on is permitted to grow to a great length, and ornamented with ſilver broaches and feathers of various colours, from the crown of the head to the extremity of the hair. Their blankets alſo, are of the firſt quality, and ornamented with ſilver claſps; the firſt, which is fixed at the nape of the neck behind, is as large as a crown piece, and are placed equidiſtant in a ſtrait line to the bottom of the blanket. Each claſp or broach (for 'tis immaterial which, juſt as it ſuits the hero) proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably decreaſe in ſize from the uppermoſt to the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, which is fixed at the loweſt extremity, and not larger than a piece of ſilver coin of the ſmalleſt value. The perſons thus decorated, are reſpected by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty at feaſts, tournaments, and all public games, as the nobility and gentry of European nations are by the peaſantry.</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:038422_0094_1011EA58F5C82C58"/>The Indians of both ſexes are fond of paint, and uſe it on all occaſions. The males in going to war paint their faces of different colours, the right ſide black, the left red, ſometimes in chequers of various colours, as black, red, green, yellow, &amp;c. The females paint a ſmall portion of each cheek of vermillion, at ſome particular ſeaſons their arms and necks, their breaſt alſo they pay particular attention to.

               <p>The common dreſs of the males conſiſts of a blank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, clout and ſhirt, unconfined at the riſts or collar, this would confine their arms ſo much as to prevent any great exertions of the body; their legs and feet are covered with ſtockings of Beaver ſkins, and mogaſons of Mooſe hide poorly dreſſed. Their blankets are carefully thrown over their ſhoulders, holding the upper end by two corners; with a truſty knife in one hand, pipe, tobacco pouch, &amp;c. in the other, they walk about the village; but in their dances, they throw off the blanket.</p>
               <p>The females wear a covering, ſome of leather, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of linnen, when they can procure it from the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards; this often happens, which covers the peticoats<note n="*" place="bottom">Their peticoats are made of Mooſe hide or coarſe cloth, when attainable.</note>

               <p>The manner of conſtructing their wigwams hath already, in the memoirs, been ſufficiently deſcribed. Their utenſils for domeſtic convenience, are in general tolerable, ſuch as braſs kettles, both large and ſmall, as occaſion requires. Knives are ſeldom uſed but in ſcalping and carving on wood, making wooden la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, &amp;c. Their veſſels uſed at feaſts are wooden diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and bowls; into which the prepared food is dipped by wooden ladles. Every member of a family or collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitude, is furniſhed with a wooden ſpoon tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly executed.</p>
               <p>Their other furniture conſiſts of beds, formed by piling up ſkins of Bear, Beaver and Buffalo, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two feet from the ground, on which their beds, without order or diſtinction, are placed. The beds of the parents are indiſcriminately prepared, ſo that the parents' lodging one night, often becomes the lodging of the ſons or daughters the ſucceeding night, and ſo on juſt as it happens. A perfect harmony, however, prevails through each family, both at their meals and retirements.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. OF THEIR MANNERS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE males in general live an idle, careleſs life, never undertaking buſineſs in a domeſtic line, leaving that to the females, who not only execute every kind of manual labour at home, but are obliged to travel into the woods and bring home the game, whether great or ſmall, when obtained by their huſbands.</p>
               <p>Each family hath a particular ſpot of ground aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it by the chiefs, whereon to raiſe corn, beans,  all which is tilled by the females of each family, and in autumn, whatever grows thereon, whether corn or any other vegetable, the profits of their labour is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſecured, ſo that the males are left to their eaſe, while at home, realiſing that the wife is truly an help meat.</p>
               <p>What adds much to the arduous toil of the women already deſcribed, is, they are obliged to carry with them into the corn field ſuch infants as depend on the mother's breaſt for ſupport. Thoſe children are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laſhed to the concave ſide of ſome thick bark, or to ſome piece of wood formed for that purpoſe. From the wigwam to the field the tender mother carries her

babe ſlung to her back; when arrived, ſhe ſeeks for ſome ſure and truſty prop, to which ſhe ties the riſing hope of her family in ſuch a manner, and in ſuch a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as by the gentle wind and melodious notes of airy ſongſters, the child ſecurely ſleeps until exhauſted nature rouſes the body, which by its infantile cries ſoon brings the nurſe, who from the yielding breaſt ſupplies the calls of nature with ambroſial treat; this (drawn through canals unimpaired by time, or the more dangerous aſſaults of intemperance, long multiplied and handed down from mother to daughter) affords a liquor at once nouriſhing and ſalubrious. The tender offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring therefore is reared, corporally, active and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the young and expanding mind, the better part muſt have an almoſt unbounded latitude for growth when aſſiſted by the more accompliſhed artiſt; for want of this, the young ſavage dwindles down to as abject a ſtate of uſeleſſneſs as the long cultivated debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The males are careful not to intrude into the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males company at particular times, when obliged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to retire—during the continuance of certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical evacuations to which the females are peculiarly incident, or in the more important hour of nature's ſtruggle into life.</p>

Whenever a woman viſits her female neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe enters the wigwam without reſerve, and with an open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unreſerved frankneſs, peculiar to a people uncloged with unmeaning complimentary ſentences, (never to be found in female companies of the more polite, whoſe viſits are managed with futile and evaſive words to little or no purpoſe, and of no more conſequence nor edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, than whether a cat, to be a good mouſer, ſhould be black or white) the converſation turns upon ſubjects peculiarly adapted for domeſtic uſe and nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al profit, ſuch as the beſt method to cultivate the ſoil in proper ſeaſons—to rear their tender offspring in the beſt manner for future uſefulneſs, both in the cabinet and in warlike feats—teach them in their reſpective lines, both male and female, the beſt and ſafeſt mode of purſuit, which if perſevered in, will lead them on to honor and reſpectability, both in their own nation and with the Tribes of the vicinity.</p>
               <p>Such is the conduct of the reſpective nurſes towards their ſeveral charges, leaving the management of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concerns, more weighty and more important for national protection to the males, whoſe buſineſs it is to plan and execute all matters tending to peace or war.

               <p>When the moon does not appear they ſay it is dead; when it firſt appears they ſay it is come to life again. They make no further diviſion of time into weeks, hours,  but when conveying the idea of a day they call it a ſleep.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. THEIR MODE OF GOVERNMENT, MANNER OF CONVEY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING INTELLIGENCE TO OTHER TRIBES IN ALLIANCE WITH THEM, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE Scanyawtauragahrooote Tribe being very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and warlike, particular care is taken, both in domeſtic and diſtant operations, when called ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately as a nation, or in junction with ſome other Tribe. The perſons who are choſen to conduct as chiefs (for they are conſidered as ſeparate departments) act ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arately. The one who conducts the operations of war and peace, is one who has long been approved
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:038422_0102_1011EA6F5936A2B8"/>
in warlike feats, for he riſes purely by merit, is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is implicitly obeyed, no one ever daring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his mandates; but may, when called upon by the chief, give his opinion on the beſt and ſureſt mode of advance or retreat.</p>
               <p>The perſon who conducts their internal police, is one who hath by long and often tried abilities approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf one of ſound and judicious abilities; moſt likely to govern without auſterity, partiality or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice whatever he undertakes to decide upon. He pays particular attention to the charge alledged againſt the offender; never admits circumſtantial evidence as having any weight, either in condemning or acquiting the accuſed. All the evidence pro and con, is impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially weighed, and without favour or affection decided upon. Thoſe of the males who are diſtinguiſhed as above deſcribed, are ever elected whenever a vacancy requires a new choice, never admitting of hereditary ſucceſſions.</p>
               <p>In their domeſtic government, a number of perſons are elected to execute matters of leſs conſequence; as to put into execution certain mandates iſſued by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, and are often called upon as aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to the ſupreme judge, in trying and deciding mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:038422_0103_1011EA738EDE2ED0"/>Whenever occaſion requires to ſend intelligence to diſtant Tribes, 'tis done by arranging a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beads of different colours, in ſuch a manner as to convey the intended idea of intelligence. The bead which is to begin the firſt word is ſtopped up at its eye, and is of a larger ſize. A number of beads of the ſame colour are placed in a direct line to the right, and ſo on, alternately placing different coloured and ſized beads ſo as to convey the whole of the propoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. The perſons thus informing, and thus receiving intelligence, are ſufficiently inſtructed ſo as to convey and receive certain and infalible intelligence.</p>
               <p>Soon after the death or reſignation of any one of the commanders in chief, the whole of the males aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for a new choice, which is made in open air, and in a convenient place for that purpoſe. The national pipe is brought on, and a large block is fixed in the ground at a ſmall diſtance, on which the candidate is placed, croſslegged (for they ſet up but one at a time.) The matter is determined by the number of perſons who alternately ſmoke at the pipe: if a large majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uſe the pipe at this time, 'tis determined in favour of the firſt candidate, if otherwiſe, a ſecond is ſet up as the firſt, and the Tribe proceed as before, and ſo on until one is choſen by a majority of ſmokers preſent.</p>
               <p>Whenever a perſon is choſen, proclamation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made of the perſon, his age and qualities.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038422_0104_1011EA76C7C4A9A8"/>
If he accepts the office, all perſons without diſtinction encircle him; he then makes a lengthy ſpeech, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his acceptance and determination ſtrictly to adhere to their national laws, and his determiation inviolately to hand down to his ſucceſſor all the rights and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies peculiar to their nation. The multitude are then diſmiſſed. The ſachem exerciſes all the authority given him as handed down by his predeceſſor, until his power ceaſeth, which is at his death or reſignation only.</p>
               <p>As it rarely happens that any one reſigns his office, electioneering but ſeldom takes place among them. It often happens that the young warriors are called upon to aſſiſt in council on matters of war or peace. They attentively liſten to the arguments for or againſt any propoſed queſtion, never ſpeaking on the ſubject; but by ſaying I approve or diſapprove, and that will do or will not do, juſt as it ſuits him. The whole debate ends by the largeſt number of anſwers as above.</p>
               <p>The war and civil departments are by their prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtitution<note n="*" place="bottom">Their code of laws are handed down inviolate from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration to generation, and are the ſame that their anceſtors slave to.</note> ſo formed, that one never interferes or claſhes with the other.

to the laws formed to ſupport and to carry into effect, the mandates iſſued by its particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief.</p>
               <p>Such is the power of long habit, no one of inferior rank ever ſhews the leaſt reluctance in performing whatever is in his power, ſparing no pains day nor night, but cheerfully executes all orders properly authenticated, even at the hazard of his life; ever keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in his mind, that to preſerve his own life and property, 'tis neceſſary to dedicate his own power and time to the national welfare. However, it ſome times (though rarely) happens that one or two will reſent and endeavour to fruſtrate the purpoſes and decrees of the civil magiſtrate, as was the caſe on my trial. Whenever ſuch conduct is diſcovered, the offenders are puniſhed with death, and that in a moſt excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manner, unleſs prevented by the delinquents leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nation for ever after.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. OF THEIR FEASTS AND DANCES.</head>
               <p>FEASTING and dancing, among the Indians, are accounted the moſt honorable and ſatisfactory paſt time. Nothing is wanted, in their power to furniſh, on public feaſts, to render the entertainment moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:038422_0106_1011EA7B30857688"/>The animal food they uſe principally, is of the Buffalo, Bear, Beaver and Racoon, with many other ſmall meats, as their appetite may direct their choice.</p>
               <p>Whenever a public feaſt is propoſed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the civil department, preparation is immediately made in ſome airy and convenient ſpot; for the whole Tribe, male and female, aſſemble.</p>
               <p>A certain number of cooks and waiters prepare the food, by boiling Bear, Buffalo, Beaver, Deer and Mooſe—but above all, the tail of the Beaver is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſerved up to the commanders in chief. With this variety of meat is added Indian corn and beans, all boiled together in ſuch a manner that it is eat, both fleſh and vegetables, with ſpoons only.</p>
               <p>The feaſt being prepared, the multitude aſſemble and form a circle on the ground croſslegged—in the centre the national pipe is placed, in a manner already deſcribed. The two chiefs ſit near the pipe on blocks croſslegged. A particular attention is paid to them by waiters of diſtinction. As ſoon as may be, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected citizens are ſerved by waiters placed on different quarters, with the food in wooden bowls, each one ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arately—to each a wooden ſpoon is added. By a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſign given by the maſter of ceremonies, every gueſt begins at one and the ſame time, ever bearing in mind never to crack a bone which may fall to his ſhare, and to eat all contained in his diſh.</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:038422_0107_1011D06597E8C210"/>The feaſt ended, they all riſe and carry towards a large fire, (prepared for the purpoſe) his bowl, into which the bony contents is flung, and there left to conſume. This done, the bowls and ſpoons are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſecured in ſome convenient department, always ready for future uſe.</p>
               <p>The aſſembled multitude then ſurround the great pipe, and (led on by the commanders) alternately ſmoke, which further cements the nation. Dancing now takes place, which is performed in equal diviſional parties, led on by each reſpective maſter, with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual number of muſicians, each furniſhed with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of muſic already deſcribed, or in want thereof, with a braſs kettle turned bottom upwards. The muſic being well performed, ſerves to animate the dancers, and adds much to the entertainment: each dancer carefully obſerves time, as beaten by the players.</p>
               <p>After dancing for ſome conſiderable length of time, a new ſcene takes place, which begins by ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed warrior, who ſteps forward and in a loud, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment voice, harangues the multitude to the following purpoſe, viz.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. OF THEIR HUNTING, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE ſupplies of the more ſubſtantial part of their food being obtained by hunting, 'tis neceſſary that a very conſiderable portion of their time ſhould be taken up in this moſt neceſſary article. Great care therefore is taken that every riſing generation of the males ſhould be well inſtructed in this art.</p>
               <p>They are early taught the uſe of the bow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by ſhooting at marks fixed at a proper diſtance from the archer. This is daily practiced until the young pupil becomes a complete markſman, not inferior to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:038422_0110_1011EA84CBB5E8D8"/>
his inſtructor. They are alſo practiced in wielding the tomahawk, which is peculiarly ſerviceable in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The hunting ſeaſon approaching, peparation is made for that purpoſe by fixing their traps, bows, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The firſt hunting ſeaſon commenceth about the firſt of November annually, and continues with but ſmall intervals during the winter, until March: after this month, and ſo on during the ſummer, animals of every ſpecies are of leſs value, whether for food or cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The quadrupeds they principally aim at in hunting, are the Buffalo, Deer, Mooſe, Bear, Otter, Beaver, Raccoon and the Porcupine. At this time the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence peculiar to the hunters during the ſummer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is loſt, and an active, perſevering, indefatigable ſpirit pervades the whole.</p>
               <p>They are ſagacious in diſcovering the retreat of the animal they propoſe to hunt, and are equally ſo in the means uſed to deſtroy it. They can eaſily diſcover the footſteps of the Beaſts they are in purſuit of, although imperceptible by every other traveller, and with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty follow their prey through the pathleſs wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Their particular movements on this occaſion, are by a council in the previous ſummer determined upon,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:038422_0111_1011EA865824D8E0"/>
as well as the number each party ſhall conſiſt of (for they hunt in different companies, and purſue different routs.)</p>
               <p>Their method of hunting the Buffalo hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been deſcribed.—Previous to each company's ſetting out on their different routs, agreeably to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the council, every perſon belonging to each company prepares himſelf by faſting three days; during which, he neither taſtes of food nor even water, nor ſuffers his dog, who he propoſes to accompany him, to eat any thing. During this ſelf denial they appear alert and happy.</p>
               <p>The reaſons they give for this faſting, is, that it keeps off the evil ſpirit, and renders their enterpriſes moſt propitious; that it cauſeth them to dream what courſe to purſue in order to obtain the beſt and greateſt quantity of game, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All the prerequiſites being made ready, each party ſets out under the direction of ſome long experienced hunter, taking with them their dogs and a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young archers.</p>
               <p>Various methods are practiced to hunt the Deer: ſometimes by ſhooting him with the arrow, ſometimes by knocking him in head with the tomahawk when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken in deep ſnow; but the moſt effectual method
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:038422_0112_1011EA8964C53D10"/>
is by forming a triangular fence encloſing a ſmall piece of meadow, to which they reſort.<note n="*" place="bottom">Their haunts are eaſily diſcovered by their trampling down the ſnow in queſt of food, &amp;c.</note> This fence is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of pliable poles interwoven between poſts ſet up at a proper diſtance one from the other. Within this triangular fence ſnares are prepared from the rhine of certain weeds, not unlike the nettle of this country, ſpontaneouſly growing with them, and are ſo fixed that the animal coming within this encloſure cannot retreat, but is eaſily taken.</p>
               <p>Any number diſcovered in the woods are by the hunters and their dogs put in motion and drove on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til caught by the ſnares. This method is leſs expenſive and moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>The Mooſe is hunted by firſt diſcovering his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the ſnow, which the hunters with weary and perſevering ſteps purſue until the animals are overtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in their retreats (for they herd together, ſometimes a large number, juſt as it happens) which is called the Mooſeyard, formed by them in trampling down the ſnow, a ſpace ſufficiently large to contain the aſſembled num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Here they tarry until all the ſmall branches of the ſurrounding trees are entirely lopped off by the Mooſe, or driven from thence by the hunters, their never failing enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:038422_0113_1011EA8BF1521170"/>'Tis impoſſible truly to deſcribe the agility and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance of the hunters when in perſuit of their game; neither mountains, valleys, ſwamps, thickets, torrents, rivers, or even lakes retard their progreſs, but march ſtrait forward in the moſt direct line they poſſibly can; ever having it in their power to help themſelves with food of ſmall game, as the woods every where plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupply.</p>
               <p>The Bear is caught frequently by ſetting traps, for they have no particular place of reſort, unleſs when in their dens, which are generally the hollow of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtub of ſome old tree, or under ſome roots of windfalls; they are therefore but accidentally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>The method of ſetting traps, is firſt to find ſome old tree moſt likely for them to repair to for winter quarters: into this tree about ſix inches from the ground a hole is made, into which a large plug is driven, and at ten feet in a direct line a ſtake is fixed in the ground of about ſix feet in height from the plug fixed in the tree, to the top of the ſtake a heavy pole is ſlightly laid on, and on either ſide from the tree to the ſtake wood is piled up in ſuch a manner as to prevent the Bear's retreat, but at the entrance a piece of fiſh is fixed on the end of the pole as near the plug as may be, which allures the hungry animal to the bait, and as ſoon as
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038422_0114_1011EA8FC7815748"/>
touched, the pole which is ſufficiently large and heavy, falls, and at once cruſhes the unwary Bear.</p>
               <p>The Otter being an amphibious animal, is caught principally by ſetting ſteel traps in the water ſufficiently deep as to cover the trap ſo as not to be diſcovered by the animal. The trap is baited by fiſh of any kind, the more ſtale the better. Near the trap a ſtake is fixed, and ſmeared with the entrails of fiſh, the more putrified the greater the attraction. The trap and ſtake thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, great care muſt be taken to allure the Otter to the trap; for this purpoſe the hunter in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trap, goes a circuitous rout to a point about one fourth of a mile from the bait, then rubs over the bottoms of his mogaſons tainted fiſh, then in his mog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſons, travels on in a ſtrait line to the trap; this leaves on the ground a ſcent ſufficiently ſtrong for the purpoſe: this done, the mogaſons are taken off, and the hunter, barefooted, in a new rout returns fully ſatisfied with the ſufficiency of his trap and precaution, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail.</p>
               <p>The Beaver is alſo an amphibious animal, and of the greateſt conſequence to the hunter, as well for food as for clothing and bedding. The tail properly dreſſed is accounted the moſt delicious of any meat whatever, and ſought for at all public entertainments. The fleſh of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038422_0115_1011EA9151C95458"/>
the Beaver is alſo much valued by the Indians<note n="*" place="bottom">This animal affords the much valued Caſtor, famed for its medicinal qualities.</note>—the fur not only ſerves for clothing, &amp;c. but is the moſt valuable article for trade with the Spaniards of South America, with whom our Indians barter for ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as are not to be found among themſelves.</p>
               <p>This ſpecies of animals are by many conſidered as under a particular mode of government, not unlike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm, moſt ſagacious, and not only endeavour to prevent the aſſaults of the hunters, but alſo intruſions of animals leſs formidable. Nothing however can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their regular and artful mode of conſtructing hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itations exactly ſuited for their convenience and comfort, but more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>As thoſe animals ever herd together, every precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken, by them, to prevent being taken by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; for this purpoſe they are careful to ſix guards at proper intervals. The truſty guard give the earlieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the community, who immediately ſecreet themſelves in a retreat beyond the ſkill of the intruder to penetrate. Every precaution therefore is neceſſary to be uſed by the hunter to become ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Many methods are alternately tried, ſome with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery prerequiſite, however fail; but the moſt approved mode is by ſetting ſteel traps.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:038422_0116_1011EA942931FD70"/>In catching every other amphibious animal with ſteel traps, ſome bait particularly ſuited to allure the devoted quadruped, is cautiouſly fixed to each trap; but in catching the Beaver a quite different method is uſed.</p>
               <p>The hunter on finding their dam, carefully ſurveys its extent and particular conſtruction, and at ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place in the dam makes a ſmall breach on the upper ſide, next to the ſtagnated water, fixes his trap nine inches below the ſurface; this ſerves to catch the oldeſt Beavers firſt, and by this mode the greater part of the community are taken, for the old ones finding the water lower above the dam, cautiouſly ſend out the youngeſt to ſearch the breach, and by reaſon of their ſhort legs ſwim over the trap without harm; upon this the full grown ones venture out and ſwim towards the breach, and are taken. As ſoon as the oldeſt ones are taken, the trap is placed nearer the ſurface of the water, proportional to the length of the young Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's legs, they alſo are in like manner taken.</p>
               <p>Many traps are fixed as above, juſt as the hunters think beſt, and all are fixed in the day time. At night the over matched animals leave their retreats to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine their dam, and to mend whatever breaches are made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:038422_0117_1011EA972F902D90"/>The Raccoon is generally found in the cavity, formed by the ravages of time in large trees. As ſoon as their retreat is diſcovered, a trap is fixed at a ſmall diſtance from the tree, thus, a ſemi-circular fence is formed by driving into the ground a ſufficient number of ſtakes at about three inches one from the other: within this ſpace a crotched ſtake is fixed, on which a heavy pole is placed, and at its inmoſt extremity, a bait, either of fiſh or fleſh is placed: the Raccoon in helping himſelf to the bait ſtarts the pole, which inſtantly falls, and the hungry animal is taken.</p>
               <p>The Porcupine is often diſcovered when in ſearch for food in the day time, ever retreating at night to his den, which is dug into the ſide of a hill or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Whenever he is ſeen in open air he is ſhot by the archer with his well directed feathered arrow; ſometimes he is found in his den, which is known by introducing a long pole; the hunter on diſcovering the animal is careful to faſten the end of the pole into the Porcupine's hair and pulls out the devoted creature to the den's mouth, where he is ſecured.</p>
               <p>Smaller animals are occaſionally hunted, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the archers, excepting the Mink, Muſk-Rat, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Fox and Wolfe, which are caught by traps ſimply prepared: the meat and fur is ſecured—the meat by ſmoking—the fur is carefully dried in the air and ſun, and in a proper time the hunters return to their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038422_0118_1011EA9B27F66C48"/>
homes, richly laden with the plunder obtained by deſtroying the once defenceleſs inhabitants of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, pathleſs wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>On the hunters return an equal diſtribution of game is made, which being often repeated, would ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the Indians, provided they diſpoſed of their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to any good advantage, but their being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the proper mode of traffic, they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily impoſed upon, and the end of one hunt is but the beginning of a ſecond, and ſo on during the hunting ſeaſon. Neceſſity, however, urges them to practice hunting as often as the ſeaſons will permit, as their principal dependance for ſupport is on the beaſts of the wilderneſs; who are very numerous, and during the winter (which is the beſt hunting ſeaſon) are very fat.</p>
               <p>In deſcribing the manner of catching the animals there particularly mentioned, I omitted deſcribing the manner of catching the Fox, and although not in order, in this place for the benefit of hunters in this country, I here give it.</p>
               <p>The Fox is the moſt ſubtil and difficult to catch of any animal whatever; therefore the greateſt care and ſecrecy is neceſſary to be obſerved to take him. He is catched in a ſteel trap.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:038422_0119_1011EA9CB17408C0"/>Previous to ſetting the trap, 'tis neceſſary to allure the Fox near ſome convenient place where you propoſe ſetting the trap: carry to the ſpot a quantity of the entrails of ſome animal, no matter of what kind—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the bait by tying it to ſome tree, here let it remain until the Fox by the ſcent will diſcover it, perhaps the firſt night after the bait is prepared. As ſoon as the hunter diſcovers that the Fox has eaten part of the bait, he will then ſet his trap at about five paces from the bait. Before the trap is ſet, it ſhould be rubbed over with the liver of ſome animal—while among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians I uſed Deer's liver, ſince my return to Canada, I have uſed Hog's, which is much the beſt. The liver muſt be boiled, and leſt the Fox ſhould diſcover the trap by the ſcent left on from the hunter's hands, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to put on a pair of leather gloves, and then rub the boiled liver over every part of the trap, and on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his ſhoes or mogaſons, and is careful not to touch any thing near the trap without his gloves on; then he takes a quantity of the ſame kind of liver, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the aſhes, or which is beſt, in the oven (if it can be done) to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h a degree as to pulveriſe it: this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſprinkled over the hunter's tracks to and from the trap, for the Fox is caught with more eaſe when the ſnow is deep. The track muſt be made from the firſt fixed bait to and over the trap. A piece of white birch bark is placed on the trap, or which is better, with clean paper, if to be procured; this prevents the ſnow
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038422_0120_1011EAA1073BA388"/>
from gathering over the trap, which might prevent it from ſpringing. Great care muſt be taken to place ſome part of the liver under the trap to prevent it from ſinking too deep in the ſnow.</p>
               <p>The hunter may, if he chooſes, allure Foxes from any other quarter to his trap, by walking with his ſhoes on, prepared as above, towards his trap from his neighbour's traps not properly prepared.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. DESCRIPTION OF THEIR WEAPONS FOR WAR, METHOD, OF CONDUCTING THEIR WARS, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>INDIANS in general are tenacious of their rights and priviledges, jealous of their neighbours, leſt at any time they intrude on hunting ground not their own, (for each Tribe hath a particular piece of land aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as well for tillage as hunting.) Some Tribes have a larger extent of territory than others. The Tribe to which I belonged, poſſeſſed hunting ground extending not only throughout the iſland, but on the main alſo, ſome part far diſtant from our village; therefore often treſpaſſed upon by the neighbouring Tribes. This being the caſe, our nation always were
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038422_0121_1011EAA3EAB84398"/>
(excepting in hunting ſeaſons) planning and carrying on war, or receiving overtures for peace from ſome Tribe or other.</p>
               <p>As Indians are naturally ſprightly, enterpriſing and indefatigable, and of a reſtleſs, uneaſy make, add to this their jealous, ſuſpicious temper; they ſeem peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted for war and really delight in its operations, however rigorous and doubtful.</p>
               <p>The yearly trade our Indians carry on with the Spaniards (as hath been obſerved) gives them opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſufficient to furniſh themſelves with fire arms and ammunition, which the Indians are careful to keep in readineſs, prepared at all times to repel invaſions, or to carry into effect a plan of warlike operation with ſome diſtant Tribe.</p>
               <p>The Tomahawk and ſcalping knife alſo, are arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles peculiarly uſeful, eſpecially when cloſely engaged with the enemy.</p>
               <p>They are careful not to burden themſelves with baggage unneceſſary; carrying from home but a ſmall quantity of proviſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sometimes killing ſmall game with the arrow, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their guns, leſt it ſhould alarm the enemy.</note> unleſs the nation they propoſe to contend with are at a great diſtance, in ſuch a caſe,

what proviſion they carry they depoſit in ſome ſecret hiding place the greater part, ready for ſupply if obliged ſuddenly to retreat, which but ſeldom happens with our nation.</p>
               <p>Beſides the weapons above deſcribed, our iſlanders ſometimes uſe the bow and arrow on particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: their chief dependance being on the fire arms and tomahawk.</p>

               <p>Their treatment of their captives is ever practiced as deſcribed in the before cited paſſage.—The return of the warriors to the village is announced by their whooping, as often repeated as they have recovered priſoners and ſcalps.

               <p>ALTHOUGH Indian wars are conducted with great ſpirit and cruelty, yet the contending powers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long ſcene of bloodſhed and deſtruction of prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, one or more powers when greatly reduced, ſue their opponents for peace; each party reluctantly make the firſt propoſal. That Tribe who firſt make them, ſend three of their nation, who are men of integrity and of conſequence to the nation; who carry with them a letter formed by beads, recommending their perſons, declaring the purpoſe for which they viſit the power who have been contending with them. They alſo
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038422_0124_1011EAA9C307AA50"/>
carry a belt of wampum.<note n="*" place="bottom">Wampum is a belt of Mooſe hide, on which beads are artfully ſtrung, and conſidered as a peaceful token.</note> Wherever this belt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, its bearers are treated with reſpect.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens that overtures for peace are made by the mediation of ſome power in alliance with that power to whom propoſals are made; this mode generally proves the moſt ſucceſsful, and ſeldom fails of its deſired effect.</p>
               <p>The envoys with their wampum, immediately on their arrival, repair to the head quarters of the nation, (to whom they are ſent) which is the ſeat of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief of the war department, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſends for his privy council; to them, in preſence of the captain general, the foreign miniſters are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, who deliver the wampum, letters miſſive, which are in an elevated voice read by a perſon ſkilled in hyeroglyphical modes of conveying intelligence, &amp;c. On this the envoys are ordered to retire for a ſhort time; when the chief, with his council, takes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject into conſideration, deliberately weighing the good and evil conſequences that may inſue on their rejecting the propoſals, alſo the conſequence of liſtening to the preliminaries about to be made, ever keeping their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

               <p>This ſtate of harmony between friendly nations, continues for a great length of time, and as a mean of ſtrengthening the friendſhip, the belts or wampum uſed in forming the alliance, is frequently exchanged by one nation to the other, which ſerves further to cement the friendly Tribes with each other.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. OF THEIR DIVERSIONS.</head>
               <p>THE Indians are often at leiſure, and have many opportunities of gratifying their paſſions for different kinds of diverſion, as playing ball, running, leaping, ſhooting with the bow and arrow, throwing the tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahawk, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In playing at ball, they form themſelves into companies of about twenty each—ſelecting ſome lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, ſmooth piece of ground, moſt ſuitable for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Each company is divided into two equal parts, and a bet is laid, conſiſting of a certain number of broaches, as by the parties agreed on, to be delivered to the victors. As the broaches, previous to the game,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038422_0129_1011EAB94EC3F3F8"/>
are delivered into the hands of ſome truſty byſtander, that ſide which gains the victory never fails of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>Their balls are made in an orbicular form of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo's hair, and covered with leather of Mooſe hide.— The inſtrument with which they ſtrike the ball, is about four feet in length—in form like a fiſhhook. That part deſigned to ſtrike the ball is interwoven with the ſinews of Deer, which (on ſtriking the ball) by reaſon of its elaſticity, ſends it to a much greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than if ſtruck by a ſtick prepared as in this country.</p>
               <p>The perſon who ſtrikes the ball, ſtands near to a hole formed in the ground, to which another ſtanding at a diſtance, aims to trundle the ball, into which (if not prevented by him who holds the ſtick) it will fall, and then the gameſter gives up his ſtick to ſome other of his ſide, and ſo the game goes on until the whole number choſen on both ſides have alternately gone through the ſame.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe, the perſon to whom the broaches are delivered, having kept an exact account of the number of times they on ſtriking the ball run from the hole to a ſtake fixed at a certain diſtance as agreed upon, while the trundl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:038422_0130_1011EABC09E02320"/>
both ſides, and that ſide in whoſe favour the perſon to whom it is left gives the preference, receives the broaches, and thus the game ends.</p>
               <p>Running matches are frequently formed among them; at ſuch times a large number collect, when a certain mark is made on the ground from which the combatants take their departure; they run to a mark made in the ground at ſuch a diſtance from the firſt mark as by the company is determined upon. The race commences ſometimes by two only, but often of a larger number, juſt as it happens. The wager is made by depoſiting a certain quantity of broaches into the hands of ſome indifferent perſon, who gives them to him who firſt croſſeth the laſt fixed bounds, near which the man who determines the conteſt ſtands. The run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners lay aſide every part of their clothing that may in the leaſt retard their motion. The victor receives the applauſe of the multitude, and is honored by their ſongs and inſtruments of muſic as performed on all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic rejoicings.</p>
               <p>Leaping is alſo publicly attended to, and is by ſome one indifferently choſen for that purpoſe, who receives the number of broaches the parties agree upon (for bets at all times of diverſion conſiſt of broaches only.) He who on a level plain leaps the greateſt number of
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038422_0131_1011EABD9A3E1BF0"/>
paces, takes the broaches and receives the plaudits of the multitude as on all other public diverſions and deciſions.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the bow and arrow is of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the nation, that great pains are taken, early to inſtruct the youth in this art, deſigned for hunters and warriors; for this purpoſe, a certain number of good markſmen are aſſigned as inſtructors, who daily lead forth a certain number of boys, and by repeated trials they become maſters, and can with exactneſs ſtrike a mark fixed at a reaſonable diſtance. Hence this diverſion of ſhooting at marks, to be decided in public, which is determined in the ſame manner as before mentioned of playing at ball, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The proper mode of uſing the tomahawk is of as much national conſequence as the proper uſe of the bow and arrow; therefore ſimilar pains are taken to inſtruct in the latter, as in the former art.</p>
               <p>The perſon who throws the tomahawk, holds it in a perpendicular poſition with its pole or ſhank outwards, the edge towards his body, and with as much force as the wielder is capable to give, the weapon f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

who throws this cruel weapon. When thrown by an able markſman, it rarely fails to ſtrike the deſtined ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, whether man or beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are moſt expert in this noble art, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently banter each other, and on public days bets of broaches<note n="*" place="bottom">Broaches, either of gold or ſilver, are the principal Indian ornament, and ſo much eſteemed by them, that 'tis common for one to poſſeſs five hundred, and ſome one of the chiefs can command one thouſand at a time, made by the Spaniards at Tartarrac, and ſold to the Indians in exchange for their fur, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <head>CHAP. X. OF THEIR MANNNER OF COURTSHIP, MATRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONIAL CEREMONIES, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>NO Nation, whether civilized or not (that I have ever read or have any knowledge of) ever have totally omitted certain ceremonies to be uſed in joining the male to his female; although it rarely happens that any two nations make uſe of the ſame form for one and the ſame purpoſe; that is, in forming a new and endearing connection between two perſons of oppoſite ſexes, under the character of huſband and wife.</p>
               <p>Some of the Indian Tribes (as I was informed, when on my return to Canada) proceed to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ceremony without any previous acquaintance, or even the conſent of the parties; but with the Scanyaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauragahrooote Tribe 'tis quite otherwiſe, for previous to marriage, a courtſhip takes place between the man and woman, who are afterwards married.</p>
               <p>Whenever a ſingle man wiſhes to form an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with any particular female, he pays the family, to whom ſhe belongs, a viſit in the evening; if ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be at home, after a ſhort introductory conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the father, he fixes his eyes upon the female
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:038422_0134_1011EAC6A93CA7E8"/>
he propoſes to form a new connection with. After ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting without uttering one word for ſome conſiderable time, he then takes a ſtick of about four inches in length (for he always at ſuch times carries three ſticks with him) and throws it into her lap; ſhe knowing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, carefully ſecures it; he then after a ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval throws a ſecond ſtick, and then the third—ſhe ſecures the whole number; this done, the man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retires and leaves the family to their wonted repoſe. Then on the next ſucceeding evening he viſits the ſame family, and in the ſame manner ſpends his time, not forgetting to leave the ſame number of ſticks as above, and ſo the next ſucceeding night, performing the ſame ceremony. The third and laſt evening, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male having received nine ſticks; if ſhe approves of his ſuit, carefully keeping the whole number, runs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of the wigwam, followed by her lover, to a ſhort diſtance from the habitation, when a ſhort dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between them takes place; then each retire to their own wigwams; but if ſhe diſapproves of his ſuit, ſhe on the third evening throws the nine ſticks into her ſuiter's face, and ſo the matter ends. If his viſits are approved of, her parents make preparation to ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the marriage, which is performed the firſt day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluded upon in a convenient place in open air.</p>
               <p>On this important occaſion, a large number collect of all ages and ſexes, where they are entertained by
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:038422_0135_1011EAC8375E7BF8"/>
feaſting and dancing, with ſuch muſic as is commonly uſed on public rejoicing: but previous to this, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonial ceremony takes place, which is thus performed: the lovers are ſeated croſslegged on the ground, directly oppoſite one to the other, their knees touching each other; this done, the fathers of the young couple come forward with a blanket in their hands, which they gently place over the young candidates, then the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude form a circle round them, to which the parents alſo join; then after a ſmall ſpace the two fathers come to the young couple, and taking hold of the two oppoſite corners of the blanket utter a few ſignificant words, as, we wiſh you joy, 'tis our wiſh that you may live long and peaceably together; that your offspring may be numerous; that you may be an honor to your nation; that your children may by good citizens, and that their children may alſo honor their country, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its rights, and inviolately hand down their nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al priviledges to the future riſing generations. The blanket then drops, the fathers join the encircled multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; then the mothers approach the happy couple, and raiſe the two oppoſite corners of the blanket, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by their huſbands, and in language ſimilar to that delivered by their huſbands, for a moment addreſs the young and riſing hopes of their family honor; this done, the mothers join the multitude, when a dance, honored with the national muſic, concludes the ceremony. The male and his female conforming to
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:038422_0136_1011EACB1A9B8600"/>
this mode, are now and ever after, ſo long as they live conſidered as man and wife.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens that the propoſed couple are deſtitute of parents; in this caſe four perſons, conſiſting of an equal number of both ſexes, are by the propoſed couple ſelected, and on the matrimonial ceremony, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and act the part aſſigned the parents on the ſame occaſion.</p>
               <p>Polygamy is here tolerated, and every time the male wiſhes to add a new female to his bed, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the uſual ceremonies, which are as often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he admits a new partner.</p>
               <p>In thoſe families where a plurality of wives are found, there appears a perfect harmony among the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, each one endeavouring to recommend herſelf to the good will of her lord and maſter, the huſband and head of the family.</p>
               <p>Adultery is not known among them; jealouſy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is a ſtranger. Fornication however, is puniſhed thus: the female when found guilty, is by the aged matrons roughly handled, by cutting the delinquent's hair as cloſe as may be to the head, then ſhe is obliged to take her paramour by his right hand, and in this manner the two delinquents are drove through the village. On this occaſion the populace treat them with the greateſt indignity, hooting and throwing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> them as they paſs. This, however, but ſeldom happens. The female delinquent is ever after treated by her friends and acquaintance with neglect.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as may be after a young couple are married, the whole nation aſſemble, and clear a certain piece of land aſſigned them by the chiefs for their future improvement. The trees ſtanding on this land, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er large or ſmall, are removed root and branch in the following manner.</p>
               <p>The roots running from each tree is carefully ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the trunk; then a large rope,<note n="*" place="bottom">This rope is made of the rhine of a tree called white-wood.</note> ſufficiently long and ſtrong, is fixed near the centre of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at each extremity of this rope a number of ſtrong, hearty pearſons are placed, who by ſtrength pull down and carry off the trees until the whole piece of land is properly cleared and fit for tillage.</p>
               <p>The young bride remains one year with her parents after marriage, by this time her huſband recovers one crop from his patrimony.</p>
               <p>The male children have names given them by the father, the females by the mother; thoſe names are without any ſignificancy, and are given merely to diſtinguiſh one child from the other while in a ſtate of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:038422_0138_1011EAD0C2884508"/>
minority.<note n="*" place="bottom">They are conſidered in this ſtate until they are married, which generally, among the young people, takes place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the age of fourteen and twenty.</note> Whenever they perform any feat worthy of public note, whether in hunting, gaming, or in the more noble art of war, they then receive new and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant names, ſuch as Buffalo, Bear, Fox, Deer, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Tyger, Porcupine, Otter,  ſometimes ſome rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile or inſect, whatever animal the action the perſon performs ſhall moſt reſemble. Some one who excels others in ſubtility, is called Fox; another who excels in ingenuity and induſtry, is called Beaver: a man of ſhort legs, and of a ſnarling, touchy diſpoſition, they call Porcupine: one of a long neck and long legs is called Turkey, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Every head of a family prides himſelf in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of children he hath in his family; for this purpoſe he marries as many women as he can ſupport by his hunting, aided by their induſtry and oeconomy.</p>
               <p>The parents are remarkably fond of their children, eſpecially while in their infantile ſtate. Nothing can exceed the mother's attachment to her infant; ſhe takes unwearied pains to nurſe it, never omitting any means or pains to prevent its being unuſeful when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into an active life. As ſoon as born, ſhe plunges it in cold water, and as often afterwards as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repeats it—ſhe is careful to prevent its limbs from

deformity by lacing the young and pliable body to ſome piece of wood or bark exactly fitted for this purpoſe. This motherly fondneſs continues until the child's new relation, in a conjugal ſtate takes place.</p>

               <p>THE Scanyawtauragahrooote Indians hold to a plurality of Gods, as the ſun, moon, ſeven ſtars, north or polar ſtar. They alſo ſuppoſe that evil geniuſes, or bad ſpirits more or leſs effect their national and private operations.

               <p>The moon and ſtars are conſidered as ſubordinate powers, and take their authority from the ſun. The moon on its firſt appearance, whether in the wane or increaſe, is particularly attended to. When it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in its full orbit, nothing can exceed the joy which pervades the whole village—ſhouting, dancing, and every other mode of exulting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the inhabitants, ejaculatory prayers are intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſking the moon's intereſt with the ſun, praying that he would be propitious to them, in giving them ſucceſs in hunting, tilling their lands, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſtars are conſidered as having rule at night in the abſence of the moon; the Indians therefore, pray that they would uſe their influence with the ſun as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; that he would haſten the return of the moon, continue its luſtre and influence longer than at one time heretofore; that the ſtars would preſide over their traps, give ſucceſs to their endeavours to catch the Beaver, Fox, Wolfe, and all other animals taken by traps during the night ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>They hold that certain evil ſpirits have power to counteract the good influence of the ſun, moon,  that they can, and often do reveal ſecrets to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows or praying Indians. Thoſe Powows are always conſulted on public enterpriſes, ſuch as going to war, &amp;c. The inhabitants ſuppoſe the Powows hold a ſecret correſpondence with thoſe evil geniuſes.</p>
               <p>How thoſe praying Indians come by this ſecret pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I am at a loſs to determine, although when among them I made all the enquiry into this matter. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Powow's religious operations hath already been fully deſcribed.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:038422_0141_1011EADB16CAC338"/>The Indians appear in their religious principles to be rude, and for want of a knowledge of the ſcriptures of divine revelation, but a ſmall remove above the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal creation, not having even a faint idea of any power neceſſary to exiſt before, and ſuperior to the ſun, moon, &amp;c. in order to create them.</p>
               <p>In inſtances of earthquakes, heavy thunder and lightning, they ſay it is becauſe the ſun, moon, or ſtars are angry, becauſe they have omitted paying their hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to one or all of their deities, or have not in the beſt manner improved their hunting ſeaſons, or have not (through their own neglect) improved any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they have at any time gained over their enemies in battle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If it happens that earthquakes are not ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, as for the moſt part is the caſe among them, they ſay their Gods are in friendſhip with them, and that they have nothing to fear from their enemies, and cheerfully paſs away time, not even entertaining any notion of a ſtate of future rewards or puniſhment; but that death puts an end to the difficulties attendant on this life; that the hunter ſhall no more be obliged to travel ſo far, and ſuffer ſo much as he now does in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing food, &amp;c. for himſelf and family; that the ſtate on which they enter at the cloſe of this life, is every way better calculated to make them happy; that good

               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:038422_0143_1011EADFC1B4C480"/>In caſes of ſickneſs and pain, they always apply to the old experienced ſquaws, who are their doctors.—In the pleuriſy the firſt trial the ſquaw makes to remove the diſorder, is to bleed the patient; this is done nearly in the ſame manner as performed by doctors in this country, which is by winding a ſmall cord round the patient's arm above the elbow, and opening a vein by a ſharp flint. This is done in a maſterly manner, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having been operated upon ſeveral times during my tarry with them. The doctor then proceeds to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriffic mode of cure (if phlebotomy does not effect a cure) which is thus performed; a number of ſtakes are drove into the ground, forming a ſpace ſufficiently large as to contain one body only, with the neceſſary furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c. Thoſe ſtakes are ſet ſo cloſely together, as by weaving in between them certain pliable twigs, air is totally excluded above as on all ſides. Into this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure two large rocks, previouſly made very hot are placed; on to thoſe rocks water is frequently thrown: the patient at the ſame time being confined within this encloſure, here tarries for one hour, which brings on a free and plentiful perſpiration; in this ſtate the patient plunges himſelf into cold water ſo deep as at once to cover his whole body.</p>
               <p>This method, however inconſiſtent it may appear to practitioners in this country, is invariably uſed by the female practitioners among the Indians, and is ſaid to be
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038422_0144_1011EAE2EE64C908"/>
in general ſucceſsful, when followed by internal medic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal decoctions of herbs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Dropſical and paralytical complaints are rarely (if ever) known among them. Wounds made in war, or by any other accident, are frequent with them; in ſuch caſes the ſquaws act the ſurgeon's part, who by external applications of herbs and roots, ſpontaneouſly growing with them, and familiarly known to the ſurgeons, are applied, and never fail of a perfect cure. The method of cure in the bite of the Rattle Snake hath been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the memoirs.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the patient ſuppoſes that his diſorder ariſeth from the malice of evil ſpirits; in this caſe the Powows are conſulted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who enquire in their uſual way of the cauſe and mode of cure, which is by the phyſicians particularly attended to.</p>
               <p>All the phyſicians' and ſurgeons' preſcriptions, are founded on their knowledge of ſimples only, which are taught them by long experience and indefatigable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to their operations.</p>
               <p>The females in the hour of nature's ſtruggle, meet with but little or no difficulty, being always delivered alone, and without the aid of any one of her female friends, or any other perſon. This to ſome may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a falſe repreſentation, but however ſtrange, 'tis perfectly true.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>INDIAN FORTITUDE IN A TRYING HOUR.</hi> THE MANNER OF BURYING THEIR DEAD, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>HOWEVER terrible the near approach of death may be to the greater part of mankind, cauſing the animal frame to ſhudder even at the idea of diſſolution, the Indian meets this laſt enemy with as much compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as though he was not the perſon deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this never failing conqueror; even when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by his phyſician, that any further attemps to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore him to health, would be fruitleſs, makes no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſion on the dying man, but with compoſure he receives the laſt viſits of his friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who aſſemble round their departing friend, and never omit to refreſh his memory with a recital of ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed traits of his conduct in hunting and war; alſo the great advantage his family in particular, and the nation in general might receive from him if he was to continue for any greater length of time among them; add to this the lementations ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by his neareſt connections, make no impreſſion; but with heroic boldneſs, as he was wont to meet his oppoſing enemy in the field of battle, he receives the laſt words of his friends, and with equal compoſure, firſt addreſſeth himſelf to his family in general, then to his viſiting friends; laſtly to her who he expects to
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:038422_0146_1011EAEA99862248"/>
take care of and guide the children he may leave in a ſtate of minority and dependance. To his family he gives council and directions how they ought to conduct themſelves to gain the good will of the nation, and to gain the approbation of their national Deities; that they muſt conſider themſelves as about to act (each one according to the ſtation of life in which they are placed) with equal fidelity and honor the part that he, their father, hath before them acted, both as a good hunter and ſucceſsful warrior; that in all their conduct they muſt keep their national honor in view, ever ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificing their own private intereſts for the public good, whenever called thereto. He then addreſſeth himſelf to his intimates preſent; tells them that a retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view of his and their conduct, when called to war; their fortitude, ſtrength and ſkill in directing the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in handling the truſty firelock, and never failing tomahawk, gives him peculiar ſatisfaction; that his own conduct while in active life, will entitle him to a free and ſure paſſport at death, into a country far better than the country they now enjoy; that in that country, hunting is continued through the twelve moons; that the beſt of game is always to be had without any fatigue or diſappointment to the hunter, or his truſty dogs; bids his friends ſtrictly to adhere to the wholeſome and well fabricated rules, calculated to ſupport their national honor, as handed down by their fathers; that they alſo muſt hand them down to their
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038422_0147_1011EAEC2F1E7448"/>
poſterity, with a particular charge to their children, that they do the ſame to theirs; that the generations yet unborn may reap the benefit of ſo valuable a bequeſt as their national rights, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To his wife he makes his laſt ſpeech, and endeavours to encourage her in performing the duty, which on his death muſt be greatly increaſed; that her reward for her good ſervices will aſſuredly be given her in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the nations in the other world, at which the faithful will arrive. In this calm, converſable manner the ſavage, without one groan or ſtruggle, yields his breath as conquered. As ſoon as the body becomes lifeleſs, preparation is then made for its burial in the following manner.</p>
               <p>It is ſtretched out on ſome ſkins of animals, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently large. Round the dead man's neck is fixed by a ſtring, his ſcalping knife, leaving his head and neck bare—round his body his blanket is wrapped, and confined by the broaches he was at his death poſſeſſed of, with all his other ornaments. Thus prepared for interment, his neighbours aſſemble, and make ready his grave, which is dug in ſome convenient, retired place and unfit for tillage, in a perpendicular form, ſufficiently large to contain the body, the deceaſed's gun, a quantity of ammunition, his bow and arrow, his tomahawk, which they ſuppoſe he will want to gain a living in the future ſtate. The grave then is lined
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:038422_0148_1011EAEF4DE36F68"/>
with ſome thick bark; then the body is carried without any ceremony or order, and in an erect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture placed in the prepared grave, with the imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, covered over with bark; over which, earth is carefully laid on, ſufficiently high as to diſtinguiſh the grave from the ſurrounding earth. All preſent, both friends and neighbours follow the corps without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction or order; tarry until the funeral ſevices are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, then in the ſame confuſed manner return each one to their reſpective homes.</p>
               <p>At any time after, whenever the ſpirits of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving friends are raiſed, they aſſemble round the grave, there dancing and whooping in a moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant manner; and then recite over the extraordinary feats performed by the deceaſed when living. This concludes the ſcene, when all retire to their wonted employment and diverſions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE SCANYAWTAURA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAHROOOTE INDIANS.</head>
               <p>IN all civilized nations, oppoſite characters are to be found. Some appear mild and calm on every occaſion: nothing however gloomy or terrifying to others hath any ill effect on them: others appear in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:038422_0149_1011EAF4088B2628"/>
of life uneaſy, churliſh and diſcontented, whether in proſperity or adverſity, nothing appears to pleaſe them, even the occurrences of common Providence diſaffects them; at times they are ready to ſay that ſuch and ſuch events are the reſult of wrong calculations. Such characters are to be met with in all orders of men. The farmer will frequently diſcover this by ſaying the ſeaſon is too wet or too dry, too hot or too cold; if in the winter, they ſay (if the ſeaſon be favourable for buſineſs) that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy; if the ſeaſon be otherwiſe, they ſay my cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are eating my provender without any profit, &amp;c. This complaining ſpirit appears to prevail more or leſs among people who pretend to an uncommon ſhare of philoſophic knowledge: but among the Indians who have not the advantage of education, this ſpirit does not appear ſo much to prevail.</p>
               <p>The character of an Indian, is a compound of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity and gentleneſs; they are at once led away by paſſion, &amp; at the ſame time poſſeſs virtues that would do honor to people of more refined taſte: they will diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a moſt diabolical temper in executing ſuch priſoners as are deſtined to ſuffer, at the ſame time will ſhew all the compaſſion and tenderneſs in their power towards thoſe whoſe happy lot it is to be ſelected from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of priſoners, and are adopted by thoſe ſquaws who have loſt their friends in battle. Such inſtances I have known when among them; no pains are omitted that
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:038422_0150_1011EAF7092B4E28"/>
are neceſſary to make ſuch perſons as happy as Indian accommodations can afford.</p>
               <p>I myſelf have experienced much of their kindneſs, although not taken in battle; yet as a ſtranger, both in ſickneſs and in health. They uſed every mean in their power to mitigate my ſorrows on my firſt arrival a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>Nothing can exceed their ſpirit of reſentment, whenever their honor is touched. They never paſs by an affront with impunity; but will watch night and day in ſome ſecret place, near which the offender is likely to paſs, and all this without food or even ſleep for two days and nights together; and will make their way through pathleſs deſerts, with no other ſuſtenance than what accidentally falls in their way, to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on an enemy.</p>
               <p>Whenever the father of a family is called to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from his family for any great length of time, on his return he is not unmindful of his connubial and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal feelings, but with open heart and unfolded arms meets his family, and with a degree of unaffected ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction receives the congratulations of them on his ſafe return to his wigwam; will entertain them with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular recital of all the events that have taken place during his abſence, whether for or againſt him, and with a ſatisfaction no leſs pleaſing, will he attend to a
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038422_0151_1011EAF896F3ABE0"/>
recital made by his wife and children of thoſe events that took place among them during his abſence.</p>
               <p>Nothing can exceed an Indian's attachment to his nation, on all occaſions when called to council or to battle. When public honor or intereſt is at ſtake, the whole take the alarm, and act as if actuated by one ſoul. All private intereſt is conſidered as of no weight when compared to national honor.</p>
               <p>Being accuſtomed to hardſhips from their youth, they will ſurmount every obſtacle however hazardous; even the near proſpect of death will not abate their zeal when about to execute the commands of their leaders, whether in battle with their enemies or in hunting.</p>
               <p>It frequently happens that in their long marches, proviſion falls ſhort with them; in this caſe not a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring word is heard among them: the pleaſing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they entertain of ſucceſs in their enterpriſe allays the calls of nature. This they will endure for ſome days, unleſs relieved by taking ſome game which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents when on their march, for they never turn aſide from their propoſed route, but keep as ſtrait and direct a courſe towards the deſtined place as poſſible, however great the calls of nature may be.</p>
               <p>I have known them on ſuch marches to be ſo far reduced for want of food, that they have been obliged to eat reptiles, frogs, &amp;c. and that in a raw ſtate; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:038422_0152_1011EAFD789CDFC8"/>
for want of this unſavoury food, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the leaves and rind of trees as they paſs along.</p>
               <p>The Indians are remarkably generous to ſtrangers who viſit them, whether on public buſineſs or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; the beſt of their food is unreſervedly ſet before them, and they are bid a cordial welcome to every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in the power of the family to help them to to allay their hunger, or to gratify their paſſions dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tarry, whether longer or ſhorter.</p>
               <p>The foregoing relation of the different prevailing paſſions reigning in the breaſt of the Scanyawtauragah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooote Indians muſt ſuffice to give the reader an idea of their character.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THE QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, REPTILES AND INSECTS, WHICH ARE TO BE MET WITH ON, AND IN THE VICINITY OF SCANYAWTAURAGAH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROOOTE ISLAND.</head>
               <p>OF theſe I ſhall treat in alphabetical order; and firſt of the quadrupeds, Bear, Beaver, Buffalo, Cat of the Mountain, or Wild Cat, Deer, Dog, Fox, Hare, Hedgehog or Porcupine, Marten, Mink, Mooſe, Muſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaſh, Mouſe, Mole, Otter, Porcupine, Rabbit, Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coon, Skunk, Squirrel, Tiger, Weaſel, Woodebuck and Wolf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:038422_0153_1011EB00BA568A30"/>Bears are to be found in great plenty in this, as well as in many other parts of America. The hunting of this animal is much attended to for food, clothing and bedding: the fleſh is eſteemed the firſt of any to be found in the wilderneſs, both for its flavour and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What adds much to recommend this diet, is, that it never cloys; a perſon making a meal of it one day may feed heartily upon it the next, and ſo on (if to be obtained) for one month or longer. Such is its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious quality, that it is highly recommended by practitioners to the invalid, as it ſits eaſy on the ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and of eaſy digeſtion. With the inhabitants of the interior parts of New-England 'tis much prized, as it ſupplies them, when ſalted, with meat but little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to pork. With the firſt ſettlers, where pork cannot be procured, 'tis of the firſt conſequence, for in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſupply they are enabled to execute plans the moſt arduous among them. Among the Indians 'tis of no leſs conſequence; their method of ſmoking meat (as hath already been deſcribed) ſerves to preſerve large quantities of this food for ſupply, when hunting ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are over.</p>
               <p>The ſkin of the Bear is alſo of value among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, as their beds and ſome part of their clothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of thoſe ſkns. The fat is much uſed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; they frequently rub it over their bodies, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over their limbs; to this they attribute their agility. Bear's greeſe is uſed by them to facilitate the growth of the hair on their heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:038422_0154_1011EB03CC326020"/>This animal is ſo well known in this country, that a minute deſcription of its bulk or colour when fully grown, or when in a young ſtate, is here needleſs; however, I would obſerve that this much valued ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal produces but two Cubs at a litter, and but once in one ſeaſon, which is not ſo with ſome other quadrupeds of this weſtern continent. And what is particularly noticed of the Bear, is, that during the winter it reſts in its ſafe retreat in a dormant ſtate. On its firſt taking poſſeſſion, it is careful to ſtop or plug up the moſt material outlet of its body, with a certain gum or gluy ſubſtance taken from the pine or hemlock tree. In this ſtate they are often found with one of its hind paws in its mouth, and what is worthy of note, the Bear is then the fatteſt and moſt profitable to the hunter.</p>
               <p>The Beaver is an amphibious animal, and delights much in water: they are to be found and caught in or near this element.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid and publiſhed on the ſingular qualities of this valuable animal, and if rational or thinking qualities may with propriety be conſidered as making a part of a quadruped's inherent faculties, the Beaver firſt claims the right; for, as hath in this work been already noticed, they are by ſome authors ſaid to be in a ſtate of republicaniſm; having myſelf been an eye witneſs to their manner of conſtructing their dams, which with peculiar pleaſure I often attended to by
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038422_0155_1011EB055D38CA08"/>
moonlight (when with the Indians) for they are moſt induſtrious by night as well as by day, unleſs interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome accident, or by the near approach of ſome more fatal enemy.</p>
               <p>Their firſt movement (after collecting a ſufficient number for the purpoſe) is to find out and determine upon ſome convenient place as well for conſtructing their habitations as for food; this muſt be a ſmall rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, ſurrounded with a plenty of timber ſuitable to build a dam from ſhore to ſhore to ſtop the running water; this being unanimouſly determined upon by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, each citizen hath his particular part aſſigned him to act, whether as a labourer, an overſeer,<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe who act in this office, are very attentive to their buſineſs, for when any who are employed to fall trees, &amp;c. are idle (for this ſometimes happens) an overſeer with his tail will correct the idler, which is done to ſo good a purpoſe that the buſineſs goes on with more life; the idler on being corrected, more cloſely attends to his part of duty.</note> or in the more important office of councillor.</p>
               <p>All the prerequiſites being adjuſted, the buſineſs commences, and is conducted by the ſtricteſt rules of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and oeconomy. The younger and more robuſt, whoſe teeth are beſt calculated to perform the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutter's part, aſſemble round the handieſt trees; to each a ſufficient number is placed as can work without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. They are careful to gnaw the tree ſo as that
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038422_0156_1011EB0A2A8DD838"/>
it may fall towards the rivulet. As ſoon as the tree is fallen, they, whoſe buſineſs it is, take an exact meaſure of the diſtance from ſhore to ſhore; the trunk of the tree is then meaſured, and at a ſuitable length is gnawed off; when others are employed to carry the prepared timber to its place of depoſit. The wood-cutters go on to prepare more timber as above related.</p>
               <p>Their manner of draging timber is by their tails thus, a ſuitable number for the purpoſe place their tails all on one ſide of the timber, while others on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide gently role the timber on to the prepared vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; thus fixed, the timber is drawn forward to the ſpot, and there placed. They proceed in the ſame manner until a number ſufficient for their purpoſe is drawn on and placed; then a number appear and act the maſon's part, who with their tails as with a trowel plaſter on between the timber, interwoven with ſmall branches of the felled trees—the morter uſed is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Beaver's feet. They alſo carry upon their tails rocks of very conſiderable weight, further to ſtrengthen their dams.</p>
               <p>Having completely ſtoped the running water, they then proceed to form their cabins, or lodging places; theſe are conſtructed in an oval form, and are built either on piles by them formed in the pond above the Beaver dam, or on the extremity of ſome point of land running into the pond. The greater part of the cabin
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038422_0157_1011EB0D0CDCC920"/>
ſtands above the water. Each cabin is ſo large as to contain a number of inhabitants; each one hath a particular ſpot aſſigned it, the floor of which is ſtrewed over with leaves or ſmall branches of pine trees. Their cabins are ſo nearly ſituated, that an eaſy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is kept up between them. The floor of the cabin is ſo conſtructed that the innermoſt part is ſix or eight inches higher than at the entrance; the Beaver then in laying down keeps his body dry, while his tail is kept in the water, for it muſt be kept wet, otherwiſe the animal is ſickly. The manner of the Beaver's laying down in his cabin, accounts for this animal's knowing that ſome breach is made in the dam, which, as hath been deſcribed, gives the hunter an opportunity of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his game; for when the water is drawn off, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imal's tail is dry, which gives its owner a reſtleſs feeling, and increaſeth to ſuch a degree as to cauſe the Beaver to riſk his life in ſearching out the cauſe, and in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breach.</p>
               <p>Their habitations are completed by the latter end of September, and their ſtock of proviſion to ſerve them through the winter is provided. Their proviſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſmall pieces of wood whoſe texture is ſoft, ſuch as puplar, willow, &amp;c. which they lay up in piles in ſuch a manner as to preſerve their moiſture.</p>
               <p>The Beaver being an animal but ſeldom ſeen but by thoſe who hunt them, I ſhall here deſcribe it. The
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038422_0158_1011EB0E9C483FE8"/>
largeſt are nearly four feet in length, and about fifteen inches over the haunches; they weigh, one with anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when fully grown, about fifty-five or ſixty pounds. Its head reſembles that of the Otter—its ſnout is long— the eyes ſmall—the ears ſhort, round, hairy on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and ſmooth within—its teeth very long; the under ones ſtand out of their mouths about one inch, the upper teeth about one fourth of an inch; all are broad, ſtrong and ſharp; the under teeth before, are formed like a carpenter's gouge, and ſeem peculiarly formed to fall trees, &amp;c—their fore legs are ſhorter than their hind ones—their toes in the fore feet are ſeparate, each toe furniſhed with a nail—its hind feet are furniſhed with membranes, which join their toes much like unto the feet of water fowl, thus prepared it can ſwim with as much eaſe as any other aquatic animal. The tail in ſome meaſure reſembles that of a fiſh, and ſeems to have no relation to any other part of the body, except the hind feet, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts being ſimilar to other land animals. The tail is about twelve inches in length, and about four inches broad in the middle, the root and its extremity being much narrower; 'tis about two inches thick near the body, where it is almoſt round, but gradually thinner and flatter towards the end, 'tis covered over with ſcales like unto thoſe of fiſh. The colour of the Beaver differs according to the different climates where they are found. In the northern parts they are almoſt black—in the more temperate climate, brown. Their colour grows lighter as they approach towards the ſouth.
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038422_0159_1011EB1148154A48"/>
Their fur is of two ſorts, all over the body, except the feet—the longeſt is about one inch and of no value, the other part is a very thick and fine down, almoſt as ſoft as ſilk; this ſort is much uſed in the hatter's buſineſs, &amp;c. The Caſtor is found in this animal, and is of peculiar uſe in certain diſorders, and of no ſmall profit to the hunter.</p>
               <p>The Buffalo is found in the greateſt perfection and plenty in this quarter, and of great conſequence to the Scanyawtauragahrooote Indians; it is much larger than a common Ox—has ſhort black horns, with a large beard under its chin; his head is ſo full of hair that it falls over its eyes, which gives a diſagreeable appearance. This animal is diſtinguiſhed from others by a large bunch on its back, beginning at the haunches, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually to the ſhoulders and neck. The whole body is covered with long hair of a dun or mouſe colour —its head is larger than a Bull's, with a very ſhort neck— the breaſt is broad— the body decreaſeth towards its rump.—The Buffalo's fleſh is excellent food—its hide very uſeful—its hair much uſed in manufacturing many articles.</p>
               <p>Cat of the Mountain, or Wild Cat, in ſhape much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles our common houſe Cat, but much larger. Their whole ſkin is beautified with black ſpots—the hair which covers the body, in general, is of a rediſh caſt. This animal is very fierce, and will engage animals of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038422_0160_1011EB15471E53A0"/>
ſuperior bulk, and by its dexterity in uſing its claws will conquer animals of ſuperior ſtrength and agility.</p>
               <p>Deer. This animal is well known in this country. They are of a deep fallow or pale colour—light on the foot, and excellent food, and are in great plenty in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated parts of America.</p>
               <p>Dogs among the Indians are numerous, and of great uſe and much profit as well in hunting animals of the wilderneſs, as in queſt of water fowl and other feathered game. They are early taught to follow and aſſiſt the hunter whenever neceſſary. 'Tis rare to meet an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian in the woods without his Dog (unleſs when on ſome warlike enterprize) who is treated by his maſter with familiarity, and at all times with his benefactor ſhares in what the wigwam affords while at eaſe, crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his maſter's feet, and in hunting does not looſe his ſhare of the game.</p>
               <p>Nothing can exceed the attachment and fidelity of the Dog to his owner on all occaſions by night as well as by day.</p>
               <p>The Indian Dogs appear to be of one ſpecies, in thoſe, the qualities of the Spaniel, the Grey-Hound, the Maſtiff, the Bull-Dog, the Fox-Hunter, and the Blood-Hound,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038422_0161_1011EB17165214B0"/>
ſo much prized in European nations, ſeem to unite in forming one complete Indian Dog, whoſe head as well as the other parts of his body as nearly reſembles that of a Wolfe as any animal whatever.</p>
               <p>Many anecdotes have been related of the ſagacity and fidelity of a Dog to his maſter; among a variety, I ſhall ſelect one only.</p>
               <p>"In one of the weſtern forts within the limits of the United States, an American officer, accompanied by his truſty Dog only, left the fort in queſt of ſome ſmall game, having travelled ſome way into the woods was met by two Indians, who knocked the officer down and ſcalped him; the Dog was not noticed by the Indians, who, after the enemy had left his maſter, licked the wound, and tarried by the body for ſome time, often repeating his friendly aid, at length diſcovering ſome motion in the mangled body, the Dog (as though he knew that ſome further aſſiſtance was neceſſary to compleat a cure) ran to the fort; ſome officers at that time walking at a ſmall diſtance from the parade, the Dog run up to them fawning round them, and running from them towards the place where lay his maſter's almoſt lifeleſs body. The officers at firſt but little noticed him, but upon the Dog's repeating the ſame, they followed the friendly animal, who led them to the wounded man. The offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:038422_0162_1011EB1B1740CDF8"/>
carried the body to the fort, where, by proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication the maimed officer ſoon recovered his wonted health, and afterwards became an ornament to the American heroes."</p>
               <p>The Fox, Hare, Marten, Mole, Mink, Muſkquaſh, or Water-Rat, Mouſe, Rabbit, Squirrel, Skunk, Weaſel and Woodchuck are ſo well known in almoſt every part of the United States, that a particular deſcription in this book muſt be needleſs; I therefore ſhall paſs them over and proceed in the propoſed order to deſcribe ſuch as are commonly found in the Indian country, and are ſtrangers to this part of America.</p>
               <p>The Hedgehog and Porcupine ſo nearly reſemble each other that in deſcribing one the reader may form an idea of the other, although by ſome conſidere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as two diſtinct animals. It is about the bulk of a ſmall Dog, but of ſhorter legs; its body is covered with hair of a dark brown, and armed with quills on almoſt every part of the body; thoſe on its back are moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. Thoſe quills are this animal's defenſive and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive weapons, which at pleaſure he diſcharges at his enemy. Whenever they enter the fleſh in any degree, they will ſink into it, and are not to be extracted but by inciſion. The Indians make uſe of theſe quills in boring their ears and noſes to inſert their pendants,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:038422_0163_1013D2AFC9E67450"/>
and alſo as ornaments to their ſtockings, mogaſons, hair,  their fleſh is eſteemed by the Indians.</p>
               <p>The Mooſe by ſome is ſaid to be of the Deer kind, but on a cloſe examination 'tis found to be an animal of a diſtinct ſpecies from the Deer, both in its bulk and particular formation; the Deer being gant and of a ſlender body, long leged and light on the foot—its horns long, ſlender, round and branching. The Mooſe is in body nearly of the bulk of a well fed horſe, its legs ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more ſtockey—its horns near the baſe are nearly round and large, as they expand, more flat and leſs branching. This animal ſheds his horns annually—its hair is of a light grey, with a ſmall mixture of blackiſh red—the tail very ſhort—its fleſh is good food, nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing and eaſy of digeſtion; the upper lip when prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly cook'd is much eſteemed—its hide is very proper for leather, being thick, ſtrong, ſoft and pliable. The Mooſe never appears when in motion, but on a trot. This animal is rarely to be met with on or near the Scanyawtauragahrooote Iſland, its haunts being much further north—its food through the winter is the buds and moſs of trees.</p>
               <p>The Otter is an amphibious animal, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the Beaver in its head and fore parts of the body—its teeth are ſhaped more like a Fox or Wolf.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:038422_0164_1013BFC146D08D78"/>
The Otter's hair is much longer than that of the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and of a greyiſh caſt. This animal is to be met with in almoſt all parts of uncultivated America, is miſchievous, and if cloſely purſued will attack men as well as dogs—in the ſummer ſeaſon it feeds on fiſh, during the winter 'tis content with the bark of trees, &amp;c —its fleſh is of a fiſhy taſte and ſmell, and is not eaten but in caſes of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Raccoon. This animal is ſomething ſmaller than a Beaver—its legs ſhorter—its head is much like a Fox —its ears ſhorter, more round and naked—its hair is thick, long and ſoft, intermixed with a ſort of fur, which is of great uſe to the hatter—on its face a broad ſtripe of white runs acroſs it which includes the eyes, which are large—the teeth are ſimilar to a Dog's in ſhape and number—the tail is long and round, with annular ſtripes on it—the feet have five long ſlender toes, each armed with a ſharp claw by which they with eaſe climb trees into the extremity of the boughs—it uſes its fore feet like the Squirrel to feed itſelf—its fleſh in autumn, after being fattened on nuts, &amp;c. eats very good, and is much valued by the hunters in that ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Tiger. This is an animal much ſhunned by the Indians, as they are ravenous and of no conſequence when caught by the hunter; they are much in form like the Wolfe, armed with claws, long and very
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:038422_0165_1013D2A4DAC44B80"/>
ſharp; their hair is of a darkiſh fallow, and entirely free from ſpots—they ſecreet themſelves under the cover of ſome thick buſhes, and on the near approach of ſome animal or hunter, ſuddenly leaps from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, ſeizes its prey, which falls a ſacrifice; for from the Tiger's claws there is no eſcape; thoſe animals are but rarely met with, which the Indians eſteem as one of the greateſt favours.</p>
               <p>Wolf. This animal by ſome is called the wild Dog, and much reſembles him in its form; they are however much longer bodied and longer leged—their colour in general, is that of a dun or dark brown—ſome few are grey; whether this is owing to their great age, or is their natural hue, I am at a loſs to determine. The Wolf is a great night walker, and often thins the new ſettler's ſtock, as well the yearling cattle as ſheep and lambs in the interior parts of this country. Wolves often herd together in the night, which is generally known in the vicinity of their reſort, by the hideous yellings the Wolves are careful rarely to omit.</p>

                  <p>Black-Bird. There are three ſorts of birds in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica (that naturaliſts) diſtinguiſh under this name, viz. the Crow Black-Bird, which is of the largeſt ſize, and builds its neſt on high trees, inacceſſable to boys in queſt of bird's eggs; of this kind there are a great plenty; in autumn they are ſeen in large flocks, and greatly infeſt cornfields, and do much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by robbing the induſtrious farmer of the fruit of his ſummer's toil, unleſs prevented by timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions; however, their rapacity is but of ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, for when froſt nips hard they are ſeen no more for that ſeaſon; as they are birds of paſſage, they retire to ſome unfrequented and more favourable cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038422_0167_1013D2A91D58D140"/>
The ſecond ſort are of a ſmaller ſize than the former, and are diſtinguiſhed from them by the name of the Red-Wing Black-Bird, having the whole of its body covered with black feathers, except on the lower edge of its wings, which is of a bright ſcarlet—this ſort build their neſt on low buſhes, on or near ſwampy ground, their eggs are comeattible by boys, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for their ſcarcity when compared with the Crow Black-Bird. They are not (either ſort) prized for their ſongs. The third and laſt ſort are much ſmaller than either of the former, and are of a jet black, except a ſmall part of white on its head and back—this ſort build their neſts on the ground, and uſe a few warbling notes. The female is of a brown colour and is not a ſinger.</p>
                  <p>The Humming bird is peculiar to America, and is not known in any other part of the globe; 'tis the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of the feathered airy inhabitants—its legs are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally ſmall to its body, and are not biger than two ſmall needles—its plumage exceeds deſcription—it has a ſmall tuft on its head of a ſhining black—its breaſt is red—the belly white—the back, wings and tail a pale green—ſmall ſpecks of a gold caſt are ſcattered over the whole body—an almoſt imperceptible down ſoftens the colours, and produces the moſt pleaſing
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:038422_0168_1013BFBBEA7BE290"/>
ſhades—with its bill, which is proportionably ſmall to its body, it extracts moiſture from flowers, which is its nouriſhment; over which it hovers like a Bee, without lighting, conſtantly moving its wings with ſuch veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the motion is imperceptible; this quick motion cauſeth a humming noiſe, from whence it receives its name.</p>
                  <p>The Wacon-Bird is nearly the ſize of the ſwallow, of a brown colour, ſhaded about the neck with a bright green; the wings are of a darker brown than the body —its tail is compoſed of four or five feathers beautifully ſhaded with green and purple, and is three times as long as its body, it carries this length of plumage in the ſame manner as the Peacock does, but does not raiſe it into an erect poſition—the name of this bird ſignifies the bird of the great ſpirit, and is held in great veneration by the Indians, and treated by them as a bird of ſuperior rank to any of the feathered race.</p>
                  <p>The Whetſaw is of the Cuckoo kind, is a ſolitary bird, and rarely to be met with in the ſummer months —'tis heard in the groves; its noiſe ſounds like the whetting of a ſaw, from whence it receives its name.</p>

                  <p>As all the above mentioned ſnakes are to be found in many parts of the United States, except the Rattle-Snake and Turkey-Snake, I ſhall not attempt a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription of any except thoſe two.</p>
                  <p>Rattle-Snake. This ſerpent is of all the ſerpentile ſpecies moſt to be feared; its bite (if not prevented by ſome early and proper application) proves fatal—at its full growth 'tis about five feet in length, it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures round its body about eight inches, from its centre it gradually decreaſeth both towards its head and tail— the neck is ſmall, the head broad and depreſſed—they are of a brown colour—the eye appears of a bright red and very piercing—the upper part of its body of a brown, mixed with a ruddy yellow, and chequer'd with
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038422_0170_1013D2BBB57C7D58"/>
many regular lines of a deep black, gradually to a gold colour—the belly is of a pale blue, which grows fuller as it approacheth its ſides. This ſnake gives the trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller notice of his danger by ſhaking the rattles at its tail; the number denotes its age as one is added every year of its life.</p>
                  <p>The Turkey-Snake is about ſix feet in length, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally large in its body, and of a duſky colour— this ſnake takes its name from its preying upon the Wild-Turkey principally. The method of its taking the Turkey is in the manner following.</p>
                  <p>The ſnake on finding a tree on which the Turkeys are wont to rooſt at night, aſcends it, to its loweſt branches entwines its tail round a branch with its head downwards, draws its body into a ſmall compaſs, not unlike the form of a Waſp's neſt.

                  <p>The ſoil appears more rich in the Indian country than in any part of the United States, at leaſt in ſuch parts as I have travelled, the height and bulk of the trees clearly evinces this.</p>
