            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN this diſcourſe, I have uſed all plainneſs and ſimplicity, both of ſentiment, and ſtyle, agreeable to the nature, ſolemnity and importance of the ſubject; as alſo ſuitable to the deſign of the aged Miniſter's ſerious addreſs to the People, in the caſe of life and death in a moral view.</p>
            <p>THE publication hereof was deſired by ſome in the time of it, as it is by others ſince. Several of theſe annual diſcourſes have taken place ſince this: but if any one is publiſhed, I ſhould chooſe this, becauſe of its ſpecial propriety for my purpoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſolemn words of Moſes, from which I have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this kind of farewell to the people of my charge.</p>
            <p>IT is with ſelf diffidence, that I venture it out to public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and muſt aſk the readers candour; but, would humbly commit it to the divine bleſſing and influence, to render it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly profitable to the fathers, and their children after them.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE. DEDICATORY TO THE CHURCH AND CONGREGATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, UNDER MY PASTORAL CARE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR PEOPLE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AT the invitation of your fathers, long ſince departed, I came hither in October, 1716.—After ſome proper time, with the people on probation; had their unanimous call, to ſettle with them, in the work of the miniſtry, and accordingly was ordained thereunto in November, 1717.</p>
            <p>AT the expiration of <hi>fifty years,</hi> from my ordination, I gave you an half century diſcourſe, in November, 1767, from 1 Pet. i. 12, 13. "Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in remembrance of theſe things, although you know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth; yea, I think it muſt, as long as I am in the tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance; knowing that ſhortly, I muſt put off this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, even as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I will endeavour, that you may be able after my deceaſe, to have theſe things always in remembrance."</p>
            <p>WHICH diſcourſe, at the deſire you have had among you, and at the revolution of every year ſince that period, I have given you a diſcourſe, on ſome ſuitable ſubject for the occaſion: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind my ſelf, and you, of the riches of God's forbearance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: of our increaſing obligations to fill up our ſwiftly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time, with duty to God, and uſefulneſs to man. And that, with a juſt and practical regard, and reverence to the inviſible, untried ſtate beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>At the completion of the laſt year, I began a diſcourſe, from thoſe ſolemn affecting words of Moſes, Deut. xxx. 19. "I call
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018003_0005_0FA414E0626E54C0"/>
heaven and earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet life and death before you; chooſe ye life," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND now, at the ſixty-firſt year of my miniſtry, I reaſſumed the important ſubject, with enlargements; if poſſible, (through grace) to have my own heart and your's, deeply impreſſed with things ſo ſolemn and intereſting as are contained therein: for it ſurely becomes miniſters to uſe all means within the compaſs of their office and ability, for their own, and people's ſafety and happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT, notwithſtanding all the means of grace, here and there; and methods of providence alſo; even the very "terrible things in righteouſneſs;" of late, there have been a moſt evident decay of piety, and growing corruption of manners. Yea, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the commencement of the preſent war, which has ſpread iniquity more than equal to deſolation; replete with all manner of dreadfuls, and ſtill increaſing; which aggravates the diſeaſed guilty ſtate of the land, and heightens their danger.</p>
            <p>THIS with other reaſons, hath induced me to give you theſe anniverſary diſcourſes from the ſolemn and awakning words of Moſes, before recited: in hopes, that by the bleſſing of God, the ſame may be of ſervice to excite ſome proper reflections in the more <hi>thoughtleſs claſs</hi> of mankind, who have expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the witneſs of God and conſcience againſt them, for their great neglect of religion and ſalvation to this day—and to awaken reſolutions in the <hi>more ſerious,</hi> to improve better than ever their day, and advantages for theſe worthy purpoſes.—As alſo, to promote the revival of religion, in <hi>the beſt,</hi> ſo much needed in this day of moſt awful declenſion.</p>
            <p>I have always had a large field of buſineſs here; many to miniſter unto, not only publickly—but alſo privately, through
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018003_0006_0FA414E163EE1EC0"/>
all their changing ſcenes of life. While, with as great proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (as in any inſtance) might ſay, "who is ſufficient for theſe things?" And though I fear, as to many, I have laboured in vain; yet humbly hope, that thro' grace have had ſome fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, in this place; as I may obſerve to the glory of God, that in ſome of the firſt years of my miniſtry, there have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſeaſons, whereto appeared marks of a divine work upon the hearts of men, attended with laſting good fruits in the life. And though in later years, there hath not been obſerved any thing of the like extent, yet hopefully ſome inſtances of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſpiritual edification, ſome tokens of the ſpirit's influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at leaſt as the ſmall gleanings of the vintage.</p>
            <p>Now the importance of our ſubject from the words of Moſes, when juſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his life and miniſtry, together with the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that this may be the laſt diſcourſe from me, of this kind; may excuſe me in giving them on to you, that they may be with you, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen I can ſpeak to you no more, but in ſuch a form as this. And this by the grace of God, be more effectual to you, and children after you, than the perfect mode of ſpeaking hath been.</p>
            <p>You will then take it as a kind of laſt and dying advice to you and yours in after time—Oh receive in unto the very heart, that "life and death are ſet before you," and ſee to it, that you are not witneſſed againſt for refuſing life, and ruſhing on to death a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all authority and grace, until the door of hope be ſhut, and there be no remedy—Agreeable hereunto, ſuffer me to urge it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you in the language of the text, that "ye chooſe life that both you and your children may live." And for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, refer you to the counſel given you and children, in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part of the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>To ſay no more here, only this—in all your religion, reſt not
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018003_0007_0FA414E1E48C6260"/>
without integrity of heart; for without this, all fails of God's acceptance, and of ſaving advantage to ourſelves, therefore it is of the higheſt importance that we do not reſt in pompous ceremonies, parod<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and ſhow in religion, not yet in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the externals of it, even though the whole circle thereof; but realize the neceſſity of being <hi>God's workmanſhip,</hi> created in Chriſt Jeſus <hi>unto good works.</hi> Can there be a right ſpirit in our religion, without a new heart at bottom? And 'tis uprightneſs with God and men that is connected "with the Saviour of God, which is life." Now, as religion is the <hi>beſt thing</hi> any have, better than riches, honour, &amp;c. So the corruption of it by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in doctrine, eſpecially capital ones; or by hypocriſy in practice, is <hi>the worſt;</hi> moſt odious to the God of truth and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It muſt be fixed in our minds, that a right evangelical tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the heart, is the ſoul and life of all religion; the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and glory of them that have it; the very dreſs of the "King's daughters that is all glorious within," and much ſo without. 'Tis the upright that God beholds with approbation and pleaſure now: and who ſhall have dominion in the morning of the reſurrection, when they ſhall riſe to reign and be with Chriſt forever? Beyond all expreſſion and conception, happy in the everlaſting abodes of conſummate felicity above.</p>

            <p>AT this ſeaſon, I ſhall reſume the ſubject, introduced on tho laſt. The ſubject is important enough to bear taking up a ſecond time. Alſo to have ſome recapitulation of what was ſaid the year before—and copeous enough to admit of the deſigned enlargement at this time. I have before, endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſolemn truths and duties, contained in the words. I ſhall now briefly go over again with ſome of the capital articles, and leading ſentiments before given out; and then after reciting the laſt year's introduction to the whole, proceed to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on the ſubject. Truly, my hearers, the words I have read to you, moſt ſolemn and affecting, are worthy our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſolicitude to ſhare in the good of them.</p>
            <p>I have no ſooner recited this ſacred ſtriking paſſage, and you have reflected on the occaſion of my uſing it; but your thoughtful minds, with your fixed eyes, do view me as one draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the cloſe of his life and miniſtry. You will then
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018003_0009_0FA414E3600CCDB0"/>
ſeriouſly attend unto me, as a dying miniſter preaching to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, (though now) to a congregation that will moſtly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me, who have ſurvived by far, the moſt of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I began to preach unto.</p>
            <p>WHEN Moſes looked upon his work among his people to be near done, inſpiration taught him to give them a recapitulation of thoſe things he had delivered to them from God—the great <hi>doctrines</hi> of religion to guide their faith—and <hi>precepts</hi> thereof to govern their practice—together with the <hi>ſtatutes and ordinances</hi> of God, to direct their worſhip. As alſo, his <hi>promiſes</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their obedience; yea, and his <hi>threatnings</hi> to deter them from diſobedience: and then ſums up the whole, under the emphari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal expreſſions of <hi>life and death, bleſſing and curſing,</hi> which he had plainly ſet before them in the courſe of his miniſtry, humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to God, that he had ſo done; then moſt affectionately addreſſeth himſelf to the people of his charge.</p>
            <p>"THEREFORE, chooſe ye life, that both thou and thy ſeed may live." With reſpect to all this, Moſes ſaith, "I call hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth to record this day," this day of my very advanced age, when ſoon, very ſoon, you will hear me no more. God and your own conſciences teſtify againſt you, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that God has done for you, and by me, hath ſaid unto you, have continued in your ſin and neglect of duty. And ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe, who, hereafter are found thus diſobedient. All theſe implying that the ſame which is witneſs againſt the guilty, is witneſs for the obedient now and hereafter.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, the ſolemn words of my text may be thought applicable on the preſent occaſion, both as they look <hi>back</hi> (in <hi>a moral view</hi>) upon the like general courſe of a miniſter's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in his ſpecial office, and on the people's behaviour, under
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018003_0010_0FA414E4295A74D0"/>
the preaching of the word; and alſo as looking <hi>forward</hi> unto fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture duty, and the eternal ſtate, which the moral conduct of miniſters and people ſtand related unto. Whence I obſerved.</p>
            <p>I. THAT the ſum of a miniſter's duty, is to ſet life and death the bleſſing and the curſe, before the people of his charge. This general phraſe includes all the particulars of a miniſter's duty, as it is deſigned to ſpeak out the <hi>good</hi> of religion and ſalvation, and the <hi>evil</hi> of ſin and deſtruction: yea, this doth mean that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is to ſet before the people the whole ſyſtem of religion, with all the doctrines and precepts of it, &amp;c. together with the obligations to faith and practice, according to the divine requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. In a word, he is to preach the goſpel of Chriſt, which eminently holds up life to the believer, who is careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works; and moſt certainly ſhuts out from life the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, and diſobedient: and all the preacher has in charge to ſay to the people, he is to <hi>ſet before them</hi> in a plain, intelligible and engaging manner, not hide any part of God's council from them by obſcurity of language, or artful repreſentation of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to turn off people's minds from the juſt ſenſe they have</p>
            <p>II. OBSERVE when the miniſter is drawing near to the cloſe of his life and miniſtry, there is a ſpecial propriety in his remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of this, that he has by the grace of God been ſetting life and death before them in the courſe of his miniſtry: often opening the way of life by Jeſus Chriſt, and diſplaying the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord againſt the unbelieving and diſobedient. Now the miniſters declaring this with a ſolemn appeal to God and their conciences, has a tendency to put people upon ſolemnly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining how they have heard and improved, under the means of grace and life. And what would likely be their caſe, if they ſhould now be called hence? This alſo tends to ſolemnize the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018003_0011_0FA414E4E02E6F10"/>
miniſter's own heart, unto the better finiſhing his courſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and life, and to the giving account of his ſtewardſhip, with the <hi>joy of the faithful in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. I obſerved, that of the miniſter, upon a juſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf; is conſcious, that by the grace of God, he has plainly and faithfully ſet life and death before the people of his charge: he may then humbly appeal to God, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that he hath ſo done.—<hi>Moſes</hi> fully ſatisfied in this point, could and did call heaven and earth to witneſs hereunto: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to witneſs againſt the diſobedient, and for the obedient. And whoever ſince have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful; that in ſome meaſure they have been ſo, may in ſome imitation of Moſes, make the ſame kind of appeal.</p>
            <p>Now, this may add weight to what miniſters ſay in God's name, and people thus hear from God. This alſo ſhews 'tis of great importance, that the word be well ſpoken, and well attended unto. For, that God is witneſs, and that conſcience is witneſs to the whole, is what demands the attention both of miniſters and people, unto their duty—Yes, ſurely, it muſt be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that <hi>miniſters</hi> "do preach only the preaching that God kids them," and that <hi>the people</hi> do hear the word, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word of God, and not of man: that they hear, as for their lives, for indeed the life of the immortal ſoul, is intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned herein. Again, I obſerved,</p>
            <p>IV. THAT the ſolemnity of this appeal, together with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the whole matter, may well put miniſters upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting their people to chooſe life. And this as excited hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the good of it, to themſelves and their children, "that both they and their feed may <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018003_0012_0FA414E6E6758908"/>
SUCH a ſolemn appeal to God (as Moſes doth here make) may well be attended with a ſerious addreſs to the people; when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had ſet life and death before the people, in this ſtriking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt, i. e. with the glory of the one, and terror of the other, that they might have the argument in its full force opened to them, to gain their intelligent and free choice of life. Then like a faithful compaſſionate friend to them, he adds and ſays, in the language of moſt pathetic addreſs—"Therefore chooſe ye life, that both thou and thy ſeed may live." This was to ſtrike every paſſion, reach all the feelings of the intelligent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious heart, and theſe of the parent, for the dear pieces of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I then went on to the</p>

               <p>II. USE, whatever there was to recommend unto Iſrael of old, the duty urged in the text, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to chuſe religion and life connected therewith; taken from the high character and ſignal hiſtory of Moſes, which no meer man may pretend to;—Yet there is now and always, enough in the worth of life, and terror of death; as well as argument enough from the author, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of religion, to recommend the advice in our text. <hi>Therefore chooſe life,</hi> and ſo enough to recommend religion, to mens attention, and practice, in all ages. <hi>Life</hi> in the ſenſe of the text is what it is, ſome permanent good, which is known in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as that important ſomething, which connects the ſoul of man with the Deity, in whoſe <hi>favour is life.</hi> So that it may be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and known by the name of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Therefore it is of eternal conſequence to us, that we be found to have choſen life and the way that leads unto it, omitting any mention of ſeveral affecting ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the application, the laſt year, I ſhall now, go on, to the deſigned enlargement—and infer from the ſubject.</p>
               <p>III. THAT religion is no vague, uncertain trifling buſineſs, very far from this; when it is our conformity to God, and communion with him, our only road to eternel life. 'Tis indeed, too ſerious, ſolemn, and intereſting a buſineſs to be trifled with. Due thoughts of the author, and object of it; as alſo of the dignity and conſequences of it; utterly forbid treating <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

It muſt rather be treated with ſolid judgment and exactneſs; for it is a very critical and delicate buſineſs, by no means to be trifled with.</p>
               <p>RELIGION is a very <hi>critical buſineſs;</hi> juſt ſo, and no otherwiſe, than the word of God deſcribeth it.—Its <hi>Principles,</hi> truth, and nothing but the truth, ſo all error is its derect oppoſition its <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> "concerning all things perfectly right," oppoſit to every falſe way—its motives; ſimple and free of unhallowed ſelf—its <hi>exerciſes,</hi> ſpiritual, and ſuperior to every thing of nature and art.—its <hi>end and deſign</hi> truly ſublime, the glory of God and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018003_0014_0FA414E9021E7B00"/>
RELIGION, is alſo a very <hi>delicate thing,</hi> and cannot bear any thing to fully its beauty; and darken its glory, it will not bear with heterogeneous things; jaring principles, and eſpecially diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant with the ſtandard of orthodoxy. Nor will it bear with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability, off an on, as if it were <hi>a vague buſineſs</hi> neither certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this or that, it implys unexampled preceſſion, the very thing, that God hath determined; exactly this, and no other. It is of God, and muſt be eſteemed what he has ſaid, and doth require, and ſo to remain permanant like his "word which abide, for ever." never to be altered at the will of man, as if he may ſhew himſelf weary of truth, and ſtrictneſs. We muſt abide by its very principles, and continue ſteaddy in the practice, for God's honor, and our own happineſs, as he has deſigned it; view, and uſe it as an inſtitution worthy of God; fitted for us, both dignifying and beautifying to us, ſo that, God is jealous for the honor due to him, in the way of our faithfullneſs and ſteady practice. There muſt not be any ſhifting here, to ſuit the times, no kind of trifling here. In a word, true religion will not bear with fickleneſs, hypocriſy or ſloth; or any ſuch thing that is unfriendly to the power of it.</p>
               <p>Now then, if religion be of ſo fine and delicate a conſtitution, ſo ſuſceptible of injury by oppoſition, and even by miſtake, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that for doctrine and principle, which was no place in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that for its buſineſs, which the laws of religion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not; alſo conſidering the noble end which religion is fitted to promote. The glory of the Deity, and our own happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; it muſt certainly be of the greateſt importance, that we have juſt notions of, and pay a faithful regard thereunto. And this, as ever we would not be found to have affronted the author of its and ourſelves ſuffer accordingly. For religion is ſtamped with a divine authority, and trifling in it threatens our loſs of heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:018003_0015_0FA414EA85DD82B8"/>
SURELY then the inſtituting it for the end above ſaid, is not a waſte of divine wiſdom, goodneſs, &amp;c. which ſtrongly argues, that it muſt not be neglected or trifled with. Here the life and death ſet before us, in the moſt ſolemn manner, and will it do, (my hearers) to trifle in the caſe of life and death.</p>
               <p>IV. USE of exhortation to you and your's; "therefore chooſe life, that you may live, that both <hi>you and your children</hi> may live." But as life is a perſonal happineſs, and religion a perſonal thing, how will the parent's religion and chooſing life ſerve the life of the children? Why to be ſure it may be ſo, as here is a fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by the wiſdom and religion of the parents, for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to copy after; they beholding their parents ſtrictly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and conducting as perſons who have choſen the better part, and bound for heaven; may be awakened to a juſt ſolicitude about theſe important things, according to that, "train up a child in the way wherein he ſhould go," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>HERE is Moſes's addreſs to the people of his charge, that they chooſe life to the end, that both they and their ſeed may live. Well explained and urged in the following words, "that thou mighteſt love the Lord, and that thou mighteſt cleave unto him, for he is thy life;" which all ſhews that to chooſe life, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the choice and exerciſe of religion here ſummed up, in loving the Lord our God, with all our hearts, and cleaving to him in our whole life.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſo far as I may uſe the words of Moſes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are expreſſive of the divine council and compaſſion; let them be duly regarded by us, and this be ſeen in a practical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the one thing needful, in the well proved "choice of that better part, which cannot be taken away."</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018003_0016_0FA414EADD8DF6B8"/>
HOWEVER ſenſible of my failures in the office of a miniſter of Chriſt; yet, I hope I may, in ſome feeble imitation of Moſes, call heaven and earth to record this day; that I have by the grace of God been ſetting life and death before you, in the courſe of my miniſtry among you, which now completes ſixty-one years, ſince my ordination: and may I not hope that through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſing accompanying the word, I have been inſtrumental of the converſion and edification of ſome; while yet juſtly to be lamented, that many have not believed the report of the goſpel, may there in future time, be greater numbers believe and turn to the Lord.</p>
               <p>I am thankful that you have been ſenſible that my old age cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for ſtated help, and that you have been diſpoſed to call and ſettle a colleague with me, in the important ſervice of Chriſt. May you by him, have a rich ſupply of miniſterial ſervice, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the happieſt ſucceſs. And the God of all grace and God of peace, be with you and bleſs you and yours, in all their generations.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the times we are now fallen into, are exceeding difficult and diſtreſſing, yet carry in them much argument to keep up the worſhip of God in public and private, with utmoſt care to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit religion to future generations: for if religion fail from among a people, what is there left that is very worthy of their ſolicitude to hold and enjoy? But however diſtreſſing the preſent times, ſuch as <hi>America</hi> never knew before, for expence of blood and treaſure in our defence: and however great and general the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion from virtue and piety, even unparalleled, you have in the midſt of ſuch embarraſſments, and well indeed that you have ſet forward and accompliſhed the ſettlement of another miniſter, to preſerve the public worſhip of God among you in future time. May God have the glory and you and yours, the laſting benefit of it.</p>

THE importance of our ſubject, and my ſituation as near done ſpeaking to you, may give me warrant to give, and engage you to take the following as a kind of laſt and dying advice to you and your children, all agreeable to that of Moſes, "therefore chooſe life, that both thou and thy ſeed may live." To be more particular in ſome ſet form of advice,</p>
               <p>I. BE eſtabliſhed firmly in the belief of this prime truth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that "<hi>God is,</hi> and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him," which is the foundation of all religion. In this Athieſtical age, very eminently ſo, when ſo many, at leaſt practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deny the exiſtence of a God, as ſupreme law-giver and judge—that "live without God in the world," as if there was no God to give law unto them and judge them; let me ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat it, and preſſingly urge, that you have your hearts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this great truth, that certainly there is a God, one all perfect Being, neceſſarily and unchangeably what he is; the grand baſis of all religion. For, if there is no God, it could not with any propriety be ſaid, "if there be any virtue, if there be any praiſe think on theſe things," as there could not be any ſuch thing to employ the mind, ſince virtue and Godlineſs hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary relation to the certain exiſtence and perfections of deity, to require and reward the ſame. Therefore if any Athieſtical thoughts or deſires be ever ſuggeſted to you, reſiſt them, with vehement indignation, as infinitely impious and abſurd. For it is "<hi>the feel</hi> that even in his heart, <hi>ſaith there is no God,</hi>" which is to deny both his Maker and his own exiſtence at one ſtroke, and at once diſlodge all thoughts of religion, virtue and happineſs; and what a ſtrange kind of being muſt man be, without virtue and religion, as his proper exerciſe and buſineſs, and without God as the only true happineſs of an intelligent creature.</p>

II. BE eſtabliſhed in this, that God (moſt high, yet conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable with men) hath by his own gracious revelation, opened a converſe with fallen man, through his own ſon Jeſus Chriſt, the great medium of our intercourſe with heaven, and only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of our prayers and praiſes, and all our religion: in a word, God's way to us, and our's to him by faith.</p>
               <p>III. BE aſſured of this, that the ſcriptures of the old and new Teſtament, are the word of God: that they naturally prove the divinity of each other, as the former predictions in the old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, having their accompliſhment by facts of later date rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the new Teſtament, do prove that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God. Thus Chriſt himſelf alledgeth that his Meſſiahſhip and character, as he, ſon of God, and Saviour of men, is given out and proved by the writings of Moſes; for ſays he, "they are they, which teſtify of me; of me as I now appear, and am manifeſted in the very character foretold of the Meſſiah." Moreover, as the miracles of Moſes proved the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinty of his writings, ſo the unconteſtable miracles of Jeſus Chriſt proved the divinity of his goſpel: eſpecially his reſurrection from the dead, evident to his diſciples, was, and is clear proof of this. Further the divinity of the ſacred ſcriptures, appears from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine excellency of the matter the inimitable majeſty of the ſtyle, compoſed of greatneſs and ſimplicity, as no other writings are. So is the power and efficacy of the word of God upon the mind and conſcience, ſtrong proof of the point in hand. Yea, this ſame eſpecial evidence of the divine authority of the word, according to the deſign of Jer. iii. 28, 29. adduced to this very purpoſe; "for, what is the chaff to the wheat? Is not my word like fire, and like as a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" Now then, is not the given characters of the word of God, when verified by the work of the divine ſpirit on the mind and heart, good proof of the divine authority thereof.

Take it in theſe inſtances out of many. It is ſaid, "by the law is the knowledge of ſin. The law of the Lord is perfect <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the ſoul. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the heart." And all this effected by the ſpirit. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that when perſons are convinced of ſin, converted to God, and comforted in this way, by this means; and all this evidenced by fruits, which the word marks out as genuine; here is good proof of the divinity of the ſcriptures; in that God himſelf, doth hereby ſet to his ſeal, in confirmation of the truth of them. By this it appears, that his authority is really ſtamped upon them; and that they are indeed the word of God, and not of man, and to be taken by us, as "the faithful ſaying, worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation." Then let it be ſettled upon your hearts, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation is to apoſtate man, the only ſure and ſufficient rule of faith and practice, morally fitted to be the means of our converſion to God, and forming for heaven.</p>

Oh! my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſee that you ſet out right, and keep the road of truth and duty:" be not deceived, God "is not mocked;" the heart is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deceitful; ſelf flattery "but too natural to depraved man." And ſo there is an imbred proneſs to yield to the flattering ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe that lie in wait to deceive with their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, pleaſing to corrupt nature. Therefore, be on your guard, "not to be carried away with ſtrange doctrines,—with every wind of doctrine, to turn you from the faith once delivered to the ſaints," and yet continued unto them. Study your bible well, not to have revelation ſubject to reaſon; but <hi>this</hi> guided and governed by <hi>that</hi>

V. BE well eſtabliſhed in the connection of internal religion and ſalvation; the ſame as a connection of heart purity with a Chriſt. For as it is moſt evident there is ſalvation in no other, but Chriſt the one Mediator between God and man; and no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt without union to him; ſo no union to him without faith, which is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ought in us in our effectual calling. Not ſome time <hi>after,</hi> but <hi>in it.</hi> According to ſuch plain paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as theſe. Eph. ii. 10. "We are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good works." John, i. 12. "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God." The regenerate are ſons of God, born of him by his ſpirit: theſe are <hi>his workmanſhip created in Chriſt,</hi> i. e. renewed <hi>in him</hi> as united <hi>to him.</hi> So that it ſeems not agreeable to the language and ſpirit of the bible; that we conceive of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the order of time, before faith in Chriſt. Doth God by his ſpirit take a poor creature all in the rough, renew him in the whole man after his image, that he ſhall love God ſupremely, love his law as holy, and yet know nothing of Chriſt, and have no union to him by faith, while yet the ſcripture ſpeaks of men's being the children of God by faith, Gal. iii. 26. The truth is, that regeneration is prior to faith, only in the order of nature, and of their conception of things. We conceive of <hi>God's drawing,</hi> and then of <hi>our coming;</hi> but really they are together. As God draws, we come. So <hi>Mr. Polbil</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>acta, agit.</hi> The ſoul acted upon, doth act. Which appears to anſwer well to the deſcription of it. John, vi. 44. "No man cometh to the Son, but whom the Father draws." And what is his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if we come not? How is it an effectual calling if the extar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal call doth not take with us, and we don't come to Chriſt as offered in the goſpel?</p>
               <p>BE well informed in this point, according to the experience of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018003_0022_0FA414F0F07C0C60"/>
the church in Sol. Song, i. 4. "Draw me, we will run after thee." Is not regeneration the work of God within us, by which we are conformed to the <hi>image of his Son?</hi> Here is a Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the buſineſs. And can this be without any connection with him; without any knowledge of him, or faith in him? In a word, it ſeems that the renovation of our natures doth not take place, abſtract from Chriſt, any more than the juſtification of our perſons. The Apoſtle is full here: ſee I Cor. i. 30. "But of him are ye <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who of God is made unto us <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>ſanctification."</hi> And is it ſafe to think we have the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for heaven? <hi>Heart</hi> purity, without a Chriſt formed in us the hope of glory.</p>
               <p>Now, as religion is not any thing ſaving to us, unleſs it be a perſonal powerful principle of obedience to God; ſo this internal religion is what we have <hi>in our union to Chriſt by faith:</hi> the new creature is what it is <hi>in him,</hi> and cannot exiſt without him.</p>
               <p>VI. BE well eſtabliſhed in the connection of God's inſtituted means, and the end propoſed in our uſe of them. Now the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abundantly ſhew, that God hath in his infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, appointed external means with reſpect to our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yea, to our obtaining of ſaving grace. Means, well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our <hi>nature</hi> as men, and to our <hi>ſtate</hi> as ſinners: means which he makes uſe of by his ſpirit, for this purpoſe. As the ſpirit takes of Chriſt and ſheweth it unto us: and means which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us diligently and faithfully to attend on for his influence and bleſſing, to make them effectual unto us. So that to ſay, "there is no ſort of connection between the means and the end;" is an unſcriptural aſſertion. Indeed, there is no cauſal or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious connection, as if the means were thought to riſe into the place and character of <hi>an Efficant,</hi> or that by the beſt uſe we can make of them we could merit grace and ſalvation; yet there is
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018003_0023_0FA414F1AE84B100"/>
ſome ſort of connection, ſuch as is proper between means and end: and that the encreaſe or bleſſing, is God's prerogative to give; yet Paul is to plant, and Apollos water, and we to attend thereon. For "faith comes by hearing the word preached," the means inſtituted for that end. Therefore, be you faithful in the uſe of the means left you fall under the cenſure of thoſe that "frame not their doings (or ways) to turn unto the Lord," and fail of the bleſſing to be obtained in the way of duty. This the ordinary way of it: to be ſure more likely than in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of means. Examples in ſcripture are full to this purpoſe. And is not our ſanctification by the ſpirit, <hi>through belief of the truth,</hi> which is revealed and preached to us, according to that in John, 17. where our Saviour is full in this? <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> The written word contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means by which the ſpirit doth his work. And is the means we are to uſe to this purpoſe, evident by that in Rom. 10? <hi>How ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi> Which ſheweth there muſt be <hi>preaching</hi> the word, and hearing it. And how comes <hi>faith</hi> ordinarily, but <hi>by hearing?</hi> Thus internal religion is form'd in us.</p>
               <p>VII. SET out early and earneſtly in the buſineſs of religion, that divine ſervice you were eminently made for, and do owe to God that made you, and who only can make you happy. This advice is eſpecially addreſſed to the youth, agreeable to that of Solomon's; "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come," &amp;c. Intimating that the younger part of life is ordinarily moſt free of evil days. Of ſuch wherein is no pleaſure, except it be in religion.</p>
               <p>BUT the advice is alſo proper for thoſe in elder life, delay no longer now, but early and earneſtly apply to this ſerious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: whatever is your age now, delay no longer; for the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018003_0024_0FA414F26209F958"/>
off to a future day, under a notion of a more convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is a meer cheat, and danger enough, that be fatal: for they who put off to a morrow, are apt and want to do juſt ſo again, when the morrow comes; and ſo on, till a morrow be no more delay, will coſt you bitter repentance here or hereafter.</p>
               <p>AND dont think that a little religion will anſwer for God's acceptance and your ſafety: only going on in a circle of external duties (if you were come to that) with an unhallowed heart, will not be enough to pleaſe him, "with whom you have to do;" who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, but looketh on the heart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be very ſolicitous to have the foundation laid in <hi>the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſpirit unto obedience;</hi> in faith repentance, with ſelf-dedication to God, devotedneſs to him without reſerve, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond revocation.</p>
               <p>VIII. BE frequent and faithful in ſelf-examination into your ſtate and wants, &amp;c. which may be awakning to the ſinner, and improving to the ſaint. 'Tis a good guard againſt every kind of temptation, and friendly to every branch of religion. Yes, to be much at home communing with your own hearts, is a good way to be the more with God, in communion with him.</p>
               <p>IX. CONSCIENCIOUSLY attend God's inſtituted worſhip. Let not any trifling excuſes hinder you from conſtant attendance on it in <hi>public.</hi> Be ſteady in <hi>family worſhip,</hi> in reading the word and prayer. (not paſſing over that of the <hi>ſolitary kind</hi>) Let there be no prayerleſs families among you; and let no family diſcord have place within your houſe, leſt thereby your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be hindered. Let <hi>heads of families</hi> be faithful in the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government thereof; teach your children and ſervants <hi>ſound doctrine, which only is unto Godly edifying.</hi> Train them up well, like Abraham, "command your houſhold after you, to keep the way of the Lord." Be firm in Joſhua's reſolution;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018003_0025_0FA414F3E3885040"/>
"as for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord." And not a little with this view, that well regulated families, are the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the church and ſtate in their glory; but that the community of every kind is extremely injured by irreligion and diſorder in private families. Let <hi>children</hi> be obedient to their parents, as ever they would hope to ſhare in the promiſe annexed in the 5th commandment. And <hi>ſervants</hi> chearfully obey their maſters in the Lord. Let all in <hi>early life</hi> be far from thinking they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed in the vanities of children and youth, but rather attend to that advice, "young men and maidens (with old men and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) let them praiſe the name of the Lord." This a fit buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all ages, and through life. Let the <hi>aged</hi> be eminently ſober, grave, and of good behaviour, bringing forth fruit in old age to the glory of God, and their own comfort.</p>
               <p>UNTO one and all ages and characters, let me ſay, that it ſhould be a ſettled point with you, to be ſtrictly virtuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious: fail not of any breach of duty, in the whole circle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If <hi>moral virtue</hi> fail in your conduct, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> cannot flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Therefore, "that which is altogether juſt, &amp;c. thou ſhall follow;" or can you think to be followers of Chriſt, act out the Chriſtian in every way required, &amp;c. in every thing called for, without a ſtrict regard to moral virtue, in all righteouſneſs and charity?</p>
               <p>BUT perhaps it will be ſaid, how can ſuch important matters be attended to, againſt the impetuous current of wickedneſs? Againſt all the embarraſſments to virtue and religion, that crowd upon us, in times ſo diſtracted and diſtreſſing as the preſent? I reply, the ſtate of our affairs, both in a political and moral view, do indeed wear a dark aſpect; eſpecially, as our abounding ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and impieties do compoſe the darkeſt part of the cloud that hangs over us; and muſt needs ſtrike a thoughtful mind with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018003_0026_0FA414F4AF0DD660"/>
grief and lamentation; yet, and although <hi>Ichabod</hi> in ſome plain characters, is written upon this land; as the glory is awfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us; ſtill, let not the mourners in Zion, who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ark of God, be diſcouraged from conſtant fervent prayers for his return unto us, with his healing ſaving mercy; nor be diſcouraged from vigorous attempts of our reformation; for as God hath for his own name's ſake, ſaved his people of old, when on the brink of ruin: ſo, for his own name's ſake (ſtill as dear to him as ever) he may appear for us in our low eſtate, as many as our ſins are, and heavy as his judgments are; ſee Ezek. 22. where it is ſaid four times over,—"I will pour out my fury," &amp;c. But I wrought for my name's ſake. Nevertheleſs, mine eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and ſpared them from deſtroying them. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as God himſelf ſays, <hi>becauſe I am God, and not man.</hi> As in Hoſea, xi. 9. where, open to view, the moſt ſurpriſing ſtruggle between juſtice and mercy, and mercy prevailing, "how ſhall I give thee up Ephraim, &amp;c. mine heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled together? I will not return to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Ephraim in the fierceneſs of mine anger, but will ſurely have mercy on him, for I am God and not man, ſaith the Lord." A ſimilar ſurpriſing paſſage is that in Iſa. lviii. 18. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him:</hi> yes, the <hi>ways of my people,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore greatly aggravated. Yet, as bad as they are, I will heal him. So he may for his name's ſake heal us of our backſlidings, and give us repentence unto life. But "for this he will be enquired of to do it for us." And, as a juſt reflection on our abominable declenſion from God, together with his terrible things in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs at this day, may awaken us to our duty. So God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion (ever the ſame) may encourage us to ſtrive and pray for a reformation and the removal of his judgments. Shall we dare to indulge our ſtupidity, till our iniquity complete our ruin; till our all is gone, paſt recovery? The caſe is fairly ſtated thus, if ye
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018003_0027_0FA414F5603A61A8"/>
live after the fleſh, (and continue to do ſo) ye ſhall die, and there is no remedy. And how can the ſhort-lived pleaſures of ſinful gratifications more than ballance the horrors of eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as if it could not be wiſe, to be at the pains of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortification to eſcape it.</p>
               <p>To revert for a moment to the firſt paragraph under this laſt head of advice, and ſay, by no means forſake the aſſembling of yourſelves together for public worſhip; but be faithful and conſtant in the attendance on the inſtitutions of God's houſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the Lord's day; for, as ſlackneſs in this, and as to the ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath (as at this day) is an awful <hi>evidence</hi> of great declenſions already taking place; ſo if continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will be a terrible <hi>omen</hi> of moſt threatning declenſions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Oh this being weary of Sabbaths, and God's worſhip, do awfully expoſe us to God's caſting us off, to be no more his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for though he bear long, he will not bear always. And if <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> be written upon us, wo to us: as ſaid, "wo to them if I depart from them." But I would hope better things of you; and therefore proceed one ſtep further by way of advice.</p>
               <p>SPARE no pains in the Chriſtian work, or warfare, be very ſolicitous for a ſaving and ſatisfying connection with Chriſt, give up yourſelves to him by faith, love him ſupremely, make much of him, more than any other beloved, infinitely more, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Lord your only righteouſneſs: live by the faith of the Son of God, ſtrictly follow him, walk circumſpectly, (i. e. look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all around you) to eſpy danger from every quarter, from your own hearts, the world and Satan, as well as not to let any duty paſs unnoticed: lay up your treaſure in heaven, and have your hearts there as an evidence of this. Ever account it a prize worth contending for, and the ſpiritual warfare you muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in to obtain it; as you muſt liſt under Chriſt's banner, ſo
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018003_0028_0FA414F71F93DCC0"/>
fight the good fight of faith, to lay hold, and keep hold of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Put on the whole armour of God, eſpecially the ſhield of faith, and therewith uſe the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God, to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one. Reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation early, and give no place to the Devil: reſiſt him ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the faith of Chriſt's power and merit, yea, in a humble confidence in his grace to be ſufficient for you. However ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the ſtruggle may be, be reſolute and courageous in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual battle, with a reliance on Chriſt to be your ſupport, and to give you the victory. Never give over as to any branch of the Chriſtian work or warfare, however much you may be afflicted with oppoſition—but continue in well doing, and vigorous fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Shrink not back from the moſt vigorous efforts in ſo noble a cauſe: keep a good conſcience before, toward God and man: faithfully regard the dictates of a well enlightened conſcience in living well, and ſettling well the grand account for the laſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Oh then indulge not any thing that will not bear a look from God's all pervading eye; that will not bear a ſingle caſt from his dread tribunal, much leſs the full glare of eternity.</p>
               <p>THROUGH all life keep death and the future world in view, realizing their ſwift approach. In this view, keep up the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtruggle for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>IN the cloſe of theſe heads of advice, reſpecting faith and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhall only add, that whatever men believe and do, or feel and ſuffer, even in the bitter reflections of conſcience, it all dont make up a righteouſneſs to juſtify them before God. No, the true faith, ſincere obedience, and rich experience of eminent Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in the exerciſe of love to God and Jeſus Chriſt, in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. have not any thing in them of the nature of an expiatory ſacrifice
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018003_0029_0FA50B59538281C0"/>
and payment of our immenſe debt to divine juſtice. It is moſt evident, from the preſent ſtate of diſeaſed guilty man, from the whole current of the bible, and from every conſtitution of God; that all his pretences to juſtification and life, by any thing of his own, are utterly vain; which muſt not eſcape our notice, or fail of the ſtricteſt attention.</p>
               <p>THIS ſane is a very important matter to be ever in our view. Yea, a point as clear as any in all the bible, and abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed therein. It is obſervable, that early upon the fall of man, God declares againſt the vanity and folly of ſealing righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the deeds of the law, when once he had tranſgreſſed it. Accordingly he ſoon lets Adam know he may not attempt now to approach the tree of life: but ſo far from this, God drove him out of the garden; and ſet cherubims, and a flaming ſword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. But oh! how ſurpriſing the divine benevolence, that even before Adam's excluſion from Paradiſe, and prohibition of uſing the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he opens a new and living way by the promiſe of the ſeed of the woman to be the Saviour of men; the ſane that afterwards, is ſtiled <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VERY worthy of our remark it is, that God who is wont to ſpeak to us, eſpecially the moſt important things by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt, ſetting the one over againſt the other, that the light may appear the ſtronger, and have the greater effect; and often ſets forth the gloomy part of the contraſt firſt, though immediately after the encouraging part, as it were in the ſame breath. See the inſtance in Hoſes, xiii. 9. "O Iſrael, (O man) thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thyſelf, but in me is thine help." So that in Iſaiah, xxvii. 4, 5. "Who would ſet the briers and thorns againſt me in the battle? I would go through them and burn them together Or let him take hold of my ſtrength and make peace with me,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018003_0030_0FA50B59DF0B3C30"/>
and he ſhall make peace." I ſay it is worthy of remark, here in the caſe of Adam; he exhibits the bright ſide of the contraſt firſt: gives out the promiſe of a Saviour, before he fully opens upon the guilty creature the terrors of the broken law; as if he ſhould be prevented from any diſpair, (only in himſelf) and have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ready at hand the moſt powerful argument, to renounce ſelf, and truſt in an all-ſufficient Saviour. How thankful ſhould we be for the proviſion now made for our juſtification and life, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a goſpel plan, that humbles men, and exalts the Lord.</p>
               <p>I have finiſhed the whole, when I have added the appendix, uſual on ſuch occaſions; the account of <hi>baptiſms</hi> and <hi>deaths,</hi> in this ſociety, with ſome proper reflections.</p>
               <p>BAPTISMS this year, 40. Deaths, 36. Of theſe, infants, 5. Children from 2 years, with the youth to 25, are 10. From the age of 25 to 50, are 13. From 50 to 94, are 7. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo died here in a few weeks, of the French priſoners from New-York, 20. In all, 56.</p>
               <p>I have thus claſſed out the dead, that you might have before you a ſpecimen of demonſtration, that death ſpares no age or character, but runs through all ages, from the infant of days, to the eldeſt mortal: it ſeizeth on perſons of all characters, without diſtinction; ſparing not the moſt virtuous and uſeful, within its commiſſion. Very ſpeaking it is, that no age or qualification, ſecureth from the irreſiſtible ſtroke. So that none may boaſt of a morrow; when death in its rapid way to the living, may come to day ſuddenly, and unſuſpected as "a thief in the night."</p>
               <p>AND now by this look into the grave, into the congregation of the dead, who number on in all periods of life, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally filling up that vaſt collection in the ſilent abodes below: I ſay, by this view of what we are all haſtening unto, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to join
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018003_0031_0FA50B5A9CD30B28"/>
the dead, every one in his own order and time. May we thro' grace, be very ſolicitous to prepare each one for his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching change; ſo as that we may then attend with faith and fortitude to the <hi>ſolemnities of dying,</hi> which ſtand alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and never repeated. Indeed the <hi>ſolemnity of living</hi> with a juſt reference to <hi>dying,</hi> is next to it and connected with it; and this to be carried on through life: but that of dying is but once and alone; and not a little determined what it is by the manner and kind of our life. Then let us not ſpend our days as a tale that is told; ſoon out, and to little purpoſe. But may we hear of every age, capable of reflecting on the importance of living and dying well; moſt faithfully apply ourſelves to our great work "while it is day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work."</p>
               <p>IT is an old ſaying and a true one, delays are dangerous; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſo in the important matters of religion The King's buſineſs requires hoſte; the King of Kings will not have his poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, how expreſs his demand, that <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elay not to keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> The reaſon is plain; delay is keeping God out of his due; is a kind of refuſal to pay it at all. 'Tis very injurious to ourſelves, and threatens to be fatal. 'Tis certain our days haſten faſt to a cloſe; and if our work doth not go on in ſome good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion thereto, we ſhall be ſadly in the arrears of duty; and if the one thing needful is not done, what then but immerſed in the irretrievable ſtate of the ſlothful? And now having ſo many arguments to awaken our attention to our duty and intereſt, may we ſeaſonably and thoroughly attend thereunto; let us ſee to it that our hearts are right with God; that we make with him an everlaſting covenant, and eſpecially learn to live the life of the righteous, and have our laſt end like his. Oh! let us under the realizing views of death's approach and ſeizure, beyond any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in that war; be acting in the full character of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with right Chriſtian perceverance to the end. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the prayer of Moſes, "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom," that by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through life, a juſt and practical reference to death, and that final great account, we may commence <hi>the wiſe, that ſhall inherit glory.</hi> AMEN.</p>
