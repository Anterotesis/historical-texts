            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Mr. CHAIRMAN,</p>
                  <p>I heartily thank this reſpectable Aſſembly for the honour they have conferred upon me, but want words to expreſs the ſenſe I feel of their kindneſs. The mere accidents of meeting with particular books, and converſing with particular men, led me into the train of ſentiments, which the committee are pleaſed to think juſt; and others, with the like opportunities of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would much better have deſerved to receive the thanks, they now generouſly give. I conſider the approbation of this company as an evidence, that they entertain a favourable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my good intentions, and as an encouragement for all to apply themſelves, in theſe unhappy times, to the ſervice of the public, ſince even ſmall endeavours to promote that ſervice, can find a very valuable reward. I will try, during the remainder of my life, to remember my duty to our common country, and, if it be poſſible, to render myſelf worthy of the honour for which I now ſtand ſo deeply indebted.</p>
                  <p>I thank you, Sir, for the polite and affectionate manner, in which you have communicated the ſenſe of the committee to me.</p>
               </note> of this committee be given from the chair to JOHN DICKINSON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the great aſſiſtance they have derived from the laudable application of his eminent abilities to the ſervice of his country in the above performance.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN the committee for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a draught of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was appointed, it was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it would not be proper, to form ſome kind of a ſketch, however imperfect it might be, of all the grievances of the colonies, and of courſe of their conſtitutional rights.</p>
            <p>SUCH an attempt, tho' very rude, might be improved by better hands; and it ſeemed abſolutely neceſſary, no longer to conſine ourſelves to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional complaints and partial reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but, if poſſible, to attain ſome degree of certainty concerning our lives, liberties and properties.</p>
            <p>IT was perceived, that if the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be formed on this plan, they would comprehend many and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013247_0005_0F90435288F01DD0"/>
important poſitions, which it would be proper to introduce, by previouſly aſſigning the reaſons, on which they were founded. Otherwiſe, the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might not appear to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to be juſt. From this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it became neceſſary, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſtructions long and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative; and whoever candidly reflects on the importance of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, will think ſuch a method very juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>THE draught of inſtructions being brought into the provincial commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee and read, and no objection being made to any of the principles aſſerted in them, it was not thought neceſſary, that the argumentative part ſhould continue any longer in them. The committee, that brought in the draught, therefore moved, that this part of the inſtructions might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt. Whereupon the draught was re committed, for this purpoſe, to the committee, that brought it in. This was done.</p>

The additions are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by crotchets, thus [ ] and in theſe it was not thought neceſſary to obſerve the ſtile of inſtructions.

            <p>FOR attaining this great and deſirable end, we requeſt you to appoint a proper number of perſons to attend a congreſs of deputies from the ſeveral colonies, appointed, or to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by the repreſentatives of the people of the colonies reſpectively in aſſembly, or convention, or by delegates choſen by the counties generally in the reſpective colonies, and met in provincial committee, at ſuch time and place as ſhall be generally agreed on: And that the deputies from this province may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and encouraged to concur in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as may be deviſed for the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, we think it proper, particularly to inform you, how far, we apprehend, they will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in their conduct by their conſtituents.</p>

[<hi>In this place was inſerted the argumentative part, which in this publication is called "An Eſſay."</hi>]</p>
            <p>THE aſſumed parliamentary power of internal legiſlation, and the power of regulating trade, as of late exerciſed, and deſigned to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, we are thoroughly convinced, will prove unfailing and plentiful ſources of diſſentions to our mother country and theſe colonies, unleſs ſome expedients can be adopted to render her ſecure of receiving from us every emolument, that can in juſtice and reaſon be expected, and us ſecure in our lives, properties, and an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſhare of commerce.</p>
            <p>MOURNFULLY revolving in our minds the calamities, that, ariſing from theſe diſſentions, will moſt probably fall on us and our children, we will now lay before you the particular points we requeſt of you to procure, if poſſible, to be finally decided; and the meaſures that appear to us moſt likely to produce ſuch a deſirable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of our diſtreſſes and dangers. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire of you—</p>
            <p>FIRST. That the Deputies you appoint, may be inſtructed by you ſtrenuouſly to exert themſelves, at the enſuing Congreſs, to obtain a renunciation, on the part of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013247_0024_0F904366B94E7C88"/>
all powers under the ſtatute of the 35 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, chapter the 2d—of all powers of internal legiſlation—of impoſing taxes or duties internal or external—and of regulating trade, except with reſpect to any new articles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which the Colonies may hereafter raiſe, as ſilk, wine, &amp;c. reſerving a right to carry theſe from one colony to another—a repeal of all ſtatutes for quartering troops in the Colonies, or ſubjecting them to any expence on account of ſuch troops—of all ſtatutes impoſing duties to be paid in the Colonies, that were paſſed at the acceſſion of his preſent Majeſty, or before this time; which ever period ſhall be judged moſt adviſeable—of the ſtatutes giving the courts of admiralty in the colonies greater power than courts of admiralty have in <hi>England</hi>—of the ſtatutes of the 5th of <hi>George</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, chapter the 22d, and of the 23d of <hi>George</hi> the ſecond, chapter the 29th—of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for ſhutting up the port of Boſton—and of every other ſtatute particularly affecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> paſſed in the laſt ſeſſion of Parliament.</p>
            <p>IN caſe of obtaining theſe terms, it is our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it will be reaſonable for the colonies to engage their obedience to the acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commonly called the acts of navigation,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013247_0025_0F904367B000B628"/>
and to every other act of parliament declared to have force, at this time, in theſe colonies, other than thoſe above mentioned, and to confirm ſuch ſtatutes by acts of the ſeveral aſſemblies. It is alſo our opinion, that taking example from our mother country, in aboliſhing the "courts of wards and liveries, tenures in capite, and by knight's ſervice, and purveyance," it will be reaſonable for the colonies, in caſe of obtaining the terms before mentioned, to ſettle a certain annual revenue on his majeſty, his heirs and ſucceſſors, ſubject to the controul of parliament, and to ſatisfy all damages done to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> company.</p>
            <p>THIS our idea of ſettling a revenue, ariſes from a ſenſe of duty to our ſovereign, and of eſteem for our mother country. We know and have felt the benefits of a ſubordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with her. We neither are ſo ſtupid as to be ignorant of them; nor ſo unjuſt as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. We have alſo experienced the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of gratitude and love, as well as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from that connexion. The impreſſions are not yet eraſed. We conſider her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with tender concern. We have not been wanting, when conſtitutionally called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to aſſiſt her to the utmoſt of our abilities; inſomuch that ſhe has judged it reaſonable to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013247_0026_0F90436BD33C35A8"/>
make us recompences for our overſtrained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions: And we now think we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more than we do, to the alleviation of her burthens.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER may be ſaid of theſe propoſals on either ſide of the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> this is not a time, either for timidity or raſhneſs. We perfectly know, that the great cauſe now agitated, is to be conducted to a happy concluſion, only by that well tempered compoſition of counſels, which firmneſs, prudence, loyalty to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, reſpect to our parent State, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to our native country, united muſt form.</p>
            <p>By ſuch a compact, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will ſecure every benefit, that the parliamentary wiſdom of ages has thought proper to attach to her. <hi>From her alone</hi> we ſhall continue to receive manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>To her alone</hi> we ſhall continue to carry the <hi>vaſt multitude of enumerated articles</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, the exportation of which her policy has thought fit to <hi>confine to herſelf. With ſuch parts of the world only,</hi> as ſhe has appointed us to deal, we ſhall continue to deal; and <hi>ſuch commodities only,</hi> as ſhe has permitted us to bring from them, we ſhall continue to bring. The <hi>executive</hi> and <hi>controuling</hi> powers of the crown will retain their

preſent full force and operation. We ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly labour for her as affectionate <hi>friends,</hi> in time of tranquility; and cheerfully ſpend for her, as dutiful <hi>children,</hi> our treaſure and our blood, in time of war. She will receive a <hi>certain income</hi>

An annual ſum is granted by the public for a public uſe, as keeping up a harbour, or the like. A private man, by intereſt, gets a grant of the jobb; the public concern is neglected, and the public poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket picked.

expence of collecting it—without being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſturbed by complaints of grievances, which ſhe cannot juſtify, and will not redreſs. In caſe of war, or in any emergency of diſtreſs

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013247_0031_0F9043718463EE90"/>
up in the proſperity of our mother country. Our union, founded on mutual compacts and mutual benefits, will be indiſſoluble, at leaſt more firm, than an union perpetually diſturbed by diſputed rights and retorted injuries.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:013247_0032_0F9043720EAF3F30"/>
SECONDLY. If all the terms abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot be obtained, it is our opinion, that the meaſures adopted by the congreſs for our relief ſhould <hi>never</hi> be <hi>relinquiſhed</hi> or <hi>intermitted,</hi> until <hi>thoſe</hi> relating to the troops,—internal le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation,—impoſition of taxes or duties here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,—the 35th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, chapter the 2d,—the extenſion of admiralty courts,—the port of <hi>Boſton</hi> and the province of <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> are obtained. Every modification or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of <hi>theſe</hi> points, in our judgment ſhould be inadmiſſible. To obtain them, we think it may be prudent to ſettle ſome revenue as above-mentioned, and to ſatisfy the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> company.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY. If neither of theſe plans ſhould be agreed to, in congreſs, but ſome other of a ſimilar nature ſhall be framed, though on the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013247_0033_0F904372D0A76D80"/>
terms of a revenue, and ſatisfaction to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> company, and though it ſhall be agreed by the congreſs to admit no modification or qualification in the terms they ſhall inſiſt on, we deſire your deputies may be inſtructed to concur with the other deputies in it; and we will accede to, and carry it into execution as far as we can.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY. As to the regulation of trade—we are of opinion, that by making ſome few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, the commerce of the colonies might be ſettled on a firm eſtabliſhment, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and them, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubject to no future alterations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mutual conſent. We deſire to have this point conſidered by the congreſs; and ſuch meaſures taken, as they may judge proper.</p>
            <p>IN order to obtain redreſs of our common grievances, we obſerve a general inclination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the colonies of entering into agreements of non-importation and non-exportation. We are fully convinced, that ſuch agreements would withhold very large ſupplies from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and no words can deſcribe our contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of thoſe coloniſts, if any ſuch there are, who, from a fordid and ill-judged attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their own immediate profit, would purſue that, to the injury of their country, in
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013247_0034_0F9043738D2088E0"/>
this great ſtruggle for all the bleſſings of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It would appear to us a moſt waſteful fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, that would loſe every important poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by too ſtrict, an attention to ſmall things, and loſe alſo even theſe at the laſt. For our part, we will cheerfully make any ſacrifice, when neceſſary, to preſerve the freedom of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But other conſiderations have weight with us. We wiſh every mark of reſpect to be paid to his majeſty's adminiſtration. We have been taught from our youth to entertain tender and brotherly affections for our fellow ſubjects at home. The interruption of our commerce muſt diſtreſs great numbers of them. This we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to avoid. We therefore requeſt, that the deputies you ſhall appoint may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to exert themſelves, at the congreſs, to induce the members of it, to conſent to make a full and preciſe ſtate of grievances and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent yet firm claim redreſs, and to wait the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, before any other ſtep is taken. It is our opinion, that perſons ſhould be appointed and ſent home to preſent this ſtate and claim, at the court of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the congreſs ſhall chuſe to form agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of non-importation and non-exportation immediately, we deſire the deputies from this province will endeavour to have them ſo formed
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013247_0035_0F9043743853FBA0"/>
as to be binding upon all, and that they may be PERMANENT, ſhould the public intereſt require it. They cannot be <hi>efficacious,</hi> unleſs they can be <hi>permanent;</hi> and it appears to us that there will be a danger of their being infringed, if they are not formed with great caution and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have determined in the preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public affairs to conſent to a ſtoppage of our commerce with <hi>Great Britain</hi> only; but in caſe any proceedings of the parliament, of which notice ſhall be received on this continent, before or at the congreſs, ſhall render it neceſſary, in the opinion of the congreſs to take further ſteps, the inhabitants of this province will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt ſuch ſteps, and do all in their power to carry them into execution.</p>
            <p>THIS extenſive power we commit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, for the ſake of preſerving that unanimity of counſel and conduct, that alone can work out the ſalvation of theſe colonies, with a ſtrong hope and truſt, that they will not draw this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince into any meaſure judged by us, who muſt be better acquainted with its ſtate than ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, highly inexpedient. Of this kind, we know any other ſtoppage of trade, but of that with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> will be. Even this ſtep we ſhould be extremely afflicted to ſee taken by the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013247_0036_0F9043750EA25A68"/>
congreſs, before the other mode above pointed out is tried. But ſhould it be taken, we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that a plan of reſtrictions may be ſo framed, agreeable to the reſpective circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſeveral colonies, as to render <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſenſible of the imprudence of her counſels, and yet leave them a neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. And here it may not be improper to take notice, that if redreſs of our grievances cannot be wholly obtained, the extent or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our reſtrictions may, in ſome ſort, be proportioned to the rights we are contending for, and the degree of relief afforded us. This mode will render our <hi>oppoſition</hi> as <hi>perpetual</hi> as our <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and will be A CONTINUAL CLAIM AND ASSERTION OF OUR RIGHTS. We cannot expreſs the anxiety, with which we wiſh the conſideration of theſe points to be recommended to you. We are perſuaded, that if theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies fail of unanimity or prudence in forming their reſolutions, or of fidelity in obſerving them, the oppoſition by non-importation and non-exportation agreements will be ineffectual; and then we ſhall have only the alternative of a more dangerous contention, or of a tame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013247_0037_0F904375B9CA4BD8"/>
UPON the whole, we ſhall repoſe the higheſt confidence in the wiſdom and integrity of the enſuing congreſs: And though we have, for the ſatisfaction of the good people of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, who have choſen us for this expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, offered to you ſuch inſtructions, as have appeared expedient to us, yet it is not our meaning, that by theſe or by any you may think proper to give them, the deputies appointed by you ſhould be reſtrained from agreeing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meaſures, that ſhall be approved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. We ſhould be glad the deputies choſen by you could, by their influence, procure our opinions hereby communicated to you to be as nearly adhered to, as may be poſſible: But to avoid difficulties, we deſire that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by you, to agree to any meaſures that ſhall be approved by the congreſs, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this province having reſolved to adopt and carry them into execution—Laſtly—We deſire the deputies from this province, may endeavour to procure an adjournment of the congreſs, to ſuch a day as they ſhall judge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the appointment of a ſtanding commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</p>
            <p>AGREED, that <hi>John Dickinſon, Joſeph Read,</hi> and <hi>Charles Thomſon,</hi> be a committee to write to the neighbouring colonies, and communicate to them the reſloves and inſtructions.</p>

            <p>THE authority of parliament has within theſe few years been a queſtion much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; and great difficulty, we underſtand, has occurred, in tracing the line between the rights of the mother country and thoſe of the colonies. The modern doctrine of the former is indeed truly remarkable; for though it points out, what <hi>are not</hi> our rights, yet we can never learn from it, what <hi>are</hi> our rights.

            <p>WHATEVER difficulty may occur in tracing the line, yet we contend, that by the laws of God, and by the laws of the conſtitution, a line there muſt be, beyond which her authority cannot extend. For all theſe laws are<note n="§" place="bottom">

As the ſoul, ſpeaking of nature, has a right to prevent or relieve, if it can, any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the body of the individual, and to keep it in the beſt health; ſo the ſoul, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the conſtitution, has a right to prevent, or relieve, any miſchief to the body of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and to keep that in the beſt health. The "evident conſequence" mentioned, muſt mean a tendency to injure this health, that is, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the happineſs of the people—or it muſt

If therefore, the conſtitution "DECLARES <hi>by evident conſequence;</hi>" that a tendency to diminiſh the happineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a proof, that power exceeds a "bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry," beyond which it ought not to "go;" the matter is brought to this ſingle point, whether taking our money from us without our conſent, depriving us of trial by jury, changing conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of government, and aboliſhing the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the writ of <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> by ſeizing and<note n="‖" place="bottom">

                  <p>"But in order to ſay ſomething more particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject, let us obſerve that the natural ſtate of nations in reſpect to each other, is that of ſociety and peace. This ſociety is likewiſe a ſtate of equality and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, which eſtabliſhes a parity of right between them; and engages them to have the ſame regard and reſpect for one another. Hence the general principle of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is nothing more than the general law of ſociability, which obliges all nations that have any intercourſe with one another, to practiſe thoſe duties to which individuals are naturally ſubject.</p>
                  <p>"Theſe remarks may ſerve to give us a juſt idea of that art, ſo neceſſary to the directors of ſtates, and diſtinguiſhed commonly by the name of <hi>polity.</hi> Polity conſidered with regard to foreign ſtates, is that ability and addreſs by which a ſovereign provides for the preſervation, ſafety proſperity and glory of the nation he governs, by reſpecting the laws of juſtice and humanity: that is, without doing and injury to other ſtates, but rather by procuring their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as much as in reaſon can be expected. Thus the polity of ſovereigns is the ſame as prudence among private people; and as we condemn in the latter any art or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that makes them purſue their own advantage to the prejudice of others, ſo the like art would be cenſurable in princes, were they bent upon procuring the advantage of their own people by injuring other nations.

Or ſhall we not rather conſider them as barbarous practices; practices from which every juſt and well governed nation ought to refrain.

                  <p>That the plan of governing us by withholding <hi>neceſſaries of life</hi> has been conſidered, and in what light colonies are viewed at home, the following extracts will partly ſhew."</p>
                  <p>It appears that the original and grand evil attending them was, the ſettlement of <hi>ſo conſiderable a part</hi> in a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate incapable of yielding the commodities wanting in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe northern colonies, long after <hi>their diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous</hi> nature was known, were continually increaſed by freſh migrations from <hi>Europe;</hi> which, as I before obſerved, ought totally to have been prevented, and ſuch migrations have been encouraged only to the beneficial colonies.</p>
                  <p>Since the late war, <hi>Britain</hi> laid the trade of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies under ſome very ſtrict regulations, which certainly cut off many inlets by which they formerly received much <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> coin. The <hi>principle</hi> upon which ſuch regulations were formed, of ſecuring to the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alone <hi>all matters of commerce,</hi> I have already attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:013247_0076_0F90439DA2509B60"/>
                  <p>When once their ſupernumeraries are become manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers, it will require more than <hi>Britiſh</hi> policy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into planters.</p>
                  <p>I muſt think this point of ſuch great importance, as to extend probably to the <hi>annihilation of manufacturers</hi> in our colonies—To conclude, it is in the propoſed ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Ohio</hi> we muſt <hi>firſt</hi> look for hemp and flax; as ſuch great numbers of the old <hi>American</hi> farmers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and ſettled there, which may, in thoſe fertile tracts, be cultivated in ſuch abundance, as to enable us to underſell all the world, as well as ſupply our own conſumption. It is on thoſe high, dry, and healthy lands, that vineyards will be cultivated to the beſt advantage, as many of thoſe hills contain quarries of ſtone, † and not in the unhealthy ſea-coſts of our <hi>preſent</hi> colonies. To theſe we ſhould bring the ſettlers from <hi>Europe,</hi> or at leaſt ſuffer none to go <hi>north</hi> of <hi>New-York;</hi> by which means our numbers would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in thoſe parts, where it is our intereſt they ſhould increaſe; and the report of the ſettlers from the new colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny on the <hi>Ohio</hi> would be a conſtant drain of people from our <hi>unprofitable</hi> northern ones, by which means they would, in future times, as well as the preſent, be prevented from extending their manufactures.</p>
                  <p>What I ſhall therefore venture to propoſe is, that the government, <hi>through the means of a few merchants</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>American</hi> trade, that can be tolerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, ſhould eſtabliſh <hi>factons</hi> at <hi>Boſton, Philadelphia, New York,</hi> and a few other ports, for the ſale of ſuch car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures as ſhould be conſigned to them; and to conſiſt of ſuch particularly as were moſt manufactured in the province, with directions immediately and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>underſell</hi> all ſuch colony manufactures. By this means the operation of the ſucceeding meaſures, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013247_0077_0F90439FCCE37428"/>


of hands rendered idle, would be ſo much the eaſier to be executed.</p>
                  <p>The ſhips which carried out ſuch cargoes ſhould be large bulky ones, of eight, nine hundred, and one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tons burden, for the ſake of bringing large quantities of deals, &amp;c. back, at a leſs proportionate expence; and, previous to their arrival in <hi>America,</hi> cargoes of theſe ſhould be ready for them. The coloniſts ſhould be engaged to work their iron mines, and get the product ready in bars, &amp;c. and vaſt quantities of deals and ſquared timber ready for loading the ſhips: All which, on the certain and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate proſpect of a ſale would eaſily be effected; as it is well known they have more than once proved to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they could ſupply all <hi>Europe</hi> with theſe articles, had they but the <hi>demand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I laid it down as a rule to proceed upon, that <hi>trade, fiſhing,</hi> and <hi>manufacturing,</hi> were put an entire ſtop to among the colonies.</p>
                  <p>If the ſugar iſlands contained ten millions of people, AS DESTITUTE OF NECESSARIES as they are at preſent, <hi>Britain</hi> would be as SURE of their allegiance as ſhe is at preſent—provided no power more formidable than herſelf at ſea aroſe for their protection.</p>
                  <p>The firſt dependance of our colonies, as well as all their people, is, to change the terms a little, upon corn worked into bread and iron wrought into implements; or, in other words, it is upon <hi>neceſſary</hi> agriculture and <hi>neceſſary</hi> manufactures; for a people who do not poſſeſs theſe, to think of throwing off the yoke of another <hi>who ſupplies them with them,</hi> is an abſurd idea. This is preciſely the caſe with our ſugar iſlands. Let us ſuppoſe the continental colonies to be as happy in the <hi>neceſſary agriculture</hi> as they really are, but to be abſolutely without manufactures, could they throw off their allegiance to <hi>Britain</hi> be their numbers
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013247_0078_0F90439FF7CAFD50"/>

what they would? No. certainly; for that is nothing more than ſuppoſing they ſhould throw off their allegiance to hoes and ſpades, and <hi>coats</hi> and <hi>ſhoes,</hi> which is abſurd to imagine: can any one imagine that a rebellion can be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on among a people, when the greateſt ſucceſs muſt be attended with the loſs of <hi>half</hi> the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life!</p>
                  <p>The following, among other effects relative to this point, would be the conſequence of the <hi>plan</hi> ſketched out in the preceding ſection.</p>
                  <p>The people would depend on <hi>Britain</hi> for thoſe <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life</hi> which reſult from manufactures.</p>
                  <p>The cultivation of <hi>ſtaples</hi> would be more profitable to them than any other employment whatever.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſale</hi> of thoſe ſtaples would depend on <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people would all be <hi>ſpread</hi> over an immenſe country as planters;—none of them collected in towns.<note n="*" place="bottom">"This point, which is of infinite importance, would pretty fully be occaſioned by other parts of the plan.

The premiſes by no means warrant this concluſion. It is built on a mere ſuppoſition, that, the colonies are thereby acknowledged to be <hi>within the realm,</hi> and on an incantation expected to be wrought by ſome magic force in thoſe woods.

But a general legiſlative power, is not a power to preſerve that connection, but to diſtreſs and enſlave them.

ſatisfactory conſiderations. It was a very uſeleleſs exerciſe of their virtues, for their poſterity. It they had <hi>by accident</hi> ſettled an <hi>"uninhabited"</hi> country, the invaluable rights of the common law would have <hi>attended</hi> them; but when they <hi>dared</hi> to obtain a ſettlement by <hi>humanity</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> they <hi>forfeited</hi> all rights of the common law, to the lateſt ſucceeding ages. <hi>Can this be law?</hi> Every caſe quoted by the Judge, it is humbly apprehended, makes a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between ſtates or ſocieties compoſed of <hi>Engliſh ſubjects,</hi> and thoſe compoſed of <hi>"conquered"</hi> people, &amp;c. and that <hi>this</hi> is, the only diſtinction warrantable by thoſe caſes.

                  <p>It is very remarkable, how our ableſt antagoniſts are perplexed in framing their arguments againſt us. Even the learned judge does not expreſs himſelf with his uſual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity: But the want of it is well atoned, if we, coloniſts, can be thereby deprived of the benefits of the <hi>common law,</hi> and be abſolutely ſubjected to the <hi>king;</hi> for <hi>theſe</hi> courtly tenets are the <hi>only</hi> conſequences deducible from the curious <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that tends to involve <hi>theſe colonies</hi> in the misfortunes of "<hi>conquered, ceded,</hi> or <hi>infidel</hi> countries." The "controul of parliament," is aſſerted to be ſupreme, in every caſe. Whether the colonies were ſettled in "uninhabited countries," or in "conquered, ceded, or infidel countries," makes no difference as to <hi>that</hi> point.</p>
                  <p>Another learned gentleman has diſcovered, that we "are not entitled to as great a degree of freedom as <hi>Ireland.</hi>" Why?

A PARLIAMENTARY power of <hi>internal legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> over theſe colonies, appears therefore to us, equally contradictory to humanity and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and illegal.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond head, a power of regulating our trade, our opinion is, that it is legally veſted in parliament, not as a ſupreme legiſlature over theſe colonies, but as the ſupreme legiſlature and full <hi>repreſentative</hi> of the parent ſtate, and the only judge between her and her children in commercial intereſts, which the nature of the caſe, in the progreſs of their growth admitted.

on <hi>a few plain principles.</hi> The plauſible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the objection conſiſts in a confuſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſeveral points, entirely diſtinct in their nature, and leading to conſequences direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to each other. There was a time, when <hi>England</hi> had no colonies. Trade was the object ſhe attended to, in encouraging them. A love of freedom was manifeſtly the chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the adventurers. The connexion of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies with their parent ſtate, may be called a new object of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> laws. That her right extinguiſhes all their rights,—rights eſſential to freedom, and which they would have enjoyed, by remaining in their parent ſtate, is offenſive to reaſon, humanity, and the conſtitution of that ſtate. Colonies could not have been planted on <hi>theſe</hi> terms. What <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> but an ideot, would have become a coloniſt on theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? to mention no more particulars, "That every ſhilling he gained, might rightfully be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him—trial by jury aboliſhed—the building houſes or making cloths with the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials found or raiſed in the colonies prohibited—and armed men ſet over him to govern him in every action?"</p>

HAD theſe provinces never been ſettled—had all the inhabitants of them now living, been born in <hi>England,</hi> and reſident there, they would now enjoy the rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> that is, they would be free <hi>in that kingdom.</hi> We claim <hi>in the colonies</hi> theſe and no other rights. <hi>There</hi> no other kingdom or ſtate interferes. But their trade, however, important it may be, as the affairs of mankind are circumſtanced, turns on other principles. All the power of parliament cannot regulate <hi>that</hi> at their pleaſure. It muſt be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated not by parliament alone, but by treaties and alliances <hi>formed by the king</hi> WITHOUT THE CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT OF THE NATION, with other ſtates and kingdoms. <hi>The freedom of a people conſiſts in being governed by laws, in which no alteration can be made, without their consent.</hi> Yet the wholeſome force of theſe laws is <hi>confined</hi> to the limits of their own country. That is, a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlature to a people, which acts <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> over that people, and inevitably implies <hi>perſonal</hi> aſſent, <hi>repreſentation,</hi> or <hi>ſlavery.</hi> When an univerſal empire is eſtabliſhed, and not till then, can regulations of trade properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, acts of ſupreme legiſlature. It ſeems from many authorities, as if almoſt the whole power of regulating the trade of <hi>England</hi> was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly veſted in the crown. One reſtriction appears to have been, that no duty could be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the conſent of parliament. Trade
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013247_0121_0F904C3C2F6024B0"/>
was little regarded by our warlike anceſtors. As commerce became of more importance, duties, and ſeverities were judged neceſſary additions to its firſt ſimple ſtate, parliament more and more interfered. The conſtitution was always free, but not always exactly in the ſame manner. "By the Feodal law, all <hi>navigable</hi> rivers and <hi>havens</hi> were computed among the Regalia, and were ſubject to the ſovereign of the ſtate. And in <hi>England</hi> it hath always been held, that the king is lord of the whole ſhore, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is guardian of the ports and havens, which are the inlets and gates of the realm: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo early as the reign of king John, we find ſhips ſeized by the kings officers, for putting in at a place that was not a legal port. Theſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ports were undoubtedly at firſt aſſigned by the crown; ſince to each of them a court of portmote is incident, the juriſdiction of which muſt flow from the royal authority. The erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beacons, lighthouſes, and ſea marks is alſo a branch of the royal prerogative. The king may injoin any man from going abroad, or command any man to return. The powers of eſtabliſhing public marts, regulating of weights and meaſures, and the giving authority to, or making current, money, <hi>the medium of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> belong to the crown. By making peace or war, leagues and treaties, the king may
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013247_0122_0F904C3D0736E4B0"/>
open or ſtop trade as he pleaſes. The admiralty courts are grounded on the neceſſity of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juriſdiction ſo extenſive, though oppoſite to the uſual doctrines of the common law. The laws of <hi>Oleron</hi> were made by <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, and are ſtill uſed in thoſe courts." In the "Mare clauſum", are ſeveral regulations made by kings<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The power of regulating trade, was carried ſo far by the crown, as ſometimes to impoſe duties; and queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> obtained ſeveral judgments in the exchequer on ſuch regulations.

                  <p>The author of "the controverſy," who with a liberality of ſentiment becoming a pleader againſt freedom and the beſt intereſt of mankind, counts, "ſtatute books"—"miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters"—"king's council"—pa. 77. 78.—:"ſcraps of jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals"—pa 81. and ordinances of "the rump parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment"—pa. 87. among <hi>his</hi> "DEITIES" pa. 78; and grieves that we poor <hi>"infidel"</hi> coloniſts will not pay his idols the veneration his zeal judges due to them, has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a good many fragments of proceedings in the houſe of commons from the year 1614 to 1628. The amount is this, that the miniſters of the crown inſiſted, that parliament could not make laws for <hi>America;</hi> that the the commons doubted; but at length in 1724, came to an opinion, that the king's patent for "a <hi>monopoly</hi> of fiſhing on the <hi>coaſts of America</hi> was a <hi>grievance,</hi>"—that a <hi>"clauſe of</hi> FORFEITURE" againſt thoſe who interfered in the fiſhery was void—and paſt a bill "for a <hi>free</hi> liberty of <hi>fiſhing</hi>" &amp;c. It appears in the debates that the fiſhery was free <hi>before the patent was granted</hi>—Theſe extracts do not ſhew, what 
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013247_0124_0F904C3E29E66CD8"/>


became of the bill in the houſe of lords. One Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> ſaid in 1621—"We may make laws here for <hi>Virginia,</hi> for <hi>if the king gives conſent</hi> to this bill paſt here and by the lords, this will controul the patent."</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, as if the notion of the king's regulating power ſtill prevailed, but, that "a clauſe of <hi>forfeiture</hi>" in ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations was void." So much had the power of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grown ſince king <hi>John'</hi>s reign. Nor does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been unreaſonable, as commerce became of more consequence. The inſtance here mentioned, related to a regulation of trade; and however the king might have accommodated the point, with the other branches of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, the whole proceeding is immaterial. If it was a right actually enjoyed by <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to fiſh on the coaſts of a plantation—and a grant by the crown of the fiſhery to the people of the plantation excluding the people of <hi>England,</hi> could not <hi>diveſt them</hi> of their right—or, "if by the king's giving his conſent to a bill paſſed by lords and commons,"—"the patent might be controuled"—it does not follow, that the king, lords and commons could diveſt the people of the plantations of all <hi>their</hi> rights.</p>

She might ruin us by it. The injury thereby to herſelf might be ſo <hi>remote</hi> as to be deſpiſed by her.</p>
            <p>THE power of regulation was the only band that could have held us together; formed on one of thoſe "original contracts,"—which only can be a foundation of juſt authority. Without ſuch a band, our general commerce with <hi>foreign nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> might have been injurious and deſtructive to her. Reaſon and duty reject ſuch a licence. This our duty reſembles that of children to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The parent has a power over them: but
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:013247_0131_0F904C43A2DFB430"/>
they have rights, which the parent cannot take away. Heaven grant that our mother country may regard us as her children, that if by the diſpenſation of Providence, the time ſhall come, when her power decreaſes the memory of former kindneſſes, may ſupply its decays, and her colonies like dutiful children, may ſerve and guard their aged parent, for ever revering the arms that held them in their infancy, and the breaſts that ſupported their lives, while they were little ones.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems, as if the power of regulation might not inaptly be compared to the prerogative of making peace, war, treaties, or alliances, whereby <hi>"the whole</hi>

"With regard to FOREIGN CONCERNS the king is the <hi>delegate</hi> or <hi>repreſentative</hi> of the people; and in him, as in a <hi>center,</hi> all the <hi>rays</hi> of his people are united<note n="‖" place="bottom">

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:013247_0132_0F904C44471E1908"/>
the Commentaries. "The <hi>meaning</hi> of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlature, when it uſes theſe terms of <hi>empire</hi> and <hi>imperial,</hi> and applies them to the realm and crown of <hi>England,</hi> is <hi>only</hi> to aſſert, that our king is equally <hi>ſovereign</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> within theſe his dominions; and <hi>owes no kind of ſubjection</hi> to any potentate upon earth." Thus WE maintain, that with regard to FOREIGN AFFAIRS, the parent original ſtate, "is the <hi>delegate</hi> or <hi>repreſentative,</hi>" of the entire dominions, "the <hi>ſovereign power</hi> QUOAD HOC is veſted" in her. Her acts under this power "irrevocably bind the whole nation." But yet this power by no means implies <hi>a ſupreme legiſlature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE exerciſe of this power <hi>by ſtatutes</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary; becauſe it was, and could only be lodged, as the laws of the parent ſtate, ſtand, in the ſupreme legiſlature of that ſtate, conſiſting of king, lords, and commons; and <hi>ſtatutes</hi> are the modes by which this united ſentiments and reſolutions are expreſt.

THIS power of regulation appears to us to have been pure in its principle, ſimple in its operation, and ſalutary in its effects. But for ſome time paſt we have obſerved, with pain, that it hath been turned to other purpoſes, than it was originally deſigned for, and retaining its title, hath become an engine of intolerable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and grievous taxations. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an eminent judge, ſtates the point in a ſimilar caſe ſtrongly for us, in theſe words.—</p>

For in it there is <hi>mutatio hypotheſis,</hi> and a <hi>tranſition</hi> from a thing of <hi>one</hi> nature to <hi>another;</hi> as the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> are of a <hi>power only fiduciary,</hi> and in <hi>point of truſt and government,</hi> and the <hi>concluſion</hi> infers a <hi>right of intereſt and gain.</hi> Admit the king has <hi>cuſtodiam portuum,</hi> yet he hath but the <hi>cuſtody</hi> which is a <hi>truſt</hi> and not <hi>dominium utile.</hi> He hath power to <hi>open</hi> and <hi>ſhut,</hi> UPON CONSIDERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF PUBLIC GOOD TO THE PEOPLE AND STATE, but not to make <hi>gain</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> by it: the <hi>one</hi> is PROTECTION, the <hi>other</hi> is EXPILATION."
