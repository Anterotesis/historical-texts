            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from his fear, and our Errors from his ways, <hi>and though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> Israel <hi>doth not acknowledge us;</hi> yet O that upon a well-grounded confidence we could say, <hi>Doubtless thou art our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To shut up with a few cordial Wishes, and as we hope unfeigned Petitions for the Welfare of all Ranks and Ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we the Old Men and falling Generation might Nightly water our Couches, for our windfal rotten and immature fruit, for our being Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and hollow Trees, instead of Palm Trees and Cedars, Fat and Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in the house of our God, bringing forth fruit to shew that the Lord is Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, our Rock, and no Unrighteousness him, that we may demonstrate in our lives and Conversations, the Vigilance, Gravity, Temperance, and Soundness in the Faitly, in Love, in Patience becoming such as have known him who is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the standing-Generation, our Sons may be as Plants in the House of our God, our Daughters corner stones Polished after the Similitude of a Palace, for Christ Jesus by his Spirit to Dwell in. That our young men may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Wicked One, the World and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000576_0028_0FA711090E019DF8"/>
all that is therein, Lusts of the Flesh, <hi>Lusts of the Eye, and Pride of Life which is not of the Father but of the World, that they may be strong and stedfast in the Faith &amp; order of the Gospel according to the Word in-dwelling in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Rising Generation, our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children and Babes may be Effectual calling know the Father, that they may abide in him, without Seduction by the Deceivers, and may overcome them, that it may not be said of us, as is recorded of <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>who after this or next Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are gathered to their Fathers; there should arise another Generation, who shall not know the God of their Fathers, nor yet the great Works the Lord had done for them &amp; forsake him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord divert this dismal Judgement, but pray we that there may be a pepetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Name Jehovah, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted worship according to his holy word, in <hi>New-England</hi> to all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Tho our Heads are not Fountains of Tears and our Eyes Rivers to mourn for our own, and Relations wanderings and wickedness, yet that the Lord would please to accept some few Drops from us, to be such as he will put into his Bottle, and though we cannot look for any Indigitation;

or Remarque in the Book of his remembrance, knowing by your selves just ground of saying, Lord when did we <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet we hope there is not an utter oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the least mite into his Treasury, of our Sincere Sighs and Groans, and Soul Travel for the Welfare of present, and future Generations, concerning which we have cause from our hearts to beg and also now do, <hi>That the Lord would spare us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Multitude of his great Mercies, and although our Iniquities testifie against us, before him who is the Hope of</hi> Israel, yet we know that there is hope in <hi>Israel</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing; and shall conclude with <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer, <hi>Oh that the Lord our God would be with us as he was with our Fathers, and that he would not leave us nor forsake us.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>IF any ingenious Reader would fully be inform'd, about the <hi>Astrocism</hi> made by the Great God in our visible Heavens; relating to the Great <hi>Cotton,</hi> and related in the Impolite Lines preceeding, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Life and Funeral Elegy; Writ and Composed at his Buryal: by the late Famous <hi>Norton,</hi> his Successor. A Taste whereof is here inserted.</p>
            <l>That <hi>Comets,</hi> Great Mens Death do oft fore-go;</l>
            <l>This present <hi>Comet</hi> doth too sadly snow</l>
            <l>This <hi>Prophet</hi> Dead, yet must in Doctrine speak,</l>
            <l>This <hi>Comet</hi> saith, else must <hi>New England</hi> break</l>
            <l>What ere it be; the Heavens avert it far,</l>
            <l>That, <hi>Meteors</hi> should succeed our greatest Star.</l>
