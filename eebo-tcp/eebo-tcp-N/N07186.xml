            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1762. <hi>June</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi>
               </note>AFTER a very fortunate paſſage thro' the old Straits of Bahama, the fleet arrived within ſight of two ſmall forts to the Eaſtward of the Havannah, ſituated upon two rivers about three miles diſtant from each other. The whole fleet brought to, &amp; Sir George Pocock, with 12 ſail of the line, ſome fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and all the ſtore ſhips, bore away for the mouth of the harbour, to block up the Spaniſh Men of War that were there and to make a feint on the other ſide, in order to facilitate our landing on this. Commodore Kep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, with ſeveral ſail of the line, and ſeveral ſmall frigates, was ordered to remain with the tranſports, to protect and conduct the debarkation of the troops, which was deferred 'till day. There was too much wind, and too great a ſurf from the ſhore to effect it at that time.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>th.</hi> By break of day this morning, the army landed without oppoſition between the two forts Bacarans and Coxemar. The one was ſilenced, and taken poſſeſſion of by the Mercury and another frigate; the other was taken by the Dragon, of 74 guns. They were defended by a conſiderable number of peaſants and negroes in arms, who very ſoon abandoned them, and fled into the woods. The Earl of Albemarle, with the light infantry and grenadiers of the army, paſſed the river Coxemar, where his lordſhip took his quarters that night. The reſt of the army lay upon their arms along the ſhore, with the picquets advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the woods.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:009165_0003_1030FD175B38FE80"/>8<hi>th.</hi> Lord Albemarle marched the main body of the army early in the morning to a village called Guanamacoa, about 6 miles from the landing place, and ſent Colonel Carleton through the Coxemar wood, with a finall corps of troops, to the ſame village, to endeavour to cut off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of a corps of the enemy, ſaid to be aſſembled there, and which his lordſhip determined to attack. The enemy were drawn up to receive us, and very advantageouſly poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a riſing ground between us and the village. Their cavalry marched down in a large body to the light infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry who were upon the right of Col. Carleton's corps. They were very ſoon repulſed, and the whole body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed-before the army got up. They were about 6000 in number, chiefly militia mounted, with the regiments of Edinburgh dragoons, two companies of grenadiers, and many Spaniſh officers. This morning Col. Howe, with two battalions of grenadiers, was ſent thro' the woods to the Moro, to reconnoitre, and ſecure the communication to that fort from the Coxemar.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>th.</hi> Lord Albemarle marched the army from Guana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macoa, and encamped in the woods between the Coxemar and the Moro, leaving a corps at Guanamacoa, under the command of Lieut. General Elliot, to ſecure the avenues on that ſide, and a large tract of country, which could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the army with water, cattle, and vegetables. We now diſcovered the enemy diſmantling their ſhips in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, at the entrance of which they had laid a boom.</p>
            <p n="10">10<hi>th.</hi> The Moro hill, called the Cavanno<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, where the enemy were ſaid to have a poſt well fortified, was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitred: and in the evening Col. Carleton, with the light infantry and grenadiers from Coxemar, went and inveſted that hill and the Moro fort.</p>
            <p n="11">11<hi>th.</hi> Col. Carleton attacked the redoubt about one o' Clock in the afternoon, and carried it with very little loſs, and little reſiſtance on the ſide of the enemy. Here was a poſt eſtabliſhed, and the work called by the name of the Spaniſh redoubt.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>th.</hi> The Moro fort was further reconnoitered by his lordſhip's order. It was difficult to reconnoitre it with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009165_0004_1030FD1930ACFBB8"/>
much accuracy, it being ſurrounded with thick bruſhy woods, which could not be ſeen through, and we<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> moſtly impoſſible. It was obſerved the parapet was thin, and all of maſonry, and it was threfore judged adviſeable to erect a battery againſt it, as near as the cover of the woods would admit of; there was accordingly a plan fixed upon, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 250 yards diſtance, and preparations were accordingly made, and parties ordered out for faſcines, and collecting earth, which was a work of great labour, the ſoil being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly thin and ſcarce. The landing of the ſtores was, at the ſame time, carried on with great dilligence by the fleet.</p>
            <p n="13">13<hi>th.</hi> The battery mentioned yeſterday was begun, as alſo a howitzer battery beyond the Spaniſh redoubt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſhipping further off up the river. They threw a great deal of random fire into the woods, and annoyed us very much. Col. Howe, with 300 light infantry, and two battalions of grenadiers, was detached to land at Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera, about 7 miles to the Weſtward of the town, to ſecure a footing, and engage ſome part of the enemy's attention upon that ſide.</p>
            <p n="19">19<hi>th.</hi> There was a mortar battery begun upon the right near the ſea, for one 13 inch, and fourteen royal mortars.</p>
            <p n="20">20<hi>th.</hi> Parallels put in the woods to the right and left battery, and a faſcine line begun, to ſecure the guards from the enemy's fire.</p>
            <p n="23">23<hi>d.</hi> Another battery made upon the beach, to advance the royals in the battery on the 19th, nearer the fort.</p>
            <p n="24">24<hi>th.</hi> A battery for two howitzers begun near the lime kiln; likewiſe againſt the ſhipping, to remove them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the harbour, which had its effect.</p>
            <p n="25">25<hi>th.</hi> A battery for a 13 inch mortar begun near the lime kiln, againſt the ſhipping.</p>
            <p n="26">26<hi>th.</hi> A battery begun againſt the fort for four guns and two mortars, upon the left of the firſt battery.</p>
            <p n="29">29<hi>th.</hi> The enemy, at day break, landed two detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of 500 men each, of grenadiers and choſen men, with a detachment of armed Negroes and Mulattoes, with each corps, one upon the right under the Moro, the other
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009165_0005_1030FD1C61012478"/>
upon the left of the lime kiln. The picquets and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poſts, prevented the ſucceſs of theſe detachments, by repulſing them, killing, and taking near 200, beſides wounding a great number of them, who moſtly got of by the favour of the woods. Our loſs was only ten men killed and wounded.</p>
            <p n="30">30<hi>th.</hi> This day was chiefly taken up in carrying ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and carriages to the ſeveral batteries to provide for their opening next morning, which was done by the ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers and 500 Blacks purchaſed by Lord Albemarle, at Martineco and Antigua, for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 1. This morning we opened two batteries of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which, with our mortars, made up a fire as follows, viz.

ſtill did us a conſideaable ſervice in taking up the enemy's attention for that time, which gained us a ſuperiority in the number of guns.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> Our batteries continued their fire with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and beat down the front attacked, as faſt as could be wiſhed or expected, particularly the eight gun bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; but unhappily about noon, we were obliged to ſlacken, that battery being in danger of catching fire, from the conſtant fire kept up, and the dryneſs of the faſcines, having had no rain for 14 days; however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evening, the enemy's fire was reduced to two guns, which fired but ſeldom.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> We flattered ourſelves the fire was quite out, but about two in the morning it broke out again with great violence. Both water and people were ſent as faſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but unhappily too late; the fire had inſinuated itſelf where water could not reach it, nor earth ſtifle it. Thus 17 Days labour of 5 or 600 Men, and which muſt have let us into the fort in a few days, was now baffled, and to do over again. There was another embrazure added this night to William's battery.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>th</hi> and 5<hi>th.</hi> Theſe two nights our endeavours ſtill continued to extinguiſh, and with much difficulty, there were two embrazures ſaved upon the right, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paulment for mortars upon the left. The fire of theſe two embrazures was continued until the guns was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and two mortars ſerved en barbette, until the enemy's fire obliged the men to give it up. It was now determined to convert the mortar battery, in the left parallel, into a battery for cannon, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun, with ſome improvements to the other works, which the enemy's fire from the town, Fort la Punta, ſhips of war, and floating batteries, had render'd neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th.</hi> Two more embrazures were added this night to Williams's battery, and a place fixed upon near the ſtone redoubt for another battery of four guns.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>th.</hi> This morning we had 12 guns in battery, viz. Williams's battery of ſeven guns, and the left parallel of five guns, beſides our mortars. The enemy fired with about eight or nine.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009165_0007_1030FD1F77846700"/>10<hi>th.</hi> At night a battery of four guns begun in the right parallel.</p>
            <p n="11">11<hi>th.</hi> This morning the four gun battery, near the ſtone redoubt, and two guns upon the ſaved part of the grand battery newly repaired, opened and played with ſucceſs. We now had 18 guns in play to 8 or 9, which the enemy ſtill kept up; for, by their uninterrupted communication with the town, and the great aſſiſtance of their ſailors, who ſerve their guns, they always made the loſſes of the day good at night. This afternoon two guns in the left parallel battery failed, one by running, the other by cracking; the carriages of a third was diſabled upon Williams's battery. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the merlons of the grand battery again caught fire, and extended from right to left, and the whole was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparably conſumed.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>th.</hi> The diſabled guns in the left parallel, and in Williams's battery were replaced laſt night, ſo that we ſtill had 16 guns in play: Towards noon the carriages of the three guns in the ſtone redoubt battery were diſabled.</p>
            <p n="13">13<hi>th.</hi> This morning there was a battery of four 32 pounders opened on the right parallel againſt the left baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made conſiderable havock. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther battery of four guns ordered to be made upon the right of it as ſoon as materials can be collected. The ruins of the burnt battery was ordered to be converted into a line for muſquetry at the ſame time. There were two guns remounted in the night upon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery near the ſtone redoubt, but there were two more diſmounted immediately afterwards.</p>
            <p n="14">14<hi>th.</hi> The four guns in the ſtone redoubt battery were laſt night mounted on ſea-carriages: We now had 20 guns mounted againſt five or ſix, which the enemy began with in the morning: They were reduced to two before dark. The whole front attacked appeared in a moſt ruinous condition, yet the enemy, tho' kept in a conſtant hurry and confuſion, behaved with ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Preparations for carrying on approaches had now been in hand ſome days. The 40th regiment was employed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009165_0008_10303239AF48EB60"/>
in making gabions, and ſeveral men of war in making junk, blinds, or mantelets, and ſome bales of cotton pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to ſerve as wool-packs. As our approaches muſt be entirely raiſed above ground on account of rocks, theſe precautions were neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="15">15<hi>th.</hi> We played with the ſame number of guns as yeſterday. The enemy fired in the morning with 6 or 7 guns, but were totally ſilenced before night.</p>
            <p n="16">16<hi>th.</hi> Our fire as yeſterday. The enemy fired in the morning with two guns, and only twice with each. They fired the reſt of the day with muſquetry and wall-pieces, but not much with either. This evening the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for the approaches began to be advanced. The guns and ammunition are carrying up for the new bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which is to open to-morrow morning. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſeemed to be employed in making up freſh merlons upon the face of the right baſtion.</p>
            <p n="17">17<hi>th.</hi> The Valiant's battery opened this morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 10 and 11; the enemy had no fire on the front attacked, but fired two guns from the left face of the left Baſtion upon Williams's battery, and up along the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannos. This afternoon we began to ſtuff Gabions with Faſcines for advancing our Sap. In the evening our Sap was begun, but there being a thick thorny wood to cut through, was advanced but a little way.</p>
            <p n="18">18<hi>th.</hi> The enemy's fire this morning was the ſame as yeſterday. We had two howitzers put in Dixon's bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to fire into the breaches; the Sap was carried on this night about two thirds of the way to the ſmall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery at the foot of the Sorties before the right Baſtion. There was likewiſe a ſmall lodgement made at the edge of the wood, before the point of the weſt Baſtion.</p>
            <p n="19">19<hi>th.</hi> The enemy fired this morning with three guns from the front attacked, but they were ſoon ſilenced. About noon we took poſſeſſion of the covered way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the point of the right Baſtion, and the former Sap carried on at night, and another begun along the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way before the right face, where we made a lodgment.</p>
            <p n="20">20<hi>th.</hi> This morning the miners were entered under
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009165_0009_1030FD21581859A8"/>
the right or ſea face of the right Baſtion, the only place Where there was a practicability of doing it, at the foot of the wall, for the ditch of the front attacked is 70 feet deep from the edge of the Counterſcarp, and upwards of 40 feet, of that depth, ſunk in the Rock, but fortunately there was a thin ridge of the Rock left at the point of the Baſtion, to cover the extremity of the ditch from being open to the ſea, and to prevent ſurprizes, and by means of this ridge the miner paſt, with ſome difficulty, to the foot of the wall, which he could do no where elſe without the help of Scaling Ladders, an operation which would be both tedious and dangerous. This ridge was ſo narrow that there was no poſſibility of covering a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage upon it, from the fire of the oppoſite flank, but we took our chance, and were glad to find it, even with that diſadvantage. It coſt us but only three or four men during the whole time. We began the ſame after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon to ſink a Shaft without the covered way, for mines to throw the Counterſcarp into the ditch to fill it up in caſe of occaſion. We continued our Sap along the Glacis, and got a gun into the Saliant Angle of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered way againſt the oppoſite flank. In the day-time we had parties for making Faſcines and other preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the town, after the Moro ſhould be taken.</p>
            <p n="21">21<hi>ſt.</hi> Our Sappers and Miners continued to carry on their work; in this they were much retarded, by meeting often with very large ſtones, which coſt them much labour to remove. In the night there being a ſuſpicion that there were very few men in the Fort, there was a Serjeant and 12 men that ſcaled the ſea line a little to the right of the mine, and found only about nine or ten men aſleep in that part of the work: they wakened before our men got to them, and ran off immediately to alarm the reſt: the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant and his party then came down, and being ordered up a ſecond time, found they had taken the alarm, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number aſſembled, and ready to make an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had it been practicable to ſuccour them briſkly, the Fort might have been carried at that time, but the attempt was not to be repeated.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009165_0010_1030FD27D72C01C0"/>22<hi>d.</hi> About four this morning there was a ſally made by the enemy from the town, which, by the information or priſoners, amounted to 1500 men, divided into three different parties; one puſhed up the bank behind the Shephard's battery; they were ſtopped for near an hour, by the guard poſted there, conſiſting only of about 30 men, commanded by Lieut. Col. Stuart, of the 90th regiment, until he was joined by about 100 ſappers, and the 3d batt. of Royal Americans; the fire continued hot all the time; the enemy were then driven down the Bank with great ſlaughter; as many as could, got in their boats, and many leapt into the water, where there were 150 drowned. Another party endeavoured to puſh up by the ſaliant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the Moro to attack our Sappers upon the Glacis, and their Covering Party, but they were beat off in a very ſhort time; the third party went up the Bank of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Redoubt, but finding our people ready to receive them, they returned very peaceably from whence they came. The alarm was entirely over, and our people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their work by eight o'clock. The enemy's loſs was ſaid to be near 400 men killed, drowned and taken; beſides the wounded that got off. We had about 50 men killed and wounded. The enemy canonaded up moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, when their troops were beat down the bank, from the Punta, Weſt Baſtion, and from the lines and flanks of the entrance, and from their ſhipping; they even killed ſome of their own men, ſo eager were they to kill us. At the ſame time that their troops wete attacking, we ſaw they had great numbers paraded in the town, and ſome of them going into boats to ſuſtain the attack; but when they perceived the rough treatment their comrades had met with, they prudently dropt the attempt.</p>
            <p n="23">23<hi>d.</hi> The former works continue in hand, viz. Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Mining, and making Faſcines. This day a ſketch of the batteries againſt the town, and defences of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to be erected along the cavannos after the Moro ſhould be taken, were laid before the Earl of Albemarle, and approved of by his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p n="24">24<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand, and the materials

collecting for a four gun battery, to the left of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh redoubt, to be called — This battery to be opened againſt La Fuerza, and to enfilade the two next flanks, facing the entrance of the harbour. There was a party of 600 Negroes ordered this day for faſcine making, and to be continued upon that ſervice, but they ſeldom amounted to above half, or even a third of that number, occaſioned by ſickneſs, and other preſſing duties.</p>
            <p n="25">25<hi>th.</hi> The ſame work in hand as yeſterday. There was a road made from the rear of William's battery, up to the Spaniſh redoubt, covered from the town, to ſerve as a communication to the new deſigned batteries upon the Cavannos. This afternon there was a battery for five guns begun, to the right of the rear of Dixon's bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to open againſt the Punta. This battery is called —</p>
            <p n="26">26<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand, and the battery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, to the left of Spaniſh redoubt. This morning a two decked Merchant's frigate, acroſs the entrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Weſt Baſtion, within the Boom, and near the ſunk ſhips, was ſunk by a howitzer, near Dixon's battery; this ſhip had annoyed us very much.</p>
            <p n="27">27<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand, and a mortar battery begun at a Spaniſh redoubt; there was likewiſe a battery begun for three guns to fire upon boats landing at the Moro, which would have been of conſiderable uſe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, if it could have been ſerved without erecting other batteries to check the fire of the Moro itſelf, upon that ſide: But that could not be undertaken, as our troops were already ſufficiently employed in the works of the real attack. Brigadier Burton arrived with the firſt of the troops from North America, and was ordered to the weſt ſide.</p>
            <p n="28">28<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand. This afternoon a large merchant ſhip of the enemy's caught fire by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within the Harbour, and blew up in ten minutes. At night there was a battery for two mortars begun to the right of the Spaniſh redoubt: And one for five guns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fort La Punta upon the left of our Sap, near the point of the Moro.</p>
            <p n="29">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009165_0012_1030FD2CF8BD7B70"/>29<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand. The mines were this day preparing for being ſprung to-morrow morning.</p>
            <p n="30">30<hi>th.</hi> About two this morning the enemy ſent two boats and a floating battery out of the Harbour, to fire into the ditch where our Mines were at work: They fired grape and ſmall arms, but without any other effect, than a ſhort interruption of the work: The covering party fired ſo ſmartly upon them that they were obliged to retire: About two o'clock in the afternoon the mines were ſprung; that, in the counterſcarp had not a very conſiderable effect, but that in the Baſtion having thrown down a part of both faces, made a breach, which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Chief Engineer thought practicable; upon which the troops under orders for the aſſault, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to mount, which they did, with the greateſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rming very expeditiouſly upon the top of the breach, ſoon drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts: The Spaniards had about 130 men, with ſeveral officers, killed; about 400 threw down their arms, and were made priſoners; the reſt were either killed in boats or drowned in attempting to eſcape to the Havannah. Our loſs in this glorious affair, amounted to two officers killed, and about 30 men killed and wounded.</p>
            <p n="31">31<hi>ſt.</hi> Our preparations were carried on with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence, for erecting the intended batteries upon the Cavannos. The enemy's fire continued very hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moro; they pointed chiefly at that part of the work where the ciſtern was, in hopes no doubt, of letting out the water. Lord Albemarle went this evening to the weſt ſide of the town to reconnoitre the ground there, and ſee in what manner attacks might be carried on with advantage on that ſide, in caſe of occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> The enemy's fire ſtill continued againſt the Moro. This evening General Keppel determined to erect the remainder of the batteries to be erected upon the Cavannos; ſome by the 1ſt and 2d brigades, and ſome by the ſailors, and to begin them to-morrow night.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> This morning, before day, the enemy, ſent down a 74 gun ſhip into the Entrance, and moored her oppoſite
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009165_0013_1030FD337B240B90"/>
to the Fuerza; ſhe directed her fire likewiſe againſt the Moro: There were two howitzers run into the battery to fire at her, which incommoded her a good deal. The batteries mentioned yeſterday were begun this night, by the two brigades, and ſailors; they conſiſted of thirty-five pieces of cannon.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> The former works in hand, and carried on with diligence. This morning the Chief Engineer was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the weſtward of the town, to reconnoitre the ground, for attacking that ſide in caſe of occaſion. This evening the enemy's ſhip oppoſite to the Fuerza, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned yeſterday, was removed by our howitzers, with a good deal of confuſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>th.</hi> The chief Engineer reported to Lord Albemarle, that as the Moro, was now in our poſſeſſion, there was, to the weſtward of the town, a very advantageous attack to be formed againſt the poligons next the Punta, by the cover of a bank running along ſhore from the Lazaro to Fort la Punta, ſuppoſing that fort ſilenced: That there was a road upon the bank which was, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable way, covered both from Fort la Punta and every part of the town, that the road was at preſent ſtopped up by trees felled on each ſide, but might be eaſily clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as attacks upon that ground would in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſtand in the line of fire of our batteries upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, it would be moſt adviſeable to delay them until theſe batteries had in ſome meaſure effected their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and eſpecially, as they might of themſelves, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, anſwer the end without further trouble.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> The works and batteries on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

               </gap> in hand as before, and ſome of the platforms begun to be laid: It was now difficult to get materials for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thoſe from England and Martinico being expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but by the Admiral's aſſiſtance, the materials were got. Lord Albemarle took up his head quarters this evening the other ſide.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th.</hi> The works in hand as yeſterday, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably advanced, and the men much fatigued, there was none allowed for this night.—There was 30 car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009165_0014_1030FD36D797DF08"/>
from the provincial troops, lately arrived, now employed in making platforms. There was a command of Engineers, and a proportion of entrenching tools or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the weſt road, the former to go as ſoon as the batteries and works on the eaſt ſide ſhould be ready, and the tools to be ſhipped immediately: The chief en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer was ordered to repair to that ſide, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
            <p n="7">7<hi>th.</hi> The former works upon the eaſt ſide were going on, and Faſcine parties ordered to work on the weſt ſide.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>th.</hi> The former works in hand on the eaſt ſide, but Faſcine-making was retarded conſiderably on the weſt-ſide for want of tools. This afternoon the ſhip arrived on the weſt-ſide with the intrenching tools, but the ſhip being very sickly, there were none landed. In the evening Lord Albemarle went himſelf to reconnoitre the road and ground between the Lazaro and the Punta, and ordered ſome poſts to be taken up farther advanced.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>th.</hi> The intrenching tools were landed this day, by the aſſiſtance of the men of war, in the afternoon. The enemy having diſcovered our reconnoitring towards the Punta for ſome days paſt, ſet ſome houſes near the road on fire to prevent their being a ſhelter for us. In the evening there was a party of 200 men ordered to make a redoubt upon the roads to the Punta, with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering-party of the ſame number; the place intended for the redoubt, which was partly upon the road, being much encumbered, as mentioned before, all they could do was to clear off the trees, and form an Abbates in the front and flanks for preſent defence.</p>
            <p n="10">10<hi>th.</hi> At day break this morning the enemy having diſcovered the covering party, and ſuſpected our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been at work, began to cannonade along the road pretty warmly, but with little execution. About ten in the morning, our batteries being ready to open on the eaſt ſide, and we to open ground on the weſt ſide, Lord Albemarle ſent a flag of truce by an Aid de Camp to acquaint the Governor with the ruin that threatened the place, and ſummoned them to capitulate. The
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009165_0015_1030FD38669CB848"/>
Governor after keeping the flag from till between three and four in the afternoon, in the open fields, at ſome hundred yards diſtance from the works, ſent him back, and before he got two thirds of the way, began to fire: we at the ſame time ſaw many people leaving the town with loads; in the evening there was a party ſent to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the works as before.</p>
            <p n="11">11<hi>th.</hi> At day break this morning, all our batteries opened conſiſting of 43 pieces of cannon, and 8 mortars. The advantage of poſition, as well as ſuperior fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came viſible very ſoon. Fort Punta was ſilenced between nine and ten. The north baſtion almoſt, in about an hour afterwards; but now and then fired a ſhot. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and 2 we diſcovered a great number of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my running off from the Punta, as if they had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it. About two o'clock there were flags of truce hung out all round the garriſon, and on board the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's ſhip: ſoon after, there arrived a flag of truce at our head quarters, by Don—Fort Major, his ſon, and an interpreter, which proved to be with propoſals for a capitulation. Sir George Pocock was then ſent for, and the buſineſs entered upon, as ſoon as he came. The works were ſtopt for this night, and the flag re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned about duſk.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>th.</hi> The truce continued. This day the flag was ſent in, and returned; and ſent in again in the evening. The works were ordered to be carried on as before, which gave room to expect the hoſtilities were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the morning; but the capitulation was ſettled before that time.</p>
            <p n="13">13<hi>th.</hi> This day the capitulation was ſigned and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the long time it took to be ſettled, is ſaid to be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an unreaſonable earneſtneſs in the enemy to ſave their ſhipping, which they at length gave up.</p>
            <p n="14">14<hi>th,</hi> About ten this morning, General Keppel with —men, took poſſeſſion of Fort la Punta, and about noon, of the Punta gate and baſtion, at both which places there were Britiſh colours hoiſted, having been eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by the enemy.
