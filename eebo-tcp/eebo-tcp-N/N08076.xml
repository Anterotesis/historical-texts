            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EXAMINATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>Q. WHAT is your Name and Place of Abode?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Franklin</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. Do the <hi>Americans</hi> pay any conſiderable Taxes among themſelves?</p>
            <p>A. Certainly many, and very heavy Taxes.</p>
            <p>Q. What are the preſent Taxes in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> laid by the Laws of the Colony?</p>
            <p>A. There are Taxes on all Eſtates real and perſonal, a Poll Tax, a Tax on all Offices, Professions, Trades and Buſineſſes, according to their Profits; an Exciſe on all Wine, Rum, and other Spirits; and a Duty of Ten Pounds <hi>per</hi> Head on all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes imported, with ſome other Duties.</p>
            <p>Q. For what Purpoſes are thoſe Taxes laid?</p>
            <p>A. For the Support of the civil and military Eſtabliſhments of the Country, and to diſcharge the heavy Debt contracted in the laſt War.</p>
            <p>Q. How long are thoſe Taxes to continue?</p>
            <p>A. Those for diſcharging the Debt are to continue till 1772, and longer, if the Debt ſhould not be then all diſcharged. The others muſt always continue.</p>
            <p>Q. Was it not expected that the Debt would have been ſooner diſcharged?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:010303_0003_0F7E736F59B60418"/>
A. It was, when the Peace was made, with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> but a freſh War breaking out with the <hi>Indians,</hi> a freſh Load of Debt was incurred, and the Taxes, of Course, continued longer by a new Law.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not all the People very able to pay thoſe Taxes?</p>
            <p>A. No, the Frontier Counties, all along the Continent, having been frequently ravaged by the Enemy, and greatly impoveriſhed, are able to pay very little Tax. And therefore, in Conſideration of their Diſtreſſes, our late Tax Laws do expreſsly favour thoſe Counties, excuſing the Sufferers; and I ſuppoſe the ſame is done in other Governments.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not you concerned in the Management of the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Office in <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes. I am Deputy Poſt-Maſter General of <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. Don't you think the Diſtribution of Stamps, by Poſt, to all the Inhabitants, very practicable, if there was no Oppoſition?</p>
            <p>A. The Poſts only go along the Sea Coaſts; they do not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a few Inſtances, go back into the Country; and if they did, ſending for Stamps by Poſt would occaſion an Expence of Poſtage, amounting, in many Caſes, to much more than that of the Stamps themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. Are you acquainted with <hi>Newfoundland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I never was there.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you know whether there are any Poſt Roads on that Iſland?</p>
            <p>A. I have heard that there are no Roads at all; but that the Communication between one Settlement and another is by Sea only.</p>
            <p>Q. Can you diſperſe the Stamps by Poſt in <hi>Canada?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. There is only a Poſt between <hi>Montreal</hi> and <hi>Quebec.</hi> The Inhabitants live ſo ſcattered and remote from each other, in that vaſt Country, that Poſts cannot be ſupported among them, and therefore they cannot get Stamps <hi>per</hi> Poſt. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies too, along the Frontiers, are very thinly ſettled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010303_0004_0F7E7370A9A0C0E8"/>
Q. From the Thinneſs of the back Settlements, would not the Stamp-Act be extreamly inconvenient to the Inhabitants, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted?</p>
            <p>A. To be ſure it would; as many of the Inhabitants could not get Stamps when they had Occaſion for them, without taking long Journeys, and ſpending perhaps Three or Four Pounds, that the Crown might get Six-pence.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not the Colonies, from their Circumſtances, very able to pay the Stamp-duty.</p>
            <p>A. In my Opinion, there is not Gold and Silver enough in the Colonies to pay the Stamp-duty for one Year.</p>
            <p>Q. Don't you know that the Money ariſing from the Stamps was all to be laid out in <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I know it is appropriated by the Act to the <hi>American</hi> Service; but it will be ſpent in the conquered Colonies, where the Soldiers are, not in the Colonies that pay it.</p>
            <p>Q. Is there not a Ballance of Trade due from the Colonies where the Troops are poſted, that will bring back the Money to the old Colonies?</p>
            <p>A. I think not. I believe very little would come back. I know of no Trade likely to bring it back. I think it would come from the Colonies where it was ſpent directly to <hi>England;</hi> for I have always obſerved, that in every Colony the more plenty the Means of Remittance to <hi>England,</hi> the more Goods are ſent for, and the more Trade with <hi>England</hi> carried on.</p>
            <p>Q. What Number of white Inhabitants do you think there are in <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I ſuppoſe there may be about 160,000.</p>
            <p>Q. What Number of them are Quakers?</p>
            <p>A. Perhaps a Third.</p>
            <p>Q. What Number of <hi>Germans?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Perhaps another Third; but I cannot ſpeak with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>Q. Have any Number of the <hi>Germans</hi> ſeen Service, as Soldiers, in <hi>Europe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010303_0005_0F7E7371093BEFF8"/>
A. Yes,—many of them, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. Are they as much diſſatisfied with the Stamp-duty as the <hi>English?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, and more; and with Reaſon, as their Stamps are, in many Caſes, to be double.</p>
            <p>Q. How many white Men do you ſuppoſe there are in <hi>North-America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. About 300,000, from Sixteen to Sixty Years of Age.</p>
            <p>Q. What may be the Amount of one Year's Imports into <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> from <hi>Britain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I have been informed that our Merchants compute the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from <hi>Britain</hi> to be above 500,000 Pounds.</p>
            <p>Q. What may be the Amount of the Produce of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince exported to <hi>Britain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It muſt be ſmall, as we produce little that is wanted in <hi>Britain.</hi> I ſuppoſe it cannot exceed 40,000 Pounds.</p>
            <p>Q. How then do you pay the Ballance?</p>
            <p>A. The Ballance is paid by our Produce carried to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and ſold in our own Iſlands, or to the <hi>French, Spaniards, Danes</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> by the ſame carried to other Colonies in <hi>North-America,</hi> as to <hi>New-England, Nova-Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina</hi> and <hi>Georgia;</hi> by the ſame carried to different Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> In all which Places we receive either Money, Bills of Exchange, or Commodities that ſuit for Remittance to <hi>Britain;</hi> which, together with all the Profits on the Induſtry of our Merchants and Mariners, ariſing in thoſe circuitous Voyages, and the Freights made by their Ships, center finally in <hi>Britain,</hi> to diſcharge the Ballance, and pay for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures continually uſed in the Province, or ſold to Foreigners by our Traders.</p>
            <p>Q. Have you heard of any Difficulties lately laid on the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Trade?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, I have heard that it has been greatly obſtructed by ſome new Regulations, and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War and Cutters ſtationed all along the Coaſt in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010303_0006_0F7E737199EA2F90"/>
Q. Do you think it right that <hi>America</hi> ſhould be protected by this Country, and pay no Part of the Expence?</p>
            <p>A. That is not the Caſe. The Colonies raiſed, cloathed and paid, during the laſt War, near 25000 Men, and ſpent many Millions.</p>
            <p>Q. Were you not reimburſed by Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. We were only reimburſed what, in your Opinion, we had advanced beyond our Proportion, or beyond what might reaſonably be expected from us; and it was a very ſmall Part of what we ſpent. <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in particular, diſburſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500,000 Pounds, and the Reimburſements, in the whole, did not exceed 60,000 Pounds.</p>
            <p>Q. You have ſaid that you pay heavy Taxes in <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> what do they amount to in the Pound?</p>
            <p>A. The Tax on all Eſtates, Real and Perſonal, is Eighteen Pence in the Pound, fully rated; and the Tax on the Profits of Trades and Profeſſions, with other Taxes, do, I ſuppoſe, make full Half a Crown in the Pound.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the Rate of Exchange in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and whether it is fallen lately?</p>
            <p>A. It is commonly from 170 to 175. I have heard that it has fallen lately from 175 to 162 and a Half, owing, I ſuppoſe, to their leſſening their Orders for Goods; and when their Debts to this Country are paid, I think the Exchange will probably be at Par.</p>
            <p>Q. Do not you think the People of <hi>America</hi> would ſubmit to pay the Stamp-duty, if it was moderated?</p>
            <p>A. No, never, unleſs compelled by Force of Arms.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not the Taxes in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> laid on unequally, in order to burthen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade, particularly the Tax on Profeſſions and Buſineſs?</p>
            <p>A. It is not more burthenſome in Proportion than the Tax on Lands. It is intended, and ſuppoſed to take an equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Profits.</p>
            <p>Q. How is the Aſſembly compoſed? Of what Kinds of People are the Members, Landholders or Traders?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010303_0007_0F7E7374C0274A98"/>
A. It is compoſed of Landholders, Merchants and Artificers.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not the Majority Landholders?</p>
            <p>A. I believe they are.</p>
            <p>Q. Do not they, as much as poſſible, ſhift the Tax off from the Land, to eaſe that, and lay the Burthen heavier on Trade?</p>
            <p>A. I have never underſtood it ſo. I never heard ſuch a Thing ſuggeſted. And indeed an Attempt of that Kind could anſwer no Purpoſe. The Merchant or Trader is always ſkilled in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and ready with his Pen and Ink. If unequal Burthens are laid on his Trade, he puts an additional Price on his Goods; and the Conſumers, who are chiefly Landholders, finally pay the greateſt Part, if not the Whole.</p>
            <p>Q. What was the Temper of <hi>America</hi> towards <hi>Great-Britain</hi> before the Year 1763?</p>
            <p>A. The beſt in the World. They ſubmitted willingly to the Government of the Crown, and paid, in all their Courts, Obedience to Acts of Parliament. Numerous as the People are in the ſeveral old Provinces, they coſt you nothing in Forts, Citadels, Garriſons or Armies, to keep them in Subjection. They were governed by this Country at the Expence only of a little Pen, Ink and Paper. They were led by a Thread. They had not only a Reſpect but an Affection, for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for its Laws, its Cuſtoms and Manners, and even a Fondneſs for its Faſhions, that greatly increaſed the Commerce. Natives of <hi>Britain</hi> were always treated with particular Regard; to be an <hi>Old England-man,</hi> was, of itſelf, a Character of ſome Reſpect, and gave a Kind of Rank among us.</p>
            <p>Q. And what is their Temper now?</p>
            <p>A. O, very much altered.</p>
            <p>Q. Did you ever hear the Authority of Parliament to make Laws for <hi>America</hi> queſtioned till lately?</p>
            <p>A. The Authority of Parliament was allowed to be valid in all Laws, except ſuch as ſhould lay internal Taxes. It was never diſputed in laying Duties to regulate Commerce.</p>
            <p>Q. In what Proportion hath Population increaſed in <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

A. I think the Inhabitants of all the Provinces together, taken at a Medium, double in about 25 Years. But their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures increaſes much faſter, as the Conſumption is not merely in Proportion to their Numbers, but grows with the growing Abilities of the ſame Numbers to pay for them. In 1723, the whole Importation from <hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> was but about 15,000 Pounds Sterling; it is now near Half a Million.</p>
            <p>Q. In what Light did the People of <hi>America</hi> uſe to conſider the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They conſidered the Parliament as the great Bulwark and Security of their Liberties and Priviledges, and always ſpoke of it with the utmoſt Reſpect and Veneration. Arbitrary Miniſters, they thought, might poſſibly, at Times, attempt to oppreſs them; but they relied on it, that the Parliament, on Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would always give Redreſs. They remembered, with Gratitude, a ſtrong Inſtance of this, when a Bill was brought into Parliament, with a Clauſe to make Royal Inſtructions Laws in the Colonies, which the Houſe of Commons would not paſs, and it was thrown out.</p>
            <p>Q. And have they not ſtill the ſame Reſpect for Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. No; it is greatly leſſened.</p>
            <p>Q. To what Cauſes is that owing?</p>
            <p>A. To a Concurrence of Cauſes; the Reſtraints lately laid on their Trade, by which the bringing of foreign Gold and Silver into the Colonies was prevented; the Prohibition of making Paper Money among themſelves; and then demanding a new and heavy Tax by Stamps; taking away, at the ſame Time, Trials by Juries, and refuſing to receive and hear their humble Petitions.</p>
            <p>Q. Don't you think they would ſubmit to the Stamp-Act, if it was modified, the obnoxious Parts taken out, and the Duty reduced to ſome Particulars, of ſmall Moment?</p>
            <p>A. No; they will never ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p>Q. What do you think is the Reaſon that the People of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> increaſe faſter than in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

A. Becauſe they marry younger, and more generally.</p>
            <p>Q. Why ſo?</p>
            <p>A. Becauſe any young Couple that are induſtrious, may eaſily obtain Land of their own, on which they can raiſe a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not the lower Rank of People more at their Eaſe in <hi>America</hi> than in <hi>England?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They may be ſo, if they are ſober and diligent, as they are better paid for their Labour.</p>
            <p>Q. What is your Opinion of a future Tax, impoſed on the ſame Principle with that of the Stamp-Act; how would the <hi>Americans</hi> receive it?</p>
            <p>A. Juſt as they do this. They would not pay it.</p>
            <p>Q. Have you not heard of the Reſolutions of this Houſe, and of the Houſe of Lords, aſſerting the Right of Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>America,</hi> including a Power to tax the People there?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, I have heard of ſuch Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Q. What will be the Opinion of the <hi>Americans</hi> on thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions?</p>
            <p>A. They will think them unconſtitutional, and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Q. Was it an Opinion in <hi>America</hi> before 1763, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had no Right to lay Taxes and Duties there?</p>
            <p>A. I never heard any Objection to the Right of laying Duties to regulate Commerce; but a Right to lay internal Taxes was never ſuppoſed to be in Parliament, as we are not repreſented there.</p>
            <p>Q. On what do you found your Opinion, that the People, in <hi>America</hi> made any ſuch Diſtinction?</p>
            <p>A. I know that whenever the Subject has occurred in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation where I have been preſent, it has appeared to be the Opinion of every one, that we could not be taxed in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where we were not repreſented. But the Payment of Duties laid by Act of Parliament, as Regulations of Commerce, was never diſputed.</p>
            <p>Q. But can you name any Act of Aſſembly, or public Act of any of your Governments, that made ſuch Diſtinction?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010303_0010_0F7E7377307F15B8"/>
A. I do not know that there was any; I think there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Occaſion to make any ſuch Act, till now that you have attempted to tax us; that has occaſioned Reſolutions of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, declaring the Diſtinction, in which I think every Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly on the Continent, and every Member in every Aſſembly, have been unanimous.</p>
            <p>Q. What then could occaſion Converſations on that Subject before that Time?</p>
            <p>A. There was in 1754 a Propoſition made (I think it came from hence) that is caſe of a War, which was then apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Governors of the Colonies ſhould meet, and order the levying of Troops, building of Forts, and taking every other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Meaſure for the general Defence; and ſhould draw on the Treaſury here for the Sums expended, which were afterwards to be raiſed in the Colonies by a general Tax, to be laid on them by Act of Parliament. This occaſioned a good deal of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Subject, and the general Opinion was, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament neither would nor could lay any Tax on us, till we were duly repreſented in Parliament, becauſe it was not juſt, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Nature of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Q. Don't you know there was a Time in <hi>New-York,</hi> when it was under Conſideration to make an Application to Parliament to lay Taxes on that Colony, upon a Deficiency ariſing from the Aſſembly's refuſing or neglecting to raiſe the neceſſary Supplies for the Support of the Civil Government?</p>
            <p>A. I never heard of it.</p>
            <p>Q. There was ſuch an Application under Conſideration in <hi>New-York;</hi> and do you apprehend they could ſuppoſe the Right of Parliament to lay a Tax in <hi>America</hi> was only local, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Caſe of a Deficiency in a particular Colony, by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of its Aſſembly to raiſe the neceſſary Supplies?</p>
            <p>A. They could not ſuppose ſuch a Caſe, as that the Aſſembly would not raiſe the neceſſary Supplies to ſupport its own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. An Aſſembly that would refuſe it muſt want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, which cannot be ſuppoſed. I think there was never any ſuch Caſe at <hi>New-York,</hi> and that it muſt be a Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010303_0011_0F7E73779A889A40"/>
or the Fact muſt be miſunderſtood. I know there have been ſome Attempts, by miniſterial Inſtructions from hence, to oblige the Aſſemblies to ſettle permanent Salaries on Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, which they wiſely refuſed to do; but I believe no Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>New-York,</hi> or any other Colony, ever refuſed duly to ſupport Government by proper Allowances, from Time to Time, to public Officers.</p>
            <p>Q. But in Caſe a Governor, acting by Inſtruction, ſhould call on an Aſſembly to raiſe the neceſſary Supplies, and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſhould refuſe to do it, do you not think it would then be for the good of the People of the Colony, as well as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Government, that the Parliament ſhould tax them?</p>
            <p>A. I do not think it would be neceſſary. If an Aſſembly could poſſibly be ſo abſurd as to refuſe raiſing the Supplies requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the Maintenance of Government among them, they could not long remain in ſuch a Situation; the Diſorders and Confuſion occaſioned by it muſt ſoon bring them to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Q. If it ſhould not, ought not the Right to be in <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of applying a Remedy?</p>
            <p>A. A Right only to be uſed in ſuch a Caſe, I ſhould have no Objection to, ſuppoſing it to be uſed merely for the good of the People of the Colony.</p>
            <p>Q. But who is to judge of that, <hi>Britain</hi> or the Colony?</p>
            <p>A. Thoſe that feel can beſt judge.</p>
            <p>Q. You ſay the Colonies have always ſubmitted to external Taxes, and object to the Right of Parliament only in laying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Taxes, now can you ſhew that there is any kind of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the two Taxes to the Colony on which they may be laid?</p>
            <p>A. I think the Difference is very great. An external Tax is a Duty laid on Commodities imported; that Duty is added to the firſt Coſt, and other Charges on the Commodity, and when it is offered to Sale, makes a Part of the Price. If the People do not like it at that Price, they refuſe it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal Tax is forced from the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Conſent, if not laid by their own Repreſentatives.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010303_0012_0F7E73785A36F3E8"/>
The Stamp-act ſays, we ſhall have no Commerce, make no Exchange of Property with each other, neither purchaſe nor grant, nor recover Debts; we ſhall neither marry, nor make our Wills, unleſs we pay ſuch and ſuch Sums, and thus it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extort our Money from us, or ruin us by the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of refuſing to pay it.</p>
            <p>Q. But ſuppoſing the external Tax or Duty to be laid on the Neceſſaries of Life imported into your Colony, will not that be the ſame Thing in its Effects as an internal Tax?</p>
            <p>A. I do not know a ſingle Article imported into the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies, but what they can either do without, or make themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. Don't you think Cloth from <hi>England</hi> abſolutely neceſſary to them?</p>
            <p>A. No, by no Means abſolutely neceſſary; with Induſtry and good Management, they may very well ſupply themſelves with all they want.</p>
            <p>Q. Will it not take a long Time to eſtabliſh that Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among them? and muſt they not in the mean while ſuffer greatly?</p>
            <p>A. I think not. They have made a ſurprizing Progreſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And I am of Opinion, that before their old Clothes are worn out, they will have new Ones of their own making.</p>
            <p>Q. Can they poſſibly find Wool enough in <hi>North-America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They have taken Steps to increaſe the Wool. They entered into general Combinations to eat no more Lamb, and very few Lambs were killed laſt Year. This Courſe perſiſted in, will ſoon make a prodigious Difference in the Quantity of Wool. And the eſtabliſhing of great Manufactories, like thoſe in the Clothing Towns here, is not neceſſary, as it is where the Buſineſs is to be carried on for the Purpoſes of Trade. The People will all ſpin, and work for themſelves, in their own Houſes.</p>
            <p>Q. Can there be Wool and Manufacture enough in one or two Years?</p>
            <p>A. In three Years, I think, there may.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010303_0013_0F7E737980C22720"/>
Q. Does not the Severity of the Winter, in the Northern Colonies, occaſion the Wool to be of bad Quality?</p>
            <p>A. No; the Wool is very fine and good.</p>
            <p>Q. In the more Southern Colonies, as in <hi>Virginia;</hi> don't you know that the Wool is coarſe, and only a kind of Hair?</p>
            <p>A. I don't know it. I never heard it. Yet I have been ſometimes in <hi>Virginia.</hi> I cannot ſay I ever took particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Wool there, but I believe it is good, tho' I cannot ſpeak poſitively of it; but <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the Colonies South of it, have leſs Occaſion for Wool; their Winters are ſhort, and not very ſevere, and they can very well clothe themſelves with Linen and Cotton of their own raiſing for the reſt of the Year.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not the People, in the more Northern Colonies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to fodder their Sheep all the Winter.</p>
            <p>A. In ſome of the moſt Northern Colonies they may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do it ſome Part of the Winter.</p>
            <p>Q. Conſidering the Reſolutions of Parliament, as to the Right, do you think, if the Stamp-act is repealed, that the <hi>North-Americans</hi> will be ſatisfied?</p>
            <p>A. I believe they will.</p>
            <p>Q. Why do you think ſo?</p>
            <p>A. I think the Reſolutions of Right will give them very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Concern, if they are never attempted to be carried into Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The Colonies will probably conſider themſelves in the ſame Situation, in that Reſpect, with <hi>Ireland;</hi> they know you claim the ſame Right with Regard to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but you never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it. And they may believe you never will exerciſe it in the Colonies, any more than in <hi>Ireland,</hi> unleſs on ſome very extraordinary Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Q. But who are to be the Judges of that extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Is it not the Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. Though the Parliament may judge of the Occaſion, the People will think it can never exerciſe ſuch Right, till Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives from the Colonies are admitted into Parliament, and that whenever the Occaſion ariſes, Repreſentatives will be ordered.</p>

Q. Did you never hear that <hi>Maryland,</hi> during the laſt War, had refuſed to furniſh a Quota towards the common Defence?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Maryland</hi> has been much miſrepreſented in that Matter. <hi>Maryland</hi> to my Knowledge, never refuſed to contribute, or grant Aids to the Crown. The Aſſemblies every Year, during the War, voted conſiderable Sums, and formed Bills to raiſe them. The Bills were, according to the Conſtitution of that Province, ſent up to the Council, or Upper Houſe, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, that they might be preſented to the Governor, in order to be enacted into Laws. Unhappy Diſputes between the two Houſes ariſing, from the Defects of that Conſtitution prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, rendered all the Bills but one or two abortive. The Proprietary's Council rejected them. It is true <hi>Maryland</hi> did not contribute its Proportion, but it was, in my Opinion, the Fault of the Government, not of the People.</p>
            <p>Q. Was it not talked of in the other Provinces as a proper Meaſure to apply to Parliament to compel them?</p>
            <p>A. I have heard ſuch Diſcourſe; but as it was well known, that the People were not to blame, no ſuch Application was ever made, nor any Step taken towards it.</p>
            <p>Q. Was it not propoſed at a public Meeting?</p>
            <p>A. Not that I know of.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you remember the aboliſhing of the Paper Currency in <hi>New-England,</hi> by Act of Aſſembly?</p>

            <p>Q. Was not the Lieutenant Governor <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> principally concerned in that Tranſaction?</p>

            <p>Q. Was it not at that Time a very unpopular Law?</p>
            <p>A. I believe it might, though I can ſay little about it, as I lived at a Diſtance from that Province.</p>
            <p>Q. Was not the Scarcity of Gold and Silver an Argument uſed againſt aboliſhing the Paper'</p>

Q. What is the preſent Opinion there of that Law? Is it as unpopular as it was at Firſt?</p>
            <p>A. I think it is not.</p>
            <p>Q. Have not Inſtructions from hence been ſometimes ſent over to Governors, highly oppreſſive and unpolitical?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. Have not ſome Governors diſpenſed with them for that Reaſon?</p>
            <p>A. Yes; I have heard ſo.</p>
            <p>Q. Did the <hi>Americans</hi> ever diſpute the controuling Power of Parliament to regulate the Commerce?</p>
            <p>A. No.</p>
            <p>Q. Can any thing leſs than a Military Force carry the Stamp-act into Execution?</p>
            <p>A. I do not ſee how a Military Force can be applied to that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Q. Why may it not?</p>
            <p>A. Suppoſe a Military Force ſent into <hi>America,</hi> they will find Nobody in Arms; What are they then to do? They cannot force a Man to take Stamps who chooſes to do without them. They will not find a Rebellion; they may indeed make one.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Act is not repealed, what do you think will be the Conſequences?</p>
            <p>A. A total Loſs of the Reſpect and Affection the People of <hi>America</hi> bear to this Country, and of all the Commerce that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on that Reſpect and Affection.</p>
            <p>Q. How can the Commerce be affected?</p>
            <p>A. You will find, that if the Act is not repealed, they will take very little of your Manufactures in a ſhort Time.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it in their Power to do without them.</p>
            <p>A. I think they may very well do without them.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it their Intereſt not to take them?</p>
            <p>A. The Goods they take from <hi>Britain</hi> are either Neceſſaries, mere Conveniences, or Superfluities. The Firſt, as Cloth, &amp;c. with a little Induſtry they can make at Home; the Second they can do without, till they are able to provide them among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010303_0016_0F7E737B587ABD28"/>
and the laſt, which are much the greateſt Part, they will ſtrike off immediately. They are mere Articles of Faſhion, purchaſed and conſumed, becauſe the Faſhion in a reſpected Country, but will now be deteſted and rejected. The People have already ſtruck off, by general Agreement, the uſe of all Goods faſhionable in Mournings, and many Thouſand Pounds Worth are ſent back as unſaleable.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it their Intereſt to make Cloth at Home?</p>
            <p>A. I think they may at preſent get it cheaper from <hi>Britain.</hi> I mean of the ſame Fineneſs and Neatneſs of Workmanſhip; but when one conſiders other Circumſtances, the Reſtraints on their Trade, and the Difficulty of making Remittances, it is their Intereſt to make every Thing.</p>
            <p>Q. Suppoſe an Act of internal Regulations, connected with a Tax, how would they receive it?</p>
            <p>A. I think it would be objected to.</p>
            <p>Q. Then no Regulation with a Tax would be ſubmitted to?</p>
            <p>A. Their Opinion is, that when Aids to the Crown are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are to be aſked of the ſeveral Aſſemblies, according to the old eſtabliſhed Uſage, who will, as they always have done, grant them freely. And that their Money ought not to be given away without their Conſent, by Perſons at a Diſtance, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Circumſtances and Abilities. The granting Aids to the Crown, is the only Means they have of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending themſelves to their Sovereign, and they think it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hard and unjuſt, that a Body of Men, in which they have no Repreſentatives, ſhould make a Merit to itſelf of giving and granting what is not its own, but theirs, and deprive them of a Right they eſteem of the utmoſt Value and Importance, as it is the Security of all their other Rights.</p>
            <p>Q. But is not the Poſt-office, which they have long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, a Tax as well as a Regulation?</p>
            <p>A. No; the Money paid for the Poſtage of a Letter is not of the Nature of a Tax; it is merely a Quantum Meruit for a Service done; no Perſon is compellable to pay the Money, if he does not chuſe to receive the Service. A Man may ſtill,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010303_0017_0F7E737DAD180588"/>
as before the Act, ſend his Letter by a Servant, a ſpecial Meſſenger, or a Friend, if he thinks it cheaper and ſafer.</p>
            <p>Q. But do they not conſider the Regulations of the Poſt-office, by the Act of laſt Year, as a Tax?</p>
            <p>A. By the Regulations of laſt Year the Rate of Poſtage was generally abated near thirty <hi>per Cent.</hi> through all <hi>America;</hi> they certainly cannot conſider ſuch Abatement as a Tax.</p>
            <p>Q. If an Exciſe was laid by Parliament, which they might likewiſe avoid paying, by not conſuming the Articles exciſed, would they then not object to it?</p>
            <p>A. They would certainly object to it, as an Exciſe is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with any Service done, and is merely an Aid which they think ought to be aſked of them, and granted by them, if they are to pay it, and can be granted for them by no others whatſoever, whom they have not impowered for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Q. You ſay they do not object to the Right of Parliament in laying Duties on Goods to be paid on their Importation; now, is there any kind of Difference between a Duty on the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Goods, and an Exciſe, on their Conſumption?</p>
            <p>A. Yes; a very material one; an Exciſe, for the Reaſons I have juſt mentioned, they think you can have no Right to lay within their Country. But the Sea is yours; you maintain, by your Fleets, the Safety of Navigation in it; and keep it clear of Pirates; you may have therefore a natural and equitable Right to ſome Toll or Duty on Merchandizes carried through that Part of your Dominions, towards defraying the Expence you are at in Ships to maintain the Safety of that Carriage.</p>
            <p>Q. Does this Reaſoning hold in the Caſe of a Duty laid on the Produce of their Lands exported? and would they not then object to ſuch a Duty?</p>
            <p>A. If it tended to make the Produce ſo much dearer Abroad as to leſſen the Demand for it, to be ſure they would object to ſuch a Duty; not to your Right of laying it, but they would complain of it as a Burthen, and petition you to lighten it.</p>
            <p>Q. Is not the Duty paid on the Tobacco exported a Duty of that Kind?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010303_0018_0F7E737E915EBF30"/>
A. That, I think, is only on Tobacco carried coaſtwiſe from one Colony to another, and appropriated as a Fund for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the College at <hi>Williamſburg,</hi> in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. Have not the Aſſemblies in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> the ſame natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights with thoſe in <hi>North America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Undoubtedly.</p>
            <p>Q. And is there not a Tax laid there on their Sugars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported?</p>
            <p>A. I am not much acquanted with the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> but the Duty of four and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> on Sugars exported, was, I believe, granted by their own Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>Q. How much is the Poll-Tax in your Province laid on unmarried Men?</p>
            <p>A. It is, I think, Fifteen Shillings, to be paid by every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Freeman, upwards of twenty-one Years old.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the annual Amount of all the Taxes in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I ſuppoſe about 20,000 Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>Q. Suppoſing the Stamp-act continued, and enforced, do you imagine that ill Humour will induce the <hi>Americans</hi> to give as much for worſe Manufactures of their own, and uſe them, preferable to better of ours.</p>
            <p>A. Yes, I think ſo. People will pay as freely to gratify one Paſſion as another, their Reſentment as their Pride.</p>
            <p>Q. Would the People at <hi>Boſton</hi> diſcontinue their Trade?</p>
            <p>A. The Merchants are a very ſmall Number, compared with the Body of the People, and muſt diſcontinue their Trade, if Nobody will buy their Goods.</p>
            <p>Q. What are the Body of the People in the Colonies?</p>
            <p>A. They are Farmers, Huſbandmen or Planters.</p>
            <p>Q. Would they ſuffer the Produce of their Lands to rot?</p>
            <p>A. No; but they would not raiſe ſo much. They would manufacture more, and plough leſs.</p>
            <p>Q. Would they live without the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in civil Matters, and ſuffer all the Inconveniences of ſuch a Situation for any conſiderable Time, rather than take the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010303_0019_0F7E737F1AB66CB8"/>
Stamps, ſuppoſing the Stamps were protected by a ſufficient Force, where every one might have them?</p>
            <p>A. I think the Suppoſition impracticable, that the Stamps ſhould be ſo protected as that every one might have them. The Act requires Sub-diſtributors to be appointed in every County Town, Diſtrict and Village, and they would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. But the principal Diſtributors, who were to have had a conſiderable Profit on the Whole, have not thought it worth while to continue in the Office, and I think it impoſſible to find Sub-diſtributors fit to be truſted, who, for the trifling Profit that muſt come to their Share, would incur the Odium, and run the Hazard that would attend it; and if they could be found, I think it impracticable to protect the Stamps in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtant and remote Places.</p>
            <p>Q. But in Places where they could be protected, would not the People uſe them rather than remain in ſuch a Situation, unable to obtain any Right, or recover, by Law, any Debt?</p>
            <p>A. It is hard to ſay what they would do. I can only judge what other People will think, and how they will act by what I feel within myſelf. I have a great many Debts due to me in <hi>America,</hi> and I had rather they ſhould remain unrecoverable by any Law, than ſubmit to the Stamp-act. They will be Debts of Honour. It is my Opinion the People will either continue in that Situation, or find ſome way to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the Courts without Stamps.</p>
            <p>Q. What do you think a ſufficient military Force to protect the Diſtribution of the Stamps in every Part of <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. A very great Force; I can't ſay what, if the Diſpoſition of <hi>America</hi> is for a general Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the Number of Men in <hi>America</hi> able to bear Arms, or of diſciplined Militia?</p>
            <p>A. There are, I ſuppoſe, at leaſt—[<hi>Queſtion objected to. He withdrew. Called in again.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Q. Is the <hi>American</hi> Stamp-act an equal Tax on that Country?</p>
            <p>A. I think not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010303_0020_0F7E737FE1E5E6F8"/>
Q. Why ſo?</p>
            <p>A. The greateſt Part of the Money muſt ariſe from Law Suits for the Recovery of Debts, and be paid by the lower Sort of People, who were too poor eaſily to pay their Debts. It is therefore a heavy Tax on the Poor, and a Tax upon them for being poor.</p>
            <p>Q. But will not this Increaſe of Expence be a Means of leſſening the Number of Law Suits;</p>
            <p>A. I think not; for as the Coſts fall all upon the Debtor, and are to be paid by him, they would be no Diſcouragement to the Creditor to bring his Action.</p>
            <p>Q. Would it not have the Effect of exceſſive Uſury?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, as an Oppreſſion of the Debtor.</p>
            <p>Q. How many Ships are there laden annually in <hi>North-America</hi> with Flax-ſeed for <hi>Ireland?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I cannot ſpeak to the Number of Ships, but I know that in 1752, 10,000 Hogſheads of Flax-ſeed, each containing 7 Buſhels, were exported from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to <hi>Ireland.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Quantity is greatly increaſed ſince that Time; and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the Exportation from <hi>New-York</hi> is equal to that from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. What becomes of the Flax that grows with that Flax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed?</p>
            <p>A. They manufacture ſome into coarſe, and ſome into a middling Kind of Linen.</p>
            <p>Q. Are there any ſlitting Mills in <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I think there are, but I believe only one at preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. I ſuppoſe they will all be ſet to Work, if the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Trade continues.</p>
            <p>Q. Are there any fulling Mills there?</p>
            <p>A. A great many.</p>
            <p>Q. Did you never hear that a great Quantity of Stockings were contracted for the Army during the War, and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured in <hi>Philadelphia?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. I have heard ſo.</p>

Q. If the Stamp-Act ſhould be repealed, would not the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> think they could oblige the Parliament to repeal every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Tax Law now in Force?</p>
            <p>A. It is hard to anſwer Queſtions of what People at ſuch a Diſtance will think.</p>
            <p>Q. But what do you imagine they will think were the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of repealing the Act?</p>
            <p>A. I ſuppoſe they will think that it was repealed from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of its Inexpediency; and they will rely upon it, that while the ſame Inexpediency ſubſiſts, you will never attempt to make ſuch another.</p>
            <p>Q. What do you mean by its Inexpediency?</p>
            <p>A. I mean its Inexpediency on ſeveral Accounts; the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Inability of thoſe who were to pay the Tax; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diſcontent it has occaſioned; and the Impracticability of enforcing it.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Act ſhould be repealed, and the Legiſlature ſhould ſhew its Reſentment to the Oppoſers of the Stamp-Act, would the Colonies acquieſce in the Authority of the Legiſlature? What is your Opinion they would do?</p>
            <p>A. I don't doubt at all, that if the Legiſlature repeal the Stamp-Act, the Colonies will acquieſce in the Authority.</p>
            <p>Q. But if the Legiſlature ſhould think fit to aſcertain its Right to lay Taxes, by any Act laying a ſmall Tax, contrary to their Opinion, would they ſubmit to pay the Tax?</p>
            <p>A. The Proceedings of the People in <hi>America</hi> have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered too much together. The Proceedings of the Aſſemblies have been very different from thoſe of the Mobs, and ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, as having no Connection with each other.—The Aſſemblies have only peaceably reſolved what they take to be their Rights; they have taken no Meaſures for Oppoſition by Force; they have not built a Fort, raiſed a Man, or provided a Grain of Ammunition, in order to ſuch Oppoſition.—The Ringleaders of Riots they think ought to be puniſhed; they would puniſh them themſelves, if they could. Every ſober ſenſible Man would wiſh to ſee Rioters puniſhed, as otherwiſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010303_0022_0F7E73819659E0C8"/>
peaceable People have no Security of Perſon or Eſtate. But as to any internal Tax, how ſmall ſoever, laid by the Legiſlature here on the People there, while they have no Repreſentatives in this Legiſlature, I think it will never be ſubmitted to.—They will oppoſe it to the laſt.—They do not conſider it as at all neceſſary for you to raiſe Money on them by your Taxes, becauſe they are, and always have been, ready to raiſe Money by Taxes among themſelves, and to grant large Sums, equal to their Abilities, upon Requiſition from the Crown.—They have not only granted equal to their Abilities, but, during all the laſt War, they granted far beyond their Abilities, and beyond their Proportion with this Country, you yourſelves being Judges, to the Amount of many Hundred Thouſand Pounds, and this they did freely and readily, only on a Sort of Promiſe from the Secretary of State, that it ſhould be recommended to Parliament to make them Compenſation. It was accordingly recommended to Parliament, in the moſt honourable Manner, for them. <hi>America</hi> has been greatly miſrepreſented and abuſed here, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and Pamphlets, and Speeches, as ungrateful and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unjuſt, in having put this Nation to immenſe Expence for their Defence, and refuſing to bear any Part of that Expence. The Colonies raiſed, paid and clothed, near 25000 Men during the laſt War, a Number equal to thoſe ſent from <hi>Britain,</hi> and far beyond their Proportion; they went deeply into Debt in doing this, and all their Taxes and Eſtates are mortgaged, for many Years to come, for diſcharging that Debt. Government here was at that Time very ſenſible of this. The Colonies were recommended to Parliament. Every Year the King ſent down to the Houſe a written Meſſage to this Purpoſe. That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, being highly ſenſible of the Zeal and Vigour with which his faithful Subjects in <hi>North-America</hi> had exerted themſelves, in Defence of his Majeſty's juſt Rights and Poſſeſſions, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it to the Houſe to take the ſame into Conſideration, and enable him to give them a proper Compenſation. You will find thoſe Meſſages on your own Journals every Year of the War to the very laſt, and you did accordingly give 200,000 Pounds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010303_0023_0F7E738218103B88"/>
to the Crown, to be diſtributed in ſuch Compenſation to the Colonies. This is the ſtrongeſt of all Proofs that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, far from being unwilling to bear a Share of the Burthen, did exceed their Proportion; for if they had done leſs, or had only equalled their Proportion, there would have been no Room or Reaſon for Compenſation.—Indeed the Sums reimburſed them, were by no Means adequate to the Expence they incurred beyond their Proportion; but they never murmured at that; they eſteemed their Sovereign's Approbation of their Zeal and Fidelity, and the Approbation of this Houſe, far beyond any other Kind of Compenſation; therefore there was no Occaſion for this Act, to force Money from a willing People; they had not refuſed giving Money for the Purpoſes of the Act; no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition had been made; they were always willing and ready to do what could reaſonably be expected from them, and in this Light they wiſh to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Q. But ſuppoſe <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhould be engaged in a War in <hi>Europe,</hi> would <hi>North-America</hi> contribute to the Support of it?</p>
            <p>A. I do think they would, as far as their Circumſtances would permit. They conſider themſelves as a Part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and as having one common Intereſt with it; they may be looked on here as Foreigners, but they do not conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſuch. They are zealous for the Honour and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Nation, and, while they are well uſed, will always be ready to ſupport it, as far as their little Power goes. In 1739 they were called upon to aſſiſt in the Expedition againſt <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and they ſent 3000 Men to join your Army. It is true <hi>Carthagena</hi> is in <hi>America,</hi> but as remote from the Northern Colonies, as if it had been in <hi>Europe.</hi> They make no Diſtinction of Wars, as to their Duty of aſſiſting in them. I know the laſt War is commonly ſpoke of here as entered into for the Defence, or for the Sake of the People of <hi>America.</hi> I think it is quite miſunderſtood. It began about the Limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween. <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> about Territories to which the Crown indeed laid Claim, but were not claimed by any <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010303_0024_0F7E7385D6154260"/>
Colony; none of the Lands had been granted to any Coloniſt; we had therefore no particular Concern or Intereſt in that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. As to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> the Conteſt there began about your Right of trading in the <hi>Indian</hi> Country, a Right you had by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> infringed; they ſeized the Traders and their Goods, which were your Manufactures; they took a Fort which a Company of your Merchants, and their Factors and Correſpondents, had erected there, to ſecure that Trade. <hi>Braddock</hi> was ſent with an Army to re-take that Fort (which was looked on here as another Incroachment on the King's Territory) and to protect your Trade. It was not till after his Defeat that the Colonies were attacked. They were before in perfect Peace with both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians;</hi> the Troops were not therefore ſent for their Defence. The Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> though carried on in <hi>America,</hi> is not an <hi>American</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. The People of <hi>America</hi> are chiefly Farmers and Planters; ſcarce any Thing that they raiſe or produce is an Article of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Indians.</hi> The <hi>Indian</hi> Trade is a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt; it is carried on with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, for the Profit of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Merchants and Manufacturers; therefore the War, as it commenced for the Defence of Territories of the Crown, the Property of no <hi>American,</hi> and for the Defence of a Trade purely <hi>Britiſh,</hi> was really a <hi>Britiſh</hi> War—and yet the People of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> made no Scruple of contributing their utmoſt towards carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on, and bringing it to a happy Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you think then that the taking Poſſeſſion of the King's territorial Rights, and ſtrengthening the Frontiers, is not an <hi>American</hi> Intereſt?</p>
            <p>A. Not particularly, but conjointly a <hi>Britiſh</hi> and an <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Q. You will not deny that the preceding War, the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> was entered into for the Sake of <hi>America;</hi> was it not occaſioned by Captures made in the <hi>American</hi> Seas?</p>
            <p>A. Yes; Captures of Slips carrying on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade there, with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010303_0025_0F7E7385E1A7B900"/>
Q. Was not the late War with the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſince the Peace with <hi>France,</hi> a War for <hi>America</hi> only?</p>
            <p>A. Yes; it was more particularly for <hi>America</hi> than the former, but it was rather a Conſequence or Remains of the former War, the <hi>Indians</hi> not having been thoroughly pacified, and the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> bore by much the greateſt Share of the Expence. It was put an End to by the Army under General <hi>Bouquet;</hi> there were not above 300 Regulars in that Army, and above 1000 <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. Is it not neceſſary to ſend Troops to <hi>America,</hi> to defend the <hi>Americans</hi> againſt the <hi>Indians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No, by no Means; it never was neceſſary. They defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves when they were but an Handful, and the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> much more numerous. They continually gained Ground, and have driven the <hi>Indians</hi> over the Mountains, without any Troops ſent to their Aſſiſtance from this Country. And can it be thought neceſſary now to ſend Troops for their Defence from thoſe diminiſhed <hi>Indian</hi> Tribes, when the Colonies are become ſo populous, and ſo ſtrong? There is not the leaſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it; they are very able to defend themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you ſay there were no more than 300 Regular Troops employed in the late <hi>Indian</hi> War?</p>
            <p>A. Not on the <hi>Ohio,</hi> or the Frontiers of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which was the chief Part of the War that affected the Colonies. There were Garriſons at <hi>Niagara,</hi> Fort <hi>Detroit,</hi> and thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Poſts kept for the Sake of your Trade; I did not reckon them, but I believe that on the whole the Number of <hi>Americans,</hi> or provincial Troops, employed in the War, was greater than that of the Regulars. I am not certain, but I think ſo.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you think the Aſſemblies have a Right to levy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on the Subject there, to grant to the Crown?</p>
            <p>A. I certainly think ſo; they have always done it.</p>
            <p>Q. Are they acquainted with the Declaration of Rights? and do they know that, by that Statute, Money is not to be raiſed on the Subject but by Conſent of Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. They are very well acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:010303_0026_0F7E7386B63BB678"/>
Q. How then can they think they have a Right to levy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the Crown, or for any other than local Purpoſes?</p>
            <p>A. They underſtand that Clauſe to relate to Subjects only within the Realm; that no Money can be levied on them for the Crown, but by Conſent of Parliament. The Colonies are not ſuppoſed to be within the Realm; they have Aſſemblies of their own, which are their Parliaments, and they are in that Reſpect in the ſame Situation with <hi>Ireland.</hi> When Money is to be raiſed for the Crown upon the Subject in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in the Colonies, the Conſent is given in the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in the Aſſemblies of the Colonies. They think the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> cannot properly give that Conſent till it has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives from <hi>America;</hi> for the Petition of Right expreſsly ſays, it is to be by common Conſent in Parliament, and the People of <hi>America</hi> have no Repreſentatives in Parliament, to make a Part of that common Conſent.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Stamp-act ſhould be repealed, and an Act ſhould paſs, ordering the Aſſemblies of the Colonies to indemnify the Sufferers by the Riots, would they obey it?</p>
            <p>A. That is a Queſtion I cannot anſwer.</p>
            <p>Q. Suppoſe the King ſhould require the Colonies to grant a Revenue, and the Parliament ſhould be againſt their doing it, do they think they can grant a Revenue to the King, without the Conſent of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. That is a deep Queſtion.—As to my own Opinion, I ſhould think myſelf at Liberty to do it, and ſhould do it, if I liked the Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Q. When Money has been raiſed in the Colonies upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, has it not been granted to the King?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, always; but the Requiſitions have generally been for ſome Service expreſſed, as to raiſe, clothe and pay Troops, and not for Money only.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Act ſhould paſs, requiring the <hi>American</hi> Aſſemblies to make Compenſation to the Sufferers, and they ſhould diſobey it, and then the Parliament ſhould, by another Act, lay an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Tax, would they then obey it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:010303_0027_0F7E73875ADEA980"/>
A. The People will pay no internal Tax; and I think an Act to oblige the Aſſemblies to make Compenſation is unneceſſary, for I am of Opinion, that as ſoon as the preſent Heats are abated, they will take the Matter into Conſideration, and, if it is right to be done, they will do it of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Q. Do not Letters often come into the Poſt-Offices in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> directed to ſome inland Town where no Poſt goes?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. Can any private Perſon take up thoſe Letters, and carry them as directed?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, any Friend of the Perſon may do it, paying the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that has occurred?</p>
            <p>Q. But muſt he not pay an additional Poſtage for the Diſtance to ſuch inland Town?</p>
            <p>A. No.</p>
            <p>Q. Can the Poſt-Maſter anſwer delivering the Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being paid ſuch additional Poſtage?</p>
            <p>A. Certainly he can demand nothing where he does no Service.</p>
            <p>Q. Suppoſe a Perſon, being far from Home, finds a Letter in a Poſt-Office directed to him, and he lives in a Place to which the Poſt generally goes, and the Letter is directed to that Place, will the Poſt-Maſter deliver him the Letter without his paying the Poſtage receivable at the Place to which the Letter is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
            <p>A. Yes; the Office cannot demand Poſtage for a Letter that it does not carry, or farther than it does carry it.</p>
            <p>Q. Are not Ferrymen in <hi>America</hi> obliged by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to carry over the Poſts without Pay?</p>
            <p>A. Yes.</p>
            <p>Q. Is not this a Tax on the Ferrymen?</p>
            <p>A. They do not conſider it as ſuch, as they have an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from Perſons travelling with the Poſt.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Stamp-Act ſhould be repealed, and the Crown ſhould make a Requiſition to the Colonies for a Sum of Money, would they grant it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010303_0028_0F7E73881C3B8618"/>
A. I believe they would.</p>
            <p>Q. Why do you think ſo?</p>
            <p>A. I can ſpeak for the Colony I live in; I had it in Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Aſſembly to aſſure the Miniſtry, that as they always had done, ſo they ſhould always think it their Duty to grant ſuch Aids to the Crown as were ſuitable to their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Abilities, whenever called upon for the Purpoſe, in the uſual conſtitutional Manner; and I had the Honour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating this Inſtruction to that Honourable Gentleman then Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Q. Would they do this for a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Concern; as ſuppoſe a War in ſome Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> that did not affect them?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, for any Thing that concerned the general Intereſt. They conſider themſelves as a Part of the Whole.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the uſual conſtitutional Manner of calling on the Colonies for Aids?</p>
            <p>A. A Letter from the Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>Q. Is this all you mean, a Letter from the Secretary of State?</p>
            <p>A. I mean the uſual Way of Requiſition, in a circular Letter from the Secretary of State, by his Majeſty's Command, reciting the Occaſion, and recommending it to the Colonies to grant ſuch Aids as became their Loyalty, and were ſuitable to their Abilities.</p>
            <p>Q. Did the Secretary of State ever write for Money for the Crown?</p>
            <p>A. The Requiſitions have been to raiſe, clothe and pay Men, which cannot be done without Money.</p>
            <p>Q. Would they grant Money alone, if called on?</p>
            <p>A. In my Opinion they would, Money as well as Men, when they have Money, or can make it.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Parliament ſhould repeal the Stamp-Act, will the Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> reſcind their Reſolutions?</p>
            <p>A. I think not.</p>
            <p>Q. Before there was any Thought of the Stamp-act, did they wiſh for a Repreſentation in Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. No.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:010303_0029_0F7E7388DA278E80"/>
Q. Don't you know that there is in the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Charter, an expreſs Reſervation of the Right of Parliament to lay Taxes there?</p>
            <p>A. I know there is a Clauſe in the Charter, by which the King grants that he will levy no Taxes on the Inhabitants, unleſs it be with the Conſent of the Aſſembly, or by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Q. How then could the Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> aſſert, that laying a Tax on them by the Stamp-act was an Infringement of their Rights?</p>
            <p>A. They underſtand it thus; by the ſame Charter, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they are intitled to all the Privileges and Liberties of <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> they find in the great Charters, and the Petition and Declaration of Rights, that one of the Privileges of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects is, that they are not to be taxed but by their common Conſent; they have therefore relied upon it, from the firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Province, that the Parliament never would, nor could, by Colour of that Clauſe in the Charter, aſſume a Right of taxing them, till it had qualified itſelf to exerciſe ſuch Right, by admitting Repreſentatives from the People to be taxed, who ought to make a Part of that common Conſent.</p>
            <p>Q. Are there any Words in the Charter that juſtify that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
            <p>A. The common Rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as declared by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Petition of Right, all juſtify it.</p>
            <p>Q. Does the Diſtinction between internal and external Taxes exiſt in the Words of the Charter?</p>
            <p>A. No, I believe not.</p>
            <p>Q. Then may they not, by the ſame Interpretation, object to the Parliament's Right of external Taxation?</p>
            <p>A. They never have hitherto. Many Arguments have been lately uſed here to ſhew them that there is no Difference, and that if you have no Right to tax them internally, you have none to tax them externally, or make any other Law to bind them. At preſent they do not reaſon ſo, but in Time they may poſſibly be convinced by theſe Arguments.</p>

Q. Do not the Reſolutions of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Aſſembly ſay all Taxes?</p>
            <p>A. If they do, they mean only internal Taxes; the ſame Words have not always the ſame Meaning here and in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. By Taxes they mean internal Taxes; by Duties they mean Cuſtoms; theſe are their Ideas of the Language.</p>
            <p>Q. Have you not ſeen the Reſolutions of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> Aſſembly?</p>
            <p>A. I have.</p>
            <p>Q. Do they not ſay, that neither external nor internal Taxes can be laid on them by Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. I don't know that they do; I believe not.</p>
            <p>Q. If the ſame Colony ſhould ſay neither Tax nor Impoſition could be laid, does not that Province hold the Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can hold neither?</p>
            <p>A. I ſuppoſe that by the Word Impoſition, they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to expreſs Duties to be laid on Goods imported, as Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Q. What can the Colonies mean then by Impoſition as diſtinct from Taxes?</p>
            <p>A. They may mean many Things, as impreſſing of Men, or of Carriages, quartering Troops on private Houſes, and the like; there may be great Impoſitions, that are not properly Taxes.</p>
            <p>Q. Is not the Poſt-Office Rate an internal Tax laid by Act of Parliament?</p>
            <p>A. I have anſwered that.</p>
            <p>Q. Are all Parts of the Colonies equally able to pay Taxes?</p>
            <p>A. No, certainly; the Frontier Parts, which have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged by the Enemy, are greatly diſabled by that Means, and therefore, in ſuch Caſes, are uſually favoured in our Tax Laws.</p>
            <p>Q. Can we, at this Diſtance, be competent Judges of what Favours are neceſſary?</p>
            <p>A. The Parliamentar have ſuppoſed it, by claiming a Right to make Tax Laws for <hi>America:</hi> I think it impoſſible.</p>
            <p>

Q. Would the Repeal of the Stamp-Act be any Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Manufactures? Will the People that have begun to manufacture decline it?</p>
            <p>A. Yes, I think they will; eſpecially if, at the ſame Time, the Trade is opened again, ſo that Remittances can be eaſily made. I have known ſeveral Inſtances that make it probable. In the War before laſt, Tobacco being low, and making little Remittance, the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> went generally into Family Manufactures. Afterwards, when Tobacco bore a better Price, they returned to the Uſe of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures. So fulling Mills were very much diſuſed in the laſt War in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> becauſe Bills were then plenty, and Remittances could eaſily be made to <hi>Britain</hi> for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth and other Goods.</p>
            <p>Q. If the Stamp-Act ſhould be repealed, would it induce the Aſſemblies of <hi>America</hi> to acknowledge the Rights of Parliament to tax them, and would they eraſe their Reſolutions?</p>
            <p>A. No, never.</p>
            <p>Q. Is there no Means of obliging them to eraſe thoſe Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>A. None that I know of; they will never do it unleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by Force of Arms.</p>
            <p>Q. Is there a Power on Earth that can force them to eraſe them?</p>
            <p>A. No Power, how great ſoever, can force Men to change their Opinions.</p>
            <p>Q. Do they conſider the Poſt-Office as a Tax, or as a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</p>
            <p>A. Not as a Tax, but as a Regulation and Conveniency; every Aſſembly encouraged it, and ſupported it in its Infancy, by Grants of Money, which they would not otherwiſe have done; and the People have always paid the Poſtage.</p>
            <p>Q. When did you receive the Inſtructions you mentioned?</p>
            <p>A. I brought them with me, when I came to <hi>England,</hi> about 15 Months ſince.</p>
            <p>Q. When did you communicate that Inſtruction to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter?</p>
