            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WAR is deſervedly accounted a very great judgment; as ſuch it is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſacred ſcriptures, and ſuch eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed by thoſe who have had ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience of its ravages. <hi>Every battle of the warrior is with confuſed noiſe and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments rolled in blood</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Iſaiah ix.5.</note>: Wherever it takes its rout it leaves a <hi>crimſon tract</hi> behind it, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the deepeſt diſtreſs, and ſpreads deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction round; whilſt to compleat the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tragedy, <hi>famine</hi> and <hi>peſtilence</hi> often times follow in its train. Perſons of refined humanity cannot even contemplate it at a diſtance without the moſt painful emotions. With the compaſſionate prophet they are ready to cry out, <hi>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013789_0003_0F91AED06A74D5E0"/>
thou haſt heard, O my ſoul, the ſound of the trumpet, the alarm of war</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Jeremiah iv 19.</note>. The idea is ſhocking, the heart revolts at the proſpect, and none but the <hi>ſavage</hi> and <hi>inhuman</hi> can conſider its tragical effects without horror: But though this be true, yet it frequently rages, its rumours are heard in different parts of the world, and perhaps there is no time when peace is at once enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the earth. It is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to reflect, that whilſt "devils with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils damned firm concord hold," men, who are under every poſſible engagement to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate peace and love, ſhould ſuffer their breaſts to be agitated by paſſions ſo malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as to excite ſuch obſtinate diſputes as cannot be decided, but by the ſword, and terminate in all the horrors of war. Still more to be lamented is it, that they, who far from diſturbing others, deſire only to ſit under their own vine and fig-tree, enjoying the ſweets of induſtry, friendſhip and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould be moleſted by the <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>tyrannical,</hi> and forced to fly to arms in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their inherent rights and privileges: But ſuch is the depraved ſtate of human nature, that inſtances like <hi>this</hi> are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common: <hi>Wars and fightings proceed from men's luſts, which war in their members,</hi> and are greatly prevalent ſince the apoſtacy. The love of empire, the principles of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013789_0004_0F91AED138F1E950"/>
avarice and revenge, being deeply radicated in the human heart, have convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this earth, which otherwiſe would have been the peaceful retreat of innocence, into an horrid ſcene of offenſive wars, and a field of blood: The united conſiderations of reaſon and religion have never been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently powerful to reſtrain theſe luſts of men, and keep them from invading the perſons, liberties and poſſeſſions of their neighbours. Hence it becomes neceſſary for the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> the <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive</hi> to turn their attention to the art of war; and while they breathe the pacific ſpirit of the goſpel, to furniſh themſelves with the inſtruments of ſlaughter: This is requiſite in order to their preſerving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and property, from the hands of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. In this view therefore, war though connected with blood and carnage, is legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated. The principles of ſelf-preſervation prove it lawful; the voice of reaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it expedient, and the law of God demands it as a duty; whilſt a moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous <hi>curſe is denounced againſt ſuch as do this work of the Lord deceitfully, and keep back their ſwords from blood</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Jerem. xlviii.10.</note>. Were we certain of being always ſafe from the violent and unreaſonable aſſaults of others, it would by no means be expedient for us to ſpend any part of our time for the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013789_0005_0F91AED69E6CA2A0"/>
of military ſkill; for the religion of Jeſus, the laws of God, do not permit us to invade the rights of others, or diſturb them in the quiet enjoyment of their juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired poſſeſſions. But, inaſmuch as the preſent corrupt temper of mankind can give us no reaſonable proſpect of an entire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from their violence, and as the moſt probable way to prevent the execution of their wicked deſigns, is to appeal to the ſword, and be in a capacity to repreſs their inſolence, and repel force by force; hence knowledge in the arts and policy of war, is a very deſirable accompliſhment: And truly happy is the condition of that people, who are ſo prepared for the reception of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching enemy, as to be free from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing fears on the occaſion, and have well grounded confidence of ſucceſs in battle. This was the happy condition of <hi>David</hi> in my text: On what occaſion he penned the Pſalm is uncertain: Some think, when he was perſecuted by <hi>Saul</hi>; others, when he was forced to fly from <hi>Abſalom</hi>; and others again, on the occaſion of his being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hands of <hi>Iſhbibenob,</hi> one of the ſons of a Giant, who came upon him and thought to have killed him, and probably would have done ſo, had not Abiſhai ſtepped in to his relief <note n="d" place="bottom">2d Saml. xxi.16.</note>: But be the occaſion what it would, we find it ſpeaks the language of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013789_0006_0F91AED79FE5C198"/>
confidence, and a full aſſurance of victory in war, ſhould it ever riſe againſt him. This was not a groundleſs preſumption, nor the effect of pride and ſelf-conceit; it was not an enthuſiaſtic impreſſion, nor an evidence of a raſh and fool-hardy ſpirit; but the reſult of paſt experience: His knowledge and dexterity in the uſe of arms, his own bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and proweſs, the goodneſs of his cauſe and the favour of heaven towards him, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with theſe hopes. The words then may well furniſh out to us the foundation of an enquiry concerning the things that are requiſite to inſpire a people with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and reaſonable hopes of ſucceſs in an engagement with an hoſt that either has, or may encamp againſt them. You will give your candid attention then, whilſt I go on to enumerate thoſe things that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The juſtice of their cauſe is, in this view eſſential: They who are believers in the righteous, ſuperintending providence of God, muſt needs have but very ſlender hopes of prevailing in battle, if they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be engaged in the ſupport of an unrighteous claim: If the increaſing their own power and dominion, the aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves and families, and the gratification of the paſſions of avarice, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or revenge, be the only motives of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013789_0007_0F91AED7EA140C88"/>
their commencing hoſtilities, and the only objects they are purſuing in oppoſition to the peace and happineſs, the liberty and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of thoſe whom they invade; then, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, their own hearts muſt miſgive them; and they can reaſonably expect no favour, no countenance, no ſupport from that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Governor of the world who loveth righteouſneſs, and is particularly concerned for the happineſs of his great family of mankind: Should they flatter themſelves with hopes of ſucceſs from their ſuperior numbers, or greater acquaintance with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary diſcipline, yet they cannot fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that God is able to arm the elements and the whole hoſt of heaven againſt them, to impart wiſdom to the ſimple, knowledge to the ignorant, ſtrength to the weak, and courage to the faint-hearted; and thus to cauſe victory to declare in favour of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed innocence. <hi>This,</hi> the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic hiſtory in the world teaches us he has done in time paſt, and <hi>this</hi> ſuch unrighteous oppreſſors have reaſon to fear he may do again; if in a natural way, deliverance cannot be procured for thoſe who are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in defence of their own righteous cauſe: The invaders therefore of the rights of their fellow-men muſt neceſſarily have many fore bodings of ill-ſucceſs, and juſt fears of being repulſed, even when engaged
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013789_0008_0F91AED8B56BBC48"/>
in conteſt with a people leſs in number and inferior in ſkill to themſelves: Whereas on the other hand, the goodneſs of a people's cauſe not only gives hope that God will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and ſucceed them in it; <hi>that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord's hoſt will be for them,</hi> and <hi>fight their battles,</hi> but alſo inſpires them with great zeal and reſolution in the defence of it. What confidence muſt that people have of protection and victory, when the intereſt of religion, the honor of God, the happineſs of themſelves, and the welfare of unborn millions, are the only object of their contention? And what an amazing unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken courage, what an invincible heroiſm, will poſſeſs the breaſts of thoſe who fight <hi>pro aris et focis,</hi> for their religion, their wives and children, their liberty and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſhort, for every thing that is good and great, venerable and ſacred. <hi>This</hi> will give ſpirit to the lifeleſs, courage to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, invention to the dull, and ardour to the phlegmatic. In ſuch a cauſe as this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ages and profeſſions will chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully engage. The huſband-man <hi>will beat his plough-ſhare into ſwords, and the vine-dreſſer his pruning-hook into ſpears, and the weak,</hi> forgetting his natural embicility, <hi>will ſay I am ſtrong</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Joel ii.10.</note>. In fine, as the poet has finely obſerved:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> A ſuitable body of troops to ſtand up in defence of this good cauſe is another thing neceſſary. On the goodneſs of their cauſe a wiſe people will not alone rely, though God can deliver, and has done ſo, without any viſible means, yet his uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is to effect his purpoſes by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of ſecond cauſes: Therefore to neglect the natural means of ſafety, whilſt we have them in our power, is not confid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>in,</hi> but raſhly tempting and boldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming <hi>on</hi> the power and goodneſs of God. He expects that we uſe all lawful methods in our own power for our ſecurity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; after which we may leave our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous cauſe with heaven, in humble hope that he will uphold and protect it. Now to have provided a ſuitable body of militia to withſtand the hoſt that encampeth againſt us, is one of thoſe methods which we ought to take for our ſecurity: And that this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary body may be ſuch as to give a people reaſonable proſpect of victory, it ſhould be circumſtanced in the following manner: <hi>It ſhould conſiſt of a reſpectable number of able-bodied, effective men</hi>: Though one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chaſes a thouſand, and two puts ten thouſand to flight, yet this muſt be

owing to the miraculous interpoſition of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and what happens beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary courſe of things:—For a large and very numerous army I would not be underſtood to plead; becauſe ſuch an one commonly rather diſſerves than helps the cauſe; rather gives occaſion to fear a defeat, than hope for victory: All paſt experience confirms the truth of this: It is the unvaried language both of ſacred and profane hiſtory, that overgrown armies have commonly been routed, thrown into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and cut to pieces, by thoſe of a more moderate ſize, who were therefore more eaſily governed and leſs unweildy. <hi>Abijah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> with an army of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men entered the field with <hi>Jereboam</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with twice that number, and yet the former was victorious, ſlaying five hundred thouſand of the latter in one btttle <note n="(f)" place="bottom">2d Chron. xiii.3, 17.</note>. <hi>Aſa</hi> King of Judah, having an army of five hundred and eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, entirely routed an army of a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, brought againſt him by <hi>Zerah</hi> King of <hi>Cuſh</hi> 
               <note n="(g)" place="bottom">2d Chron. xiv.9.13.</note>. So the immenſe army of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> conſiſting of between two and three millions was entirely defeated by forty thouſand <hi>Greeks.</hi> But though theſe inſtances prove that no advantage is to be expected from an over numerous hoſt; yet at the preſent day when it is not uſual to carry ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013789_0011_0F91AEDBB7135998"/>
troops into the field, it is beſt to equal, or at leaſt not to fall much ſhort of thoſe againſt whom we appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is of ſtill greater importance towards inſuring ſucceſs, that the troops ſhould be valiant and courageous, able of body, and capable of enduring the fatigues of a campaign. And notwithſtanding the advantage a <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army</hi> may, on ſome account, have over a <hi>militia,</hi> yet theſe <hi>latter</hi> may, with more ſecurity be depended on than the <hi>former</hi>; becauſe being compoſed of men who have had their ſinews ſtrung, their limbs invigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and bodies hardened by daily labor, they will commonly exceed the former in ſtrength and courage; and fighting for their eſtates, families and religion, will have every poſſible inducement to exert the moſt ſtrenuous efforts in their defence.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>this militia ſhould be well equipt with martial weapons, with proper arms, and ſufficient ammunition.</hi>—Deſtitute of theſe, no reſiſtance can be made, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement performed againſt the advancing foe. <hi>Theſe</hi> are as neceſſary to the proper ſoldier to enable him to withſtand a well furniſhed hoſt, as the panoply of God is to the ſpiritual ſoldier, who without it cannot expect <hi>to ſtand againſt the wiles of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or quench his fiery darts. David</hi> could not have uttered himſelf as he does in the

text, unleſs he knew that <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>ſubjects</hi> were well provided with weapons of war: For what probability of ſucceſs can there poſſibly be in an engagement, if to all the modern inſtruments of death, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to oppoſe but our naked bodies, or uſeleſs arms, as incapable of annoying as they. Conſcious of the diſadvantage ariſing from the want of military weapons, the <hi>Philiſtines took away all the ſmiths, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the land of Iſrael,</hi> leſt the <hi>Hebrews ſhould make themſelves ſwords or ſpears,</hi> and thus be in a poſture of defence; and at another time, <hi>when there was not a ſword, or ſpear to be found among forty thouſand in Iſrael,</hi> they fell an eaſy prey into the hands of their enemies. Further, <hi>they ſhould be poſſeſſed of military ſkill</hi>;—knowledge in the art of war among civilized nations has been much cultivated, and by ſome of them carried to perfection: To go therefore into the field, in order to face a veteran, well diſciplined ſoldiery, rude and ignorant of this ſcience, is the direct way to ſacrifice our lives and betray the cauſe in which we are engaged. More has often times been done by military ſkill, than by the advantage of ſuperior numbers and proweſs. In battle with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous forces, this is an accompliſhment not ſo eſſential. But with thoſe by whom war is ſtudied as a ſcience, and held as a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013789_0013_0F91AEDD7274A040"/>
it is in vain to engage, unleſs we alſo are well verſed in the modern manoeuvres of the ſame. They that are but ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acquainted with hiſtory, know that the moſt glorious exploits have been atchieved by means of martial diſcipline. By this, in a great meaſure, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers made their arms triumphant over the barbarous nations of the globe. This, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, extended the Roman Empire to the moſt diffuſive limits, enabled her to give law to millions, and made her the miſtreſs of the world. This acquired to <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> the falſe glory of having ſlain more than twelve hundred thouſand men in his wars: For had he been deſtitute of this ſkill, he could not have made ſuch mighty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock; the ſtrength and courage, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and valour of his troops frequently meeting an equal match from the nations with whom they contended. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the uſe of the gun, the ſword and the bayonet; to know how to draw up an army in the moſt advantageous form for battle, to be expert in the different evolutions, ſo as to be able to rally a broken ſquadron; to place a battallion in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous poſt, to detach a party to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of thoſe that may have been outdone, and to reinforce ſuch as are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly too weak to ſtand the ſhock that is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013789_0014_0F91AEDDEDF4D4E0"/>
brought againſt them; to know how to perform theſe ſeveral manoeuvres readily, without miſtake or blunder, will give to an army a very great advantage in a field en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and without this knowledge our confidence in them can be but ſmall. Laſtly, <hi>they ſhould be accuſtomed to military ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</hi> To have able Generals, prudent and experienced commanders, and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity to obey them, is the beauty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the life and ſafety of an army. Of this obedience and ſubordination the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops are an excellent example. It is ſurpriſing to obſerve to what a pitch they have carried their ideas of order, through the influence of ſevere diſcipline, and long continued cuſtom. The common ſoldiers are all obedience to thoſe in command. And amongſt the officers themſelves there is a juſt gradation, each inferior one ſtrictly obſerving the orders of thoſe above him. Every one is fixed in his poſt, and yields ſubmiſſion to thoſe that are in places of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior command. Hence the ſupreme offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer regulates the whole. He, like the ſoul in the natural body, puts in motion every member; and all the different parts, which otherwiſe would claſh and interfere, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ultimately on his influence, are made one harmonious body, all tending in their reſpective places to one grand point, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013789_0015_0F91AEDEC4046D58"/>
confuſion. Whereas, if there were many maſters in an army, all poſſeſſed of co-ordinate power, this would obſtruct each ſalutary plan, and breed deſtruction to the whole. From a conſideration hereof, it has ever been eſteemed an important point to maintain this ſubordination; and for the maintenance of it no diſcipline has been thought too ſevere. Of ſuch moment did the ancient warlike <hi>Romans</hi> view it, that we have inſtances of perſons being puniſhed with death for fighting contrary to order, even though ſucceſs attended their arms. This indeed was a puniſhment diſproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to the offence: However, all muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that without the preſervation of <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> and <hi>order</hi> in an army no ſucceſs is to be expected againſt thoſe who religiouſly uphold it. I come now to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That the righteouſneſs of a people's character is another thing neceſſary in order to their being confident of ſucceſs in war. It is evident that under the righteous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Jehovah, thoſe who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in defence of a juſt cauſe, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been defeated. People have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived both of civil and religious liberty by the prevailing efforts of an oppreſſive enemy; and this has been permitted to take place by God as a puniſhment for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, ingratitude and unfruitfulneſs.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013789_0016_0F91AEDF74502A88"/>
As he ſometimes <hi>turns a fruitful land into barreneſs for the wickedneſs of thoſe that dwell therein</hi>; ſo at others, he raiſes up enemies to come and <hi>ſpy out a nation's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and ſtrip them of it, becauſe they have abuſed it to purpoſes of licentiouſneſs, or are otherways wholly unworthy of the ſame. For the abuſe of the written and preached word of God, people have had their <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers removed into corners, and a famine of hearing the word has enſued.</hi> Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Jews neglected and deſpiſed the goſpel, our Saviour threatens, <hi>that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſhould be taken from them, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> Juſt ſo it is with regard to any other important bleſſing: If people are not ſenſible of its worth; if they deſpiſe and undervalue, pervert and abuſe it; are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the donor of it, and their whole conduct diſcovers that they are unworthy the poſſeſſion thereof; then it pleaſes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to take it from them that they may ſee its worth in its abſence, and may be brought to humble themſelves before God for their impieties and numerous provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Accordingly, becauſe the Jews had communion with the neighbouring nations with whom they partook in their idolatries, he permitted them from time to time to be conquered and made tributary to them, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013789_0017_0F91AEE025903600"/>
to continue in this diſtreſſed condition, till they were brought to a ſenſe of their ſins, and repenting of them, called upon him for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; wherupon he raiſed them up ſaviors, and reſtored them to their wonted privileges. Now in conſideration of theſe things, a people can have no well grounded confidence of ſucceſs in war, notwithſtanding the juſtice of their cauſe, and a reſpectable body of troops to defend it, unleſs their own cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter be righteous and good; eſpecially if they have abuſed great favors, and not lived according to their advantages, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in any meaſure, the righteous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of heaven concerning them. This righteous character is neceſſary, not only for the people in general, but eſpecially for thoſe on whom they depend to protect them. If they who are immediately engaged in the war, are perſons of vicious behaviour, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, profane, unjuſt, intemperate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, we cannot with confidence rely on their efforts, neither can they face an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with calmneſs and intrepidity. This character like the accurſed thing in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Iſrael, will trouble the camp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to withdraw his aſſiſtance, and bring <hi>wrath</hi> upon the whole people. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great is like to be effected by a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſoldiery. Guilt is always timerous; vice enervates the mind, unſtrings the body, and unſits for dangerous enterpriſes. True

magnanimity dwells not in the breaſts of impenitent ſinners; but conſcious innocence makes men fearleſs and undaunted. The wiſe man obſerved long ago, <hi>that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fleeth when no man purſueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="bottom">

            <p>They who have, through Chriſt, obtained an intereſt in the divine favour, and made God their friend; they who have inliſted under <hi>Jeſus, the Captain of their ſalvation, and have fought the good fight of faith,</hi> may be fearleſs even amidſt the moſt ſhocking ſcenes of blood and carnage. <hi>If thouſands fall around them, and ten thouſands at their right hands,</hi> they may remain unmoved, and meet death with calmneſs in its moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forms. Whereas, on the other had, an abſolute certainty of victory is by no means ſufficient to make a wicked man intrepid in fight; for though the battle may be won, yet his life is in danger of being loſt; the conſideration of which, muſt needs excite prevailing fears, and conſequently unſit him, in a degree, for real ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If people entering into war would have well grounded hopes of ſucceſs, they muſt not truſt in an arm of fleſh, in their numbers, or in their ſkill or courage; but in the Lord, committing their cauſe to him,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013789_0019_0F91AEE2EE8A7590"/>
and depending on his power and wiſdom for proſperity This has been the practice of the pious in all paſt ages. In the 44th Pſalm we find the church thus expreſſing herſelf: <hi>Through thee will we puſh down our enemies; through thy name will we tread them under that riſe up againſt us: For I will not truſt in my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me, but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance.</hi> When a people have made proviſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel force by force, and are perſuaded of the goodneſs of their cauſe and character, then they are properly prepared to confide in the <hi>Lord of hoſts and God of armies,</hi> and to look to him for his bleſſing in ſo hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an undertaking, the event of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on his Providence. A people ſhould acknowledge God in all their ways, but eſpecially it is their intereſt and duty thus to do, when their <hi>all</hi> lays at ſtake; when life, liberty and property are depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They who neglect to do this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in their own numbers, prudence and valour, are guilty of a grand omiſſion that may prove fatal to their cauſe. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſuch conduct is, either that God's Providence is not concerned in the events of war, or that they ſtand in no need of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition and aſſiſtance; whereas common obſervation teaches us that he is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013789_0020_0F91AEE325A2FE98"/>
concerned in deciding the fate of battles. Things do not always, nay, not frequently turn out according to natural probabilites. How often have armies been defeated in a very wonderful manner, contrary to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man appearances or expectations. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, but time and chance happens to them all. Should one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight,</hi> this would be moſt manifeſtly owing to the ſpecial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Divine Being on the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or againſt the ſtronger ſide. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in victories obtained in a more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way, the agency of heaven is concerned, and his ſuperintendency to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for he is the author of all the warlike accompliſhments that ſoldiers poſſeſs: They have nothing but what they received from him, and to him are they indebted for their valour and military ſkill. Hence David ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that <hi>God taught his hands to war and his fingers to fight.</hi> Now the way to ſecure the divine aſſiſtance and protection in battle, is to truſt in him. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord, ſhall be like mount Zion, which cannot be moved. There is no King ſaved by the multitude of an hoſt; a mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength. An horſe is a vain thing for ſafety, neither ſhall he deliver any by his great ſtrength. But
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013789_0021_0F91AEE44EC6B318"/>
whoſo truſteth in the Lord ſhall be ſafe.</hi> It was this favour and protection of God, which he had ſecured by truſting in him, that made David ſo confident of ſucceſs in war: <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear, the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> In this way did King <hi>Aſa</hi> and King <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſignal victories over hoſts much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in number to theirs: In thier diſtreſs they cried unto the Lord, and he did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. The words of <hi>Aſa</hi> are theſe, <hi>Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many, or with them that have no power; help us, O Lord, for we reſt on thee, and in thy name go againſt this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God, let not man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt thee.</hi> And <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to heaven in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Behold how they reward us, to come to caſt us out of thy poſſeſſion, which thou haſt given us to inherit. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this great company that cometh againſt us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are up unto thee.</hi> In conſequence of their thus looking to God, and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on him for aſſiſtance, they both came off victorious; for none that <hi>truſt in the Lord ſhall be aſhamed, but curſed is man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm.</hi>

It is ſincerely to be wiſhed, that at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, when ambition and avarice are ſo frequently the only motives for fighting, this matter were properly conſidered by all. Then, methinks, we ſhould not have our ears ſo often ſaluted by the unwelcome ſounds occaſioned by the claſhing of ſwords, the report of cannon, and other inſtruments of death.

nations notice our circumſtances, and doubtleſs covet them. In years paſt the power of Great-Britain has protected us from the invaſions of foreign ſtates.— But, alas! the time is already come, when it is not ſafe wholly to depend on her: For ſhe who was the nurſe of our infancy, the guardian of our youth, and he boaſt of our riper years, has now become the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of our liberties.

And, from this perſuaſion, are now vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly making hoſtile preparations to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the deſigns of thoſe who may attempt to enforce the late unconſtitutional acts of the Britiſh parliament. But, ſhould we be called to battle, what proſpect have we of ſucceſs? Are the conditions to be found with us, that were mentioned in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, as neceſſary to give confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of victory? It is to be feared they are not. What ſhall then be ſaid unto you? Shall you be exhorted to ſubmit to the late pretentions of parliament, acknowledge its authority to legiſlate for you, and be tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient to its oppreſſive edicts? God forbid! You are rather to be exhorted, by repentance and reformation, to make
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013789_0027_0F91AEEAAC6DFE30"/>
your character as good as your cauſe, and piouſly truſting the event with God, recur to the <hi>ultima ratio,</hi> the ſword. Though not prepared, perhaps, at preſent <hi>to meet the enemy in the gate,</hi> yet we ſhall be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable if this be long the caſe with us. If in conteſt we fail of ſucceſs, it will be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the viciouſneſs of our charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or our deficiency in military ſkill.</p>
               <p>Theſe impediments may be removed, and that I may be inſtrumental thereof, I would now moſt earneſtly recommend it to this whole people, ſeriouſly to conſider, that the difficulties under which we labour, and of which we loudly complain, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to fall upon us for our ſins. <hi>Our own wickedneſs has corrected us, and backſlidings reproved us that we might know and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that we have forſaken the Lord our God.</hi> In vain do we ſend the moſt powerful and ſkilful troops againſt our enemies, whilſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main impenitent and diſobedient; whilſt intemperance and debauchery, pride and oppreſſion, luxury and extravagance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and profaneneſs abound among us; for theſe will inevitably turn the edge of their ſwords, and procure them a defeat, becauſe we cannot rationally hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of our liberties, unleſs we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and prepared to make a good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013789_0028_0F91AEEB64ACB7B8"/>
of them. Suffer me therefore by every thing that is excellent and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on the one hand; by the ſweets of peace and ſecurity, by the bleſſings of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, good government and order, and by the joy of future ſalvation; alſo, on the other, by every thing that is dreadful; by the horrors of war; by the flowing blood of your fellow-countrymen; by the miſeries of ſlavery and oppreſſion, and by the ſtill greater infelicities of future damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By theſe hopes and fears, ſuffer me, with all the plainneſs of a friend, to conjure you, to <hi>break off your ſins by right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and your iniquities by turning to the Lord.</hi> Mourn your abuſe of privileges, neglect of opportunities and breach of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; lament all thoſe impieties and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions which have been ſo provoking to the Lord, and have cauſed him to bring us into our preſent truly diſtreſſed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Reform alſo all your extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and mortify your pride; renounce fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſuperfluities, and live contentedly, <hi>in compliance with the recommendation of the Continental Congreſs,</hi> on the produce of your own bleating flocks and fertile fields. Such conduct as this, both in a religious and political view, will greatly ſubſerve the intereſt of our cauſe, and tend to deliver us from one of the moſt terrible of all worldly

evils, a civil war. But ſhould it fail of this deſired end, yet being thus reformed, we may then with greater confidence make the laſt appeal. Well diſciplined troops fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſuch a penitent people, and in ſo good a cauſe as ours, may be almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of victory. But have we a proſpect of ſuch? Is it likely, from preſent appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that <hi>this</hi> and the neighbouring colonies will be able to furniſh out an army ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently qualified to look regular troops in the face? I anſwer; in our numbers, we ſhall be in no degree deficient, and the courage of American forces was never juſtly diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they have given as exemplary proofs of it as any people under the ſun. The air we breathe, and the climate we live in, tend to make us hardy and bold, perſevering and patient. No difficulties can diſcourage, no dangers terrify the valorous ſons of New-England, tempered in theſe northern climes, and braced by theſe frigid north-weſterly blaſts. But what ſhall we think of their ſkill? It is readily confeſſed, that this in years paſt, has not, in general, been great. But at preſent, a ſpirit of emulation, and an ardent deſire to excel herein, is excited in the midſt of us. Our preſent proſpects of danger have put us upon this important ſtudy, which in times of ſuppoſed ſafety we unwiſely neglected. In our different towns
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013789_0030_0F91AEEDA37197D8"/>
and colonies, what time is ſpent, what coſt beſtowed, and pains taken in the acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this neceſſary ſcience? Military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies formed, officers choſen, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations haſtily making for an approaching enemy! From ſpecimens already given, we have the moſt animating aſſurances, that in the revolution of a few months, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, we ſhall have a moſt reſpectable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia; qualified to do eminent ſervice for their diſtreſſed and inſulted country. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced are we to find that the ſame love of freedom, and thirſt of martial ſkill, which ſo generally prevail through the provinces, have manifeſted themſelves in this place, and been exhibited in a manner that does us honor; for while, on the one hand, we have run into no exceſſes, been concerned in no diſorders, nor offered any abuſe to thoſe, who in ſome things think differently from us; on the other, being prompted by this noble ſpirit, we have been quietly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thoſe ſteps that have been calculated to procure a redreſs of grievances, and in particular made conſiderable advances in the knowledge of the art military.</p>
               <p>This naturally leads me to addreſs myſelf to you, gentlemen of the militia, by whom the ſcience of arms has been cultivated, and at whoſe deſire we are now in the houſe of God. You are not the firſt inſtance of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

To this end you will labour to make greater proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in military knowledge. Your preſent improvements are obſerved with pleaſure, and are an earneſt of ſomething ſtill more conſiderable. Go on then, in purſuit of higher meaſures; <hi>reſt not contented with any attainments to which you have already arrived; but leaving the things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, go on unto perfection.</hi> Much, you have been told, depends upon this, and without conſiderable underſtanding herein, defeat, if not deſtruction, will be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
