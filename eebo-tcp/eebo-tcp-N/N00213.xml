            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>GOd in his Providence doth many times so order, as that <hi>the last words</hi> of his eminent Servants shall be of most weighty consideration. The Scripture sets a special Emphasis and Remark upon the last words of David, 2 Sam. 23. 1. <hi>now these are the last words of David-the sweet singer of Israel,</hi> not that he never spake any words after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The same is to be said concerning the words now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; They are amongst <hi>the last,</hi> yea, the dying speeches of that holy man of God; who perceiving that the time of his departure was at hand, laveth'a most solemn charge upon his son Solomon, that he should endeavour to approve himself a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

of his Fathers God. Several Arguments are made use of to back this charge; one is in these words, taken from the benefit which would attend a sincere seeking the Lord. <hi>If thou seek him, be will be found of thee;</hi> that is to say, thou shalt then be made happy in the enjoyment of God for ever. If others seek God in sincerity of heart, they shall find him, but (saith David ) it is eminently true concerning thee, because the Lord hath been thy Fathers God. Thou art a child of a Father that had a special inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in God, and therefore if thou set thy self to seek him, know for thy encouragement, that he will be most ready, to shew himself favourable to thee, wherefore the Doctrine which may at present be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on from the words, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Children of godly Parents are under peculiar advantages and encouragements to seek the Lord.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctr.</hi>
                     </note> For the clearing of this Doctrine, two things may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, 1. To enquire what is implyed in this seeking the Lord which the Text speaketh of? 2. How it doth appear that the Children of godly Parents are under peculiar advantages and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement so to do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu. 1. What is implyed in this seeking the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. 1. It doth imply that men by nature are such as have lost God.</hi> The sinner hath lost himself, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>this thy brother was lost, and is found,</hi> yea, and he hath lost God too. He is wandred from his Fathers house. Hence the Apostle said to the Ephesians, <hi>they were without God in the World.</hi> Yea, it is true concerning. Children of godly Parents as well as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>we</hi> (saith the holy Apostle) <hi>were by nature the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath even as others.</hi> We that are Jews and descended of holy Ancestors, we that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and made Apostles of Christ, by nature were Subjects of the wrath and righteous displeasure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

God. Not but that some of the Children of godly men, have grace wrought in them whilest in a state of Infancy, as John Baptist was filled with the holy Ghost from his mothers womb, but they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive that grace from their Parents, and therefore it is not natural but supernatural, when any of the Children of sinful men are made gracious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Seeking the Lord doth imply a sense of this lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> Sense of want puts men upon seeking. The Prodigal was hunger-bitten before he would seek to be reconciled to his Father, when he saw that he was feign to live upon husks, and that there was no way but he must perish with hunger, except he sought unto his Father for a supply, he would do so. If a man hath lost a thing, except he know that he hath lost it, he will not seek after it. Hence in the Parable concerning the lost piece of silver, it is said, <hi>what woman if she lose a piece of silver, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it,</hi> Luk. 15. 8. So that there must be sense of loss before there will be seeking or finding. Nor will men seek the Lord, except they be by his Spirit made sensible, that they have lost his favour, and are through sin and the fall become miserable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This seeking doth imply earnest desire to find God.</hi> That which a man seeketh after he would be glad to find. When Job sought after Communion with God, he maketh enquiry, <hi>where shall I find him,</hi> Job. 23. 3. No one will seek after that which is not an Object of his desires, Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I desired, that will I seek after.</hi> If thou seek him, that is to say, if thou earnestly desire to find the Lord, then so it shall be. If God be the chief Object of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, if the desire of thy Soul be towards the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Name, then he will be found of thee. As it was with David himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1. <hi>O God thou

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> &amp; for ever.</hi> To the same purpose is that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 25. what more plain can be spoken, to shew that God doth many times cast elect Children upon elect Parents in a continued Succession from generation to generation? See also Isai. 65. 22, 23, <hi>Mine Elect and their off-spring with them are the blessed of the Lord.</hi> So that when Parents are Elect, usually their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eren are so too. Hence it was said to Zacheus, <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is come to thy house,</hi> Luk. 19. 9. Not only to his Soul. but to his house. Vsually if God intends to save a man, there are some of his house, <hi>i. e.</hi> posterity, that are heirs of salvation also. And therefore the Apostle said to the Jaylor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thy house, Acts</hi> 16. 31. How did Paul know that if the Jaylor believed his Children should be saved? was it from any special Revelation concerning those Children more then with respect unto others? no; but he knew, that when God brought the Father into a state of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000274_0014_0FA458464D3C2730"/>
he was wont to save however some of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and posterity. Hence also Paul said to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, <hi>when I call to remembrance the unfeigned Faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grand-mother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am perswaded in thee also,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 5. He doth probably and hopefully conclude, that Timothy did belong to God, because he was the Son of a godly mother and Grand-mother. Moreover, experience and observation doth confirm this truth, that <hi>de facto</hi> it hath been so. For the Elect are not found in all places alike, but in some Nations more then in others, and that for many Generations suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively. And in some Families more then in others. There are some Families in the World, that God hath designed to shew peculiar mercy to them, from generation to generation. And if an account should be taken concerning all the godly men that are now alive in the world, doubtless it would be found, that, the greatest part of them are sprung from godly Parents. Though there may be many converted ones in the world, whose Parents did not fear God, yet for the generality of true believers they are, such as have descended from believing Parents,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord hath established his Covenant not only with Parents, but with Children also.</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will establish my covenant between me &amp; thee, and thy seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to thee &amp; to thy seed after thee,</hi> The Saints in all ages are concerned in Abrahams covenant, under which children are comprehended. To say that the Covenant was extended to Children under the Old Testament, but not under the New, is to lessen the grace of God in these dayes of the Gospel. Yea then the Jews would haye been great loosers by, believing on Christ. If they could have said, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times our Children were interested in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

Covenant of God, but if we imbrace the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they shall have no part in the Lord, this would have been such an objection against beleiving as could never have been answered. Wherefore, we shall find that those Scriptures which relate to Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel times, expresly declare, That not only Believers themselves, but their children also, are subjects of the Lords gracious covenant with his people. Isai. 61. 8. 9. <hi>I will make an everlasting covenant with them and their Seed shall be known among the Gentiles, &amp; their off-spring among the people, all that see them shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 23. <hi>They are the Seed of the Blessed of the Lord, and their off spring with them.</hi> Now this consideration is a great encouragement to seek the Lord. So it was to them, Jer. 3. 22. <hi>We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> We are thy Covenant people, and that doth encourage us to come unto thee. And this did encourage David to seek and hope for the Lords salvation. Psal. 86. 16. <hi>Save the son of thine handmaid.</hi> And the Apostle did encourage the Jews to repent and return unto the Lord, from this argument, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> in that they were <hi>the children of the covenant.</hi> Act. 3. 19, 25. From thence it is evident, that the children of godly Parents stand in a peculiar relation unto God, &amp; that therefore he will not cast them off, except there be great cause for it.

And therefore we have a promise of converting grace to be bestowed on such children. Deut. 30. 6. <hi>The Lord the God will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed.</hi> There is a promise for grace as well as to grace, as to those that belong to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Circumcision of heart implyeth Regeneration, which is promised to the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with respect unto their children. And that was one reason why the Lord did of old appoint Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision to be applyed to the children of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that so this promise of converting grace in due time to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> might be sealed. The same thing is promised, Isai. 44. 3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my blessing upon thine off spring.</hi> And the Lord hath made a blessed promise of salvation to such children, Isai. 49. 25. <hi>I will save thy children.</hi> Hence it is promised that <hi>the seed of the Lords Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

greatest gift that ever was bestowed on the world; now this the children of godly Parents are wont to enjoy; Timothy being descended from a godly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and grand-mother, even from a child knew the Scriptures, 2. Tim. 3. 15. To enjoy the word and Ordinances of God publickly dispensed is a great mercy; it is therefore mentioned as such a blessing as is enough to make amends for many sorrows and afflictions, <hi>Thine eyes shall behold thy Teachers,</hi> Isai. 30. 20. This is wont to be the portion of godly mens Children. And to have the benefit of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, admonitions, exhortations is a great mercy; Solomon confesseth that his Father and his mother taught him good doctrine: Prov. 4. 2. It was good because for his everlasting benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Nor are the children of godly men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this benefit, Psal. 34. 11. <hi>Come you Children heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto me, and I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> It is a great mercy to be taught and principled in the fear of God, and that betimes; to be told of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of sin, the infinite danger of dying in a natural unconverted estate, the necessity of obtaining an interest in Christ, and to be directed in the right way to Salvation. Also to be the subjects of much prayer is great mercy; it is mentioned concerning Solomon as a special favour God would vouchsafe to him, Psal. 72. 15. <hi>Prayer shall be made for him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> Thus concerning the children of the Lords people, the publick prayers of the Church reach them, and their godly parents are daily praying for them; so that prayer is made for them continually. Moreover, such children experience outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and preservations for their parents sake.

Answ. This is sadly true sometimes; the most high to shew the Soveraignty of his grace, sometimes chuseth some of the Children of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parent, and refuseth some of a godly Parent; Also to shew that it is not in the power of men to give grace, no not in the power of godly men, so much as to their own Children; sometimes such Children prove very unlike unto their godly Parents. It was therefore said to Samuel, <hi>thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Father <hi>Josiah?</hi> It is noted concerning Josiah, that when the word of God was read to him, he rent his Clothes, humbled himself, and was afraid of the

Lords holy displeasure; but <hi>Jehojakim after three or four leaves were read, he took his pen knife, and cut the Roll in pieces, and burnt it in the fire, he was not afraid, nor rent his garments.</hi> Jer. 36. 23, 24. Yet this is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be added and considered, that when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of good men are unlike their Parents in grace and holiness, it proceeds not from any unfaithfulness in the blessed God as to his Covenant with such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or with their Children, for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vsually it is some evill in such parents (though otherwise godly) which the Lord doth punish in their Children, Either they are not so diligent in teaching and instructing them as they ought to be; If we must judge all those parents ungodly whose children are miserably instructed, I am certain that many amongst us, who have a name to live, and would be thought to have the root of the matter in them, will be found amongst the ungodly. Or Parents are sinfully indulgent towards their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; so was Eli; indeed he instructed them, told them of the evil of those wayes they walked in, and exhorted them to reform, but he corrected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained them not; Isaac was too indulgent towards his profane Esau; so was David towards Absolom, that afterwards proved a Rebel, rising up in arms against his own Father; and he did sinfully indulge Adonijah; the Scripture taketh notice of it, that <hi>his Father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so?</hi> 1 King. 1. 6. No wonder he came to such an unhappy end, for usually such children are first or last a shame to the Father that begat them, and bitterness to the mother that bare them. Or it may be parents doe not pray and believe for their Children as they ought to doe: God in this case sometimes saith unto parents, according to your faith be it done unto you. If you pray much, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000274_0025_0FA45856B55605B0"/>
believe much for your children, you shall obtain much mercy from the Lord for them. Psal. 33. last.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Many times the children of godly men are like their parents. In some godly Familyes all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the family are made partakers of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saving grace. So in Jacobs Family; there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe that his twelve sons did repent before they died, and that they are now in heaven, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they were Types of the Elect of God, and their names were written upon the breast of the high priest, when he entred into the Holy of Holyes. So concerning Jobs children; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, that after the death of his children and the loss of his estate, the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before, yet he had but ten chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after that, which was the number he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wherefore Interpreters probably conclude that his other children were not lost; they might all goe to heaven notwithstanding the sad and sudden death which befel them. And experience confirmeth the truth of this, we see that in some families God is pleased to bestow converting grace upon all the children therein; especially if their parents be very much in prayer to God for them. I remember I once heard an holy praying man say, my father had six children, and they are all either with Christ, or in Christ; and he hath given me six children, three of them are already with Christ, and the other (I bless his name) are in Christ. And I have read <note n="[c]" place="margin">

                  <p n="3">3. God is wont to remember and establish his covenant with some of the children of his Servants
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000274_0026_0FA4585785E59CF0"/>
however; if not to all, yet with some of them. It is commonly seen that as for wicked Parents though they have many Children they are all ungodly like their Parents; but it is seldome known that if a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath many Children that they all prove wicked; first or last God converts some of them. If there be an Ishmael in Abrahams Family, there is also an Isaac; if there be an Esau in Isaac's Family, there is also a Jacob; if there be an Absolom in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Family, there is also a Solomon; nor ought we to doubt, but that Nathan and many more of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Children are now in Heaven, albeit three of them perished.</p>

We may say of New-Englands Children (many of them) as the Apostle speaketh concerning the Jews, however the case may be with them at the present, <hi>they are beloved for their Fathers sake,</hi> Rom. 11. 28.</p>

                        <hi>Use</hi> 3.</note> (as well as for their own) sake. There are especially three things that Parents should be careful about for their Childrens sake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they be in a state of grace themselves; that they have a special and saving Interest in God. As David said to his son Solomon, 1 Chron. 28. 20. <hi>The Lord God, even my God will be with thee;</hi> So if you can, upon good grounds say, <hi>the Lord is my God,</hi> you may the better hope that he will be with your Children. If you be indeed righteous in the sight of God, it will be your poor Childrens advantage; Psal. 37. 25. <hi>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his Seed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging bread.</hi> But if you be unconverted, and Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, what a case are your Children in? That if they be in any distress, they have a Father that cannot pray for them, or if he do, his prayers find no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, because they proceed from one that hath not an interest in Heaven; Remember that Scripture, Deut. 5. 29. <hi>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments alwayes, that it might be well with them, &amp; with their Children for ever;</hi> plainly intimating that if Parents truly fear God, their children shall fare the better for it; Yea, let me tell you, that then if any of them dye in their Infancyes, <note n="[e]" place="margin">
                        <hi>See Mr Whiston's primitive practice of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
                     </note> you need not doubt of their Salvation, Deut. 30. 19. <hi>Thou and thy Seed shall live.</hi> God having taken your Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant of life, if they never break that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, shall they not live for ever? yea, they shall live for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:000274_0028_0FA45858F6743368"/>2. Parents should be careful what opinions they embrace. For oftentimes the poison of a corrupt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in the Father proveth baneful to the Child; As Naamans Leprosy went down from Generation to Generation, so the plague of spiritual Leprosy in the Head, is sometimes propagated from the Father to the Son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Parents should be careful of their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; because their Children are apt to follow their Example, especially in that which is evil. As it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Ahaziah, that he walked in the way of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of his Mother, 1 King. 22. 52. And of those superstitious persons, 2 King. 17, 41. <hi>They served their graven Images, both their Children, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children; as did their Fathers, so do they, to this day.</hi> If the Father follow superstitious or prophane practices, it is most likely that the Children will do so too; Therefore you that are Parents, in the sear of God look to it, that you do not scandalize your Children by an evil Example; If your Children see you in drink sometimes, will not they be drunkards too? If they hear you swear, will not they swear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? if they see you careless in the observation of the Sabbath, will not they likewise be guilty of Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking? And if they see you live in the neglect of holy duties, no prayer in the Family, how shall they be seekers of God? It will be a wonder if such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do not prove Athiests, that are brought up in Familyes, where they never see any prayer, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of God. O think with your selves, if you that are Parents should any of you perish, and your miserable Children follow you to bell, how will they curse you there? If thy Children perish through thy evil Example, they will follow thee up and down in the ever burning Lake, crying out, <note n="[f]" place="margin">

that had no grace to teach us the wayes of God, and lead us in the paths of godliness; If you that were our Parents, had discharged your duty towards us, we might have been in the Joyes of Heaven, but now our damned Souls must live for ever in these everlasting flames; Thus wilt thou hear thine own Children yelling in thine Ears, world without end; Canst thou think of this, and thy heart not break? then thy heart is an Adamant, and thy heart strings made of Iron sinews.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Let godly parents that are here before the Lord this day, suffer the word of Exhortation, <hi>Doe you endeavour to the utmost of your power, that your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may become seekers and servants of the only true God in Jesus Christ.</hi> And indeed when you present them to the Lord in Baptism, you promise to doe your utmost, that they may become faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of that God who is Father, Son and Spirit; take heed that you doe not become guilty of violating that Ingagement. God hath committed Children unto you, that so you might bring them up for him, <hi>The Children which thou hast borne unto me,</hi> Ezek. 16. 20. If a man had the children of a Prince or great man committed to his care and charge for educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would he not be carefull about that matter? It is a solemn thing, which it may be you have not duly considered, that the great God hath entrusted you with those that are his children, that so you may nurse them up for him: O then bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It is not enough for Parents to serve the Lord them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but they must use utmost endeavours that after they are dead, their children may walk in the wayes of God. And if they be duly, carefull in that matter, they have reason to expect, that God
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000274_0030_0FA4585A6E1349C0"/>
will remember and establish his covenant with their Children. For it is noted concerning Abraham, that his care was that his Family <hi>after him</hi> (<abbr>viz.</abbr> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he should cease to be in the world) might <hi>keep the way of the Lord,</hi> and so did the Lord bring upon him the thing which he had spoken, and graciously promised with respect to Abrahams posterity. And in special you that are mothers have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage put into your hands, to be instilling <note n="[g]" place="margin">
                        <hi>See Mr. Firmins real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. p.</hi> 8</note> good principles into your childrens souls betimes; Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons mother taught him: we doe not read that Absaloms and Adonijahs mother taught them, as Bathsheba did her son Solomon. And it is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that when children have proved thus or so, particular notice is taken in Scripture, that such or such were their mothers: Rehoboam did not prove well, and it is noted that his mother was an Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitess. On the other hand, Hezekiah, Jehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar, Josiah were eminent Servants of God, and the Scripture doth mention who were their mothers. O then you that are mothers should endeavour that your Children (as <hi>Luther</hi> speaketh) may suck in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from their mothers breasts.</p>
                  <p>And let all godly parents <hi>earnestly seek unto the Lord for their poor children:</hi> You onght to doe so daily and particularly, and by name before the Lord and thus should you doe every day: as we read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Job, that he offered burnt offerings for his Children, <hi>according to the number of them all, thus did Job continually.</hi> Job. 1. 5. Remember that you are under peculiar encouragement so to doe: if the Children of godly parents have special encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to seek the Lord, then the same thing must needs be true concerning such parents themselves, with respect to their Children. And it is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true with respect to the children of <hi>New-England</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000274_0031_0FA4585D021D4A50"/>
inasmuch as they are the posterity of such as have been sufferers on the account of the name and truth of the Lord Jesus. Are not such parents pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced blessed twice over? Mat. 5. 11, 12. even bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in themselves, and in their posterity? Who knoweth but God may remember the kindness of the fathers in these Churches (who followed him into this wilderness whilst it was a land not sown) unto their children after them? Plead it with the Lord; if you that be godly parents lay up a stock of prayers for your children, it may stand them in more stead then if you should leave them never such an inheritance, as to the things of the world, when you are dead your prayers shall live. There is many a child whose father and mother is now in heaven, that fareth the better, and will doe so for ever, on the account of prayers made for him by his blessed parents while they were in this world. And this further let me say for your encouragement, that if the Lord stir up your hearts to be importunate with him, for your children, it is a sign that God intends mercy to them. That instance of <hi>Monica,</hi> Austins gracious mother is known and famous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when she made her complaint and wept to a faithfull Minister because her son did for the present follow ungodly courses and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; <note n="[b]" place="margin">

hope for him a long time, but if he hath a godly Father and Mother too, He never leave hoping for him until I see him turned off the Gallows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me direct my Exhortation to the Children of Godly parents: There are many such that hear me this day: <hi>Be you exhorted to know and serve and seek the God of your Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lord is your Fathers God.</hi> Know the God of thy Father, saith David. Prov. 27. 10. <hi>Forsake not thy Fathers friend.</hi> And wilt thou forsake thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God, who is the best friend that ever thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had? Children are loth to part with other things because they were their Fathers; As Naboth said concerning his vineyard, <hi>God forbid that I should part with the inheritance of my Father.</hi> 1 King. 21. 3. The Lord was the inheritance of thy Father, and wilt thou let goe thy interest in him? Remember and consider that Scripture, Exod. 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is my Fathers God, and I will exalt him.</hi> So say thou, the Lord is my Fathers God, and therefore I will fear &amp; seek and serve him.</p>
                  <p>Consider. 2. <hi>The good &amp; benefit that will follow upon a sincere seeking to the Lord.</hi> If there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be said, but only this, it should be a prevalling Motive, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> That then your parents will have joy in you; A wise son (<hi>i. e.</hi> a godly son) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a glad father. The Apostle John hath such an expression as this, <hi>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth.</hi> 3. Joh. 4. Nor is there any greater joy to a godly Father, then to see truth of grace in his children; this comforts him more than to see that his Children are become rich or great in the world. Know also for your encouragement, that if you seek unto the Lord with your whole heart, He will be found of you: Yea, though your sins and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations

have been never so great: was there ever a greater Sinner then Menasseh, the son of blessed Hezekiah, <hi>Yet when he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, he was entreated of him.</hi> 2. Chro 33. 12, 13. O think of it, you that, though the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of holy parents, have been hainous sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, seek him sincerely, and he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all your sins, and save your souls from eternal death.

How much more will the blessed God pardon you, and accept you into his favour, all your Rebellions notwithstanding, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you humbly and sincerely seek unto him? Yea and God will bless you when your Parents shall be taken from you; he will then be a father to you. Psal. 27. 10. <hi>When my Father and my mother forsake me, the Lord will take me up,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> as a tender hearted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh up his child into his arms, and beareth him in his bosome. It is therefore said concerning the just man, that <hi>his Children are blessed after him.</hi>

Prov. 20. 7. And Jacob told his Sons that though he died, God would be with them, Gen. 48. 21. It is also noted concerning Isaac, that <hi>God blessed him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his Father Abraham.</hi> Gen. 25. 11. Not but that the Lord blessed him before that, only after his Fathers death, the blessing of the Lord was upon him more then ever.</p>
                  <p>Consider, 3. <hi>The evil that is in your not seeking the Lord.</hi> What a grief of mind will this be to your godly Parents? The Father of a fool hath no joy. Alas! there is many a poor parent may say to their Children, as Jephtah upon another account spake to his daughter, Judg. 11. 35. <hi>He rent his cloathes, and said, alas my daughter, thou hast brought me very low, thou art one of them that trouble me.</hi> Why should you bring your Parents down with sorrow to their graves? How did it go to the heart of David, when Absolom dyed, and was cut off in his sins? 2 Sam. 18. 33. <hi>He was much moved, and as he went, thus he said, O my Son Absolom, my Son, my Son Absolom, would God I had dyed for thee, O Absolom, my Son, my Son.</hi> As if he had said, had I dyed, my Soul had been happy, but now thou art dead, I have no other hope but that thy Soul is suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. Remember that this will aggravate your sin, and condemnation, that you were born of godly Parents, and did not walk in their steps, Jer. 50. 7. <hi>They sinned against the hope of their Fathers;</hi> it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the great aggravation of their sin. Such Children roll reproach upon the Covenant of God; they cause men to say, there is nothing in being in Covenant with God, nor is it any mercy to be born of Parents that fear the Lord; 'And will not the Lord judge you for causing such a vile reproach to be cast upon his holy Covenant? you will be most inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable before the Lord another day; If a righteous

man beget a Son that becometh a Robber, or an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, shall he live? he shall not live, but dye, and his blood shall be upon him, Ezek. 18. 10, 13. The blood of thy Soul shall be upon thy own head; All the instructions, Exhortations, Admonitions, Prayers, Examples of thy godly Parents, will be brought in as so many witnesses for thy condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the last day; yea, the tears of thy blessed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will be as oyl to make the everlasting flames of hell burn the more vehemently upon thy Soul, throughout the dayes of Eternity; <hi>The Lord will cast thee off for ever;</hi> Thy Father that begat thee, thy Mother that bare thee, will not pitty thee when thou shalt be sentenced to eternal Death at the last day. Remember Dives; In hell he lift up his eyes being in Torments, and cryed, Father Abraham! have mercy on me; but all the mercy his Father Abraham would shew to him, was, he! said, <hi>Son, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in thy life time thou hadst thy good things;</hi> As if he had said, nay, thou art justly dealt with. So will thy Parents say to thee, Remember that in thy life time we instructed thee, and thou hadst good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel given to thee many a time, but thou wouldest not regard it. Oh consider of it! yea know, that if thou dyest in thy sins, thy godly Parents will stand forth, &amp; testifie against thee, before the Lord Jesus, at the last day; As that blessed man Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> would sometimes solemnly profess to his Children, <note n="[k]" place="margin">

of her Torment rose up for ever and ever, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped God, and said, <hi>Amen, Hallelujah;</hi> Even so, when the Son of God shall say to thee, depart thou cursed wretch into Everlasting Fire, thy Father will say, <hi>Amen, Lord Jesus!</hi> This is the Son, this is the daughter, that I so often instructed and warned, and told them if they did not repent of sin, and get an interest in Christ, they should certainly perish for ever, but they would not hear, therefore let thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice be glorified for ever in their eternal confusion. O what an heart hast thou, if this break it not? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,</p>
                  <p>Consider, 4. <hi>There are many Children of godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to be seen, that do not seek the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> Yea, how many such are there in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> that are not of their Fathers principles? If a Temptation should come it is to be feared, that the greatest part of this Generation would comply, and disown that cause which their Fathers suffered for. How many that are not of their Fathers Spirit; not heavenly minded, but pursuing worldly Interests with their whose hearts; Nor zealous for God, and his glory, but lukewarm, and wofully indifferent in the matters of Religion; Nor in practice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation like their Fathers; Not of an holy gift conversation, but loose and vain, &amp; vile and vitious; Swearers, Gamesters, given to rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Chambering and wantonness! Nay, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there before the Lord in this Congregation, that never sought the God of their Fathers, even to this day? Some that never prayed in their lives, or never in earnest; You Children, it may be you say a prayer, a few words that you have been used to, but are you in earnest? do you cry to God as for your lives? do you take the Kingdome of Heaven by violence? O but few such!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="unknown:000274_0037_0FA4592AB2D9F5A8"/>Consider, 5. <hi>You know not how soon your finding time may be past and gone,</hi> therefore now seek the Lord; up and be doing, lest thy Sun go down at Noon, and God make the day dark over thy Soul. Dost not thou know that the Lord useth to make quick work with the Children of his Servants, when they will not seek him, albeit they have been brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the solemn warnings of God? It may be he will give thee up to a reprobate sense, and his Spirit for ever cease striving with thee; then woe woe be to thee, saith the Lord. Remember how it was of old: when the Sons of God, (even the posterity of godly Seth) the posterity of eminent professors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did degenerate, <hi>God said his Spirit shall strive no longer with them,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. <hi>my Spirit shall not alwayes strive.</hi> Or death may come upon you; How many young men that have fallen down slain of late? The Sword is raging, and how are they that are of <hi>the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Generation numbred for the Sword?</hi> Deadly Arrows are flying over your heads, yea, death is climbing in at windows, and carrying away young men apace; now if death overtake thee before thy Soul be got into the City of refuge, it had been good for thee never to have been born; It will be too late to seek the Lord then; If thou shouldest then seek him early, thou canst not find him; When once the gates of death are shut upon thee, and thou locked fast under the bars of the pit; When once thy Soul is out of thy body, in a moment it shooteth the Gulf of Eternity, and then though thou shouldest seek and cry till Heaven and Earth shakes, and pray, and weep Seas of tears of blood, all will be in vain. O thy Sonl, thy Soul mustly weltring in a fiery Ocean, as long as the Eternal God shall have any Being! Can thy heart endure to think of this? No! O then seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</p>

Something let me speak by way of Direction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> briefly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Be thank full to the Lord in that he hath given you to be born of godly parents:</hi> in that you have been (as David speaketh) cast upon the Lord from the womb And he hath been your God from your mothers bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Psal. 22. 10. You might have been born of such Parents as would have nursed you up in ignorance, profaness or idolatry, and so your souls have been under a necessity of perishing for ever, but the Lord hath given you to be of parents that have designed you for God, and for his glory. Yea it was for your sakes especially that your Fathers ventured their lives upon the rude waves of the vast Ocean. Was it not with respect unto posterity, that our Fathers came into this wilderness? that they might train up a generation for Christ: Bless God that ever you had such Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Plead the Lords g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acious Covenant with him,</hi> he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willing that you should doe so: <hi>Ask me concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</hi> Isa. 45. 11. You say you cannot give grace to your own Souls. True! But hath not the Lord in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace said, <hi>I will give you a new heart.</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. Plead that Promise, you especially that have had the Covenant sealed to you; why should you let your Baptism lye by you, as if it were of no use? Go to God in secret, and say, Lord thou hast promised to give a new heart to the children of thy Servants, &amp; thy Covenant hath been sealed to me in my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; Oh give me a new heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Doe not rest in any thing that is external:</hi> Not in your relation to godly parents, &amp; visible relation to God on that account; it is not you parents seeking unto God will save you, except you seek him your selves also. Did not the Lord say to the children of Israel, <hi>Are ye not as the children of AEthiopians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</hi> Amos. 9. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:000274_0039_0FA4592E4939DCB8"/>They vainly trusted, that no destruction should ever come upon them, because they were descended from blessed Ancestors. You may be as far from eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Children of Ethiopians for all that, if you do not serve the God of your Fathers. Therefore John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist said, <hi>Think not to say, we have Abraham for our Father, Math.</hi> 3. 9. I have known some that have been so foolish as to think they should be saved, only because they were the Children of godly Parents, though they lived in the neglect of God, &amp; of their own Souls. Beware of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Truth delivered unto you. And rest not in being outwardly civil and blameless; was not Paul so before his Conversion, Phil. 3. 6. And they that have been advantaged with a religious Education, often times are so, though never truly converted. Beware also of taking up a form of godliness without the power of it. O you that are the Children of godly Parents, if you outwardly observe the Sabbath day, and pray in secret, and read the Scriptures, (all which things I charge you in the Name of the Lord, that you attend unto them whilst you live) you will be apt to rest here, without an interest in the glorious Righteousness of the Son of God, but for the love of your immortal Souls, I beseech you, deceive not your selves; build not upon a false foundation, look to it, in the fear of God, that your hearts be perfect before him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Never leave seeking God until you find him:</hi> Seek, and Seek, and Seek again, untill you know that you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a saving interest in Jesus Christ, and in the favor of God through him. O make thorough work of it in the matter of your Conversion; be not almost but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Christians; so shall you find that the blessing of all the Prayers, and Covenant of your gracious Parents will come upon you for evermore.</p>

of another Ruler amongst them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly David doth here direct his Exhortation, first to the Representatives of the People, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>And David assembled all the Prinoes of Israel, the Princes of the Tribes, and the Captains of the Companies unto themselves, &amp;c.</hi> Hence they are said to be all Israel, ver. 8. <hi>In the sight of all Israel,</hi> h. e. the Heads and Representatives of all Israel, and therefore are said to be <hi>the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> Often in the Scripture by <hi>the Congregation,</hi> the Heads and Rulers of the Congregation are meant.

                     </gap>rgeth this, is, because the Lord had promised the good Land to them; but it was upon that condition of their keeping his Commandments, therefore it did highly concern them, to be careful about that matter. <hi>2dly,</hi> he directs his Exhortation to him that was to be established as chief Ruler, soil. to his Son Solomon, whom God appointed to succeed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Government. Now sincerity was the main thing which David his Father did exhort him unto, in the beginning of this Verse. <hi>And thou So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon my Son know thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind.</hi> This is further urged from three motives, 1.

others being Circumstanced as he was, <hi>h. e.</hi> that were of the younger, Rising, succeeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being also the Children and posterity of godly Parents. Especially, the words did and do concern those that are the <hi>Posterity</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that is to say, of such as have been eminent Servants of God in their Generation. The Doctrine which I would therefore (by the help of Christ) insist on, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it may not be altogether unsuitable for this great Audience, is this.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That if they that are the Children and Posterity of Gods eminent Servants shall forsake the Lord, he will cast them off for ever.</hi> In the doctrinal handling of this Truth, there are four things which may be briefly enquired into. 1. When men especially the Children of Gods Servants, may be said to forsake him? 2. What is implyed, in this casting off for ever? 3. What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of God that is, which will be attended, with such casting off. 4.

                        </gap> that called them,</hi> Gal. 1. 6. <hi>h. e.</hi> they had forsaken God himself, because they had corrupted and forsaken the great Truths of the Gospel. All Truth is from God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is styled, <hi>the God of Truth,</hi> Deut. 32. 4. Yea, Truth it self, 1 Joh. 5, 6. And Truth is said to be his <hi>Name,</hi> Christ said to his faithful ones in the Church of Pargamus, <hi>thou holdest fast my Name,</hi> Rev. 2. 13. The Truths of Christ were much opposed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and by the Hereticks of those dayes, only some did faithfully adhere thereunto; and these are said to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000274_0046_0FA45934707958F8"/>
hold fast his Name. So then to forsake the Truth is to forsake the Lords Name. Especially when there is Apostacy from great-Foundation. Truths in Religion, the Lord is forsaken. Albeit every Truth hath the Name of God stamped upon it, yet there are some Truths which have more of his Name on them, then others have, that the disowning of them is absolutely to reject the Lord, namely fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truths, which indeed are not many nor hard to be known. Moreover, when those Truths are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by Children, which their Fathers were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently engaged in the profession of, (though they should not be fundamental in their natures) such Children may be said to forsake the Lord.</p>

Yea and the Antichristian Apostacy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in the New Testament, doth consist partly in this: We know that the Anti-Christian Generation (Papists I mean) are generally not only (as all of them are) horribly superstitious and idolatrous, but of most profane and debauched Consciences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations; in the Book of the Revelations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But then there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon favour, in respect of outward blessings, which are the effects of common love, &amp; that may utterly cease, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>I will love them no more.</hi> I have loved them, (saith the Lord) <hi>h. e.</hi> bestowed outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes on them, but I will do so no more.

                  <p>We come in the next place to enquire, <hi>what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of God that is, that will be attended with this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Answ. In two words, 1. <hi>this must be understood concerning deep departures from God,</hi> and from his blessed wayes, Hos. 9. 9. <hi>They have deeply corrupted themselves therefore he will visit their sins.</hi> The Lord is the God of patience, and of all grace, and thence is very slow in rejecting utterly a people, (of such Posterity) whom he hath once taken into Covenant with himself. Hence it is not lesser departures, but high and great offences against the Lord, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to cast off his People, <hi>e. g. Idolatry</hi> is a sin that causeth the rejection which the Text speaks of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, it is true with reference unto that Idolatry which is against the second Commandment. When the Children of Israel committed that Idolatry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the Calf in the Wilderness, they sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the second Commandment, for they would worship the Lord still, only they would do it in such a way, and by such means as God never appointed, and they were in great da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ger of being cast off for this sin. Hence the Lord said to Moses, <hi>thy People have corrupted themselves,</hi> Exod. 32. 7. The Lord doth not say <hi>my People,</hi> as he was wont to do, but <hi>Thy</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as if it were said; Now they have violated my
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000274_0055_0FA4593DAD729138"/>
Covenant, and deserve that I should for ever disown and reject them. The Asian Churches have been cast off for this sin especially; we may read the sin of those Churches written in dreadful Characters, upon the Forehead of that Judgement which hath destroyed them all. God hath let loose the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Turks upon them, who hate and destroy no men so much as those that worship Images. And as for the Church of Rome, the Apostle Paul did so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly predict that they should be cast off, Rom. 11. 22. Now it is for this sin principally that the Lord hath cast them off. Again, Heresy causeth this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off which the Text speaketh of, Societies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of such as disown the fundamental Truths of the Gospel, the Lord Jesus disowns them. Hence the Jews are disowned and rejected by the Lord, for although they own some fundamental Truths in Religion, indeed all <note n="[e]" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jac. Cappellu in Heb.</hi> 6. 1.</note> those six principles mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Apostle to the Hebrews, (<hi>Cap</hi> 6. 1, 2.) the Jews acknowledge, yet there are other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Truths, which they reject; That Jesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth is the true Messiah, that Messiah is God as well as man, the Doctrine of original sin, and of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by imputed righteousness, all which things are necessary to be believed in order to eternal life, this do they reject and disown; and therefore the Lord hath cast them off. when a People shall be so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate as to loose the Essentials of Religion, they are the Lords no longer. Heretical Assemblies may be the Flocks of those that pretend to be Christs companions, but they are none of Christs Flocks, Can. 1. 7.

Solomon was guilty (notwithstanding the solemn dying charge of his Father to the contrary) of dreadful forsakings and Apostasies from the Lord, but he repented of them, as we she by the book of <hi>Ecclesiates,</hi> and therefore the Lord did not wholly cast him off for ever Notwithstanding great degeneracy in a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Lord is not wont to cast them off until he hath used all means for their Recovery, so it was with the Children of Israel of old, 2 Chron. 36. 15. The Scripture hath recorded the names of above twenty Prophets which the Lord sent to his People of old to tell them of their backslidings, and call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to repent and reform, before he would cast them off. And though in these dayes of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament, because men sin against greater light and grace, then in former times, the Lord Jesus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth quicker work, with an Apostatizing People, then in the dayes of old, and in the years of ancient Generations; and therefore he said to the Church in Ephes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst greater light, and love, and grace, then may be said of any persons in the world besides; They this rebel against the Light do at last provoke the Lord utterly to reject them. Hence it is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing Instruction, is mentioned as the grand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cause of this Rejection, Jer. 6. 8. <hi>Be instructed O Jerusalem lest my Soul depart from thee, &amp; thou become desolate.</hi> Now thus it is when the Children of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents forsake the Lord, as Solomon doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, how diligent and faithful his blessed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been in instrncting of him, Prov. 4. 3, 4. <hi>I was my Fathers Son, he taught me also, and said unto me keep my Commandments and live.</hi> And sins against grace, and peculiar mercy do without Repentance

For these causes the Lord threatned Eli that he would cut off his Arm, and the Arm of his Fathers house, inasmuch as he had sinned against peculiar mercies aud favours. Especially, sins against ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gospel grace provoke the Lord to cast men off, Math. 23. 37, 38. <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would I have gathered you, as an Hen her Chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wings but ye would not, and now your house is left unto you desolate.</hi> And this is sadly true concerning the Children of godly Parents, they sin against spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favours from the Lord, the means of grace is vouchsafed to them, they have many blessed stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the holy Spirit with them, which others have not, therefore if they forsake the Lord no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he cast them off for-ever.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. From that infinite indignation, which is in the Lords heart against Apostates. They are fugitives from Christ, and deserting their Captain, the Lord himself will execute Martial Law upon them. No sinners are greater Objects of divine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and indignation. Hence the Apostle said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hebrews, when some of them were ready to Apostatize from Christianity to Judaisme, if any man draw back the Soul of God shall take no pleasure in him, Heb. 10. 38. meaning that such Creatures, are Vessels of dishonour, and the most loathsome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that can be thought of. Hence the Lord doth pursue them with infinite vengeance, he cuts them off, and casts them off for-ever. As that miserable <hi>Spira</hi> at the very moment, when he had renounced the Truth, thought he heard one say to him; <hi>Hence thou Apostate, and receive the Sentence of thy Eternal Damnation.</hi> The Lord is wont to leave marks of his wrath upon such sinners. He brands them, that all the world may be afraid of that iniquity, seldome hath it been known that any have notoriously turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away from the Lord, but visible wrath from Heaven hath fallen upon them. <hi>Jehoram</hi> had been religiously educated under his godly Father Jehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, but he proved the Apostate child of a gracious Father; And what came on him? God let loose the Heathen Arabians, who wasted his Estate, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all his Children save one. Thus did the Lord cast him off. <hi>Joash</hi> was religiously educated under his uncle Jehojadah, but he forsook the Lord, therefore the Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Servants murdered him. The like we read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Amaziah.</hi> And Histories (besides what is recorded in the Scripture) are full of awful and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Examples of the Lords indignation against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, and therefore since if Davids Children do forsake the Lord, they are to be reckoned amongst the number of Apostates, no wonder that he doth threaten to cast them off for-ever.</p>
                  <p>USE</p>
                  <p>We proceed now to a word of Application, and shall insist upon one only use of <hi>Exhortation, let us be exhorted in the Name and Fear of God this day, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that it may not be with us, as the Text and Doctrine expresseth,</hi> let us every one in our several places, and capacityes endeavour that the present and succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations in New-England, may not forsake the Lord God of their Fathers, &amp; so endanger their being cast off for-ever.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Consider, 1. <hi>What Fathers and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors have been,</hi> they were such as did seek the Lord. As for the body of the present Generation in New-England, it may be said to them, your Fathers were such as did serve the Lord, yea, it was love to God, and to Jesus Christ, which brought them into this Wilderness. As the Lord speaketh, Jer. 2. 2. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, when thou wentest after me in the Wilderness, in a Land which was not sown.</hi> Our Fathers did not in their coming hither propound any great matters to themselves respecting this world; only that they should have liberty to serve God; &amp; to walk with him in all the wayes of his worship. As one of our worthies hath aptly expressed, God sifted three Nations, that so he might bring over choice grain into this wilderness Let us then remember what <hi>New-England</hi> hath been. It hath been a noble Plant Jer. 2. 21. <hi>I plan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

our Eyes have seen the Lord fulfilling that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture litterally &amp; gloriously, Isai. 41. 19. <hi>I will plant in the Wilderness a Cedar.</hi> The chief of the Fathers in these New-English Churches, they were <hi>Abrahams.</hi> He, when God called him removed out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the Chaldees, to the place which the Lord would shew him, &amp; there built an Altar to the Everlasting God, so did our Fathers remove out of their own Land, when God called them, and came hither, to build an Altar here to the Everlasting God, yea, and they have set the Altar upon its right Basis too. Our Fathers have been <hi>Davids,</hi> that is to say, <hi>eminent Reformers.</hi> Let me speak freely (without offence to any) there never was a Generation that did so perfectly shake off the dust of Babylon, both as to Ecclesiastical and civil Constitution, as the first Generation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that came into this Land for the Gospels sake, where was there ever a place so like unto new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem as New-England hath been?

That ever such a branch should spring out of such a Stock. The Ephraimites were the vilest Idolaters of all the Apostate Children of Israel, yet they were the Posterity of Joseph the best of Jacobs twelve Sons. The perfidious and ungrateful Ziphites were also the posterity of that blessed <hi>Caleb</hi> but now mentioned. Yea, it is a sad Truth, that Religion hath seldome been upheld in the power of it, for above one or two Generations together. Therefore it is recorded concerning the Children of Israel, <hi>they turned quickly out of the way which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, but they did not so,</hi> Judg. 2. 17. The Fathers and Leaders both of the first and second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration were for purity of worship, but their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>were not so.</hi> Their Fathers did endeavour to uphold Religion in the power of it, but <hi>their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did not so.</hi> Their Fathers did order their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation according to the holy Rules of the word of God, but <hi>their Children did not so.</hi> Hence is that sad complaint by the Prophet, <hi>they rose early and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted all their doings,</hi> Zeph. 3. 7. And if we look into the Scripture and view the story of former Ages, we shall see this to be true. The Posterity of the Lords Servants, the Children of the Church have in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time so forsaken him, as that solemn <hi>Reformation</hi> hath been necessary. Look beyond the Flood and we shall see it so. One of Adams Children with all his numerous Posterity forsook the Lord, Cain was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate out of the Church and became the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an excommunicate race and Generation.

years, (<hi>h. e.</hi> until Seth was born) but then great Apostacy prevailed. When the Church was small in one Family, it was more easy to keep it pure, by casting out the Apostates, but now the world grew numerous, &amp; a multitude of sinners caused impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in sin, so as that they that were godly and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious were fain in the very beginning or first Ages and Generations of the world, to separate themselves and become distinct societies. Hence is that, Gen. 4. 26. <hi>then began men to call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> It noteth a separation of the Church from the prophane world. After this, a second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy followed, that the Church and world were mixed together, even the Sons of God and daughters of men, the Posterity of godly <hi>Seth</hi> and of wicked <hi>Cain,</hi> until such time as the flood came and cleared the world of them, Gen. 6. 2. Then were the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth in a most corrupt Estate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Psalmist (as it seems) alluding to that time faith, <hi>the Lord looked down from Heaven, to see if there were any that did understand and seek God, every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy,</hi> Psal. 53. 2, 3. After Religion was revived in Noahs Family, his Posterity quickly forsook the Lord, <hi>Chams</hi> Apostacy was (as some Learned men observe) about forty years after the flood. The Church was reformed by his ejection, but within sixty or seventy years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the builders of Babel set upon their wicked attempt, which was desperate Rebellion against the Lord, although Noah himself was then alive, he could not by all his Authority restrain his grand Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Posterity, but they would needs become guilty of that Babel defection. After this, within a few Generations the world was overrun with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. When that iniquity first began is hard to say, but it is evident that in Jobs time (who is
<pb facs="unknown:000274_0065_0FA45A9A73F141A8"/>
thought to live about three hundred and fifty years after the Flood) the world was filled with Idolaters, yea, in Abrahams time there was such Apostacy as that Religion was almost gone out of the world; only in his Family there was a pure Church esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Yet his Posterity did quickly forsake the Lord. The Ishmaelites, Midianites, Edomites, (and other Nations) who were of the Posterity of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the Father of the faithful, in a few Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lost the substantials of Religion, and were wholly deprived of their Church Estate. The Church was setled in Jacobs Family. Corruption and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition did creep into his Family, so as that he was fain to set upon a work of solemn Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that was not two hundred years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation begun in his grand-Father Abrahams Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. After the Church was become National, the truth and power of Religion did very rarely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue above one or two Generations at the most (sometimes not so long) witness that Scripture <note n="†" place="margin">

And the People served the Lord all the dayes of Joshua, and all the dayes of the Elders that out-lived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel: <hi>And all that Generation were gathered unto their Fathers, and there arose another Generation after them, which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Those that were the grand-Children of that Generation which was brought out of Egypt, did forsake the God, of their Fathers.

Moreover, Phinehas the Son of Eleazar, the Son of <hi>Aaron</hi> was Priest in those dayes, Judg. 20. 28. which maketh it very manifest that, that most corrupt Generation, were the grand-Children of those, that were first embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed as a peculiar People, when the Lord did plant the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth, that is to say, did build up the Children of Israel as a body politick under Ecclesiastical and civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>third Generation</hi> among that People proved degenerate and apostate. And when they were under a <hi>Theocracy</hi> or Government by Judges, whom the Lord immediately raised up and set over them, how soon did they turn aside from God; when any of their faithful Judges were taken from them, Judg. 2. 19. So in the dayes of the Kings. After <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Reformation</hi> Apostacy began in the very next Generation, in the dayes of his Son Solomon, and in the dayes of his grand-Child Rehoboam <hi>all Israel forsook the Lord,</hi> until God by a sad war awakened them to some Reformation. In Jehoshaphats time Religion was upheld in some power; but in the very next Generation there was Apostacy, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah was a great Reformer, but his Son Manasseh <hi>built up again the high places, which his Father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and seduced the People to do more evil then did the Nations, whom the Lord destroyed before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

of Israel.</hi> After this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Josiah wrought a great Reformation, and with him did the work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Religion, dye amongst the Jews, upon Josiahs death a flood of Land destroying sins brake in upon that Generation, that within the space of two and twenty years after Josiah was gathered unto his Fathers, the Jewish State both Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal was quite overthrown; After the Captivity, Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra and Nehemiah, and the Prophets Haggai and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary were great Reformers; But Apostasy quickly prevailed, witness the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that not only People but Rulers many of them in his dayes, were become very corrupt. Albeit they were not guilty of that more gross Idolatry, for which their Fathers were sent into Captivity, yet Covetousness, which is a spiritual Idolatry they were guilty of, whereby they provoked the Lord to send blasting Providences upon them, there being no greater punishment to a covetous man then to have the world taken from him. That Generation did not keep themselves unspotted of the World, upon which account, they are by the Prophet pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unclean, Hag. 2. 13, 14. And when Christ came into the world, he found the Jews in a most degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate corrupt Estate. Therefore did the Lord call them an <hi>evil</hi> and an <hi>Adulterous,</hi> and a <hi>viperous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

We have in former years enjoyed a sun shine of prosperity, and that hath been attended (as useth to be) with great Apostasy. It is an apt similitude which some use, that as the heat of the Sun in Summer breeds a multitude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects, so doth the warmth of prosperity a multitude of Apostates. Men are leth to hear on this Ear, but
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000274_0070_0FA45A9E9C0E9A18"/>
if we should deny it, the Lord doth testify against us that it is so, as Ioel. 1. 2. <hi>Hear this ye old men and give Ear all ye Inhabitants of the Land, hath this been in your dayes, or even in the dayes of your Fathers saith the Lord.</hi> Were there (saith the Prophet) such Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for merly as now there are, you may therefore conclude that you are departed from God, and by your sins have provoked him so to punish you. Thus may it be spoken with reference to our State &amp; Case, and the dispensations of God towards us, you old men that are here before the Lord this day, what say you to this Question, did you know such Judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on New-England formerly, as of late we have seen? was it so in the dayes of our Fathers? were there such general and killing diseases? such a long continuing warr? so many hundreds cut of by the Sword, yea, so many hundred Familyes brought to ruine? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks removed out of their places, and Plantations made desolate! In former times we heard of little besides settlement of Plantations, and gathering of Churches, but of late years, in stead of that, ruines have been multiplyed, yea, mischief upon mischief. God hath been spending his Arrows, and heaping mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon this Generation. This Generation is not like the first. How many ignorant ones? how many scandalous ones? There is great rudeness amongst young ones in this Land; and in that respect degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy from the good manners of the Christian world. And such sins as formerly were not known in <hi>New-England</hi> are now become common, such as swearing, sinful gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, the present Generation as to the body of it, is an unconverted Generation. I would not lessen the grace of God, I know that through grace many of the younger Generation are brought home to God in Jesus Christ, yet in many (I donbt in most) Congregations, the number of sincere
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000274_0071_0FA45AA10AA07968"/>
converts is but smal, comparatively with those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main still in a natural &amp; unconverted Estate. And as for some that have the Root of the matter in them, yet they fall much short of their Fathers grace, Solomon was a good man and his Soul is now in Heaven, yet he was not like David his Father as to measure of grace and faithfulness, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 6. we may see here and there, one that hath much of his blessed Fathers Spirit and Principles, but how rare are such amongst us? Nay, the Interest of <hi>New-England</hi> is now changed, from a Religious to a worldly Interest; and in this thing is <hi>the great Radical Apostasy of New-England.</hi> Is not this to chuse a strange God? Hence do we see warr in the gates. And the Lord hath been letting this Generation blood in the right vein, since be hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the world away from them. Trade is almost ruined. Farmes, Oxen, Merchandise, which things have been sought after in the first place, how have they failed? <hi>New-England</hi> is not like this twenty years, to be in that comfortable Estate it was in but two years agoe.</p>
                  <p>Consider, 4. <hi>There is sad cause to fear what will at last come on this Generation.</hi> There is a consumption on Religion all the world over, as one well observeth <note n="[p]" place="margin">

                     </note> the buryals of Christians are frequent and their birth is rare. And as for what concerns ourselves more peculiarly, we may fear that there will be greater Apostasy, because they that should have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it are gone. Many times the removal of a few eminent Servants of God in the Common-wealth, or in the Churches, maketh way for great Apostafie quickly to ensue was it not so with the Children of Israel? when they had a good Judge over them, they would serve the Lord all the dayes of that Judge, but it came to pass when the Judge was dead, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and corrupted themselves more then their

Fathers, Judg. 2. 18, 19. In Nehemiahs time while he was Governour for twelve years together, things went well, and God blessed the Land wonderfully, but when he was removed, in one years time those sins of oppression, sensuality, Sabbath breaking, were become prevailing common evils, Neh. 13. 6. Alas! our Nehemiahs are gone, (I speak it not to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that survive, but to awaken from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our solemn bereavements) our Pauls are likewise departed from amongst us, in which respect we may fear corruption in Religion will follow, Acts 20, 29. Deut. 31. 27. Judg. 8. 33. Have we not seen it in some places, how that within a year after the death of such an eminent Servant of Christ, Apostasy to this day irrecoverable hath prevailed? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the heads of the second Generation, that were most likely to have done good, the Lord hath snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them away, and (like Enoch) translated them to Heaven, in the midst of their dayes; others that are most likely to prevent backsliding, and to be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reforming a corrupted Generation, are not likely to continue long in this evil world, yea, and of late even since the present warr, that we are bleeding under, began, the Lord hath taken away many young ones, either by Sword or sickness, who were the hopes of the Generation. In many Plantations, they that have dyed of late, were the most hopeful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable young men in the places where they lived, an Ominous sign that there is some terrible thing, which God will do, e're this Generation be passed away.</p>
                  <p>Consider, 5. <hi>How sad it would be if succeeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations should forsake the Lord.</hi> It is evident, from the considerations mentioned, that it may be so, but it would be dismal if indeed it should be so. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> would then become of all Lands the most dark and miserable.

Hence is that, Hos. 9. 15. <hi>all their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness is in Gilgal.</hi> Gilgal was once famous upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious accounts. <hi>There</hi> was the Covenant renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Circumcision, <hi>there</hi> was the first Passover kept by the Children of Israel, after their coming into the promised Land, <hi>there</hi> did God appear to Joshua, <hi>there</hi> was to be seen a famous Monument of the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders for his people, <hi>there</hi> was the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for some time, but in after Generations an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Temple was built there, so as that it was a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of much wickedness. <hi>All their wickedness was in Gilgal.</hi> It seemeth the Altar of witness was near that place, which through mens corruptions might easily be abused unto much Superstition in after Ages. The Devil seeketh to corrupt those places especially, which once were famous for Religion.

What Land under Heaven, hath been more noted for profession and Religion, then <hi>New-England?</hi> If Apostacy prevail amongst such a People, it is like to be a sad Apostacy indeed. We see it already; Hence there are such sad complaints of young men that have been bred and born in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England, when they go abroad into other Lands that none are so debauched and prophane as some of them. If the Lord should be provoked to pluck up the Hedge of civil government, what a fearful flood

of iniquity would soon break in? How would mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and inraged profaneness know no bounds? yea, this Land would become as Sodom, and then most desolating plagues will in short time follow, Ezek. 33. 28. what became of Cain's degenerate race? when they were become, I know not how many millions, the flood swept away every mothers child of them. wherefore all the Children of men that are now in the world are styled <hi>the Children of Seth,</hi> Numb. 24. 17. <note n="[q]" place="margin">

                     <pb n="69" facs="unknown:000274_0075_0FA45AA68CB8D600"/>1. Let me apply my Speech unto Zerubbabels, <hi>h. e.</hi> Rulers in the Common-Wealth. Honoured and much esteemed, the welfare or ill fare of the present, yea, and following Generation doth much depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, <hi>Magistrates</hi> are in the Scripture compared to <hi>Corner stones,</hi> because where there is a Common-Wealth erected, the safety of the whole building (under God) depends much upon them. Hence are they also termed Foundations, Psal. 11. 3. If the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations be destroyed what can the righteous do? If David had perished, Foundations had been destroyed, and the good People of the Land would have dearly felt the loss of him. And when in Sauls time there were corrupt Judges and Magistrates, it is therefore said, that the <hi>Foundations</hi> of the Earth were out of Course, Psal. 82. 5. And the Prophet Micah speaking to the Rulers in the Common-wealth of Israel saith, <hi>hear ye Foundations of the Earth,</hi> Mic. 6. 2. It is with you (by the help of Christ) to lay such Foundations as shall make Posterity either happy or miserable. David improved the power which God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence entrusted him with, <hi>to serve his Generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God,</hi> Acts 13. 36. And therefore was an eminent blessing to all that Generation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lived. If the sins of the People under your care and charge should ever provoke the Lord, to leave you in an hour of Temptation, you cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly turn aside from God alone, but many others will do so too. <hi>Regis ad Exemplum,</hi> People are apt to follow the Examples of those in place. you know it is mentioned concerning Rehoboam, that he within few years after his coming to the Government did forsake the Lord, and all Israel with him, 2 Chron. 11. 1.

Drunkenness in the sight of men, and the occasions of it, do; which you may and ought to remove. I know not any evil, that hath brought more misery upon this generation then that hath, and some that have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to know it, have told me that there hath been more Drunkenness amongst the Indians, since this war, then there was before; undoubtedly there is a fault somewhere, that good Laws are not executed upon those that shall transgress in this kind, and that the course propounded and enacted by the general Court, for the suppressing of this growing evil hath not been duly attended.

                  <p>And now I shall turn my speech from you that are <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> amongst this People: I doubt not but you consider that I have spoken these things, not as a friend only, but as in the Capacity of an unworthy Ambassador of the most high God unto you this day. And methinks my Conscience bears me witness in the holy Ghost, that an earnest desire that the will of God might be done, hath caused me thus to express my self; As also a desire that you might have comfort both now and in <hi>that day</hi> when you must give up your account to the Son of God, concerning your Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which in his Providence he hath entrusted you with; and that your names might be honourably spoken of in the next Generation, when you shall be in your graves. It is no honour to Jehu's name that <hi>in his dayes God began to cut Israel short,</hi> 2 King.10.32. nor to Jehoram in that it is recorded to Posterity, that <hi>in his dayes the Edomites revolted,</hi> 2 Chron.21. 18. Nor will it be for your honour, if the next Generation shall say, once such and such Worthies and Patriots had the management of affairs in <hi>New-England,</hi> and in their dayes things went well, God did bless and build, and prosper the Land, but after they were

gone, the work fell into other hands, and <hi>in their dayes</hi> there was trouble upon trouble, wars, sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Sword, Fire, desolations in every corner of the Land, for it (thus to be spoken) would not be for your honour. But now that it should be said, though the Lord afflicted the Land for a while, you caused the People under your charge to turn unto the Lord, &amp; then God did own them, and bless them more then ever, this will be to your honour amongst men in this world, and more to your joy when you shall appear before Jesus Christ, then if Crowns of Diadems should be set upon your heads. The Lord grant it may be so.</p>

Our Fathers did like David, He prepared Materials for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then left it to his Son to goe on with the Building: So did our Fathers, leave us Principles of Truth, which they did with much cost and pains, dig out of the rich veins of the Scripture. We have need therefore to be much in Prayer, and Humiliations before the Lord, that so he might vouchsafe to shew us the form of the House, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof.</p>

If these golden dayes be lost, probably thou wilt be undone for ever. I must needs tell you, that for the most part it is so, that men are either converted in youth or not at all.

Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is true with respect unto those that have in the dayes of their youth lived under the means of grace, heard many Sermons, experienced frequent strivings of the Spirit of God with their hearts, if they remain unconverted until the dayes of their Youth are past and gone, the Lord usually giveth them up to Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hardness of heart, that they shall never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, never saved.
