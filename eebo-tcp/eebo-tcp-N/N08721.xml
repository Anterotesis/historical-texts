            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE Of Part of the LIFE and ADVENTURERS of JOSEPH ANDREWS, Particularly of his PIRACY and the MURDER of Capt. DURYEE and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for which he was tried on the 17th Inſtant, and condemn'd to be hang'd this Day, the 23d of May, 1769, on the Shore between the Air Furnace and the Town, and his Body afterwards hung in Chains on Bedlow's Iſland.</head>
            <p>JOSEPH ANDREWS, the unhapy Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal who is this Day to ſuffer Death, was, we hear born in the Iſland of Madeira, and is now about 40 Years of Age. The Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his Life, we have not been able to obtain as he was much upon the Reſerve, and as we hear has not made any Confeſſion, except of the Crime for which he is this Day to ſuffer; but as a dying Man, ſolemnly denies having been guilty of or concerned in any other Murder.</p>
            <p>A Neglect of Religion, and all Chriſtian Duties, and a free Indulgence of every vicious, Inclination, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in keeping bad Company, led him from one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Wickedneſs to another, till his Heart was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened againſt Remorſe, and became capable of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and deviſing the moſt horrid Thoughts and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>In the Month of Auguſt 1766, he enter'd himſelf on board the Sloop Polly, Roluff Duryee Maſter, bound from New-York to the Weſt-Indies. The other Perſons on board were, Peter Demelt, jun. Mate, Nicholas Johnſon and William Harris, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners — Cobbs, a Cabbin Boy, and two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wells Caverley and his Son, Paſſengers. Soon after leaving New-York, obſerving the Captain and Paſſengers had a good deal of Money, He and John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon formed the Deſign of gaining Poſſeſſion of it by murdering the People. This Deſign they concluded to put in Execution as ſoon as they ſhould make the Land, accordingly about 8 Days after, the Night before they expected to get to St. Chriſtopers, about Midnight, William Harris being at Helm, and the Captain a ſleep on a Hencoop on Deck, Johnſon with one Blow of an Ax killed him, and he expired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Groan or Struggle. They then in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner between them murdered the two Paſſengers, and Mate with the Ax, and threw the Boy overboard alive. One of them made a Stroke with the Ax at Harris, who ran to the End of the Bowſprit with a Knife and declared he would kill the firſt Man that approached him. They then told him if he would join them and ſwear to be ſecret and faithful, he ſhould be ſafe, and ſhare the Plunder with them, for Johnſon having formerly ſail'd with him, pretended to have a Regard for him; but it was previouſly agreed between Johnſon and Andrews to kill him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got aſhore. Harris then came into the Veſſel and aſſiſted in throwing the Bodies overboard; after which they broke open the Captain's and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers Cheſts and Lockers, got a Bottle of Wine, and drank Damnation to themſelves and each other if they diſcovered the Secret. They then got a Bible and made Harris ſwear upon it that he would not betray them; 3 or 4 Days after this, being in Sight of Land, and ſeveral Veſſels appearing, they got out the Boat, put into it two Cheſts, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought proper to take, ſcuttled the Veſſel, left her, and ſail'd towards the Land, telling Harris to ſteer clear of the Shore. But he telling them if they did not get pretty near the Land the Current would drive them to the Leeward of all the Iſlands, they left him to ſteer as he thought beſt,—but intended to throw him overboard before he got to Land. After ſome Time Johnſon and Andrews both fell aſleep, when Harris ſtripping himſelf, took the Opportunity to throw overboard, without Noiſe, both the Oars and his Clothes, when unhanging and dropping the Rudder overboard, he gently let himſelf down into the Sea and ſwam on Shore at St. Kitts, where he gave a blind ſuſpicious Account of himſelf, being afraid to ſay any Thing that might break his Oath of Secrecy; but at laſt he applied to a Miniſter for Advice how a Man ought to act in a Caſe ſimilar to his own. The Miniſter convinced him that ſuch Kinds of Oaths were to far from being binding, that it would be highly criminal to keep them. He then went before the Judge Surrogate of the Admiralty and gave his Depoſition of all the Circumſtances he knew of the bloody Affair. Soon after he quitted the Boat, the irregular tumbling of it waked the two Criminals, who ſaw their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Situation, and were enraged they had not an Opportunity to ſatiate their Revenge upon Harris. They at firſt endeavour'd to ſteer with their Hate, but aftewards did it more effectually with their Sprit, and by that Means got to Euſtatia, where they ſold the Boat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:011151_0002_0F857DBFF0B1D200"/>Some Days after their Arrival, the St. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's Gazette with Harris's Depoſition, made its Appearance in Euſtatia, Andrews happening to ſee it, immediately left the Iſland, in a Veſſel bound to Caſco Bay. The Governor of St. Euſtatia, on ſeeing the Depoſition, publiſh'd by Proclamation an Order for a deligent Search, and that no Perſon ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Criminals off, under the Penalty of 50,000 Pieces of Eight: He alſo diſpatched a Veſſel after Andrews, with a proper Notification of the Charge againſt him, and Deſcription of his Perſon. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſoon taken up at Euſtatia, confeſſed the Facts, and was executed on the 15th of November, 1766, by being broke a live on the Rack, he was ſtretched naked on a Croſs, where the Bones of his Arms, Legs and Thighs were broken with an Iron Bar, and he afterwards received upwards of 20 Strokes on his Breaſt, before he expired. Andrews, the preſent Criminal was ſoon after his Arrival ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and impriſoned ſome Time at Boſton, when he attempted to cut his own Throat, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Care of his Attendants. From Boſton he was ſent here, where he arrived the Twenty-ſixth Day of May, 1766, and has remained a Priſoner ever ſince.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday laſt, the 17th Inſtant, by Virtue of a ſpecial Commiſſion, he was tried by a Court of Admiralty held for that Purpoſe, conſiſting of his Excellency the Governor preſident, the Gentlemen of his Majeſty's Council, the Judge of the Admiralty, the Commander of his Majeſty's Ship Deal Caſtle, the Deputy's Secretary, and the Receiver General and Collector of the Province.</p>
            <p>Richard Nicholls, Eſquire, Regiſter of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, at New-York, and John M'Keſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Eſq, Deputy Regiſter of the ſaid Court, and a Notary Public, in the ſaid Province, exhibited five ſeveral Charges in the ſaid Court, againſt him— During the Courſe of the Trial, fourteen Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were examined on the Part of the Crown, and two on the Part of the Priſoner—The greateſt Part of the Clothing found with the Priſoner in his Cheſt, and by him claimed as his own, in the Preſence of the Court, were very fully and circumſtantially proved to have belonged to Captain Duryee, and his Mate, or ſome of the Perſons who were murdered on board the ſaid Sloop, and alſo many other Things found in the Cheſt and owned by the Priſoner, — Many of them were marked with the initial Letters of the Names of their former Owners, and many others of them with the plain Marks of thoſe initial Letters remaining, tho' the Silk of the marking was taken out, and they were marked J. A, the initial Letters of the Name of the Priſoner.—Several Things ſaid by the Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, during the Courſe of the Trial, and in his Defence, militated much againſt him.—— The Trial laſted from Ten of the Clock on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, until One of the Clock on Thurſday Morning, during all which Time, his Excellency never left the Bench.——The Evidence was full, clear and particular, and the Priſoner found <hi>guilty,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is to be executed this Day, between the Hours of Ten in the Morning, and Two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, on the Strand, at the Eaſt Side of Hudſon's River, near Domini's Hook, between the ebbing and flowing of the Tide: And his Body to be afterwards hung in Chains, on the moſt conſpicuous Part of the Peſt-Iſland in New-York Bay, as a Spectacle to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all Perſons from the like Felonies for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>On Friday the ſame Court of Admiralty met for the Trial of Stephen Porter, Mariner, for the Murder of Capt. John Weſtcot, and ſundry others, on board a Briſtol Ship on the High Seas on the Coaſt of Guinea, in the Year 1766,—But on the Officers going to bring him up from the Priſon, they found him hanging to one of the Window Bars, quite dead, he having made Uſe of a String he uſually kept up his Irons with:—The Coroner's Inqueſt brought it in Self-Murder, and he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to be buried in the High-Way, at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End of the Bowry-Lane, and have a Stake drove through his Body.</p>
