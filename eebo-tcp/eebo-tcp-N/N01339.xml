            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN our Context, the holy Apoſtle blames the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for <hi>going to Law</hi> before the <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> v. 1. before <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> v. 6. and that about <hi>ſmalleſt matters,</hi> v. 2. They were very ready to <hi>Sue</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Law, about ſmall matters, and that before <hi>infidels,</hi> before <hi>Heathen, Pagan Judges:</hi> This he blames them for. He does not abſolutely, blame or condemn, the uſing of wholeſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, for the defending men from Injuries, or for the obtaining of their right. The Apoſtle himſelf, when in danger of being wrongfully and illegally Scourged, pleaded the Roman Law in his own defence, ſaying, Act. 22.25. <hi>Is it lawful for you to Scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned?</hi> Yea God himſelf appointed, that there
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001590_0003_0FB3DB05D7C94778"/>ſhould be Judges among his People, to hear Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and to ſee Juſtice done. Deut. 25.1. <hi>If there be a Controveſy between men, and they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Judgment that the Judges may Judge them, then they ſhall juſtifie the Righteous &amp; condemn the Wicked.</hi> Tis not therefore abſolutely and in it ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, a Sin, to go to Law; tho' circumſtances are often ſuch, that many do very Sinfully in going to Law. And ſuch were the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at this time, among the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> they went to Law about little matters, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Heathen Judges, who were ready from their contentions to vilifie &amp; reproach their Religion. The Chriſtian Religion does oblige the Profeſſors of it, to be loving, quiet, peaceable, harmleſs, ſelf-denying. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men,</hi> Rom. 12.18. Our bleſſed Saviour ſaid, Joh. 13.35. <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> Since Chriſtians are ſo plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to be loving, peaceable, ſelf-denying; no doubt but the heathen Judges before whom the Chriſtian <hi>Corinthians</hi> manag'd their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, did thence take occaſion, to reproach their <hi>Religion</hi> as well as their <hi>Perſons.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle therefore blames the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> becauſe they had no more regard to the <hi>Credit &amp; Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their <hi>Religion:</hi> he tells them they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Suffer themſelves to be defrauded,</hi> than that their Religion ſhould thus ſuffer by their means, <hi>v.</hi> 7. But then the Apoſtle goes on, and chargeth
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001590_0004_0FB3DB07564556F8"/>theſe Chriſtians, with an higher crime than their going to Law with one another; and that was, That they themſelves did wrong and defraud one another. They were ſo far from being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer wrong, and to deny themſelves, for the Credit of Religion; that indeed they did wrong and defrauded, and that their Brethren. This he charges on them as a great Sin, in our Text. Perſons may be ſaid to <hi>do wrong,</hi> and to <hi>defraud,</hi> in other matters as well as in <hi>Worldly goods</hi> or <hi>Outward eſtate;</hi> yet this latter ſeems to be chiefly intended in our Text, and in this ſenſe I ſhall ſpeak to it at preſent. The words may afford us this,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </head>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tis a very great Sin, for Chriſtians to wrong and defraud one another (or indeed any Perſons) in their Worldly Goods or Outward Eſtate.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Doubtleſs all Chriſtians, will readily aſſent to the truth of this Doctrine; yet poſſibly they wont ſo well agree, who are guilty of the crime here mention'd. I ſhall therefore inquire,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>When may Perſons be ſaid to wrong or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud others, in their Worldly Goods or Outward Eſtates;</hi> Or, <hi>when may they be ſaid, to get diſhoneſt gain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are various ways, wherein Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be ſaid to be thus guilty. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud others, (or get diſhoneſt gain.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001590_0005_0FB3DB08D6938A80"/>
                  <hi>1. When they Rob them of their Right.</hi> By <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> I here intend, an open forcible taking away a Perſon's right from him, without any pretence of Law or of giving any valuable conſideration for it. Such <hi>Robberies</hi> are often committed by Land, and alſo on the Sea by <hi>Pyrates.</hi> Such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible taking away, we read of, Judg. 9.25. <hi>They robbed all that came along that way, by them.</hi> Such Robbery, is contrary to the light and law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and expreſsly forbidden in the word of God. Lev. 19.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy Neighbour, neither rob him.</hi> Pſal. 62.10. <hi>Become not vain in Robbery.</hi> What's gotten by Robbery, muſt needs be diſhoneſt gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. When they Steal from any.</hi> By <hi>Stealing,</hi> I here mean, the taking away from Perſons what they're juſtly poſſeſs'd of, and that in a fly, ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, un-be-known to the Perſons wronged. Thus, when Perſons <hi>Secretly remove Land-marks</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their own borders, this is Stealing of Land, contrary to the Divine Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.17. So, <hi>Pick-Pockets</hi> are guilty of Stealing; ſo thoſe who <hi>in the dark,</hi> or when they think <hi>none ſees or obſerves them,</hi> will uſe that advantage for taking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what juſtly belongs to others. This is a crime, directly contrary to the expreſs letter of the <hi>Eight Commandment,</hi> viz. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal.</hi> This Sin is greatly aggravated, when Perſons take advantage for it, from <hi>Shipwrecks</hi> or <hi>burning of Houſes.</hi> When by ſuch Afflictive Providences, mens goods are thrown haſtily out of doors, or
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001590_0006_0FB3DB0A561CA8E8"/>lye ſcattered on the Sea-ſhoar (the owners not being able to ſecure them) others will take this advantage to Steal them; I ſay, when they do thus, tis a great <hi>aggravation</hi> of their Theft. They add Affliction to the Afflicted. As for direct <hi>Robbing</hi> and <hi>Stealing,</hi> they're ſuch heinous notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crimes, that an honeſt Heathen would abhor them. But there are many other methods, wherein Perſons often do wrong, defraud, and get diſhoneſt gain, as,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. When they Sell things at an exceſſive rate, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable high price.</hi> There's a juſt profit and gain, belonging (or due) to thoſe, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment 'tis to buy and ſell. It's no eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exactly to ſtate the caſe, and to ſay, how much profit is juſtly to be allow'd to the Seller. The nature of the Commodities, the trouble of the buſineſs, and other conſiderations may alter the caſe very much; and render it allowable to take more profit (proportionably to the worth or price of the thing) in one caſe; than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Many circumſtances ſhould be ſeriouſly weigh'd by thoſe, who would approve their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to God in theſe matters. And thoſe who will ſeriouſly conſider, and conſult their own Conſciences, may ordinarily if they will, avoid wronging themſelves or others in Selling. Tis good therefore, to conſult the profit of the <hi>buyer</hi> as well as of the <hi>Seller,</hi> that both may rejoyce together. 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man another's wealth.</hi> That is, we ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001590_0007_0FB3DB0BD6A18C70"/>have regard to the good and profit of others, as well as of our ſelves. But when the Seller's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is, to get as much as poſſibly he can, and regards only his own profit and not the buyer's; he then acts unjuſtly. To ask and receive an exceſſive unreaſonable price for what is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is Oppreſſion and Extortion. And tis an <hi>Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this Sin, when the <hi>Seller</hi> takes advantage for it, from the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>buyer;</hi> Impoſing on his weakneſs, making him believe the thing is worth much more than it is. It aggravates the crime alſo, when he takes advantage of the buyer's <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> it may be he has great, urgent <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for ſuch or ſuch a thing, can't get it elſe where, and this advantage the Seller takes to ask extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly: this is aggravated wickedneſs. Prov. 22.22. <hi>Rob not the poor, becauſe he is poor; neither oppreſs the afflicted in the gate.</hi> Tis wrong and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt alſo, for Perſons to <hi>Ingroſs</hi> or <hi>Monopolize</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities (getting them all into their own hands) on purpoſe that they may get an <hi>unreaſonable high price</hi> for them; eſpecially if ſuch commodities are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for humane Life, ſuch as <hi>Food</hi> or <hi>Raiment.</hi> Prov. 11.26. <hi>He that with-holdeth corn, the People ſhall curſe him. Corn,</hi> is neceſſary for the ſupport of humane Life, if therefore in time of ſcarcity, any will buy up all the Corn they can, on purpoſe to get an unreaſonable high price for it; the People will curſe ſuch an one, yea and God will curſe him too. So it's an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the crime, when Perſons ask an
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001590_0008_0FB3DB0D5E6AD1C8"/>exceſſive unreaſonable price, for <hi>Tools</hi> or <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for mens following their honeſt Callings with. Deut. 24.6. <hi>No man ſhall take the nether or upper Mill-ſtone to pledge, for he taketh a man's Life to pledge.</hi> Some of the Poor, did grind with <hi>Hand-mills</hi> for a living, if either of the Mill-ſtones was taken as a <hi>Pawn</hi> or <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> for a debt, or for a thing lent; thereby the man was hindred from his <hi>Calling,</hi> from working for a Livelihood: ſuch barbarity therefore was forbidden. Indeed as for trifles, baubles, things only to pleaſe the fancy; if an high price be ask'd for them, it's not ſo bad as to ask high for things that are <hi>neceſſary.</hi> But ſurely, Chriſtians ſhould make Conſcience of their ways, they ſhould take heed that they dont defraud in buying or ſelling. Lev. 25.14. <hi>If thou ſell ought unto thy Neighbour, or buyeſt ought of thy Neighbour's hand; ye ſhall not oppreſs one another.</hi> When the <hi>Buyer</hi> would get things at an under rate, for leſs than they're worth, not allowing to the <hi>Seller</hi> an honeſt gain or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable profit; this alſo is unjuſt. Prov. 20.14. <hi>It is naught, it is naught, (ſaith the buyer) but when he is gone his way, then he boaſteth.</hi> When the buyer, by diſpraiſing and under-valuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, gets them for leſs than they're worth, and then brags of his good bargain; this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, tis a wicked defrauding.</p>

So when perſons deceive in <hi>Weight</hi> or <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and part with <hi>leſs</hi> than what they pretend to, this is wicked cheating and defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lev. 19.35, 36. <hi>Ye ſhall do no Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; juſt ballances, juſt weights, a juſt ephah, and a juſt him ſhall ye have.</hi> God requir'd, that they ſhould have <hi>juſt Ballances,</hi> that is, <hi>true Soales</hi> (to Sell things by <hi>weight</hi>) not ſuch as they could make to <hi>turn deceitfully,</hi> to ſerve a <hi>Knaviſh deſign.

                  <hi>5. When Perſons ask an exceſſive price, for Service expected from or performed by them.</hi> As ſome ask too high a price for the goods or commodities they Sell; So ſome ask too high a price for their <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Labour;</hi> this alſo is doing wrong and defrauding. Thus, <hi>Phyſitians</hi> defraud, if they ask an exceſſive reward for their <hi>Medicines</hi> or <hi>Viſits.</hi> So if <hi>Attorneys, Clarks, Sheriffs, Conſtables,</hi> or any
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001590_0011_0FB3DB11D6302D00"/>Imploy'd in any ſuch <hi>Faculty, Office</hi> or Buſineſs, do ask exceſſive Rates or Fees for what they do, therein they are fraudulent and unjuſt. So when <hi>Trades-men</hi> or <hi>Labourers</hi> ask an exceſſive price for their Work, therein they act unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unrighteouſly. For men may be unjuſt and unrighteous, in asking too high a price for the uſe of their skill in any Art or Myſtery, or in asking too much for their Work; as in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unreaſonable high price for the Goods they ſell. So men are unjuſt, when being hired by the <hi>Day, Week Month or Year,</hi> they are <hi>Slothful, Lazy,</hi> and <hi>Idle away their Time.</hi> For Inſtance, Suppoſe, that <hi>Four Shillings</hi> a Day, is reckoned the juſt and common <hi>Wages</hi> for ſuch or ſuch ſort of Work; the Workman does not expect nor ask more; I ſay in ſuch a Caſe, if the Workman <hi>Idles</hi> away <hi>one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of his time, and yet asks and receives full Wages, he then wrongs his Imployers of a <hi>Shilling:</hi> he as really defrauds him of a <hi>Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> as if he Stole it out of his Pocket. The Slothful Servant, is juſtly call'd <hi>Wicked.</hi> Mat. 25.26 So men <hi>Defraud,</hi> when they do their Work <hi>ſlightily</hi> or <hi>deceitfully:</hi> Deceitful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, is often a great Cheat. It may be a man has not half the Service he might have from <hi>Shoes, Cloaths, Tools</hi> or Inſtruments to work with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meerly from <hi>deceitfulneſs in Work<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manſhip;</hi> either in thoſe who <hi>prepar'd</hi> Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, or in thoſe who <hi>wrought</hi> them up. So
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001590_0012_0FB3DB1359B87CE8"/>if a man Builds an Houſe, and the Work be ſlightily and deceitfully done; ſo that the Houſe ſpeedily needs Repair, and is ready to tumble down, here's vaſt damage to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by ſuch deceitfulneſs. By ſuch deceitful Workmanſhip, the Buyer or Imployer often loſeth, not only the Money paid for <hi>Labour,</hi> but in a great meaſure the <hi>coſt of Materials</hi> too. But as for <hi>Ship Carpenters,</hi> if they do their Work deceitfully, they are yet more guilty; for not only the <hi>Goods</hi> but the <hi>Lives</hi> of men are hazarded, by their careleſsneſs &amp; deceit. If in Building Veſſels they do their Work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, they are in a remote ſenſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>Murder,</hi> becauſe mens Lives are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered by their wicked careleſsneſs. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe methods of Fraud and Injuſtice, are abominable. They are quite contrary to that Golden Rule, which requires us to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we would have them do to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. and contrary to, Phil. 2.4. <hi>Look not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> When any ask and take exceſſive <hi>Fees</hi> or too high <hi>Wages</hi> for their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> are <hi>Idle</hi> when they're hired for <hi>ſuch a Time,</hi> or do their work <hi>Deceitfully;</hi> then they do wrong and defraud.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>When Perſons gain by any diſhoneſt buſineſs.</hi> There are ſome practices unlawful in themſelves, by which Perſons indeavour to get Money. Thus ſome will pretend to <hi>Tell Fortunes,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001590_0013_0FB3DB14D77B0838"/>future events; and alſo by ſecret unlawful arts, to <hi>diſcover left goods,</hi> &amp;c. Now tis all <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous gain,</hi> that's gotten by ſuch wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as theſe. So if men make <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> for <hi>Idolatrous uſes,</hi> this is unlawful buſineſs, and ſo the gain gotten thereby muſt needs be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Such was the <hi>making Silver ſhrines for Diana, which brought no ſmall gain to the Crafts-men,</hi> Act. 19.24. So when <hi>Attorneys</hi> for the ſake of a <hi>Fee,</hi> will plead a cauſe which they know to be unjuſt and unrighteous, and will indeavour that it may prevail and ſucceed; ſuch their gain, is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unrighteouſly gotten. For none ſhould endeavour to promote an unrighteous thing. <hi>Abhor that which is evil, Cleave to that which is good,</hi> Rom. 12.9. Any gain gotten by buſineſs in it ſelf unlawful, is unlawful gain. Yea what's got by <hi>Gaming,</hi> is unlawful gain. Tho' ſome <hi>Games,</hi> if moderately and ſeaſonably us'd for needful Recreation, are lawful; yet tis unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to game for the getting a Man's <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Goods.</hi> This is not a giving and receiving in way of <hi>Almes;</hi> nor in way of <hi>Bounty</hi> or <hi>Generoſity;</hi> tis <hi>not commutative Juſtice,</hi> for he that receives, does not pretend to give a <hi>Valuable conſideration</hi> for what he gets. He that games for Money, deſires (and deſigns if he can) only to gain and not to loſe; and ſo tis quite contrary to that fore-mentioned, 1 Cor. 10.24. <hi>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man another's wealth.</hi> That is, every man ſhould ſeek the good and profit of his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001590_0014_0FB3DB16594C74A8"/>Neighbour, that his Neighbour may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted and proſper, as well as himſelf. He ſhould <hi>Love his Neighbour as himſelf,</hi> Mat. 22.39. Gaming for Money, directly breaks this Divine Law. Again, we ſhould <hi>Acknowledge God in all our ways,</hi> Prov. 3.6. And <hi>in every thing by Prayer make known our requeſts to him,</hi> Phil. 4.6. We ſhould not deſire nor indeavour any thing, but what we may with a good Conſcience recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to God <hi>in Prayer.</hi> But with what face can a Chriſtian Pray to God, that He would Succeed him in Gaming, and give him his Neighbour's Eſtate without his rendring a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſideration for it? Therefore to Game for Money or Goods, is a curſed practice; a defrauding unrighteous Method of gain. Prov. 13.11. <hi>Wealth gotten by vanity, ſhall be diminiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>When Perſons knowingly conceal or retain for their own profit, ſtoln or loſt Goods.</hi> As tis a great Sin, directly to Steal from others; ſo tis, to abet, favour or incourage others in ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Pſal. 50.18. <hi>When thou ſaweſt a thief, then thou conſentedſt with him.</hi> Prov. 29.24. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is partner with a thief, hateth his own Soul.</hi> If for our own gain, we abet or incourage Theft in others, or conceal or retain ſtoln goods; this is defrauding, tis wicked and unjuſt. So if we have found <hi>Money, Goods, Beaſts</hi> that are <hi>Loſt</hi> or ſtray'd away; and know the <hi>Owners,</hi> and can return them, and yet retain or keep them for our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001590_0015_0FB3DB17EF47D220"/>own profit, this is unrighteous gain. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that a <hi>Stray Ox</hi> or <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſhould be return'd to the owner, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.1. And ſo of other things too. Lev. 6.4. <hi>He ſhall reſtore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the loſt thing which he found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>When Perſons receive griping oppreſſive Uſury.</hi> Uſury (or the taking ſome <hi>Reward</hi> for the <hi>Uſe</hi> of Money or Goods lent) is not in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, as <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Stealing</hi> are. Deut. 23.20. <hi>Unto a Stranger, thou mayſt lend upon Uſury.</hi> This would not be allow'd, if the thing in it ſelf were unlawful. Yet tis unrighteous gain, to receive <hi>Uſury</hi> from a <hi>Poor</hi> Neighbour (who borrows for <hi>preſent Neceſſity,</hi> and not to inrich himſelf.) Exod. 22.25. <hi>If thou lend Money to any of my People that is Poor by thee, thou ſhalt not be unto him as an Uſurer; neither ſhalt thou lay upon him Uſury.</hi> As tis Sinful to take <hi>any Uſury</hi> of a <hi>Poor</hi> man, who borrows only for preſent neceſſity; ſo tis Sinful to ask <hi>Exceſſive Uſury</hi> from any tho' never ſo able. So tis unrighteous gain, when Perſons take <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Rents</hi> for their <hi>Houſes, Ships, Lands, Farms;</hi> or for the uſe and ſervice of their <hi>Beaſts,</hi> as <hi>Horſes, Oxen,</hi> &amp;c. To receive an exceſſive price for ſuch things, is defrauding. On the other hand, tis defrauding, not to pay for the uſe (or loan) of ſuch things, what the ſame is juſtly worth and honeſtly agre'd for.</p>

9. <hi>When Perſons unfaithfully appropriate to their own uſe, what was betruſted with them for the uſe and benefit of others.</hi> If Money or Goods are left with a friend to keep, and by him to be reſtor'd upon demand; if the Perſon thus betruſted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates theſe things to his own uſe, he then does wrong and defrauds, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.2, 3.

Jam. 5.4. <hi>Behold, the hire of the Labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cryeth: and the cryes of them which have reaped, are entred into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</hi> Jer. 22.13. <hi>Wo unto him that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong: that uſeth his neighbour's Service without wages, and giveth him not for his work.</hi> God himſelf pronounceth a <hi>Wo</hi> againſt thoſe, who wont pay juſt Wages. Honeſt Wages for work done, ſhould be readily paid; tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, tis abominable fraud to with-hold the ſame. Yea, when a man has done a piece of work, brings in a fair honeſt Account, makes but juſt demands for his work; I ſay in ſuch a caſe, to <hi>curtail his Bill,</hi> beat him down, and pay him but part of his honeſt demands, is vile
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001590_0019_0FB3DB1DD86BA1F8"/>fraud and injuſtice. God threatens to be, a <hi>Swift witneſs againſt thoſe, that oppreſs the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his wages,</hi> Mal. 3.5. Nay tis fraud and injuſtice, willingly to <hi>defer</hi> the <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> payment of wages. Lev. 19.13. <hi>The wages of him that is hired, ſhall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</hi> Very often, the poor Labourer really <hi>Needs</hi> his <hi>Wages,</hi> as ſoon as his work is done; therefore it ſhould be <hi>preſently</hi> paid him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Labourer agrees to wait ſuch a time for his wages, tis no injuſtice ſo long to defer payment; but if no time be ſet, then as ſoon as the work is done and the wages ask'd for, they ſhould be preſently and honeſtly paid. We ſhould not only pay <hi>Wages,</hi> or pay for what we <hi>Borrow</hi> or <hi>Buy;</hi> but we ſhould pay <hi>ſeaſonably</hi> too, as ſoon as by agreement tis due. Tis the Divine Command, Rom. 13.8. <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</hi> So the Prophet ſaid to the Widow, whoſe oyl had been mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly increas'd: 2 King. 4.7. <hi>Pay thy debt.</hi> Tis ſaid, Pſal. 37.21. <hi>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again.</hi> Tis a <hi>Wicked</hi> thing, wilfully to delay paying what is due.

If they're able, tis unjuſt not to pay a juſt debt when demanded, tho' by the <hi>meaneſt Labourer,</hi> (he does but ask for his due, his right) if they're not able to pay preſently, yet juſtice and good manners, ſhould teach them to give better words in ſuch a caſe. But, tho' <hi>Juſtice</hi> requires <hi>Debtors, ſeaſonably</hi> to pay what they owe if poſſibly they can; yet on the other hand, <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> may often <hi>require Creditors,</hi> patiently to <hi>bear a while</hi> with their <hi>Debtors,</hi> and not rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly exact upon them when they find them <hi>honeſtly diſpos'd.</hi> A <hi>Debtor</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Have Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with me and I will pay thee all;</hi> his cruel <hi>Creditor</hi> laid hands on him, <hi>took him by the threat, caſt him into Priſon till he ſhould pay the debt;</hi> but our Lord's Parable calls this <hi>Creditor,</hi> a <hi>Wicked</hi> Servant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.28.—32.</p>

11. <hi>When Perſons for the ſake of a Bribe, Gift, or Private Gain, will ſpeak or do unjuſt things.</hi> Thus, thoſe do wrong and are unjuſt, who for the ſake of ſome Private Reward, will <hi>Bear Falſe Witneſs</hi> in any Caſe; as thoſe <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> did, who were ſet to Guard our Lord's Sepulchre, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.12—15. When for the ſake of ſome Private Gain, (or out of Favour to one, or III Will to another) <hi>Jury-men</hi> will bring in an <hi>Unrighteous Verdict, Judges</hi> pronounce an <hi>Unrighteous Sentence,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrators</hi> give in an <hi>Unrighteous Award;</hi> I ſay, when tis thus, there's vile fraud and doing of wrong. So when men <hi>Impreſs'd</hi> to Serve the Publick by <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> are for the ſake of ſome <hi>Private Gain to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, Sold</hi> or <hi>Set free</hi> from Serving the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; this is Fraudulent and Unjuſt: Gain ſo gotten, is Unrighteous Gain. When thoſe in Authority or Office in one Station or other, will for the ſake of <hi>Private Gain,</hi> do thoſe things that are <hi>Unjuſt,</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> to do what their Place or Office does <hi>Oblige</hi> them to do; this is doing Wrong and Defrauding. When any for the ſake of Private Gain, refuſe to give Teſtimony in a Caſe, where Juſtice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it for the Right Deciſion of a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, or for the juſt puniſhing of a Criminal; this is doing Wrong, and Defrauding. When for the ſake of Private Gain, <hi>Well-qualified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> are kept out of Places of <hi>Truſt and Profit,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001590_0022_0FB3DB2255E85E30"/>and <hi>Unqualified Perſons</hi> brought in; this is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjuſtly and fraudulently. The doing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt things, for the ſake of a Bribe, Gift or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain; is plainly forbidden by God, and abominable in his ſight. Deut. 16.19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not wreſt Judgment, thou ſhalt not reſpect Perſons, neither take a Gift; for a Gift doth blind the eyes of the Wiſe, and pervert the words of the Righteous.</hi> Amos 5.12. <hi>They afflict the Juſt, they take a Bribe, and they turn aſide the Poor in the gate from their Right.</hi> Thoſe who are wedded to Bribes and Gifts, ſcarce care how much Injuſtice they do, if they can but promote their own Gain. But all ſuch <hi>Gain</hi> will prove <hi>Loſs</hi> at laſt, if true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance prevent not. Job 15.34. A <hi>Fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of Bribery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>When Perſons are falſe to their Word, their Engagements, and break their juſt Promiſes.</hi> We ſhould never ſpeak falſely in any Caſe, yet Juſtice and Equity do not require, that we ſhould ſpeak the whole truth in every Caſe We may be queſtion'd in ſome Caſes, wherein Equity does not require our diſcovering the whole matter, there's no (falſehood, nor) Injuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice to any one in concealing part.

But now in matters of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between men and men, Juſtice requires that they ſhould ſpeak their minds plainly. They ſhould not ſpeak contrary to what they deſign, nor promiſe contrary to their Abilities or Intentions. They ſhould not promiſe to do ſuch a piece of Work, or pay ſuch a Debt, by ſuch or ſuch a time; unleſs they have a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal proſpect of being <hi>able</hi> to do it, and do <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſign</hi> if able to do it. If Perſons promiſe what they know they can't perform, or what they dont deſign to perform; they do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they Lie in ſuch Promiſes, for they deſign thereby to deceive others, contrary to Juſtice and Equity. By mens thus breaking their Word and Promiſes, they often defraud and wrong others very much. If a man has not his Work done for him, or his Money paid to him, according to the time promiſed; it may (and often does) prove a great damage to him. It may poſſibly hurt him as much, as the thing promiſed is worth; nay, the failing of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, may ſometimes hurt him more than the thing promiſed in it ſelf is worth. Poſſibly upon a firm Promiſe made to a man, that ſuch Work ſhall be done for him, or ſuch a Debt paid to him, by ſuch or ſuch a time; he may accordingly make Promiſes and Engagements
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001590_0024_0FB3DB255842D890"/>to others, which he wont be able to perform, if the former Promiſes made to him be not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And thus many Perſons may be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wronged, kept out of their juſt Dues, and greatly Injur'd, and that through one man's <hi>falſneſs to his word,</hi> and breaking his juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. It muſt needs be a vaſt damage &amp; wrong in Dealing, when men are ſo falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful in their words, that there's no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, no dependance on what they ſay. It may be Perſons have had <hi>Accompts</hi> a long time depending between them, one earneſtly deſires and urges to have Accompts made up, that he may know what he has to Pay or Receive, that he may know how his Affairs ſtand, and order them accordingly; but the other, though he promiſe at ſuch a time, &amp; at ſuch a time to make up Accompts, yet he <hi>Whiffles, Shuffles, Delayes,</hi> and wont do what he has ſo often promiſed; thus to do, is vile, baſe and wicked, tis unjuſt and unrighteous. Perſons are often much wronged and defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their Intereſt, for want of having Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts made up, and Matters well adjuſted. Whatever men think of it, tis vile Fraud, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, Wickedneſs, thus to break their Word and Juſt Promiſes; and ſo to carry themſelves that there's no truſt to what they ſay. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Heathen,</hi> would abominate ſuch Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. And when <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thoſe who make the highteſt Profeſſion (<hi>Communicants</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001590_0025_0FB3DB26D74E7610"/>at the Lords Table) are thus guilty, tis the <hi>greater Scandal:</hi> when they thus <hi>deceive,</hi> by their good words and fair promiſes, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit their Profeſſion, break Gods Law, and highly provoke him. Eph. 4.25. <hi>Putting away Lying, ſpeak every man truth with his Neighbour.</hi> Lev. 19.11. <hi>Ye ſhall not Steal, neither deal falſly, neither lie one to another.</hi> When men will uſe <hi>falſe lying words</hi> or Promiſes in their Dealing; this is a ſort of <hi>Stealing;</hi> it may in ſome ſenſe be called <hi>Theft.</hi> Many among the Jews of old, were thus guilty. Jer. 9.5. <hi>They will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every one his Neighbour, they will not ſpeak the truth; they have taught their tongue to ſpeak lies, and weary themſelves to commit Iniquity.</hi> Mic. 6.12. <hi>The Inhabitants thereof have ſpoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle mentions it on purpoſe, as a plain <hi>proof</hi> of mens <hi>Corruption,</hi> their wickedneſs. Rom. 3.13. <hi>With their tongues they have uſed deceit.</hi> Whereas tis part of the Good mans Character, Pſal. 15.2. <hi>He ſpeaketh the truth in his heart.</hi> And thus men muſt ſpeak the truth, if they would have their <hi>Converſation in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,</hi> as they ſhould, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould not dare, to deceive with good words and falſe promiſes, as too many often do: tis a great ſhame, a crying ſcandal, that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians make no more Conſcience of keeping their word, and fulfilling their juſt promiſes, than they do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:001590_0026_0FB3DB28577D13A8"/>
Thus I have ſhew'd ſome Inſtances, wherein Perſons may be ſaid to be guilty of defrauding and doing wrong. And ſuch defrauding is a great Sin, it expoſeth to the Divine Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Rom. 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>The Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By way of USE, I'll ſay two Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>So far as any have defrauded and done wrong, they ought to Repent of it.</hi> When we hear any Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Inculcated in Preaching, we ſhould Examine, <hi>Have we done this Duty?</hi> So when we hear any Sin laid open and condemned, we ſhould Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, <hi>Have we been guilty of this?</hi> And when upon Inquiry we find our ſelves faulty, we ſhould repent. Lam. 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> Nay, if we have defrauded any, we ſhould if poſſible make <hi>Reparation</hi> to the Injured, as well as <hi>Repent</hi> of our Sin. Penitent <hi>Zacheus</hi> did ſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.8. True <hi>Repentance</hi> will bring forth agreeable <hi>fruits;</hi> we do not truly Repent of our having wrong'd any one, unleſs we do what we can to right him again. <hi>He ſhall reſtore that which he took vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully, gotten,</hi> Lev. 6.4.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001590_0027_0FB3DB29D737E4B8"/>
2. <hi>Let us take great care, that we dont wrong or defraud any one for the future.</hi> Let us take heed, that we dont wrong any one by Cheating, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting, by unreaſonably neglecting to pay our Debts, by fair words and falſe promiſes, by neglecting to make up Accompts, or adjuſt Matters depending, or indeed by any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod whatſoever. And that we may not wrong or defraud any in his Eſtate, let theſe Directions be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us Mortifie our Coveteouſneſs.</hi> Coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or exceſſive Love to the World, puts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on many methods of unrighteouſneſs. 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. <hi>They that will be Rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and burtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> Since love to the World is ſo great a Sin, ſo dangerous a ſnare, it ſhould be carefully ſubdued. <hi>Mortifie therefore your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are upon the earth, Fornication, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inordinate Affection, evil Concupiſcence, and <hi>Coveteouſneſs,</hi> which is Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us Mortifie our Pride. Pride,</hi> did put the unjuſt Steward on <hi>Deceitful methods</hi> to advantage himſelf; for he was <hi>Aſham'd</hi> to beg, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.3 4. Some are ſo Proud, that they're <hi>Aſham'd</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001590_0028_0FB3DB2B57624460"/>to beg, or to do this or the other <hi>mean Service</hi> for an <hi>honeſt Support;</hi> but are <hi>not Aſham'd</hi> to <hi>Lie, Steal, Cheat,</hi> break their Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pride, puts many on unjuſt practices. Some are ſo Proud, they think they muſt live ſo as to make ſome figure and ſhow, muſt live in ſuch or ſuch ſtate or faſhion; muſt have fine Houſes well finiſh'd and adorn'd, muſt be richly cloath'd, and muſt be anſwerable thereto in their houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and entertainments; thus they deſire to live, tho' their Eſtates and Buſineſs can't ſupport ſuch an <hi>Expens;ive-way</hi> of living: and this puts them upon unrighteous methods, to ſupport the figure they would appear in. It may be they often break their juſt Promiſes, they can't pay their juſt debts, are angry if ſo much as ask'd to pay what they owe; Poſſibly they live high, when tis really on the Eſtates and at the charge of others. Let us ſubdue ſuch Pride, if we would be juſt. <hi>Having food and raiment, let us be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us avoid Intemperance, vain Company, and Idleneſs.</hi> Theſe Sins tend to <hi>Poverty,</hi> and that brings temptations to unrighteouſneſs. <hi>Leſt I be Poor and Steal,</hi> Prov. 30.9. <hi>Idleneſs</hi> it ſelf, (if Intemperance and vain Company are avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) tends to <hi>Poverty,</hi> and ſo to make men take unjuſt courſes. When men are lazy and idle, will do little or no buſineſs; how can they pay their debts, or get a Maintainance for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001590_0029_0FB3DB2CD8264428"/>and Families? They're in danger of being <hi>Worſe than Infidels,</hi> by <hi>not providing for thoſe of their own Houſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8. Tis a <hi>Scandalous Sin</hi> for Chriſtians to <hi>Live in Idleneſs.</hi> Tis directly contrary to the expreſs command of God: 1 Theſ. 4.11, 12. <hi>Study to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs, and to work with your hands as we commanded you; that ye may walk honeſtly towards them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</hi> Thoſe who live <hi>Idly,</hi> are not likely to live <hi>Honeſtly.</hi> Eph. 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more, but rather let him labour working with his bands the thing that is good.</hi> He that wont work, is in danger of <hi>Stealing,</hi> or if he does not come directly and ſpeedily to that Sin; yet poſſibly he breaks his Promiſes, lyes long in debt to the great wrong and hurt of his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and herein he acts wickedly and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly. 2 Theſ. 3.10, 11.—<hi>This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat. For we hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly, working not at all, but are buiſy-bodies.</hi> Thoſe who <hi>dont work,</hi> they <hi>walk diſorderly;</hi> and very often are <hi>buiſy-bodies,</hi> troubleſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Perſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us realize God's Eye on us, and the Future Judgment.</hi> If we duly conſider'd, that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſees us, and will call us to an Account for what we do, this would ſtrengthen us much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ill practices. Gen. 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001590_0030_0FB3DB2E56BFC6B8"/>great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi> Heb. 4.13. <hi>Neither is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are open and naked to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi> With whom we have to do, that is, <hi>to whom we muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi> Let us therefore conſider, that we muſt give an account to God for all our actions, this will tend much to prevent Fraud and Injuſtice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Let us highly prize and hunger after Spiritual Treaſures.</hi> The more theſe are valued &amp; ſought for by men, the leſs danger they'll be in of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding any in their Worldly Goods. Nay, if need be, they'll gladly <hi>ſuffer the loſs</hi> of their own Goods, when they <hi>know they have in Heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance,</hi> Heb. 10.34. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wronging others of their Worldly Goods or Eſtate; they'll rather ſay to God as, Pſal. 73.25, 26. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none on earth that I deſire beſides thee. My fleſh and my heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
