            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Soul of Man is by far the greateſt and moſt glorious Piece of divine Workmanſhip, of all the Creatures on this lower Creation. And therefore it was the more meet that, however ſecond Cauſes ſhould be improved in the Production of meaner Creatures; yet this, which is the chief and moſt noble of all, and the Crown and End of all the reſt, ſhould be reſerved to be the more immediate Work of God's own Hands, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his Power, and to be communicated directly from him, without the Intervention of Inſtruments, or honouring ſecond Cauſes ſo much as to improve them in bringing to paſs ſo noble an Effect.—'Tis obſervable that even in the firſt Creation of Man, when his Body was formed immediately by God, not in a Courſe of Nature, or in the Way of natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation; yet the Soul is repreſented as being in a higher, more direct and immediate Manner from God, and ſo communicated that God did therein as it were communicate ſomething of himſelf: <hi>The Lord God formed Man</hi> (i. e. his Body) <hi>of the Duſt of the Ground,</hi> (a mean and vile Original) <hi>and breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life;</hi> (whereby ſomething was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from an infinitely higher Source, even God's own living Spirit or divine vital Fullneſs) <hi>and</hi> ſo <hi>Man became a living Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Souls of Men being thus in a ſpecial Manner from God, God is repreſented as having a ſpecial Propriety in them, Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>Behold all Souls are mine: As the Soul of the Father, ſo alſo the Soul of the Son is mine.</hi>

And as the Souls of Men are more directly from God, by the more ſpecial and immediate Exerciſe of his divine Power as a Creator, and are what he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges as his by a ſpecial Propriety, and are the moſt noble Part of the lower Creation, and are infinitely diſtinguiſhed from all other Creatures here below in that they are immortal Beings; ſo they are, above all other Creatures which God hath made in this World, the Subjects of God's Care and ſpecial Providence.</p>
            <p>Divines are won't to diſtinguiſh between God's common and ſpecial Providence.

His ſpecial Providence is that which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes towards his intelligent rational Creatures, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents; of which Sort are Mankind alone, of all the innumerable Kinds of Creatures in this lower World: And in a ſpecial Manner the Souls of Men; for in them only is immediately ſeated Reaſon and Intelligence, and a Capacity of moral Agency; and therefore they in a peculiar Manner are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of God's ſpecial Providence that he exerciſes in this lower World. And 'tis be to obſerved that God's common Providence is ſubordinated to his ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and all Things in this World are govern'd and diſpoſed of in Subordination to the great Ends God has to obtain with Reſpect to the Souls of Men. And it is further to be obſerved that as the Creation of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005172_0010_1016CF0800C55B70"/>
the World was committed to the Son of God by, the Father, ſo is the Government of it; and in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Manner the Affairs of God's ſpecial Providence, are left in his Hands; and ſo the Souls of Men, that are the peculiar Subjects of this ſpecial Providence are committed to his Care; and more eſpecially ſuch Souls as are of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom or Church, which is often in Scripture repreſented as the Field and Vineyard that he is the Owner of and has taken the Care of.—And what Chriſt's Value is for Mens Souls appears by what he has done and ſuffered for them.</p>
            <p>But theſe Souls that Chriſt has made, and that are committed into his Hands of the Father, and that are ſo precious in his Account, he commits to the Care of Miniſters. There is a certain Order of Men that are ſo dignified and honoured by him, as to have ſo great a Truſt repoſed in them. He as it were brings thoſe Souls as an infinitely precious Treaſure, and commits 'em to them to take Care of; as a Prince commits his Treaſure, his Jewels, and moſt precious Things into the Hands of one of the dignified Servants of his Houſhold; or as the Father of a Family, when he goes a Journey into a far Country, leaves his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to the Care of a Steward.</p>
            <p>I come now in the</p>
            <p>IId Place, to enquire <hi>to what Purpoſe Chriſt commits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Souls of Men to the Care of Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005172_0011_1016CF0AC1548F98"/>
I anſwer in two Things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He commits Mens Souls to Miniſters to keep and take Care of them for him, that by their Means they may anſwer their End in glorifying him. God has made all Things for himſelf, he has created them for his Glory; but more eſpecially thoſe Creatures that he has endued with Underſtanding, as he has done the Souls of Men: It is by them that God has his Glory from all his Creatures, as they are the Eye of the Creation to behold the Glory of God manifeſted in the other Creatures, and the Mouth of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to praiſe him and aſcribe to him the Glory that is diſplayed in them. The other Creatures glorify God paſſively and eventually, as God glorifies himſelf in them, as they are the Subjects of the Exerciſe of his Power and Wiſdom in their Creation and Preſervation, and in thoſe Events that are brought to paſs in his Diſpoſal of them. Thus God glorifies himſelf in his Works that are manifeſt in the irrational and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Creation, in the View of his rational Creatures that he has made capable of beholding and admiring them, and adoring, loving and praiſing him for them: But they only are capable of glorifying him actively and immediately; therefore all the other Creatures do as it were bring their Tribute of Glory to them, thro' their Hands, to be offered to their Creator. And therefore the Souls of Men are Beings that, with Regard to the Glory of God the great End of all Things, are of immenſely greater Importance than all other Creatures in this lower World. But theſe, with Reſpect to this their great End, are committed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005172_0012_1016CF0D3B1774E8"/>
to the Care and Keeping of Miniſters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt has furniſhed them with proper Means to bring them to this End: He has given 'em all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtructions; they have a perfect Rule and Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to guide them in this great Affair; and has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd them the Duties they are to perform in their Office in every particular, and the Manner in which they are to perform theſe Duties, in the Charge which he has left them; and has furniſhed them with all needful Helps for the Inſtruction of thoſe Souls that are committed to them, to lead 'em to anſwer their great End, in duely glorifying their Creator, and all proper Means for the exciting and engaging them to attend to, and follow thoſe Inſtructions, as alſo Means for their Help and Aſſiſtance in it, that they may do it the more eaſily and effectually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are committed to their Care and Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may not be eternally loſt, but may have everlaſting Life. Theſe Souls, as I obſerved before, are immortal and made for Eternity; and they are ſet in this World between two oppoſite eternal States, the one a State of exceeding and eternal Glory and Bleſſedneſs, the other a State of unutterable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Miſery: And as they are by Nature they are liable to either; by their original Guilt and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are expoſed to periſh forever, in total and perfect Deſtruction and Miſery: But Chriſt, from his Knowledge of the infinite Worth of Souls, and his great Compaſſion and Love to 'em, has, by his own precious Blood, made Way for their Eſcape, and at
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005172_0013_1016CF0FA34A64B0"/>
this infinite Expence, has procured unſpeakable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation and perfect Bleſſedneſs for them in Heaven to all Eternity; which by this Means they have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to obtain. But yet it remains uncertain what will become of them, 'till Chriſt's Redemption be applied to them, or they are actually caſt into Hell: There is an Opportunity given, a Time of Probation, 'till the great and unalterable Event ſhall determine one Way or the other. In the mean Time there is a Space for the Uſe of Means, and the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Care, Prudence and Diligence for our own Souls and the Souls of others; that they may not fail of the Grace of God, but may eſcape that infinitely dreadful Deſtruction that they are naturally in Danger of, and may indeed obtain that infinite Priviledge of eternal Life, that is offered through the Purchaſe of Jeſus Chriſt. And now in this grand Affair, and to this great Purpoſe of an Eſcape from eternal Miſery, and the obtaining everlaſting Glory, Chriſt has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the precious Souls of Men to the Care of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; that by their Means they may have the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Redemption, and might obtain that which he has ſuffered ſo much to procure. Chriſt knew that notwithſtanding all that he had done to procure Life for Souls, they would need much Care to be taken of them, and many Means to be uſed with them, in order to their being indeed preſerved from eternally periſhing, and actually brought to the Poſſeſſion of Life: And therefore he has appointed a certain Order of Men, whoſe whole Buſineſs it might be to take Care of immortal Souls; and into their Hands has
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005172_0014_1016CF120ADD6328"/>
committed theſe Souls, and has betruſted them with the Ordinances of his Houſe, and Means that he has provided for their Salvation; that nothing might be wanting that they need for their Furniture for this great Buſineſs; he has as it were committed to them his Goods, and has given them in ſome Reſpects the Keys of his Stores and Treaſury; to them are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God and Treaſure of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. 2 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels.</hi> And Chap. 5. 18, 19. <hi>And all Things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt; and hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed to us the Word of Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Word of God, ſo the Sacraments that he has appointed, and the Diſcipline of his Houſe, he has committed to them, to be adminiſtred by them; and has ſubjected the Souls themſelves that they have the Care of to them, as far as is neceſſary to put them under the greateſt Advantage effectually to care for their Salvation, and has left a Charge to their People to obey them and ſubmit themſelves, as in the Verſe of my Text.</p>
            <p>I now proceed</p>
            <p>III. To obſerve, <hi>that the Way in which he who has committed Souls to Miniſters, expects they ſhould ſeek that theſe Purpoſes may be obtained with Reſpect to them, is by watching for them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005172_0015_1016CF1482F727C0"/>
Tho' great Things have been done by Chriſt to make Way for the Salvation of thoſe precious Souls, and altho' Chriſt has furniſhed Miniſters with all proper Means to keep them; yet they are in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this World, that there is Need of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of great Watchfulneſs, and the utmoſt Care and Diligence, in thoſe that have the Care of them, to prevent their being loſt: for they are in the Midſt of Snares, and encompaſs'd round with Dangers on every Side; they are in the Enemies Country, where there are Multitudes every where that are ſtrong and ſubtil and exceeding Blood-thirſty and cruel, that are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably, Day and Night, ſeeking the Deſtruction of theſe Souls.</p>
            <p>If a Prince ſhould commit ſome great Treaſure, conſiſting of moſt precious Jewels, to the Care of a Subject, to keep for him, and carry thro' an Enemy's Country, and bring home ſafe to his Palace, and knew that the Enemies by the Way would be ſenſible that the Treaſure was committed to him, and would be aware of the great Value of it, and therefore would be exceeding greedy of it, and inceſſant in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to get it from him; would not the Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that he, with whom he had entruſted this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhould uſe great Care in keeping it? Would he be eſteemed faithful to his Truſt, in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Care of ſo great a Treaſure, and in ſuch Circumſtances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping up a continual Watch?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005172_0016_1016CF16FB6AD0C0"/>
They that have the Care of a City in Time of War, and eſpecially at a Time when the City is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by Enemies that lay Siege to it, are wont, if faithful, to maintain inceſſant Vigilance to defend it: The Watchmen of the City in ſuch a Caſe had need to watch ſtrictly, for they have the Care of the Lives of Men.—Miniſters are from Time to Time repreſented in Scripture as the Watchmen that have the Care of the City of God; as <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 3. &amp; 5. 7. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52. 8. and 62. 6. and in other Places. Theſe Watchmen han't only the Care of the Lives of Mens Bodies, but of their Souls, which are infinitely more precious. 'Tis expected of them that they ſhould behave themſelves as thoſe that both kept and built the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah'</hi>s Time, while they were continually obſerved by malicious and ſubtil Enemies, that diligently ſought by all Means to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent them, and to deſtroy the City and People; who with one Hand wrought in the Work, and with the other Hand held a Weapon; holding Spears from the riſing of the Morning 'till the Stars appeared; and had a Trumpet always at Hand to ſound, to give Warning of any appearing Danger, and did not put off their Clothes, nor lay up their Weapons, Day nor Night, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. from the 16 Verſe to the End.</p>
            <p>Miniſters are appointed to be Shepherds over Chriſt's Flock; and he commits his Flock to their Care to keep 'em and lead 'em thro' a great and howling Wilderneſs, full of hungry Wolves and roaring Lions: And is there not need of a ſtrict and conſtant Watch
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005172_0017_1016BACB12EECD40"/>
in the Shepherds in ſuch a Caſe, as they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Lives of the Sheep, and lead 'em to the Land of their Reſt?</p>
            <p>I come now to the</p>
            <p>IVth and laſt Thing in the doctrinal Handling of the Text, <hi>viz. That Miniſters hereafter muſt give Account to him that committed Men's precious Souls to their Care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt's committing Souls to Miniſter's Care and Charge, and betruſting them with them as Servants or Stewards, neceſſarily ſuppoſes them to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Maſter with Reſpect to the Charge committed to them.</p>
            <p>He that has a Treaſure committed to him by the Owner, and takes the Care and Charge of it, not as his own Poſſeſſion, but only to improve or keep for an appointed Time, for him to whom the proper Poſſeſſion belongs, muſt return that Treaſure to the Owner when his Time is out, and is accountable to him how he has fulfilled that which he undertook; and if any precious Jewel be miſſing, he muſt give an Account of it.—So muſt Miniſters give an Account of the Souls committed to their Care.</p>
            <p>The Office and Work of Miniſters is not to laſt always; their Care of Souls is but for a limited Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and when that is expired, they muſt return to their Maſter to give an Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005172_0018_1016CF1BCB5AF798"/>
After what Manner they muſt be called to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, may be ſhewn in theſe two Things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Event of Things with Regard to the Souls committed to them will be enquired into. As there are ſo many precious Souls committed to their Care by Chriſt, ſo hereafter it will be enquired what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thoſe Souls. As if a Perſon has a Number of precious Jewels committed to him to keep; when the Time of his Betruſtment is out, and he comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the intruſted Treaſure, the State of it will be examined, that it may be ſeen whether any Jewel be lacking or not; and if any be miſſing, an Account muſt be given what is become of it. The Charge of a Miniſter is in Scripture repreſented by that of a Steward, to whom the Houſholder, when going into a far Country, commits his Goods, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, expects that the Steward ſhould give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Stewardſhip. In ſuch a Caſe the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder looks into the State of his Goods that he left behind under the Steward's Care. The Maſter in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 14, &amp;c. when he returns from his Journey, has his Goods, that he committed to the Care of his Servants, brought forth and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be enquired how far the Event that ſhall be found, with Regard to Souls committed to them, was owning to their Faithfulneſs or Unfaithfulneſs in that Care and Watch that was appointed them. If any precious Soul be found lacking, it will be enquired how this comes to paſs; they muſt give an Account
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005172_0019_1016CF1F19C10C50"/>
what they have done with this and that Soul that is miſſing, whether they were loſt thro' their Neglect or no: they muſt give an Account what Care they have taken, and what Diligence they have uſed, and whether or no they can waſh their Hands from Guilt with Reſpect to them: it ſhall be examined by an Eye that is as a Flame of Fire, whether the Blood of the Souls that are loſt is not indeed to be found in their Skirts.—We find in the Parable of the great Supper, that the Servants that are ſent out to invite Gueſts, return from Time to Time to their Maſter to give him an Account both of the Event in their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with Reſpect to ſome that they were ſent to, and Unſucceſsfulneſs with Regard to others; and alſo of their own Doings and Faithfulneſs, whereby they are clear of the Guilt of their Unſucceſsfulneſs, and are commended to the gracious Reward of their Succeſs. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 20, 21. I now come to the</p>

               <p>I. I would apply my ſelf to you, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> to whoſe Care the great Redeemer and Head of the Church is this Day committing a Number of precious Souls in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005172_0020_1016CF20AC198148"/>
this Place. I beſeech you now to ſuffer the Word of Exhortation on this ſolemn Occaſion: Suffer me to put you in Mind how great the Perſon is, with whom you are immediately and chiefly concerned in the Affair of this Day; even the great Shepherd of the Sheep, and glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is to be your and our Judge. You preſent your ſelf this Day before him to receive at his Hands a ſacred <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> a great Treaſure, a Number of Souls that are to exiſt throughout all Eternity, each one of which is infinitely more precious than all the precious Gems that the Earth affords. And I beſeech you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to how great a Purpoſe he is about to commit them to your Care and Keeping; it is that they, by Means of your faithful Care and Watchfulneſs, may be ſaved with an everlaſting Salvation. You may judge how much Chriſt will inſiſt upon it that you ſhou'd exerciſe great Diligence and Strictneſs in the Care you take of them, by the Value he himſelf has manifeſted of the Souls of Men, by what he has done and ſuffered for them: he has ſhewn how precious he has judged immortal Souls to be, in that he, tho' a Perſon of infinite Glory, did not think his own Blood, his Life, his Soul, too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to be offered up as a Price for them to redeem them, that they might obtain that Salvation in order to which he now is about to commit a Number of them to your Care, and to betruſt you with the Means that he has provided for that End; committing to you his holy Oracles, and the Food of his Houſe, which is his own Body and Blood, that therewith you might feed theſe Souls; and in ſome Senſe committing to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005172_0021_1016CF2308576BF8"/>
you the Keys of his Stores and Treaſures, that you might ſupply and enrich them, and be a Means of their eternal Wealth and Glory.</p>
               <p>Conſider, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> how great an Honour he does you whom God the Father hath made Head of the whole Univerſe, and Lord of all Things to the Church; that after he has provided for the Salvation of Souls by his dying Pains and precious Blood, and the Father has committed to him all Power in Heaven and Earth, that he might actually beſtow eternal Life on them that he died for; he ſhould call you to be a Co-worker with him, and ſhould commit precious Souls to your Care, that you might be the Inſtrument of bringing them home to him, and bringing that to paſs with Reſpect to them, for which his Soul travailed in the Agonies of Death, and in ineffable Conflicts with the dreadful Wrath of God. You are now about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the precious Treaſure at his Hands, which you are to keep for him: you preſent your ſelf here before the Lord for this End, that you may as it were reach forth your Hand and take this great <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> with ſolemn Vow diligently and faithfully to keep it, and devote your ſelf to that Service; ſo that if it be poſſible for you to prevent it, no one of thoſe infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewels may be loſt, but that you may return them all ſafe to him from whoſe Hands you receive them.</p>
               <p>Conſider the Example of your glorious Lord and Maſter: There was a Number of the Souls of Men
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005172_0022_1016CF25B2538B80"/>
committed by the Father into his Hands, that he might take Care for their Salvation: And after what Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did he execute his Office? How did he lay out himſelf for the Salvation of thoſe Souls? What great Things did he do? And what great Things did he ſuffer? How hard was the Labour he went thro'? And how greatly did he deny himſelf? How did this great Shepherd of the Sheep behave himſelf when he ſaw the Wolf coming to deſtroy the Sheep? He did not flee to ſave his own Life, and ſo leave the Sheep to become a Prey; but from Pity and Love to the Sheep, interpoſed himſelf between them and their Enemy, ſtood between them and Harm, and encounter'd the Wolf, and in the Conflict gave his own Life to ſave their's, <hi>John</hi> 10. 11,—15.—We read of Chriſt's travailing for Souls, Iſai. 53. 10, 11. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to Grief. When thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin, he ſhall ſee his Seed.</hi>—<hi>He ſhall ſee of</hi> the Travail of his Soul, <hi>and ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> And how did he Travail for this Seed of his? Look into the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> and there behold him lying on the Earth, with his Body covered over with clotted Blood, falling down in Lumps to the Ground, with his Soul exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful even unto Death, and offering up ſtrong Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Tears together with his Blood: and look to the Croſs, where he endured yet far more extreme Agonies, and drank up the bitter Cup of God's Wrath, and ſhed the Remainder of his Blood, lingeringly drain'd out thro' his tortur'd Hands and Feet, and extravaſated out of his broken Heart into his Bowels,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005172_0023_1016CF292A4D77C0"/>
and there turned into Blood and Water, thro' the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Fermentation occaſion'd by the Weight of Grief and Extremity of Agony of Soul, under which he cried out with that loud and lamentable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Cry. Thus he travailed in Birth with his Seed; thus he laboured and ſuffered for the Salvation of thoſe Souls that the Father had committed to him. This is the Example of the great Shepherd. And tho' it is not required of Under-Shepherds that they ſhould endure Sufferings of ſuch a Degree or Nature; for Chriſt has ſuffered them to that End, that both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People might eſcape them; yet ſurely he expects that, as they would approve themſelves as his Diſciples and Followers and Co-workers with him in ſeeking the Salvation of the ſame Souls, they ſhould not be backward to go thro' any Labours or Sufferings which may be requiſite in them, in order to their moſt effectually promoting the great End of his Sufferings, with Regard to the Souls that he has committed to them.</p>
               <p>And as you, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> are to ſtand in Chriſt's Stead towards this People, and to act as his Ambaſſador; ſhould you not ſhow the like Spirit, the like Love to Souls, and imitate him in his Readineſs to labour and deny your ſelf and ſuffer, yea to ſpend and be ſpent for them? Like the bleſſed Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
               <p>The Caſe with you, <hi>Sir,</hi> is as if the Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that was a great Prince, with a Number of Children in a ſtrange Land, when going home to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005172_0024_1016CF2B236E1D38"/>
a Kingdom, ſhould leave his Children behind him, and commit them to the Care of a Servant, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conduct them thro' a dangerous Wilderneſs, and bring 'em home to him; in which Caſe, he has their Health and Lives committed to his Care, as well as their future Glory in his Kingdom. With what Care and Watchfulneſs would it be expected of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that he ſhould execute his Office in ſuch a Caſe! And ſurely if he fails of being thoroughly careful and watchful, after he has taken upon him ſo great a Charge, and any ſad Diſaſter ſhould be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Unfaithfulneſs; it will moſt juſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him that he ſhould anſwer it, and he will inexcuſably fall under his Maſter's heavieſt Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>And ſuffer me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to put you in Mind of the Account you muſt give to your Maſter of theſe Souls he ſeems this Day to be about to commit to you: You are to watch for theſe Souls as one that muſt give Account. If any one of theſe Souls ſhould be miſſing hereafter, having been loſt under your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, it will be demanded of you another Day, by your great Lord, <q>What is become of ſuch a Soul?

               <p>II. I would apply my ſelf to thoſe whoſe Souls are now about to be committed to the Care of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt that is now to be ordained to the paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Office in this Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved Brethren, and dear Children,</hi> 'Tis your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls that is the precious Treaſure that the great Creator and Saviour of Souls ſeems now to be about to commit to the Care of him whom you have choſen to be your Paſtor. And indeed it is a great Charge, an high Betruſtment; and he ought to uſe his utmoſt Care and Diligence that you may not be eternally loſt: But if your Paſtor ſhould exerciſe ſuch Care that you may be ſaved, ſurely you ought to take Care for the Salvation of your own Souls: It nearly concerns him that you ſhould be ſaved; but much more nearly does it concern you. Let your Miniſter be never ſo careful and watchful, if you take no Care for your ſelves, his Faithfulneſs and Diligence will ſignify nothing, unleſs it be to harden you, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your Damnation: In ſuch a Caſe, the more Care and Pains he takes for your Salvation, the greater will your eternal Miſery be: for all will be only a Savour of Death unto Death: Thoſe People are like to ſink the deepeſt into Hell hereafter, that go to Hell from under the Care of the moſt faithful Miniſters, that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005172_0028_1016CF366F8DB4C0"/>
have taken the moſt Pains to ſave 'em from going to Hell. The Preciouſneſs of your Souls has now been made uſe of as an Argument with your choſen Paſtor to take Care for your Salvation; but much more may it be uſed as an Argument with you to ſeek your own Salvation; for therein lies the Preciouſneſs of your Souls, in their being of infinite Worth to your ſelves, appearing in the infinite Loſs you will ſuſtain if they are loſt, and your infinite Gain if they are ſaved; herein lies that Preciouſneſs of the Soul that Chriſt ſpeaks of, Matth. 16. 26. <hi>For what is a Man pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </p>
               <p>'Tis not only your Miniſter that is concerned in the Work that he is to perform among you, but you alſo are infinitely concerned in it: And it is not only he, but you alſo that are infinitely concerned in the Account that he has to give of the Diſcharge of his Office among you. You muſt all of you hereafter meet your Miniſter before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt; and if then it ſhall be found that he has been faithful, and that you have made an ill Improvement of his Miniſtry, and ſo failed of the Grace of God, the Sight of the Devil won't be ſo terrible to you at that Day as the Sight of your Miniſter; for he'll riſe up in Judgment againſt you, and your Paſtor that above all other Perſons in the World, excepting your ſelves, is concerned to endeavour your Salvation, will then above all other Perſons appear againſt you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Judge to witneſs againſt you and condemn you. But how joyful will it be to you, as well as to him, if he renders his Account with Joy, for theſe Reaſons, that he has been both faithful and ſucceſsful with Reſpect to you, and appears with you in Glory at the right Hand of Chriſt, and has to ſay to the great Judge concerning himſelf and you, <hi>Here am I, and the Children which thou haſt given me!</hi> What a joyful Meeting of Miniſter and People will there be! And how will you be each others Crown of Rejoicing! But if your Souls periſh, you will be preſent when it ſhall be required by Jeſus Chriſt of your Miniſter to give an Account of ſuch and ſuch Souls that are loſt, which were committed to his Care; and how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will it be to you, if you ſhall then hear him boldly and truly ſay before the Judge, <q>Lord, thou knoweſt that I have ſincerely and faithfully endeavoured their Salvation, I have not been ſlack or negligent towards them, I have earneſtly watched for their Souls, and diligently and unweariedly uſed all the Means with them that thou didſt appoint; they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed not thro' my Neglect, but thro' their own obſtinate Negligence and Wickedneſs!</q> In ſuch a Caſe your Miniſter will be acquitted and juſtified, but you will be condemned with a moſt aggravated Condemnation, and your Blood will be upon your own Head. Ezek. 33. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Son of Man, ſpeak to the Children of thy People, and ſay unto them, when I bring the Sword upon a Land, if the People of the Land take a Man of their Coaſts and ſet him for their Watchman, if when he ſee the Sword come upon the Land, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Trumpet and warn the People; then whoſoever heareth the Sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not Warning, if the Sword come and take him away, his Blood ſhall be upon his own Head.</hi> The good Account your Miniſter has to give of his own Faithfulneſs, will incenſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Judge towards you. Luke 14. 17. <hi>So the Servant came and ſhewed his Lord theſe Things: Then the Maſter of the Houſe being angry, ſaid to his Servant, Go out quickly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if you would have the Account your Miniſter ſhall have to give concerning you to be profitable and joyful to you, don't neglect your Duty towards him; endeavour by all Means in your Power to put him under the beſt Advantage for Serviceableneſs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs among you: Do what in you lies to encourage his Heart and ſtrengthen his Hands. This I know to be a Thing of vaſt Importance, as you would have your Paſtor a Bleſſing to you, and the ſucceſsful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the Salvation of your Souls and the Souls of your Children: Therefore ſuffer me to be a little particular with you upon this Head: I may be the more bold towards you as you hitherto have been of the Flock that Chriſt has committed to my Care, and I hope ſome of you my ſpiritual Children; therefore as my beloved Children I counſel and warn you.</p>
               <p>If you would meet your Miniſter with Comfort another Day, don't neglect doing what belongs to you comfortably to ſupport him, ſo as to enable him to attend on his great Work without Diſtraction, and to

While we are in the Body our heavenly Father knows that we have need of theſe Things, and the Way that he hath provided for Miniſters ſupply, is by their partaking of the temporal good Things of the People to whom they miniſter ſpiritual Things. 1 Cor. 9. 4, &amp;c. <hi>Have we not Power to eat and to drink?

Matth: 10. 9, 10. <hi>Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Braſs in your Purſes, nor Scrip for your Journey, neither two Coats a piece, neither Shoes, nor yet Staves; for the Workman is worthy of his Meat.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to theſe Directions he gave the <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> are the Directions he gave the <hi>Seventy,</hi> when he ſent them out.

               </p>
               <p>You ſee what great Care Chriſt has taken in this Matter, and how full and abundant the Scripture is in Commands and Directions concerning the Support of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>I know you are ſmall, and in your new Beginnings in this Place, and not ſo able as many other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: But if we may give Credit to the Word of God, for you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Prov. 3. 9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance, and with the firſt Fruits of all thine Increaſe; ſo ſhall thy Barns be filled with Plenty, and thy Preſſes ſhall burſt out with new Wine.</hi> To give to the Lord is not the Way to be poor, but the Way to be ſupplied by the Lord. Chriſt now is not perſonally, and in his human Nature, here upon Earth, to be ſupported by temporal good Things from his Diſciples, as once he was: But tho' he be now gone from hence into a far Country, yet he has not left his Diſciples without Opportunity, in this Way of ſhewing their Love to him; for there are two Sorts of Perſons that he has appointed to be his Receivers, <hi>viz.</hi> his indigent Members, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: As of old God appointed the Poor and the Levite to receive the Tythes and other Offerings that were made to the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 11, 14. and Chap. 14. 28, 29. and 26. 10, 11, 12. What is given to Miniſters is a Sacrifice to God; ſo the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents what was ſent to him for his Supply from the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 4. 18. <hi>Having received of</hi> Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus <hi>the Things which were ſent from you, an Odour of a ſweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God.</hi> And Chriſt when he ſent forth his Diſciples to preach, and had directed that they ſhould take no Proviſion for themſelves, becauſe the Labourer is worthy of his Reward, he ſays Matth. 10. 40. <hi>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that ſent me</hi>

And ſince what is given to your Paſtor is given to Chriſt, you may be aſſured that you can't conſult your own temporal, as well as ſpiritual Intereſt better, than by liberally ſupplying of him; for he that lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Lord ſhall be repay'd again with large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. And as to your Ability, if there be but a chearful, ready Mind, the greateſt Difficulty is got over; if you find this, there is no doubt but that God will make the Duty of ſupporting your Miniſter in other Reſpects eaſy to you: God loves a willing Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and a cheerful Giver; if you will do your Part in opening your Hearts and Hands, God will do his Part in finding you where-withal. But if a People grudge what they do, are always full of Fears how they ſhall pay their Rates, and exceſſively cautious leaſt they ſhould run themſelves into Difficulty, and ſtraiten themſelves and Families by giving to Chriſt, no wonder it proves difficult; 'tis the Way to meet with nothing elſe but Difficulties in their outward Circumſtances; for <hi>there is that ſcattereth, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; but to withold more than is meet, tends only to Poverty,</hi> Prov. 11. 24.</p>

Some may be ready to ſay, 'Tis no wonder Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be forward to urge ſuch a Duty as this, wherein their own temporal Intereſt is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, a coveteous Diſpoſition will make 'em love to harp upon this String.—I have not been much in inſiſting on this Duty in my own Pulpit, where it would eſpecially concern my temporal Intereſt; and bleſſed be God that I have had no more Occaſion.—But whatever any may judge of the Secrets of my Heart, with Regard to the Principles that I have been influenced by, in what I have now ſaid; it is enough for you to whom I have ſpoke it, that I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that what I have deliver'd is the Mind of God; and alſo (if there be any Truth in his Word) that what I have recommended is not only for the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſt of your Miniſter, but alſo for your own both temporal and ſpiritual Intereſt.</p>
               <p>Another Article of Advice that I would give you, is, to beware that you don't weaken your Miniſter's Hands, and wound your ſelves by Contention. You are but a ſmall People, and you'll be a very fooliſh People indeed if you are divided againſt yourſelves. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among a People hinders all Manner of Comfort and Proſperity either of Soul or Body; it makes 'em a Torment to themſelves and one another; it puts 'em every Way under Diſadvantages, and weakens the whole Body like a Conſumption.</p>
               <p>There are two Sorts of Contention I would warn you againſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Avoid Contention among your ſelves about your own temporal Affairs: This will exceedingly tend to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005172_0037_1016CF4D9C72EDB0"/>
render a Miniſter's Labours ineffectual; and it is what greatly damps the Spirit and diſcourages the Heart of a Miniſter, to ſee his People divided into Parties, and envying one another, and entertaining mutual Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, Jealouſies and Grudges, and ſo backbiting and reproaching one another, and carrying on ſecret Plots and Deſigns one againſt another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Avoid quarrelling with your Miniſter in Matters of Church Diſcipline: This is a common Thing, but a moſt unchriſtian Thing, and tends greatly to weaken the Hands of a Miniſter in the whole of his Work, and render all to no Purpoſe. The Exerciſe of the Diſcipline of God's Houſe is the moſt difficult Part of that great Work that a Miniſter has to do; and it becomes a chriſtian People to their utmoſt to ſtrengthen their Miniſter's Hands in this difficult Buſineſs, and ſay as the People ſaid to <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt, with Reſpect to the Affair of purging the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Scandal of thoſe that had married ſtrange Wives, Ezra 10. 4. <hi>Ariſe, for this Matter belongeth to thee; we alſo will be with thee: Be of good Courage and do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, If you would have your Miniſter ſucceſsful among you, and a Bleſſing to you, and if you would be a happy People, then love one another and love your Miniſter. There are ſome Profeſſors, in ſome of our Towns, that are anti-miniſterial Men; they ſeem to have a Diſpoſition to diſlike Men of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; they are apt to be prejudiced againſt them, &amp; to be ſuſpicious of them, and talk againſt them; and it ſeems to be as it were natural to 'em to be unfriendly and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005172_0038_1016CF5168BC2578"/>
unkind towards their own Miniſters, and to make Difficulty for them: But I don't believe there is a true Chriſtian on Earth that is of this Character; on the contrary the Feet of them that bring good Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and publiſh the Goſpel of Salvation are beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Eyes of all the true Children of <hi>Zion;</hi> and every one that receives Chriſt, and whoſe Heart is govern'd by a ſupream Love to him, has a Diſpoſition to receive, love and honour his Meſſengers. It was the diſtinguiſhing Mark by which God manifeſted the Perſon he had choſen to be the Wife of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that Type of Chriſt, that it was the Damſel that ſhould give kind and friendly Entertainment to <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant or Steward that was ſent to eſpouſe her and bring her home to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and therein was a Type of the Goſpel Miniſtry, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 14, &amp;c.

               </gap> Buſineſs in it; fixes you in this Place, to be a Paſtor to this Flock of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This People have, with one Voice, choſen you to the Work of the Miniſtry among them; you have accepted their Call, and devoted yourſelf to the Service

of Chriſt in the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry in this Place: We alſo are called to ſet you apart, to that ſacred Service and Office, by Prayer and the Impoſition of Hands.</p>
            <p>We therefore now ordain you a Miniſter of the Church of Chriſt, and of this Flock in particular: And in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Preſence of God, Angels and Men, we beſeech, we exhort, yea we ſolemnly charge you, to <hi>take Heed to the Miniſtry, which</hi> you now <hi>receive of the Lord Jeſus, that you fulfil it</hi>

            <p>Here we muſt deſcend to ſome Particulars, and give you in Charge the following Things,</p>
            <p>I. Take heed that you be a faithful Follower of Chriſt your ſelf, in the careful Practice of that holy Religion, in which you are to inſtruct others.</p>
            <p>Surely one who preaches the Goſpel, is under the ſtrongeſt Obligations to live according to the excellent Rules preſcribed in the Goſpel. He is under the moſt powerful and ſacred Engagements to be a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, whoſe Buſineſs it is to perſwade others to be ſo. One who leads on the Flock of Chriſt in the Ways of Religion, muſt go before them, in the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>Devote your ſelf therefore wholly to God, in a Life of practical Piety: <hi>Flee youthful Luſts</hi>

the Kingdom of God.</hi>—Mind the <hi>one Thing needful. Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Add to your Faith Vertue, to Vertue Knowledge, to Knowledge Temperance, to Temperance Patience, to Patience Godlineſs, to Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Brotherly-Kindneſs, to Brotherly-Kindneſs Charity:</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 5, 6, 7.</note> Even that <hi>Charity,</hi> which <hi>ſuffereth long, and is kind, envieth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no Evil, rejoiceth not in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but rejoiceth in the Truth, beareth</hi> (or rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth) <hi>all Things, believeth all Things, hopeth all Things, endureth all Things,</hi>

               <note n="c" place="bottom">James 3. 17.</note> Follow God as a dear Child.</p>
            <p>Hereby you will, not only be an Example to the Flock, but on other Accounts alſo, more likely to anſwer the great Ends of your Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>If you have the Knowledge of God yourſelf, you will be the more deſirous that others ſhould know him; and the better prepared to lead them into an Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him. If you have taſted the Pleaſures of Communion with God, you will be the more deſirous that others ſhould partake of thoſe Streams of Delight, and urge them with the greater Importunity to ſeek

after them. If you have had Experience of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God in your own Soul, you will be the better able to Comfort others with the ſame Comforts by which you your ſelf have been comforted of God. If you have Skill in the ſpiritual Warfare your ſelf, you will be under the better Advantage to direct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, how to uſe <hi>the Armour of Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Fail not therefore, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> of following God in a Life of ſtrict Religion.</p>
            <p>II. Take Heed that you fulfil that Part of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which conſiſts in your private Studies.</p>
            <p>Cloſe Application to Study will be needful in the Courſe of your Miniſtry, to furniſh you with thoſe Degrees of Knowledge, that may render you an able Miniſter of the New Teſtament. Give your ſelf therefore to Reading, to Meditation, <hi>that your profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting may appear unto all.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4, 13, 15.</note> And tho' other Studies may be uſeful to you, and imploy Part of your Time, yet Divinity is to be the principal Subject of your Meditations. Study the holy Scriptures which are <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the Man of God</hi> (the Miniſter of Chriſt) <hi>may be perfect, thro'ly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed unto all good Works.</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Labour to gain ſuch an Acquaintance with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that you may be able to explain them: To apply
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005172_0043_1016CF5EB82615A0"/>
them to the Hearts and Conſciences of your Hearers: To convince the Gainſayer by them; and to put to Silence thoſe who oppoſe themſelves. Endeavour more and more to deſerve that excellent Character given to <hi>Apollos</hi>—<hi>Mighty in the Scriptures</hi>—<note n="f" place="bottom">Acts 18. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Look well to the Compoſures you prepare for the publick Service of the Houſe of God. Let your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons be well ſtudied; offer not that to your People, in the Name of God, which is crude and undigeſted; nor preſume to depend upon immediate Aſſiſtance, in the Neglect of previous Preparations.</p>
            <p>III. Take Heed that you fulfil that Part of your Miniſtry, which conſiſts in private treating of Souls, in the great Affair of their eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>We hope many will come to you with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Enquiry, <hi>Sir, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all ſuch Caſes you are to be eaſy of acceſs. You muſt be open and free, pitiful and compaſſionate, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and gentle, to thoſe who make their Application to you; adapting your Counſels and Directions to their various Caſes. Not healing thoſe slightly who are wounded in Spirit, leaſt they be ruined by a falſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Not making the Hearts of thoſe ſad whom God would not have made ſad, leaſt they be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and faint in their Minds; but ſtrengthen the

weak Hands and confirm the feeble Knees: Like a ſkillful Phyſician ſuit your Directions, to the various Circumſtances of particular Souls.</p>
            <p>IV. Take Heed to fulfil that Part of your Miniſtry which conſiſts in publick Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>Watch againſt Coldneſs, Dullneſs and Formality in your publick Prayers: let a decent Fervour of Soul attend them all, that it may appear to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you are fir'd with a true Devotion, and their Hearts may keep Time with yours in the humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes you make to God.—With that holy Fear, with that Reverence and Devotion, which becomes Duſt and Aſhes, when before the moſt High, make your Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to him: Uſing at the ſame Time, that humble Boldneſs, Confidence, and Importunity, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcends to encourage in his Word.</p>

               <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, a Workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi>

thereby to pluck them as Brands from the Burning.</p>
            <p>Apply your ſelf in the moſt clear and inſtructive Manner you can, to thoſe who deſire to be informed in the Way of Life. Teach them what they muſt do to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Apply the gracious Encouragements of the Goſpel, to thoſe who labour under ſpiritual Burdens. <hi>Strengthen the weak Hands confirm the feeble Knees, ſay to them who are of a fearful Heart, Be ſtrong, fear not.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Labour to rectify the Miſtakes of thoſe who are out of the Way, by plentifully declaring the Truth as it is in Jeſus. <hi>Fooliſh and unlearned Queſtions avoid, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they do gender Strifes. And the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="l" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 23, 24, 25.</note>

               </gap> edifying; That which may conduce to their ſpiritual Nouriſhment and Growth in Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> divide the Word of Truth: Be that faithful and wiſe Steward, who gives to every one his
