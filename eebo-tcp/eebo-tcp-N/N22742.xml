            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>2 TIMOTHY, I.8.</bibl>
                  <p>—BE THOU PARTAKER OF THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE GOSPEL, ACCORDING TO THE POWER OF GOD.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles was firſt called to be an ambaſſador of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for his name's ſake; and during the whole courſe of his miniſtry, the Holy Ghoſt witneſſed that in every city, bonds and afflictions awaited him. But ſuch was his invincible reſolution in the ſervice of his divine Maſter, that none of theſe things moved him, nor did he count his life dear to himſelf, ſo that he might finiſh his courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which he had received of the Lord.</p>
            <p>HAVING paſſed through a courſe of laborious and faithful ſervice; having endured every affliction, and ſurmounted every difficulty which lay in his way, and having arrived ſo near the end of life as to be able to ſay, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand;" he does, in this epiſtle, (one of the laſt which he wrote) encourage
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030052_0004_0FE4175238393FE0"/>
his ſon Timothy to imitate his example, and not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of the Lord, nor of him who was then a priſoner for his ſake; but to be a partaker with him of the afflictions of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>HAD Paul himſelf been aſhamed of the cauſe he had undertaken to ſupport, or had he been conſcious of an error therein, natural affection would have prompted him (as is common with dying malefactors) to warn his beloved friend, of the danger of following his example, and to exhort him to a different courſe of life: but knowing in whom he had believed; knowing the dignity and importance of the work to which Timothy had been ordained, and the certain reward which awaited the faithful miniſter; knowing that the ſpirit by which they both were animated was not the ſpirit of fear, but of power and love and of a ſound mind, his tenderneſs toward him operated in a different way, and prompted him rather to deſire that Timothy ſhould continue ſtedfaſt in his Maſter's work, and patiently endure the afflictions of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>SUCH a pathetic exhortation, enforced by ſo ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an example, could not but have great force on the mind of this young evangeliſt; and, as it was written not for his ſake alone, but for a ſtanding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to goſpel miniſters, we have reaſon to believe that it has had a very extenſive influence in the paſt ages of Chriſtianity. It ſtill continues on record for our admonition and encouragement.</p>
            <p>IT was more eſpecially neceſſary that the primitive miniſters ſhould have ſuch an exhortation addreſſed to them, becauſe of the peculiar and extraordinary trials which many of them had to undergo. The genius of Chriſtianity was ſo oppoſite to all the prevailing religious opinions and eſtabliſhments in the heathen world, and made ſuch a ſurprizing progreſs in turning men from darkneſs to light, and from ſerving dumb
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030052_0005_0FE417E6FB35B318"/>
idols to worſhipping the living God, that the ruling powers became jealous of its growth, and laboured, by the moſt ſanguinary terrors, to ſuppreſs or eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it. The public miniſters of Chriſtianity being always diſtinguiſhed by their office, were often diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their ſufferings; and in this reſpect, as well as others, they were called to be examples to the flock; examples of patience and fortitude in their adherence to Chriſt and his cauſe, amidſt the moſt terrible oppoſition of their enemies; whom neither reaſon could perſuade, nor experience convince, of the folly of their attempt. The profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and eſpecially the public character which the miniſters of the goſpel ſuſtained, was then attended with the greateſt hazard; and therefore they needed ſome ſpecial ſupport and encouragement. But though the miniſters and diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt are not now expoſed to the peril of their lives for the ſake of Chriſt and his religion; yet the exhortation in the text has a very important uſe; and the Holy Ghoſt, who indited it, knew that there would always be ſufficient need of it. The world has not loſt that ſpirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the truth, which it had in the primitive times; the mode of its operation is changed; but the inveteracy of it remains; it is often brought into view, and produces diſagreeable effects. There are ſtill many afflictions to which the miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are expoſed, and which they may certainly expect to meet with, if they continue ſteadily and earneſtly engaged in their duty, and are determined to keep a conſcience void of offence towards God and man.</p>
            <p>IN common with other men, we are ſubject to all thoſe providential afflictions which God ſends as fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly chaſtiſements to correct his people for their errors, to try their virtues, and make them partakers of his holineſs. But beſide theſe, WE are ſubject to afflictions of a peculiar kind, which may, with ſtrict propriety, be called "the afflictions of the goſpel," becauſe they
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030052_0006_0FE41753E41E4AC8"/>
befal us on account of our peculiar character as the miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe afflictions ariſe from thoſe corrupt luſts and paſſions which are always working in oppoſition to divine truth, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the prince of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>HAPPY would it be for us, if we did not experience much affliction ariſing from our own unmortified luſts and paſſions. We are, like other men, compounded of fleſh and ſpirit; and we often find, to our ſorrow, that the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the things which we would; and when we would do good, evil is preſent with us. But if, through grace, we do obtain, in ſome degree, the maſtery over our own corruptions; yet we ſhall not find it ſo practicable to keep the luſts and paſſions of other men, of thoſe with whom we have a neceſſary connection, yea of our deareſt friends, in the ſame degree of ſubjection. We ſhall find very ſharp and ſevere afflictions ariſing from this ſource; of theſe we are exhorted to be partakers; and we ſhall find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient comfort and ſupport in the divine word to enable us to bear them with patience.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper to enumerate ſome of thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar trials which may be juſtly called the <hi>afflictions of the goſpel;</hi> and then ſhow why, and in what ſenſe, the <hi>power of God</hi> is given as a reaſon of the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be <hi>partakers</hi> of theſe afflictions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. ONE of theſe afflictions, of which we are called to partake, is <hi>the unſucceſsfulneſs of our labours.</hi> Who hath believed our report? is an old complaint among the miniſters of God. The world, and the things of the world, have taken ſuch firm hold of men's hearts as to engroſs the principal part of their attention, and leave little room for things of a ſpiritual nature. Preſent things afford ſome proſpect of preſent good; whilſt things unſeen and eternal are imagined to be at a great diſtance, and not to require our preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030052_0007_0FE4175597683000"/>
This is the general temper of the world, and this is what ſhuts the goſpel out of men's hearts. Cuſtom, and a ſenſe of decency, will induce ſome of them to an outward obſervance of religious duties, and attendance on divine inſtitutions, and even to treat us with a degree of reſpect, becauſe of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred character; but their hearts will not be touched with a ſerious ſenſe of divine things, nor will their lives and behaviour be regulated by the goſpel. Such were the people to whom the Prophet Ezekiel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: "They come to thee as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy wor<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> but they will not do them; for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs. And lo, thou art to them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument, for they hear thy words, but they do them not." Such a kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in people may ſuit one who is ſeeking his own eaſe and comfort and popularity; but the true miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, though he cannot but be pleaſed with outward tokens of reſpect, becauſe they are in a degree ſubſervient to his uſefulneſs; yet is not ſatisfied with them, as anſwering the end of his miniſtry. He knows the value of ſouls, and of that precious blood which was ſhed to redeem them. He knows the great importance of the work which he has undertaken, and the ſolemn account which he muſt render of his ſtewardſhip; and therefore his heart's deſire and prayer to God is, that they may be ſaved. He longs to ſee the truth take hold of their hearts, and ſhew its happy fruit in their holy and exemplary lives. But as a courſe of diſappointment in any of our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling expectations is a grief and burden to the mind, ſo it may be concluded, that the faithful miniſter ſuffers great affliction from a view of the unſucceſsfulneſs of his labours. When, after all his intenſe ſtudies, his watchings and ſelf-denial, he finds that his hearers are ſtill hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, deaf to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030052_0008_0FE417579253FC70"/>
the calls and invitations of the goſpel, and blind to their true intereſt; when he reflects that his earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſeeking their good may prove an aggravation of their guilt; when he ſees them dropping, one after another, into the grave, and has reaſon to fear that many of them will periſh through their own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and folly; theſe things muſt affect him with the moſt ſenſible grief, whilſt he ſilently adores that tremendous juſtice which ſuffers ſo many unhappy ſouls to plunge themſelves into the miſery of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>levity and inconſtancy,</hi> which appear in men's religious conduct, prove another ſource of affliction to the miniſters of the goſpel. Where people have been uſed to a variety of preaching, they are very apt to grow nice and taſty, to diſcover a fondneſs for novelty, and to be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with ſome external circumſtances attending the preacher, as his looks, his voice, his geſture, his ſtyle and manner, without any regard to the truth preached, or the conſequence of receiving or rejecting it. If it comes attended with ſome particular circumſtances, then it is pleaſing, not for the ſake of its own intrinſic worth and excellency, but on account of thoſe external circumſtances; whereas if the truth be ever ſo plainly and faithfully delivered, yet if it be deſtitute of thoſe ornaments which attract the fancy and pleaſe the taſte, it is deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected. Men's perſons are had in admiration becauſe of ſome external advantages, and they are not eſteemed highly in love for their work's ſake. How painful muſt it be to a true goſpel miniſter, who has been aſſiduouſly labouring to come to his people, and bring them the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, to find his labours ſlighted becauſe of a deficiency in thoſe external accompliſhments, which are no eſſential part of the furniture of a goſpel preacher. The Apoſtle Paul experienced much of this affliction. He came not with excellency of ſpeech, nor
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030052_0009_0FE417E8ABAF4DC8"/>
in the words of man's wiſdom; his bodily preſence was weak, and his ſpeech contemptible; and when he preached the goſpel in the learned and inquiſitive city of Athens, the compliment paid him by that polite aſſembly was, "What will this babbler ſay?" But the ſervant muſt not expect to be greater than his Lord. Jeſus himſelf, the beſt friend of mankind, was received by his audience with ſuch contemptuous language as
<q>Can any good thing come out of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? This man is a wine-bibber and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and ſinners.</q>
Was it not an occaſion of grief to his holy ſoul, and to his faithful Apoſtles, to find themſelves ſo diſreſpectfully and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly treated? and can it be otherwiſe to every ſincere miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, to find himſelf deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his teſtimony rejected, by ſuch idle and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial hearers? Or if he has not ſo large a ſhare of it himſelf, yet does it not grieve him, to ſee and hear any of his brethren, with whom he is jointly labouring in the Lord's vineyard, and for whom he entertains a cordial and ſympathetic affection, thus baſely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whilſt, on the other hand, he ſees multitudes of people carried away by an empty noiſe, and dazzled by a falſe glare of impudent attractions, when there is no ſolid food for their ſouls; leaving the ſubſtantial entertainment, prepared for them by the ſtricteſt care, and running after the frothy traſh which is preſented to them in a manner flattering to their imagination, and gratifying to their paſſions. Let ſuch trials lead us to reflect, how vain a thing is mere popularity! how low in the eſteem of him who was deſpiſed and rejected of men! and how earneſtly ſhould we ſeek the more valuable accompliſhment of being able, by manifeſtation of the truth, to commend ourſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ANOTHER of the afflictions of the goſpel is the <hi>oppoſition</hi> which we ſometimes meet in the way of our duty. We are commanded not only to preach the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030052_0010_0FE417EAA9591D10"/>
word, but to reprove and rebuke offenders, either privately, in cloſe converſation, or publicly, in the way of church diſcipline. This is a very neceſſary, but difficult and unpleaſing part of miniſterial duty, and we go to it as ſoldiers go on a forlorn hope: for as it is a direct attack on the luſts and paſſions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſo it is natural to expect a repulſe. Though armed with reſolution, and conducted by wiſdom and judgment, yet we often find the voice of reaſon too weak to be heard, where luſt and paſſion have uſurped the government of the mind. There are ſome tempers which will hearken to nothing which preſumes to contradict the reigning deſire, or bring the lawfulneſs of it into queſtion. Men will readily condemn what they obſerve amiſs in others, as David did when he heard Nathan relate the ſtory of the rich man who took away the poor man's lamb; but when it comes cloſe to the conſcience, as did the application of that parable, "Thou art the man," it requires a great degree of patience, humility and tenderneſs of mind, to receive the ſhock in the ſame manner that David did; and as theſe qualities are not to be found in every man, ſo wherever they are wanting, we may expect oppoſition and ill ſucceſs. Inſtead of having our reproof received with meekneſs, we ſhall hear the voice of recrimination; and the proverb, "Phyſician, heal thyſelf," will be retorted. Or we ſhall be thought hard and cruel, or charged with falſhood, or want of charity, or taking up an ill report. Or they will endeavour to revenge themſelves, by inventing lies againſt us, where there is no real ground of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The prophet complains of thoſe to whom he was obliged to adminiſter reproofs in the name of the Lord, that they conſpired againſt him, ſaying, "Come, let us deviſe devices againſt Jeremiah, let us <hi>ſmite him with the tongue,</hi> and let us not give heed to any of his words." And the Apoſtle Paul was, by ſome of his brethren, counted an enemy becauſe he told them the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030052_0011_0FE417F0C33B1A48"/>THE principal difficulties of this kind ariſe from the hypocriſy which too often reigns among profeſſors of religion. As a hollow tree makes a much greater noiſe, when ſtruck, than one which is ſound; ſo the hypocrite, when his faults are reproved with chriſtian fidelity, will make a loud noiſe, either in vindicating his own character, or finding fault with his reprover; whereas a true chriſtian receives a rebuke with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and patience. Let the righteous ſmite me, ſaid David, and it ſhall be a kindneſs, and their reproof ſhall be an excellent oil, which ſhall not break my head. A reproof, ſays Solomon, enters deeper into a wiſe man than a hundred ſtripes into the back of a fool. The wounds of God's true children will bear to be ſearched, and are ſoon healed; but the wounds of the hypocrite are full of proud fleſh, which keeps them always ſore.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the oppoſition which we meet in the way of reproof and diſcipline, there is much difficulty ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ignorance, the weakneſs, the prejudices, and the narrow views of ſome of our brethren, whom we charitably hope to be ſincere. Theſe cauſes will ſometimes produce a degree of obſtinacy, and even violence, which may be miſtaken for religious zeal, and operate to the diſturbance of order and peace in chriſtian ſocieties. Such things are a great affliction to the miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. It grieves them to ſee that their moſt laborious, and, as they hope, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and faithful endeavours to remove ſcandals, to convince gainſayers, to eradicate errors, to awaken men from a deluſive, dangerous, hypocritical ſleep, to pluck them out of the fire, and to preſerve or reſtore the purity of churches and divine ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, meet with ſo much oppoſition from the pride, the perverſeneſs, and the prejudices of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though they are aſſured, and their Lord hath forewarned them, it is impoſſible but that offences will come.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030052_0012_0FE417F2C5369458"/>4. ANOTHER affliction to which we are ſubjected is <hi>the contempt and reproach of the profane.</hi> The world has always been an enemy to the truth. Satan loves to keep his ſtrong hold in peace; but when this guilty peace is in danger of being diſturbed by the plain and faithful preaching of the goſpel, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary conduct of its miniſters, his endeavour is to render their work unſucceſsful by exciting his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to reproach, to ridicule, and deſpiſe them. If any, who bear the character of goſpel miniſters, are ſo unhappy as to fall into open ſins, reproach is liberally caſt on the whole order, and we are ſaid to be all alike, though our faults are not made ſo public. How many baſe reflections, ſneering jokes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſarcaſms are caſt on us, as if we preach only for hire; how little allowance is made for our unavoidable infirmities, interruptions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and how much more is expected of us than is reaſonable. If we fail in any part of our duty, how much greater ſhare of reproach do we ſuffer than oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er men in the ſame circumſtances. How often is the tongue of ſlander let looſe upon us; our moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent actions are looked upon with an eye of ſuſpicion, and our private conduct pried into with a buſy and impertinent curioſity! If we preach againſt any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins, or deſcribe any particular ſort of bad character, ſome perſon or other will think he is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, will be offended, and ſhew his reſentment. On the other hand, if we ſpeak only in general terms, to avoid giving offence, then we are cenſured as general preachers, who do not ſpeak cloſe to the conſciences of our hearers. Both our public performances and our private converſation are expoſed to the attacks of malicious, cavilling and prejudiced tempers; and he muſt be more than human, who can behave ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and circumſpectly as in all caſes to avoid giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offence; eſpecially when we conſider that we can recommend no duty but what ſome perſon neglects, and condemn no ſin but what ſome perſon commits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:030052_0013_0FE417F46EFC9C38"/>IT is inconſiſtent with the character of a goſpel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter to be a man-pleaſer. "If I yet pleaſed men," ſays the Apoſtle Paul, "I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt." Indeed we ought to be condeſcending to men's capacities and peculiarities in things of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the ſame Apoſtle ſays, that he became all things to all men, and that he pleaſed men for their good to edification. But beyond this, chriſtian fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity will not warrant us to go; and yet if we find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to ſpeak or act in a manner contrary to men's old eſtabliſhed opinions and inveterate preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; yea, if we do not actually fall in with, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour them, we ſhall incur their reſentment and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their favour. We often find, by our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the tempers of mankind are ſuch as our Lord deſcribed the Jews to be. "Whereto ſhall I liken this generation? It is like children ſitting in the market, and calling to their fellows, ſaying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented. For John came neither eating nor drinking, and ye ſay he hath a devil. The ſon of man is come eating and drinking, and ye ſay, Behold a man gluttonous, a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and ſinners. But wiſdom is juſtified of her children."</p>
            <p n="5">5. ANOTHER of the afflictions to which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is the reſentment of pretended patriots, when we oppoſe their views in endeavouring to ſerve our country. There is a monopolizing ſpirit in ſome politicians, which would exclude clergymen from all attention to matters of ſtate and government; which would prohibit us from bringing political ſubjects into the pulpit, and even threaten us with the loſs of our livings if we move at all in the political ſphere.<note n="*" place="bottom">HAD this diſcourſe been delivered twenty or twenty-five years ago, it might have been conjectured that the politicians here meant were tories, and under Britiſh influence! The ſame language is now held by ſome who think themſelves the beſt friends of America!</note> But, my brethren, I conſider politics as intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030052_0014_0FE417F66842B3A0"/>
with morality, and both with religion. If the political character of a people is bad, their morals are equally bad, and their religion is good for nothing. The ſame man who appears in the character of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, is alſo a ſubject of moral government, and a candidate for immortality. Therefore if he act right or wrong as a politician, he acts equally right or wrong as a ſubject of God's moral government; his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as a politician will be brought into the grand review at the laſt day, and his future ſtate will be determined accordingly. This doctrine, I am ſenſible, is not agreeable to the practice of ſome men, who act with a tolerable regard to the principles of morality in their common buſineſs; but when they get into a political body, relax their ideas of morality, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to carry a point by any means whatever. Againſt ſuch an idea of politics, I think it my duty to proteſt; for I believe that honeſty is the beſt policy, both in private and public life.</p>
            <p>NOW if it be the duty of goſpel miniſters to preach morality, it is their duty to preach it to public as well as private men. Did not the ancient prophets warn the princes of Iſrael and Judah of their duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them for their miſconduct in their political characters? Did not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Jews to render to Caeſar the things which were Caeſar's, in direct and decided contradiction to the principles of the <hi>diſorganizing</hi> Phariſees? Did not the Apoſtle Paul, in his epiſtle to the Romans, deſcribe the character of good and bad rulers, and teach the Chriſtians how to diſtinguiſh one from the other? Did not the Apoſtle Peter pointedly denounce the judgment of God againſt thoſe who deſpiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſpeak evil of dignities, ſtigmatizing them with the epithets of preſumptuous and ſelf-willed; characterizing them as political hypocrites, who, whilſt they promiſe liberty, are themſelves ſervants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; comparing them to Balaam, who loved the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030052_0015_0FE417FAEFF776F8"/>
wages of unrighteouſneſs; and applying to them that true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire?<note n="*" place="bottom">See 2 Peter, chap. ii. ver. 10, 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 19, 22.</note> This, in the apoſtolic age, was plain, honeſt, goſpel preaching; and if there appear any ſuch cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among us, why ſhould not the miniſters of the goſpel, in the ſame manner, expoſe them to the public odium? It is true, that the Apoſtles did not call ſuch men by their proper names, but only drew their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and left it to be applied where it belonged. The like prudence ſhould we uſe; but if men will condeſcend to wear ſuch a character, they muſt blame themſelves for the reproach which is neceſſarily attached to it.</p>
            <p>THE Roman government, under which the Apoſtles lived, was a mixture of the old republican forms with military deſpotiſm: That government was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the Jews, though protected and indulged in the free exerciſe of their religion, were continually uneaſy, and frequently exciting inſurrection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, not only in the province of Judea, but in their various diſperſions through the empire. To this <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organizing faction,</hi> the apoſtolic reproofs were addreſſed; for as the Chriſtian Religion was not deſigned to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw any of the kingdoms of this world, ſo it inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſpirit of peace and loyalty on all who profeſſed it.</p>
            <p>HAD the Apoſtles lived in theſe days, and among us, who have the privilege of chooſing our own rulers, I have no doubt that they would have exhorted us to exerciſe our privileges by none but honeſt and lawful means. They would have adviſed the people to carry the principles of Chriſtian morality to a town-meeting as well as to the exchange. They would have adviſed legiſlators to carry the ſame principles to the ſenate and houſe of aſſembly; they would have adviſed executive and judicial officers to carry the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to the bar, to the bench, to the council-board, and to the Governor's chair. They would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed us to be conſiſtent and uniform in our regards
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030052_0016_0FE4175E77FCC380"/>
to God and man, in every ſituation, private or public<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is the duty of goſpel miniſters.</p>
            <p>IT is very ſtrange that we may not preach on the ſame ſubjects which are recommended to us as ſubjects of prayer. In the annual proclamations for faſts and thankſgivings we are exhorted to pray and give thanks on a great variety of political ſubjects, foreign and domeſtic. And what good reaſon can be given why theſe ſame ſubjects ſhould not be diſcourſed on, as well as prayed over? It is expected, that we bring them into the pulpit in our prayers, and it is by ſome people highly reſented if we do not. When we have them in our mind as proper ſubjects for devotion, why ſhould we not ſpeak and diſcourſe on them for the inſtruction of our hearers? Muſt we make an addreſs to God on political ſubjects, and may we not make an addreſs to our brethren on the ſame ſubjects? I would not be guilty of ſo ſtrange an inconſiſtency.</p>
            <p>IT ſhould be conſidered that we are men of like paſſions with others. We feel ourſelves intereſted equally with our brethren in the ſame religious, moral, and political matters; and where there is freedom of ſpeech, as I truſt there always will be in this happy country, we ought not to be blamed if we uſe the liberty of Americans to ſpeak our minds at proper times, and in a decent manner, on political as well as on moral and religious topics.</p>
            <p>BUT "there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, though their teeth are as ſwords!" And how liberal are ſome tongues, ſome pens, and ſome preſſes, with their abuſe, when we appear warm and zealous in the cauſe of our country! When we ſpeak or write in ſupport of its liberties, its conſtitution, its peace and its honor, we are ſtigmatized as buſy-bodies, as tools of a party, as meddling with what does not belong to us, and uſurping authority over our brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030052_0017_0FE417FE09E3BD00"/>WHATEVER may be the views of thoſe who are of a different opinion from me, reſpecting this matter, yet I conſider their principle, that the clergy have no right to meddle with politics, and their endeavour to ſtop our mouths, as "pregnant with miſchief," tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the people in ignorance, and expoſing them to be miſled by thoſe who would always pretend that the people ſhall govern, provided that they ſhall govern the people.</p>
            <p>THE time has been, when ſome of theſe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were very fond of engaging the clergy in politics, encouraging them to write and preach, or, to uſe a phraſe of their own, "blow the trumpet," in defence of the liberties of their country. But, alas, how changed, how fallen! From ſuch politicians, and ſuch patriots, the good Lord deliver us!</p>
            <p n="6">6. THERE is another affliction of the goſpel, which I would gladly omit, if the omiſſion might not be deemed improper, and that is the difficulty which we ſometimes experience for want of a <hi>competent temporal ſupport.</hi> Though the Apoſtles in the infancy of the church, laboured with their hands that they might not be chargeable to the new converts, yet they challenged it as a right, not only for themſelves, but for all ſucceeding miniſters, that thoſe who preach the goſpel ſhould live of the goſpel. This is a dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of reaſon and juſtice, an injunction of the law of God, and of the government under which we live. But in many inſtances it happens, that through cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etouſneſs, or careleſſneſs, or prejudice, or a ſpirit of evaſion and procraſtination, the ſupport we receive is either inſufficient in itſelf, or is ſo long in coming, that we are reduced to ſtraits and ſufferings for want of it. In theſe caſes, we have but a choice of difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. If we complain, we are cenſured as impatient and querulous. If we lie ſtill, and do nothing to help ourſelves, we are ſaid to be careleſs and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident. If we ſolicit benefactions, we are ſtigmatized <pb n="20" facs="unknown:030052_0018_0FE417FFB34AD430"/>
as beggars. If we work with our hands, or engage in any literary labours, we are called worldly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and negligent of our proper buſineſs. If we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the laws of our country, and compel our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to do us juſtice, it is a wonder if there be not ſuch a ſpirit of reſentment raiſed againſt us, as will either make a continual uneaſineſs, or elſe terminate in a ſeparation.</p>
            <p>ENOUGH has now been ſaid, to convince all who could entertain any doubt, that the profeſſion of the goſpel miniſtry is neceſſarily attended with difficulties, and ſubjects us to peculiar afflictions and trials. If I ſhould ſay that moſt of theſe ideas are the reſult of <hi>my own</hi> experience, I am ſure that many of my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and brethren, who hear me, can from <hi>their</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teſtify to the truth of them. Others might be mentioned with as much propriety as any of theſe; but it muſt be ſufficiently apparent that the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the text is of very important uſe, <hi>Be thou partaker of the afflictions of the goſpel.</hi> Two ideas ſeem to be implied in this exhortation; <hi>one</hi> is, that we do not ſuffer alone, but are partakers with each other in theſe afflictions; the <hi>other</hi> is, that we ſhould have our minds prepared for them, ſo as not to be diſappointed or diſcouraged. If we ſuffer in company with our fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and brethren, we have the benefit of their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and of their advice; and it is a conſolation to us to reflect that we are partakers with the beſt of men in theſe trials and difficulties. This conſideration will help to prepare our minds to receive them, and keep us from ſinking under them. But there is another motive ſuggeſted by the Apoſtle, which merits our particular attention. Be thou partaker of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the goſpel, <hi>according to the power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us then inquire, why, and in what ſenſe, the <hi>power of God</hi> is given as a reaſon of the exhortation in the text.</p>
            <p>IN the preceding verſes the Apoſtle had repreſented the divine power as part of the gift which Timothy
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030052_0019_0FE418015FE95790"/>
had received; "Stir up the <hi>gift</hi> that is in thee, by the putting on of my hands, for God hath not <hi>given</hi> us the ſpirit of fear, but of <hi>power,</hi> and love, and a ſound mind." By which we learn, that a ſpirit of power is reckoned among the miniſterial gifts, and neceſſary to the diſcharge of the miniſterial office. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, as far as it reſpects the ordinary miniſters of the church, I take to be, that the Holy Spirit is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready, with his powerful influence, to ſupport and comfort the miniſters of the word; to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them all the energy, boldneſs and patience which they need, to enable them to bear the trials, and go through the duties of their important ſtation; and the recollection of the gift received in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or appointment to this office, the gift of a <hi>ſpirit of power,</hi> will ſo put them and continue them in the way of their duty, as that they may confidently rely on the aid of the divine ſpirit, for their ſupport. Chriſt has promiſed to be with his miniſters to the end of the world; and when they are engaged with reſolution and fidelity in his ſervice, he who has a feeling of their infirmities, and is ever attentive to their wants and requeſts, will enable them, by his power, to perſevere in the way of their duty, and ſo far to overcome all the oppoſition which may be made againſt them, as that the cauſe of truth ſhall, on the whole, proſper in their hands, and be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their miniſtry.</p>
            <p>IN humble reliance, therefore, on this divine power, we ſhould ſet ourſelves reſolutely and earneſtly about our Maſter's work, and not be moved from our ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs by any of the afflictions of the goſpel. For if we have a proper faith in this power; and a proper knowledge of the manner in which it is conveyed, and has been exerciſed, we ſhall be ſatisfied that it is ſufficient for the purpoſe for which it is given.</p>
            <p>AND here, we may, with propriety, look back to the primitive times of Chriſtianity, and ſee how this
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030052_0020_0FE41760238AC528"/>
divine power was manifeſted in ſupporting the firſt preachers of the goſpel, in times of far greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than the preſent. They had to encounter the moſt fierce and formidable oppoſition from inveterate prejudices, from malicious paſſions, from over-heated zeal, and from a combination of powerful intereſts. They had to travel among all ſorts of people, civilized and ſavage, learned and unlearned, by ſea and by land, without any certain temporal revenues or means of ſupport. They had to preach a new doctrine, and introduce a rational and ſimple form of worſhip, in defiance of ancient ſuperſtition, the craft of prieſts, the eloquence of orators, the authority of magiſtrates, and the policy of princes. The perſons employed in this ſervice were in general illiterate, void of art, actuated by an honeſt regard to their duty. They were fully convinced themſelves of the truth of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but were deſtitute of thoſe natural and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages, which human wiſdom would deem neceſſary to introduce a new religion, and recommend it to the notice and eſteem of the world. Yet they went out on their arduous and benevolent work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear; they perſevered in it with wiſdom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they were greatly ſucceſsful in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote the cauſe of their Maſter, and ſubdue the hearts of men to the obedience of the truth. And to what means can this remarkable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs be aſcribed, but to a divine <hi>power,</hi> upholding and ſupporting them, and co-operating with their exertions to produce this mighty effect. To this cauſe, the Apoſtles themſelves aſcribe it. "Our goſpel came to you not in word only, but in <hi>power,</hi> and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance." "My preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit, and of <hi>power.</hi>"</p>
            <p>SOME may think, that in the idea of this power, might have been comprehended the gift of miracles, by which they were enabled to make a direct appeal
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030052_0021_0FE41761D1530730"/>
to the ſenſes of mankind, and prove that they had an extraordinary commiſſion from God. But this was a temporary thing. There is a power accompanying goſpel preaching, diſtinct from the gift of miracles; a power, by which they were ſupported in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their office, and by which their preaching was rendered effectual to the end for which it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This was a divine energy, communicated to them, by which they were ſtrengthened and animated to go on boldly and courageouſly with their Maſter's work, in defiance of all the oppoſition which the world could throw in their way. It is not eaſy to deſcribe this energy but by its effect; and of this we have a remarkable inſtance, in the different conduct of Peter, before and after he was endowed with the ſpirit of power. Before our Lord's death, we find this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſanguine diſciple, failing of his duty in a moſt ſhameful manner. One hour profeſſing, "Though all men ſhould forſake thee, yet will I never forſake thee;" "Though I ſhould die with thee, yet I will not deny thee;" and the next, denying that he knew his Maſter; and when cloſely preſſed on the ſubject, adding oaths and curſes to confirm the denial. We find him afraid not only of the high-prieſt and rulers, but even of their ſervants; and though he ſeemed to recover from this fall, and ſhed tears of remorſe for his folly, yet, when his Lord was actually led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, he was one of thoſe who forſook him, and fled. This was an affecting inſtance of inconſtancy and timidity, which would ſeem to have diſqualified Peter from being an Apoſtle of Chriſt, and a preacher of his goſpel. But, mark the difference in his conduct, after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon him. Then he could declare to the Jewiſh multitude, "This Jeſus, whom ye have taken, and with wicked hands have crucified and ſlain, God hath raiſed up, of which all we are witneſſes. God hath made the ſame Jeſus both Lord and Chriſt." Then he could tell the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh rulers, when aſſembled in council, "The God of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030052_0022_0FE4180844206198"/>
our fathers hath raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew, and hanged on a tree." And when he and his brother John were forbidden, by the Jewiſh council, to preach in the name of Jeſus, he could boldly anſwer, "We ought to obey God rather than Men." Here we have a complete ſpecimen of the effect of that ſpirit of power, with which the primitive miniſters were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed; which enabled them to perſevere with a holy fortitude in confeſſing Chriſt before men, who were enraged againſt them, and thirſted for their blood. We ſee that this power can make the feeble ſtrong, and transform the coward into a hero.</p>
            <p>WITH this ſpirit of power, all the true miniſters of Chriſt are endowed. It was not like the gift of mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles, confined to the primitive age; but it is diffuſed univerſally. Every miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt has, or may have, a ſhare of it; and, were it not for this, it would be impoſſible for us to ſupport our character, or endure the trials and afflictions to which we are ſubject, and which will befal us in the courſe of our miniſtry. Were it not for this, we ſhould ſink under the burden of our labours and ſufferings; or elſe, forſake the ſervice of Chriſt, and, like Demas, ſeek our portion and enjoyment in the things of this vain world. The Apoſtle, therefore, wiſely refers to this divine energy, as the proper ground of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Timothy, in partaking of the afflictions of the goſpel. He knew that there was a ſpirit of power in him, and communicated to him by his divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which would uphold and ſupport him in affliction and tribulation; which would enable him to endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt, and carry him ſafely and honourably through his chriſtian warfare. The ſame ground of comfort there is to every faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt. We are exhorted, therefore, to be partakers of the afflictions of the goſpel, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power of God. Theſe afflictions are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to befal us by our wiſe and gracious Lord, who
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030052_0023_0FE4176379437C20"/>
knows how to proportion our trials to our ſtrength; who, having given us a ſpirit of power, gives us alſo opportunity to exerciſe it; that in much tribulation we may approve ourſelves faithful to his cauſe, and diligent in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>FROM what has now been obſerved, agreeable to the text, we may infer, the miſtake of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who affect to think the work of the goſpel miniſtry an eaſy thing. It has been often ſaid, by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial obſervers, that miniſters lead an eaſy life, becauſe they do not work for their living, but are maintained by their people. Granting the premiſes to be true, yet the concluſion will not follow. If our Lord has excuſed us from manual labour, and if our people comply ever ſo well with his directions in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting us, yet he muſt be a great ſtranger to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the miniſtry, who thinks our work eaſy, and that we have not buſineſs enough to give us full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>IT is a fact, confirmed by long and repeated expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the work which we are obliged to do, and the trials which we are called to endure, are more waſting to the health and ſpirits than any kind of bodily labour which men uſually perform. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of body tends to confirm and eſtabliſh the health; but the exerciſe of the mind, which falls to our lot, often proves ruinous to the health, and wears away the conſtitution in a moſt unaccountable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The thoughtfulneſs, the watchfulneſs, the ſelf-denial, the anxiety, the cloſe application, and intenſe ſtretch of the mental powers in deep ſtudy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which form an eſſential part of our work, are exerciſes unknown to the bulk of mankind. If, on any particular occaſion, they are called to ſuch kind of labour, how painful and tedious is it to them, and how eagerly do they embrace the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to get rid of it! But it is our conſtant employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The inward labour of our mind, our conflicts
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030052_0024_0FE41809F5BAE5E8"/>
with our own corruptions, and our application to ſacred ſtudies, are objects which the world does not ſee, and therefore can form no idea of them. Our public diſcourſes are the reſult of deep thought and ſtrict inquiry; and yet how often does it happen that thoſe diſcourſes are leaſt regarded; whilſt the tinſel trumpery of him "that beateth the air" is admired as the perfection of wiſdom and rhetoric! the beaten oil of the ſanctuary is quickly conſumed, and its light appears to have been ſpent in vain! whilſt the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> ſhall draw after it crouds of admirers! If our brethren did but know the labour, the patience, the ſelf application, the trials and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which fall to our lot, they would pity us, and pray for us, rather than think our work light and eaſy.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding all theſe trials and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet we are not without our ſhare of comfort; there are conſolations, as well as afflictions, of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and he who hath appointed us to the one, knows how to impart to us the other. His grace is ſufficient for us, and his ſtrength is made perfect in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The Apoſtle Paul could ſay, "Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourſelves are comforted of God; for as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt." And I doubt not, my <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>brethren,</hi> that as ye have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the afflictions, ſo ye have alſo been partakers of the conſolations of the goſpel. If ſome perſons have been inſtructed, converted, and edified by our miniſtry, the knowledge which we have of theſe good effects, wrought in the minds of our hearers, affords us proportionable ſatisfaction, that we have not wholly laboured in vain. God often gives us to ſee
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030052_0025_0FE41767AFAB7DC0"/>
ſome good fruit produced by our miniſtry; and though we ſee not ſo much as we could wiſh, yet we may have been inſtrumental of doing more good than ever has, or ever will, actually come to our knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge in this world. The huſbandman, in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is repreſented as ſowing his ſeed, and ſleeping and riſing night and day, while the ſeed ſprings and grows up <hi>he knoweth not how;</hi> ſo it is our duty to keep our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves employed in our miniſterial labours, leaving the ſucceſs of them to the ſecret, imperceptible influence of divine truth, which operates not by external might or power, but by the ſpirit of him who has free and perfect acceſs to the human heart at all times. We ſee a fountain pouring out conſtant ſtreams of water for ages, and yet now and then only ſome thirſty perſon comes to drink. From the analogy between natural and ſpiritual objects we may learn that God's word will not return to him void, but ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the purpoſe for which it is ſent; and though only now and then ſome thirſty ſinner comes to drink, yet we ſhould rejoice that the water of life has not been flowing in vain.</p>
            <p>IF we are faithful in our Maſter's ſervice, though we may be deſpiſed by the thoughtleſs and profane, yet we ſhall be reſpected by the wiſe and good; we ſhall have ſuch a ſhare of influence over mankind as we may uſe to their advantage, both in a moral and political view; and we ſhall receive ſuch outward tokens of friendſhip as will help to ſupport us, and keep our courage from failing even in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult trials. Though we ſow in tears, we ſhall reap in joy; and at the great harveſt-day, and not before, we ſhall ſee the <hi>whole</hi> fruit of our labour, to our abundant ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>MY brethren, of this <hi>whole</hi> congregation, you have heard ſome enumeration of the afflictions of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and among them, the want of a competent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſupport, which often falls to the lot of its min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030052_0026_0FE4176A8B790AD0"/>
and their families. It has been the laudable practice of this convention, for many years, and it may be juſtly reckoned the <hi>beſt</hi> part of our buſineſs at theſe annual meetings, to contribute to the relief of the widows and orphans of our deceaſed brethren, who are ſometimes left in deſtitute circumſtances. This is a ſpecies of conſolation which it is in every one's power to adminiſter in ſome degree; and if it be ever ſo ſmall, it will be accepted by him who hath ſaid, "He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet ſhall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man ſhall receive a righteous man's reward; and whoſoever ſhall give to one of theſe little ones that believe in me, a cup of cold water only, in the name of a diſciple, verily I ſay to you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward."</p>
            <p>IF the time would allow, I might urge your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this part of duty by a variety of conſiderations; but there is one, which I cannot omit, becauſe I think it is founded in fact, and yet has not, perhaps, been ſo much attended to as it deſerves. It is well known, that many of our order have but a ſmall income; it is alſo well known, that many of our families make a decent appearance, both at home and abroad. To what cauſe can this be owing, but to a principle of <hi>oeconomy,</hi> which is, I believe, generally, a characteriſtic of our families? I do not mean to ſpeak without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, becauſe it would not be conſiſtent with truth. This principle, being once formed into habit, is not eaſily loſt; but when the wife becomes a widow, and the children orphans, it is of unſpeakable advantage to them.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo well known, that our brethren are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſpoſed to give their children a good education. Having no proſpect of leaving them an inheritance, and being ſenſible of the great advantage of education, and the great diſadvantage of a ſtate of dependence,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030052_0027_0FE4180BA44B3AB0"/>
they are earneſt to put their children into a way of being able to get their own living independently, and, at the ſame time, of being uſeful to the community. The good effect of theſe cauſes is viſible in every part of the country, and this town contains ſome valuable examples of it. Take a general view of our citizens, and you will find, or by inquiry you may ſoon be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the ſons of clergymen, who make a capital figure in all the departments of buſineſs. You will ſee them among our moſt active and enterpriſing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and our moſt induſtrious and reputable tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. You will ſee them ſhine, at the bar, on the bench, in the medical faculty, in the pulpit, in our legiſlative aſſemblies; and even the chief ſeat of our government was lately filled with a gentleman of this deſcription. Look into the female line, and you will find among the daughters of clergymen ſome of the brighteſt ornaments of the ſex.</p>
            <p>WHEN theſe things are conſidered, you will permit me to ſay, that in ſoliciting charity for the widows and orphans of my brethren, I am pleading the cauſe, not of thoſe who are too proud or too lazy to work, but of thoſe who, with a little aſſiſtance, in their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances, may, in time, become ornaments of their country, and pillars of church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>TO conclude. Let us never be weary in well-doing. We ſerve a good Maſter, and we cannot ſerve him too much; he is a vigilant obſerver of our conduct, and he views not only the outward appearance, but the heart. Let ſincerity and uprightneſs, then, govern our whole deportment. Let us be ready to every good work; and we ſhall find, by our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in ſerving God, we are ſerving ourſelves; and that in ſuffering according to his will, we are promoting our own true happineſs, both here and hereafter.</p>
