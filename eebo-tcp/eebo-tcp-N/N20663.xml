            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is commonly expected that the Author or Editor of every work would furni≈øh the public with ≈øome account of the performance in the Preface; this will not be done here at length, as the work is before you and will an≈øwer for it≈øelf. It may be remarked that the Preface would be a ≈øuitable place to give a ≈øketch of the lives of the two gentlemen, who≈øe trials are here publi≈øhed, to this it can be an≈øwered that the Editor never ≈øaw Mr. <hi>Hopkin≈øon,</hi> now decea≈øed; and it would be very improper to write any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting the life of the other gentleman, who is yet on the ≈øtage: But the works of Mr. <hi>Hopkin≈øon</hi> are publi≈øhed, and his character is well known to be not inferior to any, and having very few of equal merit among the literati of the pre≈øent century. By the pre≈øent publication it will al≈øo appear, that <hi>he,</hi> like other people, had political enemies, who were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di≈øappointed at his acquittal in the year <hi>1780,</hi> as others have ≈øince been at the acquittal of Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> in the year <hi>1794.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The documents herein publi≈øhed have been regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared with authentic copies laid before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who≈øe permi≈ø≈øion to copy them the Editor had obtained during the interval from the 23d of March to the adjournment in April.</p>
            <p>If any errors have crept into the work, let the reader be a≈ø≈øured that great pains have been taken to prevent them, and that a work of this ≈øize and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027132_0006_0FD34E2DA2689418"/>
con≈øequence cannot fail of being attended with many difficulties; that this was a new field of argument, and that every error communicated to the Editor from any of the Speakers, or from tho≈øe concerned ≈øhall be duly attended to, and rectified in the next edition.</p>
            <p>From the difference in the length of the work in the two trials, the latter of which the Editor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout, and took down in ≈øhort hand; and the former be only collected and compiled from papers, ≈øome in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of private gentlemen, and others with the public, the reader will judge how nece≈ø≈øary this work is to the e≈øtabli≈øhment of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete hi≈øtory of the State-Trials of the Commonwealth of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> before the period pa≈ø≈øes when it can only be gathered from partial writers on one ≈øide or the other: As an evidence of the importance of this work, the Editor will be excu≈øed for introducing the following judicious report to the Senate of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania,</hi> by their committee a few days before the adjournment in April <hi>1794.</hi>

                           <p>Mr. <hi>M. Clark≈øon,</hi> ≈øworn in ≈øupport of the fir≈øt charge, ≈øaith,</p>
                           <p>That ≈øome time in the month of May la≈øt, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> brought Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> to his hou≈øe, to talk over certain di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that happened between him the ≈øaid <hi>M'C.</hi> and the officers of the Court of Admiralty. That we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred fully on the ≈øubject‚Äîand ≈øeveral explanations took place, concerning matters mi≈øconceived between the ≈øaid <hi>B. M'C.</hi> and Dep. The event was a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation that appeared cordial‚Äîthe Judge te≈øtified his a≈ø≈øent to ≈øaid reconciliation, having been before offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> went away, and the Judge remained. A conver≈øation commenced between Dep. and Judge; Dep. mentioned that a number of ≈øhares were unrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented, that the Judge by law might appoint agents for. That as Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> had made con≈øiderable advances to tho≈øe people who≈øe ≈øhares were unrepre≈øented. Dep. ≈øaid it would be an act of kindne≈øs to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> ≈øuch agent, as it would put it in his power to ≈øave the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney advanced,‚Äîand thought it would be a good te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the afore≈øaid reconciliation being effected.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027132_0023_0FD34E74D16A9E40"/>
The Judge con≈øented, and ≈øaid he would appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> and gave me leave ≈øo to inform <hi>M'C.</hi> and added, that ≈øuch appointments were lucrative to the receivers‚Äîand many had been done by him (the Judge) to owners of privateers; for which he had received no recompen≈øe. That Judge apprehended that on this occa≈øion the profits to Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> would be a ≈øufficient rea≈øon for him the ≈øaid <hi>M'C.</hi> to make him the Judge, a pre≈øent of a ≈øuit of cloaths, and Judge de≈øired Dep. would men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> Dep. <hi>afterwards ≈øaw M'C.</hi> and informed him, that the Judge had agreed to appoint him agent as afore≈øaid. <hi>M'C.</hi> a few days after mentioned to Dep. that in con≈øequence of the promi≈øe of the Judge, he had paid ≈øome of <hi>the</hi> ≈øaid ≈øeamen, who≈øe ≈øhares were unrepre≈øented, more money. Dep. made no mention of the Judge's expectations of a ≈øuit of cloaths, con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too delicate a matter.</p>
                           <p>Judge frequently a≈øked deponent whether he ≈øaid any thing about ≈øaid cloaths. Dep. evaded the an≈øwer, by ≈øaying he had no convenient opportunity. Thus the matter re≈øted for two weeks or three, when being at the Coffee-hou≈øe, I met the Judge there; he informed me that the letters of agency were made out‚Äîbut that Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øimons</hi> were appointed in≈øtead of <hi>M'C.</hi> Dep. felt ≈øurpri≈øed at the information, and remon≈øtrated with the Judge having de≈øired me, and mentioned the promi≈øe he (the Judge) had made of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>M'C.</hi>‚Äîand that Dep. ≈øaid, he had informed <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> of his intended appointment.</p>
                           <p>Judge ≈øaid he had a right to appoint whom he plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed‚Äîand the matter had now re≈øted two or three weeks, and that he had never heard of the deponents applying for the ≈øuit of cloaths‚Äîand thought him≈øelf neglected. Dep. felt wounded at his (the Judge'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                              </gap>) conduct, and told him (the J.) that he treated him ill, and left him.</p>
                           <p>A few days after, Judge came to Dep. hou≈øe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øed on what had pa≈ø≈øed, and attempted to vindicate him≈øelf, and ≈øaid that one thing he was mo≈øt ≈øorry for,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027132_0024_0FD34E789B6467C8"/>
viz. the reque≈øt to apply for the ≈øuit of cloaths, as by ≈øo doing he had put him≈øelf in his the Dep. power. Dep. told him that it depended on him≈øelf, that he was not di≈øpo≈øed to do any injury to him. Dep. and Judge then parted.</p>
                           <p>Cro≈øs examined. Dep. rather thinks no per≈øon was pre≈øent at the conver≈øation about ≈øuit of cloaths.</p>
                           <p>Judge took the Dep. to one ≈øide on the conver≈øation at the Coffee-hou≈øe. Dep. never told <hi>M'C.</hi> of the Judge's reque≈øt. Dept. don't know that the Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any reward from <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øimons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Dept. told his brother of the Judge's reque≈øt ≈øame day and Mr. <hi>Hazard,</hi> and don't know that it is cu≈øtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for the officers of the Court to receive pre≈øents, as he never received any him≈øelf.</p>

                        <hi>William Lewis</hi> being duly affirmed, ≈øaith, That ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months before the removal of the Mar≈øhal of the Admiralty of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> from his office, Mr. <hi>Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin≈øon,</hi> Judge of the ≈øaid court mentioned to this affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, ≈øome di≈øputes which had ari≈øen between them, and that there was one matter which perhaps the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhal might attempt to take advantage of, which was, that he had demanded a ≈øuit of cloaths for the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Blair M'Clenachan,</hi> agent for the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented ≈øhares of ≈øeamen‚Äîthat the truth of the matter was, he had propo≈øed or intended appointing him agent; but as it was a very lucrative office, which would put large ≈øums of money into his pocket, and as he the Judge was empowered by law to appoint whom he plea≈øed, and as the appointment was di≈øcretionary with him, he did not ≈øee why he ≈øhould give Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> ≈øuch an appointment without ≈øome compliment in return; that he thought a ≈øuit of cloaths but rea≈øonable, and had ≈øignified that he would appoint him, if he had a ≈øuit of cloaths, that ≈øome time elap≈øed without this being attended to, or any a≈ø≈øurance given of the ≈øaid ≈øuit of cloaths, and therefore he had appointed others.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> ≈øworn,‚Äîdoth depo≈øe and ≈øay, that he knows the Judge charged the Mar≈øhal before Council for ≈øelling prizes before condemnation, and without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he (Dep.) had formerly frequently applied to have orders for the ≈øale of ve≈ø≈øels before condemnation and procured them‚Äîbut under the pre≈øent law, the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027132_0028_0FD34E7DC6E71318"/>
Judge refu≈øed to give any orders but referred him to the Mar≈øhal, implying that he (Judge) would not take any notice thereof if made. That he (Dep.) did not think that ≈øuch application was wicked or unju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledges the paper No. 11 to be his, and under≈øtands the ≈øale of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo was ≈øtopped on that account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>B. M'Clenachan</hi> being ≈øworn in ≈øupport of the fir≈øt charge, depo≈øeth and ≈øaith, that he under≈øtood from Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> that he would be appointed an Agent for certain unrepre≈øented ≈øhares, but that he never ≈øoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the appointment and never heard any thing re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a pre≈øent of a ≈øuit of cloaths. That he had advanced con≈øiderable ≈øums of money to per≈øons own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unrepre≈øented ≈øhares, and ≈øettled the accounts with <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> the agents appointed by the Judge.</p>
                     <p>In ≈øupport of the 2d.</p>
                     <p>That on the propo≈øal of Mr. <hi>Miller</hi> he con≈øented to make a pre≈øent of a ca≈øk of wine to the Judge afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>That the order for delivering the ca≈øk mu≈øt have come from <hi>M. C.</hi> Judge never applied for it. That he did not intend the ≈øaid wine as a bribe, or to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Judge in an undue manner. That the Judge ever conducted him≈øelf in an upright manner to the be≈øt of Dep. knowledge‚Äîalways found Judge in his duty, and thought rather too ≈øevere‚Äî≈øigned a paper reque≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indulgence of the ≈øale of the <hi>Charlotte</hi>‚Äîno pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, nor bribe given for the indulgence.</p>
                     <p>In ≈øupport of the 3d.</p>
                     <p>That he with others petitioned as he thinks for the ≈øale of the <hi>Charlotte</hi> before condemnation, being ≈øuited for a privateer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andrew Robe≈øon</hi> ≈øworn ≈øaith, that he is Regi≈øter of the Court of Admiralty. That about the time that the Mar≈øhal made return that certain ≈øhares of ≈øeamen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027132_0029_0FD34E16D1B274E0"/>
to the privateer <hi>Holker</hi> were unrepre≈øented, the Judge mentioned his de≈øign to appoint ≈øuch agents.</p>
                     <p>The Judge then informed the Dep. in the cour≈øe of conver≈øation, that the Mar≈øhal ≈øhortly after applied to be agent‚ÄîTo which the Judge objected, as he (M.) was an officer of the Court, &amp;c.‚ÄîMar≈øhal urged it on the ≈øcore of friend≈øhip, &amp;c. but the Judge ≈øtill reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his the M's application. The matter laid ≈øo ≈øome time, when Ma. told Judge that it would an≈øwer as well to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> ≈øuch agent. Judge con≈øented to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> agent. That he the ≈øaid Judge, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ≈øeeing <hi>M'C.</hi> and he <hi>M'C.</hi> ≈øaying nothing on the ≈øubject, the Judge thought for ≈øeveral rea≈øons, it would be be≈øt to appoint ≈øome one el≈øe ≈øuch agent‚Äîfor if ≈øuch things were not worth a≈øking for, they were not receiving.</p>
                     <p>On que≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>Dept. in cour≈øe of conver≈øation heard the Judge ≈øay that <hi>Gover. Morris</hi> had declared that his <hi>(G. M.)</hi> father u≈øed to receive pre≈øents, and refu≈øed to proceed again≈øt Act of Parliament without; this was introduced as mere matter of chit-chat. After above conver≈øation ≈øome time, Judge informed Dep. that <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> were appointed the agents afore≈øaid, and de≈øired him to prepare bonds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>Dep. heard no more till the M's hearing before Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, when Mar≈øhal mentioned the ≈øub≈øtance of the fir≈øt charge. Judge told Dep. on conver≈øing with him on the ≈øubject, that M. agreed with him that there would be no impropriety in receiving a ≈øuit of cloaths for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of a di≈øcretionary, and not a judicial power, &amp;c.‚Äî But that afterwards the Judge told the M. that <hi>M'C's</hi> deportment and ≈øituation was ≈øuch that we would not appoint him the agent afore≈øaid. And he the Judge directed the M. not to mention the ≈øuit of cloaths, as he now viewed it rather in a different light. The Judge told him that <hi>M'C.</hi> and <hi>Miller</hi> had in his ab≈øence had ≈øent him (the Judge) a ca≈øk of wine, and never knew any thing of it until Mrs. <hi>Hopkin≈øon</hi> had informed him.</p>

2d charge.</p>
                     <p>M. told Dep. that Judge had received a pre≈øent as ≈øtated in 2d charge‚Äîthat Judge knew nothing of it till delivery, and then imagined it was a mi≈øtake. <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter's</hi> trial was tried after 14 days notice, the cargo was wine, he ≈øhewed from his minutes that the practice in this in≈øtance is not unu≈øual, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3d charge.</p>
                     <p>That in ≈øome ca≈øes of armed ve≈ø≈øels, orders i≈ø≈øued for apprai≈øement, &amp;c. that in the ca≈øe of the <hi>Charlotte,</hi> the Mar≈øhal adverti≈øed for ≈øale and ≈øold previous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but on the day the trial was to have been, which was deferred by the neglect of the owners to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure proper te≈øtimony, the Judge attended to forbid the ≈øale, but too late.</p>
                     <p>She was condemned 27th October, and ≈øold 2d Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember before.</p>
                     <p>4th charge.</p>
                     <p>In the ca≈øe of the <hi>Albion,</hi> a writ of ap‚Äî i≈ø≈øued previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the order of ≈øale, under a per≈øua≈øion that the cargo was peri≈øhable in its nature and much wanted. But the ≈øaid order for ≈øale was contradicted on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of certain in≈øpectors that it was not in danger, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thinks the Judge to <hi>be</hi> a per≈øon of great integrity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Miles Filborne</hi> being duly affirmed, ≈øaid, that he was one of the in≈øpectors of the cargo of the <hi>Charlotte;</hi> and when they made their report, that the cargo was in a peri≈øhing condition, ≈øome of the in≈øpectors ob≈øerved that it was a pity the ≈øhip ≈øhould be detained with forms, as ≈øhe would be a good privateer, &amp;c.‚ÄîThe Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that ≈øhe was ≈øo clearly a prize, that ≈øome of the forms might be di≈øpen≈øed with to expedite her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and ≈øale.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the in≈øpectors of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Hey≈øham</hi> being ≈øworn, depo≈øeth and ≈øaith, that he was one of three to in≈øpect the cargo of the ≈øhip <hi>Charlotte</hi>‚Äîthey (the in≈øpectors) waited on the Judge to

report, one of them ob≈øerved to the Judge that the ≈øhip was a good fa≈øt failing ve≈ø≈øel, and that ≈øeveral of the owners had expre≈ø≈øed their de≈øire that ≈øhe might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, and that they intended to buy and fit her out as a privateer.</p>
                     <p>The Judge an≈øwered it was a pity that ≈øuch a ≈øhip <hi>≈øhould</hi> be delayed. It would be ≈øerving the public to indulge them the owners, and that ≈øhe ≈øhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible‚Äîbut it could not be done without public adverti≈øement, and this is Saturday and it cannot be done till Tue≈øday, but I will grant every indulgence in my power, where the matter is clear.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the in≈øpectors of the cargo of the <hi>Albion,</hi> and they reported it well conditioned and in good order.</p>

                        <hi>William Budden</hi> being ≈øworn, ≈øaith, that he was one of three, that in≈øpected the cargo of the <hi>Charlotte</hi> and reported it in a peri≈øhing condition‚Äîthat ≈øome of the in≈øpectors ob≈øerved that the ≈øhip was a fa≈øt ≈øailing ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, and that the Judge ≈øaid the condemnation and ≈øale ≈øhould be expedited as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, but it could not be done without public notice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the in≈øpectors of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo, and reported it in good order.</p>

                           <p>THAT finding an enquiry in≈øtituted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the honorable <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon,</hi> 
                              <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> Judge of the Court of Admiralty, and your memoriali≈øt being of opinion, that the ≈øaid Judge has been guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and exacting fees beyond what are warranted by law, from the ≈øuitors in his court, he begs leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent the ≈øame with all humility to this honorable Hou≈øe. That the Act of A≈ø≈øembly of the twenty-≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of November, one thou≈øand ≈øeven hundred and ≈øeventy-nine, provides "That the fees of the Judge of Admiralty, including his fee for a final decree, in the ca≈øe of a ≈øhip or ve≈ø≈øel under the burthen of one hundred tons, ≈øhall be twenty-five bu≈øhels of wheat, and in the ca≈øe of a ≈øhip or ve≈ø≈øel above the burthen of one hundred tons, ≈øhall be forty bu≈øhels of ≈øuch wheat, payable however in money, as in the ca≈øe of the officers aforenamed." That your memoriali≈øt believes it will appear, that by law no more than five hundred pounds are due to the Judge in the ca≈øe of a ve≈ø≈øel under one hundred tons, but that neverthele≈øs more than double that ≈øum are continually charged and received, as the Judge's ≈øee in ≈øuch ca≈øes. That your memoriali≈øt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with tran≈ømits an authentic copy of a bill of co≈øts, which has been ≈øome time ≈øince paid, as he is informed, and believes, in the ca≈øe of the <hi>Recovery,</hi> a ≈ømall prize taken by <hi>Job Pray,</hi> in the employ of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Hugh Hodge,</hi> which was of the burthen of only eighty tons, and which was libelled by your memoriali≈øt. That the charge of <hi>thirteen hundred pounds</hi> in this ca≈øe has been complained of by your memoriali≈øt's clients, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be extortionate; yet the like charges will be found in a variety of other in≈øtances, if recour≈øe be had
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027132_0039_0FD34E6C0DC8C348"/>
to the bills of co≈øts on the files of the Regi≈øter, or in the hands of the late Mar≈øhal. That your memoriali≈øt begs leave to in≈øtance particularly in the ca≈øe or the <hi>Fame,</hi> which was al≈øo libelled by your memoriali≈øt, and lately condemned, being a ≈ømall ve≈ø≈øel owned by <hi>Jo≈øeph Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> and others, re-taken by the <hi>Fair American</hi> priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer. That if this honorable Hou≈øe ≈øhould find upon enquiry, as your memoriali≈øt is induced to believe they will find, that the ≈øaid Judge has been guilty of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than his due, in the≈øe and other in≈øtances, he humbly hopes the ≈øaid Judge will be called upon to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer for the ≈øame along with the other charges exhibited again≈øt him.

return to him the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon,</hi> as Judge of the Court of Admiralty; of certain unrepre≈øented ≈øhares in prizes taken by the privateer called the <hi>Holker,</hi> ≈øoon after which the ≈øaid <hi>Matthew Clark≈øon</hi> came to him the ≈øaid Judge, and de≈øired he might be appointed agent for the ≈øaid unrepre≈øented ≈øhares (the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> then being in intimate friend≈øhip with the ≈øaid <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Clark≈øon)</hi> but the ≈øaid Judge cautiou≈øly declined giving him the ≈øaid <hi>Clark≈øon</hi> the agency reque≈øted; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving to him that the offices of agent and mar≈øhal appeared to be incompatible, and reque≈øting the ≈øaid Mar≈øhal not to urge a compliance with his de≈øire, as ≈øuch an appointment would probably bring cen≈øure on both.</p>
                     <p>Neverthele≈øs the ≈øaid <hi>Matthew Clark≈øon</hi> continued to urge the appointment for two or three days, pleading the poverty of his office, declaring the profits thereof did not pay his Clerk, and alledging that the Judge ought from motives of friend≈øhip to throw any little advantage in his way that might occur from the rights of his office.</p>
                     <p>But the Judge ≈øtill declined the reque≈øt from a ≈øen≈øe of impropriety and apprehen≈øion of cen≈øure. At length the ≈øaid Mar≈øhal told the Judge that finding him ≈øo very nice and difficult, he had been with Mr. <hi>Blair M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan,</hi> and made up matters with him; ≈øo that if the Judge would give the agency to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> of the ≈øhares in que≈øtion, it would an≈øwer his (the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhal's) purpo≈øe and intere≈øt ju≈øt as well.</p>
                     <p>The Judge, happy to be rid of the embarra≈ø≈øments he was under on the ≈øcore of friend≈øhip, gave the ≈øaid <hi>Matthew,</hi> then Mar≈øhal, rea≈øon to believe (but no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute promi≈øe) that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed agent.</p>
                     <p>Thus matters re≈øted for ≈øome days, after which the Judge being at the Mar≈øhal's, and they alone in friendly conference; the Judge informed the Mar≈øhal, that a thought had ju≈øt occurred which he would in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence mention, reque≈øting his opinion thereupon, and declaring he would be bound by it. And then ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027132_0045_0FD34EA884465858"/>
to the Mar≈øhal that he was about to throw into Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> hands, many thou≈øand pounds, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the agency.</p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had wrought him much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his office, had never ≈øhewn civility of any kind, and even neglected the common compliment of his hat, when they met. That he heard much of Mr. <hi>M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan's</hi> politene≈øs and genero≈øity to other per≈øons and ≈øubmitted it, whether it would not be as proper, if Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øhould make him a pre≈øent of a ≈øuit of cloaths, as well as to other per≈øons who had not been as beneficent to him or done him ≈øuch ≈øub≈øtantial favours, and finally ob≈øerved that this was a matter of delicacy and doubt. To which the Mar≈øhal replied, that in common ju≈øtice Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ought to make ≈øome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for ≈øo con≈øiderable a favour‚Äîthat there was no impropriety or indelicacy in the Judge's receiving ≈øuch a pre≈øent, ≈øhould it be offered; the appointment to an agency not being a judicial act, but a voluntary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court; no more conver≈øation of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance pa≈ø≈øed at that time on the ≈øubject.</p>
                     <p>Some days after, the Judge a≈øked the Mar≈øhal whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had ever mentioned any thing of this affair to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> who replied that he had not had a favorable opportunity, and the≈øe were the only times in which the matter was touched upon; excepting that ≈øome ≈øhort time after the Judge thinking on further con≈øideration that the thing was improper, declared his better ≈øentiments to the Mar≈øhal, and ab≈øolutely forbid him proceeding in it. But told the Mar≈øhal he ≈øhould expect Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> would at lea≈øt a≈øk the Judge for the agency, a ceremony he never di≈øpen≈øed with‚Äîas he thought the favour worth a≈øking for, if worth po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øing; and declared he would never make the favours of his office ≈øo cheap as to force them on per≈øons who would not conde≈øcend to reque≈øt them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> however neglecting to a≈øk for the agency in que≈øtion, the Judge frequently urged this ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent to the Mar≈øhal, which circum≈øtance the ≈øaid
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027132_0046_0FD34E03E5793F18"/>
Mar≈øhal hath in his depo≈øition fal≈øely and maliciou≈øly applied to the ≈øuit of cloaths, all ideas of which had long ≈øince been totally di≈øcarded by the Judge. After this, above a fortnight pa≈ø≈øed, in all which time Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never called upon the Judge, or gave the lea≈øt intimation that the agency would be acceptable to him. The matter was al≈øo dropped by the Mar≈øhal, who ≈øeemed rather to avoid any conver≈øation on the ≈øubject. In the interim, other rea≈øons occurred to the Judge for not appointing Mr. <hi>M'Clenochan</hi> agent, one of which was, that he was a principal owner of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and another, becau≈øe the Mar≈øhal having had great good fortune in the arrival of a valuable prize (the <hi>Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> taken by one of his privateers, the Judge thought the agency was no longer an object with him: And la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becau≈øe the Judge on reflection thought him≈øelf right in refu≈øing to make the Mar≈øhal agent, but found it would be continuing the ≈øub≈øtance, only altering the form, in appointing Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> agent, knowing that it was to ≈øerve the purpo≈øe and intere≈øt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhal.</p>
                     <p>For all the≈øe rea≈øons, and to relieve him≈øelf at once from ≈øurrounding difficulties, he finally gave the agency to Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øimons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not to be wondered at that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> did not apply for the agency. As it appears ≈øince, that he was totally ignorant of the whole affair; Mr. <hi>Clark≈øon</hi> having never mentioned the matter to him at all, till after the appointment of Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> having impo≈øed a fal≈øhood on the Judge to ≈øerve his own avaricious purpo≈øes.</p>
                     <p>As to the ≈øecond charge, the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon</hi> ≈øaith, that the ≈øhip <hi>Albion</hi> was captured in the North ≈øeas by two ve≈ø≈øels belonging to <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> 
                        <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ≈øent into this port and libelled here. It appeared from her papers exhibited to the Judge that her cargo was altogether ≈øalt, being eight or nine thou≈øand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhels. A claim was al≈øo filed on behalf of her Maje≈øty the Empre≈øs of <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia;</hi> as ≈øalt was ≈øcarce at that time,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027132_0047_0FD34E79723FB178"/>
the Judge hoping to do a public ≈øervice without injury to any individual, waited on Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> and ob≈øerved to him, that as a claim was filed, the deci≈øion might be dilatory, that if the cargo waited till condemnation, it would be di≈øtributed in kind, and ≈øo fall into the hands of a few. That he thought ≈øalt water-born, and after ≈øo long a voyage might properly be con≈øidered as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhable article, and ≈øold by vendue before condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Act of A≈ø≈øembly; and that it would be very popular and a public good, if this ≈øalt ≈øhould be ≈øold in ≈ømall lots, ≈øo that the hou≈øe-keepers might have an opportunity of ≈øupplying them≈øelves rea≈øonably.</p>
                     <p>To this Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> after a day's interval con≈øented, and a writ of ≈øale in the common form was i≈ø≈øued, and the ≈øalt adverti≈øed to be ≈øold. His Excellency the Pre≈øident ≈øeeing the adverti≈øment, took offence and wrote to the Mar≈øhal on the ≈øubject. The Judge on ≈øeeing this letter waited on the Pre≈øident and declared his motives.</p>
                     <p>The Pre≈øident ob≈øerved that if the law was inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, methods might be taken to have it amended; but that whil≈øt it was the law, it ought to be held ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; and that ≈øalt could not be con≈øidered as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhable article within the meaning of the Act. The Judge, in deference to the Pre≈øident's opinion, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered a ≈øurvey; and on the report of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, that the cargo was not in a peri≈øhable condition, countermanded the ≈øale, and the cargo remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched 'till after condemnation.</p>
                     <p>And the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon,</hi> by and under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation, that the ≈øaid articles, and the matter in the ≈øame contained are not ≈øufficient in law to maintain the afore≈øaid impeachment again≈øt him; and ≈øaving to him≈øelf (and which he prayeth may be ≈øaved to him) both now and at all times hereafter, all and all manner of benefit and advantage of exception to the in≈øufficiency of the ≈øaid articles in point of law: Neverthele≈øs for plea thereto he ≈øaith, that he is in no wi≈øe guilty of all or any the crimes, offences or mi≈ødemeanors, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                     <p>A letter from <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon,</hi> 
                        <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> Judge of the Court of Admiralty ≈øtiled, An An≈øwer to the third article of impeachment exhibited again≈øt him by the Hou≈øe of General A≈ø≈øembly, was read, as follows, viz.</p>
                     <p>And the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon</hi> in an≈øwer to the third article of impeachment brought again≈øt him, ≈øaith:‚Äî</p>
                     <p>That it hath been the ≈øtated cu≈øtom for the Regi≈øter of the Court of Admiralty to draw out and deliver to the Mar≈øhal, the bills of co≈øts, in every cau≈øe, and for the Mar≈øhal to collect and account with the Judge for the ≈øum total of his the Judge's fees. That during his being in office he hath never ≈øeen a bill of co≈øts in any cau≈øe whatever, or ever heard any complaints made of his fees being illegal or oppre≈ø≈øive.</p>
                     <p>That he hath never conver≈øed on the ≈øubject with any per≈øon whatever, one in≈øtance only excepted, viz. When early in office a cau≈øe of a per≈øonal nature, where no ve≈ø≈øel was concerned, coming before him, he a≈øked the Regi≈øter, How the fees were to be adju≈øted in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, as the Act of A≈ø≈øembly ≈øeemed to refer to ve≈ø≈øels of certain tons burthen. To which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter replied, That for ≈øervices not referred to in the Act, the cu≈øtom was to charge the fees according to the ancient rates, allowing 40 for one for depreciation. To which ≈øy≈øtem the Judge gave his a≈ø≈øent, and acquie≈øcence as rea≈øonable and right: That the Judge never undertook to determine, what might be ≈øervices included in the Act, and what not. That as no comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laints were ever made, he thought all was right and no injury done. That in the ca≈øe exhibited by the honorable Hou≈øe of A≈ø≈øembly of the brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> neither the captors or any per≈øon concerned, ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Judge to have the bill of co≈øts ≈øcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027132_0050_0FD34EAA171D7330"/>
or ≈øugge≈øted to the Judge, or to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to his knowledge, that they thought them≈øelves ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved. That in the ca≈øe of the ≈øaid brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> many courts were held by adjournment, and arguments had of a complex and difficult nature; that be≈øides the pro≈øecution of the libel by the captors, a claim was filed by <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> 
                        <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> on principles entirely new, and which had nothing to do with the ≈øimple capture and condemnation of the prize; and that in the ≈øaid cau≈øe al≈øo two or more courts were held and depo≈øitions taken, &amp;c. on the trial of two negroes for freedom or ≈ølavery, and al≈øo on agency appointed, for all which ≈øervices, the Regi≈øter hath, as the Judge is informed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, charged the former cu≈øtomary fees and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exchange of 40 for one. That the Judge can and will produce undoubted te≈øtimony that he hath never been covetous of his fees, or made any efforts to enlarge and encrea≈øe them beyond the bounds of ju≈øtice and moderation: On the contrary hath always ≈øhewn a ready di≈øpo≈øition to ≈øave expence to parties by ≈øhortening the time for condemnation in clear ca≈øes; by remitting his fees in ca≈øes of poverty and ≈ømall property, and in one in≈øtance by ≈øuffering eight ve≈ø≈øels (of ≈ømall value) to be included in one libel; for the avoiding of expence; where he might legally and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have in≈øi≈øted on eight ≈øeparate libels, to his great emolument.</p>
                     <p>And finally that this third article of impeachment is grounded on an opinion as to the con≈øtruction of an Act of A≈ø≈øembly; for which the Judge is not impeachable; and that the Judge hath all probable rea≈øon to ≈øuppo≈øe that his opinion was right; as no p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And the ≈øaid <hi>Francis Hopkin≈øon</hi> prays that this his an≈øwer to the third article of impeachment, may be annexed to, and incorporated with his an≈øwer to the two former articles, and to have reference to his former

                     <p>Some time early in la≈øt May, the Mar≈øhal, Mr. <hi>Clark≈øon,</hi> made a return that there were certain ≈øhares for whom there were no agents, of ≈øome of the <hi>Holker's</hi> crew. Within a few days after I ≈øaw the Judge, who told me the Mar≈øhal had applied to him for the agency of the≈øe ≈øhares.

                        <p>In June la≈øt Mr. <hi>Hopkin≈øon</hi> called at our counting-hou≈øe, and offered the hou≈øe of <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øimons</hi> the agency of the unrepre≈øented ≈øhares, which they agreed to accept and entered on the bu≈øine≈øs. Afterwards applied to the Mar≈øhal for the monies due them, and had a li≈øt amounting to 26¬Ω on one ve≈ø≈øel, and 23¬Ω on another. On applying to the Mar≈øhal he ≈øeemed di≈ø≈øatisfied, ≈øaid the agency had been di≈øpo≈øed of or promi≈øed, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurs taken in con≈øequence of that promi≈øe and money paid thereupon. Upon receiving this an≈øwer I informed the Judge, he ≈øaid there had been ≈øome ≈øuch promi≈øe, but that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never had applied regularly for an appointment, and on further con≈øideration he did not think it proper to appoint one who was ≈øo largely concerned in privateers, that witne≈øs offered to re≈øign the agency, if the Judge, Mar≈øhal &amp;c. could agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them≈øelves. The Judge declined this propo≈øition, that Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> was improper and could not have it, that if they decline ≈øome other per≈øons mu≈øt have it, they might therefore as well keep it. We wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Mar≈øhal, informing him that the appointment was un≈øolicited, but as it was given they would wi≈øh to proceed in the bu≈øine≈øs.

                        <p>They afterwards met at the Judge's hou≈øe on the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs, when a compromi≈øe was agreed to, which was, that all the monies <hi>M'C.</hi> could ≈øhew he had paid on the unrepre≈øented ≈øhares ≈øhould be paid to him, and the balances to be paid to Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>Fitz≈øimons.</hi>

                     <p>IT is not u≈øual to enter into the rea≈øons of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon occa≈øions of this kind, but the importance of the pre≈øent pro≈øecution makes it nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>In the fir≈øt place it is ob≈øervable, that the commi≈ø≈øion of the Judge is during good behaviour; crimes only are cau≈øes of removal‚Äîthe cau≈øe is of great importance as it re≈øpects the officer, and as it comes from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatives of the people.</p>
                     <p>It certainly is of the greate≈øt con≈øequence, that the ≈øtreams of ju≈øtice be kept pure‚ÄîWe act in the double capacity of Judges and Jury‚ÄîIt therefore became our duty, and we have examined minutely into the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence‚ÄîIt is immaterial from what motives the pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution has originated, any farther than to determine how far it may affect the credibility of the witne≈ø≈øes‚Äî perhaps few public pro≈øecutions have taken their ri≈øe from pure regard to the public good, nor is it of any con≈øequence with what views the A≈ø≈øembly forwarded the impeachment‚ÄîWhether it is ≈øupported, is the only object of our enquiry‚ÄîThe cau≈øe has been ably argued on both ≈øides.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>The Pre≈øident then read the fir≈øt article.</p>

does not ≈øtate the ≈øuit of cloaths as a condition, or <hi>≈øine qua non,</hi> without which Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> was not to have the agency; ≈øeveral circum≈øtances ≈øeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what the Judge ≈øays, that he mentioned this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a thought that had occurred to him, and by way of taking the opinion of his friend upon it‚ÄîThe Judge and Mr. <hi>Clark≈øon</hi> were at that time intimate friends‚Äî he took no notice of it, until after the Judge had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained again≈øt him. He was exceedingly di≈øgu≈øted at the agency not being given to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi>‚Äîit ≈øeems ≈øtrange if he thought this had been made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he made no mention of it in his complaints. Either the Mar≈øhal approved the pro≈øecution or he did not‚Äîif he did not, why not ≈øay ≈øo.

                     <p>In the next place, tho' Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect any countermand, yet as the Judge gave the agency to Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Meade</hi> &amp; <hi>Fitz≈øimons,</hi> not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any compliment, but as no hint or ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtion was made that any ≈øuch was expected, this looks like confirmatory of the repre≈øentation made by the Judge.

                     <p>There are in almo≈øt all offices compen≈øatory as well as ≈øpecific fees.‚ÄîIn fee laws, laws made for the regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fees of officers, it is very difficult to enumerate all the ≈øervices. In ≈øuch ca≈øes compen≈øatory fees mu≈øt be allowed, or the nece≈ø≈øary bu≈øine≈øs will not be done. There is a great difference between exacting more than the ≈øpecific fees, and a≈øking fees for ≈øervices where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is provided.‚ÄîBut it is ≈øaid that the law on which this charge is founded, intended to have excluded all other fees except the wheat. But every part of this law was not attended to. In a preceding paragraph it is ≈øaid, that the fees of the ≈øaid officers ≈øhall be e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and paid according to the price of good mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable wheat in the manner following, that is to ≈øay, the ≈øaid fees as they were regulated by law or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice under the late government of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> before the fir≈øt day of July one thou≈øand ≈øeven hundred and ≈øeventy-≈øix, ≈øhall from and after the publication of this Act be ≈øatisfied in good merchantable wheat; accounting and allowing that a bu≈øhel of ≈øuch wheat, weighing at lea≈øt ≈øixty pounds, ≈øold formerly in times of war and difficulty for ten Shillings. The fifth paragraph menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that this former one ≈øhall extend to the Judge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter and Mar≈øhal of the Court of Admiralty.</p>
                     <p>It appears therefore in this very law, the principle of making a difference between ≈øpecific and compen≈øatory fees was adopted‚Äîformerly by an Act of Parliament, the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027132_0072_0FD34ED4D99D5F80"/>
Judges of the court of Admiralty in the then province of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> were allowed ¬£. 15 ≈øterling for every ve≈ø≈øel above 100 tons, and ¬£ 10 for every ve≈ø≈øel below that burthen‚Äîas the ≈øame number of tons is mentioned in this Act of A≈ø≈øembly, as applied to the twenty-five bu≈øhels of wheat and the forty, it ≈øeems probable that this was intended in lieu of tho≈øe ≈øums. On this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction the law is con≈øi≈øtent and complete, and the law and practice agree, and it mu≈øt appear that the ¬£ 1300 taken by the Judge exceeds what he was entitled to by this mode of computation‚Äîhere were three cau≈øes; the fir≈øt, libel to decide prize or no prize‚Äîthat is the object of the law‚Äîthen the claim by Mr. <hi>Morris</hi>‚Äîthen the negroes; the≈øe are three as di≈øtinct cau≈øes as if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to different ve≈ø≈øels. At this rate the fees would have amounted to ¬£ 1320‚Äîbut ≈øuppo≈øe the matter had not ≈øtood entirely on this ground, and that it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the ¬£ 1300 was a ≈øum beyond what the Judge was entitled to, ≈øtill the charge is not, that he <hi>received</hi> too much, but that he <hi>exacted</hi> too much. We do not ≈øay, that the Judge ought not to take care of his officers ‚ÄîBut an inadvertence of this kind would not be a ground for rendering a man infamous for life. On looking into the authorities we found they all run in this ≈øtile‚Äî that the Judges exacted‚Äîthat bu≈øine≈øs was kept back and delays affected until the money was paid‚Äî≈øuppo≈øe the court wrong, they ought not to be immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuted in a criminal way, but complaint ≈øhould be made, and if they will not rectify the mi≈øtake, then it will be proper to pur≈øue in a cour≈øe of ju≈øtice‚Äîat the ≈øame time we take this opportunity to ≈øay, that the fees of the court of Admiralty have increa≈øed lately extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not in the time of the pre≈øent Judge; indeed, he took things as he found them; as to the agency I do not conceive it to be the ≈øpirit and meaning of the act of A≈ø≈øembly, that one ≈øhould be appointed to every ve≈ø≈øel where there are unrepre≈øented ≈øhares‚Äîthe holding of courts for mini≈øterial purpo≈øes is wrong al≈øo‚Äîthis practice has taken ri≈øe within four or five years‚Äîit's

When this is done, if on complaint made, errors are not rectified, there will be a proper ground for criminal pro≈øecution. UPON THE WHOLE, WE ARE UNANIMOUSLY OF OPINION THAT THE JUDGE OUGHT TO BE ACQUITTED UPON ALL THE THREE CHARGES.</p>

But hath he ob≈øerved the≈øe directions? no; if you look at his accounts No. 13, you will find that he hath been di≈øpo≈øing thereof of his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in a former account he hath di≈øpo≈øed of far the greater part of the whole continental money on like authority, and he had even the confidence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to me that he knew, at the time he did it that it was not authorized by the Legi≈ølature.

                           <p>"I HAVE read with attention the letter of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Trea≈øury of the U. S. dated 21 Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1791, and the two letters of the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dated 24th December, 1791, and 29th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1792, relative to the con≈øtruction of the 18th ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act of Congre≈øs making provi≈øion for the debt of the U. S. It appears to me that the word <hi>"tho≈øe"</hi> in the enacting part of the clau≈øe can only apply to the certificates i≈ø≈øued by the State, but as that never could be the meaning of the Act of Congre≈øs, I agree that the con≈øtruction given by the Secretary is the only rational one. Be that as it may, it is very certain that neither the New-Loan certificates of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> remaining in circulation, nor the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in exchange for which the≈øe New-Loans had been i≈ø≈øued, have been ≈øurrendered to the U. S.‚ÄîIt is not le≈øs certain that the payment of intere≈øt, whether to the ≈øtate or to individuals has not been ≈øu≈øpended, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027132_0083_0FD34E5842A59CC0"/>
≈øu≈øpen≈øion to the ≈øtate is but temporary, and ari≈øes merely from the exten≈øion of the former law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs by their Act of la≈øt May, and will of cour≈øe cea≈øe on the fir≈øt of March next, (if the former objections are not revived) and of cour≈øe it mu≈øt have appeared to the ≈øatisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury that all the New-Loan certificates have been re-exchanged or redeemed. To have con≈øidered them as ≈øuch is I ≈øuppo≈øe, what the Comptroller means by the "equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deci≈øion" of the Secretary. It is however of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us to know what were the real grounds of that deci≈øion, as it is po≈ø≈øible that the ≈øub≈øcription made lately in New-Loan certificates to the loan of the U. S. may affect it materially. For if the Secretary con≈øidered the whole of the New-Loan certificates as actually re-exchanged or redeemed, it mu≈øt have been, becau≈øe the ≈øtate law which entitled the holders to ≈øuch an exchange might been ≈øuppo≈øed to have been altogether carried into effect, ≈øince not a ≈øingle of tho≈øe certificates had been offered for ≈øub≈øcription to the loan of the U. S. But as ≈øome have been offered ≈øince the exten≈øion of the loan took place, that circum≈øtance may induce him to alter his opinion, and indeed I cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand how he may ≈øuppo≈øe him≈øelf ju≈øtifiable in looking upon the whole amount as being actually re-exchanged, whil≈øt he has got it in proof, that ≈øome of them are not ≈øo. Upon the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øion I ≈øhould be led to think that the Secretary having once declared (by his allowing the intere≈øt not to be ≈øu≈øpended) that the whole amount was re-exchanged (and that upon the information of the ≈øtate officer) will now look upon them in the ≈øame light and return them as not a≈ø≈øumable, an opinion which I think, may al≈øo be ≈øupported on different ground both from the nature of the certificates them≈øelves and from the ≈øtate law of 1789, which declared the ≈øtate not to be liable for the payment of the principal.</p>
                           <p>"However as the whole of this rea≈øoning is mo≈øtly conjectural, as the deci≈øion of the Secretary may, under the pre≈øent circum≈øtances, lead him to ≈øu≈øpend the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to prevent intere≈øt from being twice paid on what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally con≈øtituted one debt; an event which could not in this ca≈øe happen; as it appeared incon≈øi≈øtent with equity, that the ≈øtate ≈øhould be required to ≈øurrender the certificates which were the ≈øole con≈øideration for which they had become indebted to their citizens when no equivalent had been ≈øtipulated therefor by the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States; as ≈øuch a ≈øurrender would defeat the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by the ≈øtate for effecting a re-exchange of the out≈øtanding certificates, and a ju≈øt ≈øettlement with their creditors, as a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the payment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt on the a≈ø≈øumed debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> would prove highly injurious to the rights of individuals; and la≈øtly, as it appeared to me that the terms and intent of the law could be ≈øatisfied without a≈ø≈øuming a con≈øtruction liable to the ≈øtrong objections before ≈øtated, I could not he≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to determine, that a ≈øurrender on the part of the ≈øtate was not nece≈ø≈øary.</p>

If however the New-Loan certificates are not by the laws of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> con≈øidered as <hi>debts,</hi> but merely as receipts for certificates of the United States, which may be demanded at plea≈øure‚Äîthen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general rule of con≈øtruction, the New-Loan certificates of the ≈øtate will not be con≈øidered as receivable on loan to the United States, and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored to the ≈øub≈øcribers.</p>

                           <p>"It having been previou≈øly arranged with the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Trea≈øury, that the ab≈øtracts with receipts a≈ø≈øigned to the Commonwealth, ≈øhould be ≈øufficient to authori≈øe the proper officers of the United States to i≈ø≈øue the certificates to be granted thereon, direct to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.

The ≈øub≈øcribing ≈øtate creditors pre≈øented a li≈øt, together with the certificates, to the Comptroller-General, who examined and certified their a≈ø≈øumable and genuine quality, without de≈øcribing the kind of debt; on which certificate the officer of loans granted the party a receipt on an ab≈øtract, which ab≈øtract and receipt were generally pre≈øented to this office, and a≈ø≈øigned to the commonwealth. An examination with re≈øpect to the ca≈øting and intere≈øt took place, and ≈øubmitted to the Comptroller for his examination and approbation, when, if approved by him, a certificate to the Governor from his office, was ≈øent to this office, of the amount of the redeemable debt and intere≈øt, which was counter≈øigned by the Regi≈øter, and ≈øent to the Secretary, on which a warrant i≈ø≈øued on the Trea≈øury.</p>

                           <p>Ab≈øtract, No. 262, was ≈øent in the ≈øame manner from the Comptroller's office, entered in this the 9th July, and a warrant i≈ø≈øued on the 12th, and was entered the 14th in this office.</p>
                           <p>"Ab≈øtract, No. 272, was pre≈øented by Mr. <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> on the 17th July, which was the fir≈øt time I knew of any New-Loans being ≈øub≈øcribed to the Loan of the United States, and not before. A conference took place between Comptroller and Regi≈øter, in which it was ≈øtated by the Comptroller, that they were within the Act of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and were certainly redeemable. In this I concurred, provided the conditions ≈øtipulated by the Act of the United States, could be complied with: This he ob≈øerved was a matter of the United States, and that he had or would con≈øult the Secretary of the Trea≈øury on the bu≈øine≈øs.</p>

much of this bu≈øine≈øs, and that it was wrong, in which the Attorney-General agreed with him‚ÄîThat he would put the que≈øtion in writing to him, and tran≈ømit official directions for my government.</p>

                     <p>The bu≈øine≈øs progre≈ø≈øed in this manner until the 3d of April, when the committee on ways and means made the following report, viz.</p>
                     <p>The committee on Ways and Means to whom were referred ≈øundry letters and documents relative to the ≈øub≈øcription to the Loan propo≈øed by the United States, and the ≈øub≈øequent redemption of ≈øundry certificates, formerly i≈ø≈øued under the authority of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and commonly called New-Loan, report on that ≈øubject‚Äî</p>

the certificate and certificates which they ≈øhall receive from the United States, in con≈øequence of ≈øuch ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription, or all and ≈øingular the intere≈øts and benefits to be derived from ≈øuch other provi≈øion, together with the proper evidences thereof.</p>
                     <p>That by the arrangements taken in con≈øequence of the law of Congre≈øs, extending the terms of their former loan, no certificates could i≈ø≈øue in favor of the ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, prior to the 1≈øt day of May 1793; whereupon, it having been agreed that the receipts given by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner of loan, to the ≈øub≈øcribing ≈øtate creditors, ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øigned to the commonwealth, and that the certificates from the Loan-office, ≈øhould i≈ø≈øue directly to the commonwealth; the bu≈øine≈øs was conducted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the following regulations: When the holder of any ≈øtate-certificate or certificates, wi≈øhed to ≈øub≈øcribe the ≈øame to the loan propo≈øed by Congre≈øs, and to avail him≈øelf of the benefit of the above-mentioned law of the commonwealth, pa≈ø≈øed in April 1792, he pre≈øented ≈øuch certificate or certificates, with an ab≈øtract of the ≈øame, ≈øpecifying the number, date, by whom and to whom i≈ø≈øued, and the amount of the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, to the Comptroller- General, who after examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation certified on the face of the ab≈øtract, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were genuine and a≈ø≈øumable. The ab≈øtract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then pre≈øented to the commi≈ø≈øioner of loan, and the certificates them≈øelves depo≈øited with him, the commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioner gave to the party a receitps for the ≈øame on the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtract. The ab≈øtract and receipt were then a≈ø≈øigned to the commonwealth, and pre≈øented to the Regi≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Comptroller-General for examination, and if approved, a certificate ≈øigned by the two officers, was ≈øent to the Governor, ≈øtating the amount due to the party, and a warrant for the ≈øame, thereupon i≈ø≈øued according to law.</p>
                     <p>That among≈øt other ab≈øtracts thus declared to be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumable by the Comptroller, which pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øeveral offices, and the nominal amount of which (including both principal and intere≈øt,) was con≈øequently paid to the re≈øpective holders out of the State-Trea≈øury, there

were ≈øundry certificates of that de≈øcription commonly called New-Loan, and which were i≈ø≈øued by virtue of an Act, entitled <q>An Act for the further relief of the public creditors, who are citizens of this ≈øtate, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving on loan certain debts of the United States of <hi>America,</hi> and for funding the ≈øame, and for paying the annual intere≈øt of ≈øuch loans, and the intere≈øt of certain debts of this ≈øtate, every ≈øix months,</q> pa≈ø≈øed on the fir≈øt day of March 1786; part of which Act was repealed by the Act, entitled <q>An Act to repeal ≈øo much of any Act or Acts of A≈ø≈øembly of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the intere≈øt thereof, beyond the 1≈øt day of April next, and for other purpo≈øes therein mentioned,</q> pa≈ø≈øed on the 27th day of March 1789, wherein it is enacted that the continental certificates received by the ≈øtate by virtue of the former Act, ≈øhall be returned to the holders of New-Loan certificates, upon their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ≈øame, and that "≈øo much of every Act or Acts of General A≈ø≈øembly as directs or ≈øecures the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal ≈øum or ≈øums, in the ≈øaid certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or any of them mentioned, or of the intere≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beyond the term of four years, ≈øhall be, and the ≈øame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</p>
                     <p>That the total amount of the New-Loan certificates thus redeemed by the ≈øtate, at their nominal value, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the intere≈øt, amounts to 63,075 dollars and 37 cents; 60,220 dollars and 41 cents of which, were ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed in the name, and of cour≈øe appear to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>John Nichol≈øon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The committee are of opinion that the Comptroller-General, in the above-mentioned tran≈øactions, has been guilty of a high mi≈ødemeanor:‚Äî</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt. By certifying the a≈ø≈øumable quantity of the New-Loan certificates; the greater part of the ≈øame being his own property.</p>
                     <p>Second, By pa≈ø≈øing and certifying the ≈øame to the Executive in the u≈øual forms of office; thereby cau≈øing them to be redeemed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:027132_0094_0FD34EEE62042CF8"/>The opinion of the committee on the fir≈øt point, is founded upon the following con≈øiderations‚Äî</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. They conceive, that ≈øince the Act of March 1789, above mentioned, the New-Loan certificates cea≈øed to be a ≈øtate debt; were not, therefore, within the a≈ø≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and could not be ≈øub≈øcribed to the loan propo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatever the deci≈øion of the officers of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury of the United States might be on the preceding po≈øition, as it was not, by law, the official duty of the Comptroller-General to decide on it, he ought not to have done ≈øo, when a deci≈øion given under the colour of office operated in his own favor, at the expence of the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. In certifying the New-Loan certificates to be a≈ø≈øumable, he neither con≈øulted the Regi≈øter-General, nor communicated the tran≈øaction to the Governor; and as neither the ab≈øtracts on the face of which the a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity was certified, nor the official certificates on which warrants were i≈ø≈øued, did di≈øcriminate the kind of debt that was redeemed; the checks provided by law were thereby de≈øtroyed, and the other officers of the ≈øtate deluded into error.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. The Comptroller-General knew, by a former deci≈øion of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury of the United States, that at all events the New-Loan certificates could not be recognized as a≈ø≈øumable, unle≈øs an equal amount of continental certificates was delivered to the Secretary afore≈øaid; which no law authori≈øed the Comptroller to do: and he was appri≈øed that the payment of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt to the ≈øub≈øcribing ≈øtate creditors and to the ≈øtate, on account of the a≈ø≈øumption, would have been ≈øu≈øpended, when the time limited for receiving ≈øub≈øcriptions to the former loan of Congre≈øs expired, had it not, upon inve≈øtigation, appeared that no New-Loan certificates had been ≈øub≈øcribed.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of the committee on the ≈øecond point, ari≈øes from con≈øidering that, independent of the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the a≈ø≈øumption of the United States, they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable by the Act of April 1792? and this appears from the following con≈øiderations‚Äî</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. No funds were provided by the Act for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of tho≈øe certificates.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The ≈øixth ≈øection of the Act can only be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a provi≈øo and exception to the preceding ≈øections by which the redemption of certain de≈øcriptions of debts, which do not include the New-Loan certificates, were exclu≈øively and ≈øolely contemplated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. Even the ≈øixth ≈øection, ≈øuppo≈øing it to ≈øtand alone, cannot admit of the con≈øtruction given by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, as it de≈øignates only ≈øtate-creditors, and by the exi≈øting laws of the commonwealth, the holders of New-Loan certificates are declared not to be ≈øuch.</p>

                        </gap>ral view of the ≈øubject, the committee deem it their duty to pre≈øent the following re≈øolutions to the con≈øideration of the Hou≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Re≈øolved,</hi> That <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of this commonwealth, be impeached for a high mi≈ødemeanor in his office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Re≈øolved,</hi> That the Attorney-General be directed to in≈øtitute a ≈øuit again≈øt the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> to recover, for the u≈øe of the commonwealth, the amount of the New-Loan certificates, which have been redeemed and paid at the Trea≈øury of this ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>The committee in the cour≈øe of their enquiries upon this occa≈øion, have found rea≈øon to lament, that in the execution of the various, important and confidential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (embracing the emi≈ø≈øion of certificates and the care and management of other public property to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men≈øe amount) which have from time to time been a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to the Comptroller-General, an adequate check has in few ca≈øes been provided, and, in fewer ≈øtill, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. They conceive, therefore, that the honor and intere≈øt of the ≈øtate, require an early and effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øtigation of the Comptroller's official tran≈øactions; and they would be wanting in their duty to the public and to them≈øelves, were they not to offer an earne≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation

                        <p>‚ÄîFinding in this an≈øwer that <hi>Samuel Baird,</hi> 
                           <abbr>E≈øq</abbr> was the per≈øon alluded to, I think it proper fir≈øt to declare that this gentleman is one for whom I have long had a friend≈øhip, and of who≈øe integrity I have an high e≈øtimation; ≈øome things are alledged again≈øt him in ≈øome of the≈øe purcha≈øes, and a ≈øuit is depending in which I ≈øhall be ≈øorry if I ≈øhall be found to have been mi≈øtaken in his character.‚ÄîAfter this I proceed to take a view of the ≈øituation of his purcha≈øes, and of this ≈øubject gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, fir≈øt, I find that the number of claims of this cla≈øs rendered amount to 366.</p>
                        <p>"Second, I find that of the≈øe, 66 were rendered by ≈øaid <hi>Baird,</hi> of which two were for General and <hi>D. St. Clair,</hi> and were not claimed by him, but received by them≈øelves re≈øpectively.</p>
                        <p>"Third, Although it required no official information to di≈øtingui≈øh tho≈øe gentlemen in the country, who had ≈øerved as officers in the late army, ≈øo as to apply only to tho≈øe who were entitled; yet we find, and the committee,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027132_0153_0FD34FE1259AC520"/>
from the books laid before them, had an opportunity to ob≈øerve that of the 64 claims rendered by <hi>Saml. Baird,</hi> there were two, <hi>Chri≈øtopher Gettig</hi> and <hi>Ca≈øper Wetzel's</hi> e≈øtate, who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>"Fourth. Another que≈øtion whether he obtained previous information from me of the clothing received by the different officers, ≈øo as to a≈øcertain the balances due, can be≈øt be refuted by a view of the facts. Of the 62 claims remaining as afore≈øaid, pre≈øented by him, the following per≈øons had received ≈øuch a quantity of cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to leave a balance due by them to the State on ≈øaid account, viz.

                                       <p>"ON the 3d in≈øt. I received your excellency's letter of the 1≈øt, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opinion of the Attorney-General of the 25th of June la≈øt; on this I have to ob≈øerve,</p>
                                       <p n="1">"1≈øt That this opinion is founded much on matters ≈øtated as a fact, which are not ≈øo, and which I ≈øhould have been able to prove, had the matter been put on the i≈ø≈øue I propo≈øed.</p>
                                       <p n="2">"2d.

But as to the ≈øettlement of the accounts, the thing I am anxious to have done, it gives no ≈øuch power to the executives of the ≈øtate.</p>
                                       <p n="3">"3d. All the books I received from major <hi>Bowen</hi> in behalf of the agents, together with the papers other than the certificates, con≈øi≈øt of two large receipt books, orders and vouchers for the delivery of certificates. The≈øe are yet un≈øettled, and will until adju≈øted by the United States, to whom in their behalf I render them for that purpo≈øe, as they have de≈øired, whereby the ≈øaid account will be clo≈øed; the papers I have in this bu≈øine≈øs are al≈øo vouchers, ≈øuch as orders, and receipts for delivery of certificates, which receipts I have generally taken in the ≈øaid agent's name, and which mu≈øt (unle≈øs I ≈øettle with the agents) be adju≈øted al≈øo with the United States, before the ≈øame accounts can be clo≈øed, the latter I intend to have done; the other papers re≈øpecting the delivery of certificates received from Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> are of the ≈øame kind, and to be ≈øettled in the ≈øame way with the United States.</p>

                     <p>THE additional articles of impeachment were read the ≈øecond time‚ÄîMajor <hi>M'Connell</hi> appeared at the bar of the Hou≈øe, and being duly ≈øworn, an≈øwered the following interrogatories.</p>

                        <hi>Que≈øtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> Have you been po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of any New-Loan certificates in the year 1788?</p>

                        <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> I had a quantity of New-Loan certificates about that time, but at pre≈øent cannot a≈øcertain their amount or numbers.</p>

                        <hi>By the ≈øame.</hi> Did you ≈øell a certificate of that de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription amounting to ¬£. 3275:19:4 to <hi>Blair M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> if yea, plea≈øe to tell at what time?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈ø.</hi> It appears from my book, that I delivered ≈øuch a certificate to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> the 23d day April, 1788, which had been i≈ø≈øued in my own name. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him many New-Loan certificates about that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Que≈ø. by Do.</hi> Do you know what he did with that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate who≈øe amount was ¬£. 3275:19; 4, did he ≈øell it, or did he exchange it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Impo≈ø≈øible for me to tell what Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had done with it, the certificate was his own after he got it from me. I believe an exchange took place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Comptroller-General, but in this I am not po≈øitive.</p>

                        <hi>Que≈øtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi> Have you a li≈øt of the names of the per≈øons to whom the certificates which you then had, were originally granted?</p>

                        <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I have a book at home, in which I have entered their amounts, &amp;c. but at this time I cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

                        <hi>Que≈ø. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> Had you any other New-Loan certificate of the ≈øame amount i≈ø≈øued in your name, about that time, before that time, or ≈øince that period?</p>

                        <p>The pre≈øent impeachment was brought forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt this officer by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives of this commonwealth, conformably to the precedent above alluded to, and agreeably to the con≈øtitution which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribes, that "The Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives ≈øhall have the ≈øole power of impeaching."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>He ≈øaid that the amount of New-Loans which were redeemed was about 63,000 dollars, and that Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> owned about 60,000 dollars of that ≈øum.</p>
                        <p>He read the preamble to the Act of the 16th March, 1786, explaining the views of the Legi≈ølature to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the payment of the debts due to the citizens of this commonwealth, as Congre≈øs could not; the 13th ≈øection was then read as being more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the pre≈øent ca≈øe; the 14th ≈øection de≈øcribes the cla≈øs of creditors to be relieved, and gives a de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the certificates which were entitled to intere≈øt.</p>
                        <p>He read a long report of a grand committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, Sept. 24, 1785, Journals of Congre≈øs, volume 10, page 310, 311, 329, and con≈øequent re≈øolution, by which it appeared that Congre≈øs were di≈ø≈øatisfied at the mode pur≈øued by <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and forbid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner of Loans to ≈øettle or i≈ø≈øue, unle≈øs as therein provided, that is with the≈øe States who had complied with the requi≈øition of 1781.</p>
                        <p>This was di≈øagreeable to <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> who afterwards pa≈ø≈øed the Act of March 1, 1786, with a view to count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eract the mea≈øures contemplated in the re≈øolution of Congre≈øs, and to accommodate the citizens of this ≈øtate, who were creditors of the United States. And near two million pounds of New-Loans had been i≈ø≈øued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> gave the hi≈øtory of New-Loans, i≈ø≈øued in con≈øequence of this Act of March 1, 1786‚Äîrepealed by Act of March 27th, 1789, the intere≈øt paid for four years; the ≈øecond and third ≈øections are the mo≈øt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of the repealing Act‚Äîthe former principles are recognized in this Act, and after its pa≈ø≈øing no other

u≈øe could be made of the New-Loans than to exchange them for Continental certificates.</p>
                        <p>They could no longer continue a claim, as the law was repealed which con≈øtituted them a claim: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came difficult from payments in the Land-Office to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn continental certificates, and the fund from the Land-Office was added in-con≈øequence of the practice of ≈øplitting certificates.</p>
                        <p>In the repealing Act of 1789 the Legi≈ølature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated to re≈øtore their debts to the parties‚Äî<hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> de≈øigned an exoneration on the return of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates, on one ≈øingle condition, to wit, the re≈øtoration of tho≈øe certificates to the parties.</p>
                        <p>The State has been injured, the criminality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons depends much upon circum≈øtances, ≈øhe is injured not by her own acts, but by the conduct of one of her officers, by a wrong con≈øtruction of law, whether wilful or mi≈øtaken, the Senate will judge when the facts and evidence will be laid before them.</p>
                        <p>This con≈øtruction under the Act of the 10th April, 1792, has involved the State in a lo≈øs of near 15000 dollars, and this immen≈øe lo≈øs has been ≈øu≈øtained by this con≈øtruction of the pre≈øent defendant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read part of the 12th and 13th ≈øections of the Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th Augu≈øt, 1790, which contemplates only the a≈ø≈øumption of certificates i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies, none excepted but "certificates i≈ø≈øued by the commi≈ø≈øioners of army accounts in the ≈øtate of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> in the year 1786."</p>
                        <p>The Act of 27th March, 1789, pa≈ø≈øed before the Act of the 4th of Augu≈øt, 1790; If the New-Loans are not ≈øub≈øcribable to the fir≈øt loan, they cannot be to the ≈øecond of the 8th May, 1792. The idea of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing them never entered the mind of any per≈øon during the continuance of the fir≈øt loan.</p>
                        <p>He read the Act of A≈ø≈øembly of the 9th of April, 1791, re≈øpecting purparts, for making up the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of intere≈øt on continental loans, the Legi≈ølature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered the per≈øons relieved here as their only creditors,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:027132_0221_0FD350899792D9E0"/>
who≈øe debts were ≈øub≈øcribable, had New-Loans been con≈øidered as exi≈øting debts, equal provi≈øion would have been made for them in the ≈øaid Act.</p>
                        <p>In the next place he adverted to the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, in which Act the Legi≈ølature determined to pay off their proper debts with the purparts. The 2d ≈øection appropriates the ≈øtock to pay the debts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the fir≈øt ≈øection, the ≈øection de≈øcribes, 1, the fund; 2, the debts, here he ob≈øerved that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to ≈øee if New-Loans were included; the intere≈øt on New-Loans was not payable at this time. As it is under a con≈øtruction of this law the articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were brought forward, it was nece≈ø≈øary to pay proper attention to it, and to weigh the particular ≈øtate of the affair with the eyes of ≈øcrutiny and candor.</p>
                        <p>This is the con≈øtruction put on it by us, we cannot tell what is the con≈øtruction of the Comptroller, or his coun≈øel. Agreeably to the duties required of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for the purpo≈øe of carrying this Act into execution, it was nece≈ø≈øary for him to have an account of the debts. ‚ÄîHe therefore applied to the Comptroller and Regi≈øter-General, who e≈øtimated the debt to be redeemed, and the ≈øtock to be ≈øold; this e≈øtimate, Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> ≈øaid, did not include New-Loans, but thro' ≈øome fatality this document has been lo≈øt.</p>
                        <p>Had the Legi≈ølature de≈øigned to redeem the New-Loan certificates it was nece≈ø≈øary to appropriate larger funds‚ÄîThe ≈øtock which had been ordered to be ≈øold, was only adequate to the other debt.</p>
                        <p>The fifth ≈øection refers only to certificates mentioned in the ≈øecond ≈øection.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øixth ≈øection is apparently more indefinite and uncertain, and depended upon what provi≈øion Congre≈øs would make.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> then read the Act of Congre≈øs of the 8th of May, 1792, ≈øupplementary to the Act of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt, 1790, which is extended on the ≈øame terms, ≈øame con≈øtruction mu≈øt be attached to each Act, as both Acts are on the ≈øame principles. Here he referred to the 2d

≈øection of the Act of Congre≈øs of the 8th May, 1792, relative to non-≈øub≈øcribing creditors, to get the ≈øame intere≈øt which he ≈øaid, merited particular attention.</p>
                        <p>In the 6th ≈øection of the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, as it is confined to the a≈ø≈øumption before the fir≈øt of July, and nothing could ≈øtrictly be done conformably to it under the la≈øt Act of Congre≈øs, becau≈øe no certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates could i≈ø≈øue under it until March the 1≈øt, 1793: This compared with the 6th ≈øection of the Act of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly of the 10th April, 1792, it became impo≈ø≈øible that both laws could be literally and expre≈øsly complied with; a corre≈øpondence took place, between the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Secretary of the commonwealth, Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and the Secretary of the Trea≈øury of the United States, and arrangements were made accordingly‚Äîall the extracts which he read were repeated, reiterated, dilated and de≈øcanted upon, placing every ≈øubject in various points of view: remarked that he had gone through the different laws of the United States, and acts of this commonwealth, which were connected with this bu≈øine≈øs, that he would then be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of referring to written documents and oral te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that the letters were numerous and lengthy, and as it was then within a quarter of two he propo≈øed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the reading of the letters until the next day.</p>

                           <p>By an Act pa≈ø≈øed in March, 1789, the holders of this balance are entitled on pre≈øenting their certificates of this ≈øtate and liquidating the intere≈øt received thereon, to receive back their former ones or an equivalent; this hath taken place to a great amount, in≈øomuch that there does not at pre≈øent remain much unexchanged on a compari≈øon of the whole, the exact amount at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent unexchanged I cannot tell, a number of exchanges to the amount of 40 or 50 pre≈øented are pending for want of the parties paying the indents due, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I e≈øtimate from 40 to 50 thou≈øand pounds, if ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute preci≈øion be nece≈ø≈øary, I will have the additions and ≈øelections made ≈øo as to give the ≈øum exactly.</p>
                           <p>When I read the letter of the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury referred to afore≈øaid, I was doubtful until I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted it again, whether it really imported that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt payable quarterly on the certificates granted on the A≈ø≈øumed debt of this ≈øtate, would be ≈øu≈øpended until the certificates of the Federal debt not yet exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the New-Loans as afore≈øaid ≈øhould be ≈øurrendered or an equivalent in ≈øtock under the funding ≈øy≈øtem, as ≈øuch a ca≈øe would pro≈øtrate the faith of the United States to the will of the Legi≈ølature of this ≈øtate, if they ≈øhould refu≈øe to ≈øurrender them, then the United States (without any fault on the part of the original ≈øub≈øcribers or the pre≈øent holders) would not pay the intere≈øt they had i≈ø≈øued their obligation for, in which they promi≈øed payment. It appeared to me that if ≈øuch were the law
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:027132_0230_0FD350DACD8C6A10"/>
the public credit of the United States might be ≈øhaken by it and rendered precarious, but on turning to the law it will appear that the provi≈øion for returning the certificates of the United States, was to prevent the United States from paying the intere≈øt twice on the ≈øame debt, and that in conformity thereto, if any of the certificates of this ≈øtate commonly called New-Loan debt had been before the fir≈øt of October la≈øt, when the loan clo≈øed, ≈øub≈øcribed to the ≈øaid loan, it would have been requi≈øite before the ≈øtock had i≈ø≈øued therefor, that an equal ≈øum ≈øhould have been ≈øurrendered by the ≈øtate as afore≈øaid. <hi>The ≈øtate would thus have redeemed her certificates through the United States in the ≈øame manner at pre≈øent practi≈øed, for individuals,</hi> but no ≈øuch certificates of this ≈øtate were ≈øub≈øcribed‚Äîcon≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the United States are entitled to none of the continental certificates, which are demandable by the per≈øons holding the New-Loans. If they ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the United States, this ≈øtate might have to pay the New-Loan certificates without having this re≈øource to do it with. I think too highly of the faith of the public to ≈øuppo≈øe, that the holders of New-Loan are compellable either to ≈øub≈øcribe them to the United States or to re-exchange them for the continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, or that to ≈øuch as do not, the ≈øtate are ab≈øolved from payment both of principal and intere≈øt, but the market value and the irredeemable quality of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental ≈øtock and the pre≈øent funds of the United States are generally ≈øufficient to induce the change, as is evinced from the great quantity already ≈øo exchanged, of the remainder ≈øome part is exchanged almo≈øt every day, and if the loan ≈øhould be opened by Congre≈øs the exchanges would be encrea≈øed thereby.</p>

                           <p>"THE ≈øubject committed to me by your excellency in December la≈øt, re≈øpecting the claim made by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury to a ≈øurrender on the part of the State, of the Continental certificates not exchanged, having been brought to a clo≈øe; and being this day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Trea≈øury that all ob≈øtacles were removed re≈øpecting the transfer and payment of intere≈øt quarterly on the a≈ø≈øumed debt of this ≈øtate, or the payment quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to the ≈øtate of the re≈øiduum un≈øub≈øcribed of this ≈øtate's quota; and orders having gone out to the Loan-Office of the di≈øtrict of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> con≈øequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, I ha≈øten to inform you thereof.</p>
                           <p>"The ≈øubject was an important one, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Continental certificates from <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> while the New-Loans for which they were given were out, and the ≈øtate re≈øpon≈øible for, without the≈øe means of redemption, could have placed her in an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant ≈øituation. To take off the appearance of this hard≈øhip, it was ≈øugge≈øted, that in ca≈øe the New-Loans not exchanged, would not be ≈øub≈øcribed to the United States by the holders (which on the propo≈øed terms of the loan might be done) yet ≈øtill that the ≈øtate would by the terms of the ≈øame loan, be in the receipt of a ≈øufficient ≈øum from the Union to meet the intere≈øt due to the≈øe creditors. But to this it was objected, that this receipt of intere≈øt by the ≈øtate would be temporary, and would cea≈øe when the ≈øettlement of our accounts with the United States ≈øhould be effected, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances provided for agreeably to law, whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand again≈øt the ≈øtate would be perpetual, and could only be di≈øcharged by payment of the debt.</p>
                           <p>"On the whole after much attention to this bu≈øine≈øs it hath been ≈øettled to our wi≈øh; and the good ≈øen≈øe of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury hath led him to a deci≈øion, under the Act of Congre≈øs of Augu≈øt 4th, 1790, which

                        <pb n="228" facs="unknown:027132_0236_0FD34FEB25658838"/>Here Mr. <hi>Morgan.</hi> remarked that the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were excluded.‚ÄîIf the≈øe two officers made a partial ≈øtatement, they did not comply with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions, it mu≈øt therefore be conceded that it included all: The act of the 10th of April, 1792, was their rule of con≈øtruction. He then read the 2d ≈øection of that act. Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> then held in his hand an ab≈øtract which had been actually redeemed, which did not on the face of it ≈øhew the certification of the Comptroller for being <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable,</hi> but it was in the hand writing of that officer, in the ab≈øtracts of others, it was nece≈ø≈øary, here it was not, the form is ≈øimilar to the others; it con≈øi≈øted of eight columns.‚Äî1. Date of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate. 2. Number of ditto. 3. By whom i≈ø≈øued. 4. To whom i≈ø≈øued. 5. Commencement of intere≈øt. 6. Amount of each certificate. 7. Intere≈øt computed to December 31, 1791. 8. Total amount.</p>
                     <p>In this ab≈øtract it is nece≈ø≈øary to ob≈øerve that a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate purcha≈øed from an irreproachable witne≈øs on the 7th of July, 1792 is contained in a receipt dated the 30th June, 1792, an erazure is made to cover purcha≈øes made after the fir≈øt of July, to bring them within the time pre≈øcribed by the act.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing were offered to ≈øupport the three fir≈øt articles, the fourth is rather a deduction from them, he ob≈øerved that the three fir≈øt were con≈øidered together for they could not be ≈øeparated.</p>
                     <p>He read the fourth article.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> he ob≈øerved, could not certify to the officers of the United States in his private capacity, he therefore did it under colour of his office, there was no ≈øpecification of New-Loans on the face of the ab≈øtracts, and no fund provided to pay them, the money mu≈øt therefore have been drawn from the Trea≈øury without any previous appropriation, or out of a fund otherwi≈øe appropriated, which is contrary to the con≈øtitution; he quoted the 21≈øt ≈øection of the fir≈øt article of the con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> It is apparent from the≈øe facts and circum≈øtances that the Comptroller General knew
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:027132_0237_0FD350C11DBB38A8"/>
when he made the certification, and unle≈øs an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation can be ≈øhewn, it will not be di≈øputed that the New-Loans could be redeemed out of any other than the fund contemplated in the Act of the 10th of April, 1792. He repeated the reading of the ≈øecond ≈øection, and ≈øaid, that unle≈øs ≈øome other law can be ≈øhewn, which he knew nothing of, there was no fund, the ≈øection men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nothing of New Loans, nay it appropriates the funds and excludes New-Loans; the ≈øale of the three per cent. ≈øtock was co-exten≈øive with its object. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 986,000 dollars were only ≈øufficient, and part direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for New-Loans, it would affect the other, and injure the proper ≈øtate creditors; the honor of the ≈øtate would be di≈øgraced, as ≈øhe promi≈øed payments and had not funds.</p>

                     <p>The Trea≈øurer appeared with his books to ≈øhew that the money was paid the 14th July, 1792, before the Regi≈øter or the Governor knew any thing about the ≈øub≈øcribability of New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>The con≈øequences of this tran≈øaction aggravate the crime, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> gain on the whole was about 14 or 15,000 dollars, and the commonwealth lo≈øt 25 per cent.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read the 5th article, ob≈øerving that he would ≈øub≈øtantiate the charge contained in this by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectable witne≈ø≈øes, they did not appear, and he moved for an adjournment, which was granted, with directions from the Speaker to be punctual.‚ÄîThe members of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives returned to their chamber, and repeated the ceremony, as in page 214 and 215.</p>
                     <p>The letter of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> read ye≈øterday in the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives (≈øee page 200) was read the ≈øecond time; and referred to Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>B. Morgan, M'Lene, Evans,</hi> and <hi>Bowman.</hi> It does not appear that they reported on it.</p>

                     <p>That in all his communications previous to March, 1789, the Comptroller mentioned the New-Loans as an exi≈øting debt; and a total change of ≈øentiment took place in him, in the Legi≈ølature, and Governor, after that period; becau≈øe they conceived the law of March, 1789, had done away the claim which exi≈øted by the law of 1786, and the New-Loans were omitted in all their ≈øub≈øequent ≈øtatements as no longer an object of Legi≈ølative con≈øideration.</p>

                     <p>The Comptroller-General him≈øelf, the committee on Ways and Means, and the other officers were of the ≈øame opinion.

                        <p>After this certificate was obtained from the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller, they carried that ab≈øtract and certificate to the Loan-officer of the United States, and there ≈øub≈øcribed it to the loan opened in a book for that purpo≈øe; after making this ≈øub≈øcription, the Loan-Officer gave them a duplicate of the ab≈øtract, and a receipt, which were brought to my office, and examined there, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt calculated up to the time allowed by law, and an account was ≈øtated by me, State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> to ‚Äî Dr., owing to the hurry of bu≈øine≈øs it was divided between my Clerks and my≈øelf, they made the calculations of intere≈øt and additions, and I made the entries; or they made the entries, and I made the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and additions;‚Äîthat calculation with the ab≈øtract was ≈øent to the office of the Gomptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a corre≈øponding entry being made in my books.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø.</hi> Was you always able to make this?</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Being oftentimes much hurried, a per≈øon helped me in the calculations and ca≈øtings; intere≈øts were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated ≈øometimes by my≈øelf, and ≈øometimes by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but the entries were for the mo≈øt part made by me. I think it underwent an examination at the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's office, and in that ca≈øe the ab≈øtracts were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me becau≈øe I had not completed the returns of the particulars and different kinds of debt, but the gro≈øs amount: the Comptroller ≈øigned it, the ≈øame was brought to me, which I counter≈øigned, and it was then ≈øent to the Governor, who granted a warrant on the Trea≈øury for the amount.</p>
                        <p>I recollect to have no conver≈øation with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller re≈øpecting New-Loans, until after the date be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 14th and 17th July, 1792, when the ab≈øtracts No. 264, 265 and 266, and warrants had pa≈ø≈øed my office.</p>
                        <p>On this conver≈øation a conference took place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, wherein I agreed with him in ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, and embraced under the act of the 10th April, 1792.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø.</hi> Was it Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> gave you the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I received information out of doors, that New-Loans were contained in the ab≈øtracts, and was ≈øo well convinced, altho' I went to Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> to ≈øee whether New-Loan certificates were included, that I afterwards pa≈ø≈øed ≈øeveral ab≈øtracts knowing them to contain New-Loans, for which warrants i≈ø≈øued and were ≈øtopped in my hands, except one from Mr. <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him by mi≈øtake.</p>
                        <p>In my conver≈øation with the Comptroller we referred to the ≈øeveral acts of the United States and laws of this commonwealth, the only difficulty which occurred was the delivery of the Continental certificates for which the New-Loans had i≈ø≈øued‚ÄîHe an≈øwered it was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the United States, and that he either had, or would ≈øettle that bu≈øine≈øs with the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:027132_0246_0FD3508E4882F480"/>
of the United States. He al≈øo avered that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon (as a creditor) holding the certificate, had it in his power to do it, knowing that the ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of intere≈øt was the only difficulty, and that that would only take place until certificates of the United States were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                        <p>This was the ≈øub≈øtance, I do not recollect the preci≈øe or ≈øpecific terms.</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I believe in my office. I think I had a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation with him at his office door in con≈øequence of receiving ≈øub≈øcribable debt for three per cent. ≈øtock.</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I recollect, that on receiving a debt, ≈øome were ≈øub≈øcribable, I made out an ab≈øtract in my own name, which I afterwards made over to the commonwealth. I went down to Mr. <hi>Smith's,</hi> where I ≈øub≈øcribed in blank for their amount, the hurry was ≈øo great in his office that he could not count them, this was on the 30th of June, as ≈øoon as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had lei≈øure, ≈øome days after, he counted them, and found that they corre≈øopnded with the ab≈øtract, he gave his receipt, dated 30th of June, corre≈øponding with the time I had ≈øub≈øcribed, which al≈øo appears in his report. I think, but will not be po≈øitive, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> name was there in blank on the books of ≈øub≈øcription.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> In June 1792 I bought for my father from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Raphael</hi> a New-Loan certificate ≈øigned by <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> and <hi>Rittenhou≈øe,</hi> being one of tho≈øe commonly called New-Loan, in the name of <hi>John Thomp≈øon.</hi> Three year's intere≈øt had been paid by the ≈øtate on the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and it was one of tho≈øe endor≈øed between Sept. 1777 and March 1778‚Äîand bore intere≈øt on the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ≈øum. The next day I ≈øent <hi>Je≈ø≈øe Morris,</hi> a young man who lived with my father, to the State-Trea≈øury, to receive the intere≈øt due thereon, he ≈øoon returned and informed me ≈øome difficuly occured re≈øpecting it, that Mr. <hi>Febiger</hi> had ≈øtopped the certificate, and had ≈øent Mr. <hi>Reilly</hi> his chief clerk to the Comptroller with it.</p>
                        <p>I therefore went to the Comptroller's office, met Mr. <hi>Reilly</hi> on the ≈øtairs, and he returned with me to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> room.</p>
                        <p>I was informed more fully of the circum≈øtances by the Comptroller-General. I then recollected to have ≈øeen this de≈øcribed in an adverti≈øement on a file of ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and lo≈øt certificates u≈øually hung up in Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon's</hi> office; and likewi≈øe in the ne≈øwpapers. I enquired of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> whether any lo≈øs re≈øpecting this certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate would accrue to Mr. <hi>Biddle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> informed me that in a former ca≈øe of the like nature, the per≈øon who held them, had amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ≈øettled the matter, and letters were ≈øent to <hi>Thomp≈øon</hi> re≈øpecting the certificates; likewi≈øe that he believed it would be no injury to Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> as it could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</p>
                        <p>Upon this I turned to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> de≈øk, took a blank exchange and filled it up, de≈øcribing this certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of <hi>Thomp≈øon's,</hi> which I purcha≈øed of <hi>Raphael,</hi> the bu≈øine≈øs re≈øted here, and I went home, and left both the certificate and exchange with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon.</hi>

                        <p>I had been in the habit of purcha≈øing New-Loan certificates and entru≈øted that bu≈øine≈øs principally to my ≈øon, about the latter end of June, 1792, I ≈øaw by the bills of parcels, that my ≈øon had purcha≈øed a New-Loan certificate from <hi>S.

                        <p>Either that day, or the next, I do not recollect which, my ≈øon mentioned the circum≈øtances, and the difficulty in the payment of intere≈øt, and exchange,‚Äîafter which, on conver≈øing with ≈øome friends, and con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, and knowing that it was payable to bearer; I was convinced that I could not ≈øuffer, the ≈øtate had indemnified the holder, it mu≈øt be exchanged, the law was pa≈ø≈øed, the ≈øtate mu≈øt make it good.</p>
                        <p>A few days after, not immediately, I came to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> and had, I believe, two opportunities, and ≈øpoke to him before the ≈øtate-hou≈øe; and I urged the exchange as there could be no exception to my right, he ≈øeemed to admit my right, but mentioned that he

                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Yes; on or about the 4th of July, 1792, I had a number, ≈øuppo≈øe about ≈øeven or eight hundred odd pounds in New-Loan certificates, I, according to the u≈øual practice made up an ab≈øtract, and took them to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented the ab≈øtract and certificates in due form, and left them with the Comptroller as it was u≈øual on ≈øuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øions.</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> After pre≈øenting them, I expected the original Continental certificates in lieu of them, I a≈øked when I might get the Continental certificates, the an≈øwer, as well as I can recollect, was, that I ≈øhould have them the next day about the ≈øame hour, it was then about 12 o'clock. I went up the next day‚Äî(Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> was
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:027132_0252_0FD35091E683C1A8"/>
de≈øired by Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> to tell what pa≈ø≈øed in the mean time.) On the evening of the ≈øame day, I received a letter or note from the Comptroller, which note is lo≈øt, the purport of which was, that he would pay me an equal proportion and quantity of 6, 3, and deferred ≈øtock, and arrearages of intere≈øt for them, take the certificates him≈øelf, and ≈øave me the trouble of funding the Continental ones.</p>
                        <p>To this note I returned no written an≈øwer, but told the bearer that I would ≈øee the Comptroller the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and would complete and fini≈øh that bu≈øine≈øs, and ≈øo the matter re≈øted.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øaw the Comptroller the next day, I fancy, it mu≈øt have been in the mean time, an idea ≈øtruck me, that he could pay them into the Land-Office, and intended to a≈øk him ≈øomething more, don't know whether I went up twice or thrice, ≈øtill not ready; and when I did the la≈øt time, I told him, if he would give me thirty dollars beyond what their value was, as I ≈øuppo≈øed they would be of more u≈øe to him, he ≈øhould have them. To this propo≈øal the Comptroller agreed, transferred the ≈øtock to me at Mr. <hi>Smith's,</hi> and gave me a check on the Bank of the United States for 155 dollars and 85 cents, and 30 dollars for my good will of the certificates, being in the whole one hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighty-five cents.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø.</hi> When you offered the certificates to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller for 30 dollars, did the Comptroller tell you it was too late?</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I do not recollect, not certain, that any ≈øuch thing was mentioned, it is a long time ago, the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of intere≈øt and thirty dollars con≈øtituted the ≈øum for which he gave me a check, and that was on the 7th of July, 1792, this I know from an entry in my memorandum book, the only written account, which I have of this tran≈øaction.</p>
                        <p>The ab≈øtract No. 262, was looked for, found, and ≈øhewed to Mr. <hi>Oldden,</hi> and he was de≈øired to inform the Senate whether his certificates were in it; he directly

                     <p>Having gone through the five fir≈øt articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment again≈øt the Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, it now remains for me to go on to the 6th and 7th articles, to under≈øtand the≈øe two, a con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ≈øcale of important facts and corroborating te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony mu≈øt fir≈øt be attended to‚ÄîIf I have ≈øhewn that the Comptroller's opinion was, long before the pa≈ø≈øage of the Act of March 1789, that the New-Loans cea≈øed to be a State debt, it will render his conduct more criminal, a retro≈øpective view of a pa≈øt tran≈øaction will add ≈øome information to what has been already advanced: in one of his reports on the ≈øtate of the finances, dated October 1, and December 11, 1790; he had ≈øtated what debts were valid again≈øt the commonwealth and what were not.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read the report page 385, in the appendix to the minutes of 1790, containing what debts were to be di≈øcharged, and what were valid, agreeably to the report of the proper officers; that the pre≈øent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution allowed of no draughts from the Trea≈øury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by previous appropriations made by law. But in page 389 in the 7th article of the finances are ≈øeveral ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divi≈øions, wherein the amount of the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt of the New-Loans are defined, and excluded from redemption in the Land-office, whereby they cea≈øe to be and are no longer a debt of the ≈øtate. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in expre≈øs terms, page 395 that New-Loans were then excluded. Here then we re≈øt our te≈øtimony
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:027132_0256_0FD350DBF3B7E9F8"/>
of the five fir≈øt articles, the≈øe are objects of our accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for plain and obvious rea≈øons.</p>
                     <p>We now come to objects of greater moment, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments of a deeper dye, as the articles are of greater magnitude the puni≈øhment is to be ≈øeverer, ina≈ømuch as the Comptroller as a faithful guardian to pre≈øerve the property of the public, did not lay his hands on the trea≈øures of the commonwealth, for the purpo≈øe of ≈øav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame, but made his official duty ≈øub≈øervient to ≈øpeculation. If the te≈øtimony already exhibited and arguments adduced, has made equal impre≈ø≈øion on the Senate as on the managers and on the Hou≈øe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatives, who are his accu≈øers, the articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment will have the effect which the law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution require. <hi>(Here</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans a≈ø≈øi≈øted</hi> Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in arranging the papers and preparing the parts to be read.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the various per≈øons who came to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's office to loan their certificates, we find the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> in different progre≈ø≈øions, and if I am RIGHTLY INSTRUCTED it will be proved that Loan-office certificates of the United States and New-Loan certificates were depo≈øited with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> and both ultimately ≈øub≈øcribed to the Loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p>It remains with the Comptroller-General to account for that procedure, if the Act had required the ≈øame Continental certificates to be returned, the ca≈øe would be plain, and owing to the circum≈øtances of both, the New-Loans and the other certificates having been ≈øub≈øcribed by the ≈øame per≈øon a pre≈øumption is rai≈øed; and he ≈øhould ≈øhew why they had not taken different cour≈øes. The moment that they cea≈øed to be private property, they immediately became the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the New-Loans and the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates could not be public and private property at one and the ≈øame point of time, yet both have been ≈øub≈øcribed.</p>

                     <p>To prove that the Continental certificates thus depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øited exactly corre≈øponded with the New-Loans, I have in my hand a certificate from the Regi≈øter of the Trea≈øury ≈øigned by <hi>Jo≈øeph Nour≈øe,</hi> March 4th, 1794, by which it appears that the Comptroller-General had ≈øub≈øcribed by the Act of Augu≈øt 4, 1790, the certificates i≈ø≈øued as afore≈øaid.</p>

                        <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> came forward and had New-Loans i≈ø≈øued for his Continental ones, two evidences of the ≈øame debt‚Äîthis inconvenience would not have happened if the intention of the Legi≈ølature had been pur≈øued. After the law of 1789 the New-Loans were only a receipt or claim to get back the Continental certificates; by this means a duplication of debt had been brought again≈øt the United States, contrary to what the Union and <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had contemplated. This is the only te≈øtimony now in our power, it remains with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General to ≈øhew and explain; it is manife≈øt that we had two debts in≈øtead of one, the certificates of the United States and tho≈øe of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> it is in his power to ≈øatisfy the Senate if his books were kept in the manner in which they ought to have been‚Äîif this tran≈øaction is not cleared up, the pre≈øumption is that ≈øomething is unfair and unworthy of this officer.</p>
                     <p>To ≈øhew however by as direct te≈øtimony as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance of this ca≈øe will admit that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General has made u≈øe of certificates brought to, and depo≈øited with him for re-exchange which he afterwards ≈øub≈øcribed to the Loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p>The circum≈øtances which both points are briefly to prove, are the≈øe; that <hi>Matthew M'Connell</hi> furni≈øhed or ≈øold a certificate for ¬£. 3275:19:4, to <hi>Blair M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> which is among tho≈øe ≈øub≈øcribed by Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> in his grand ab≈øtract. The pre≈øumptive te≈øtimony will be ≈øtrong, that the Comptroller received this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate in his official capacity, and that he afterwards took it to his own u≈øe: The fir≈øt witne≈øs whom we ≈øhall call on this ≈øubject is <hi>Matthew M'Connell.</hi>

Every per≈øon who in conformity with the ≈øaid Act ≈øhall pre≈øent to you a New-Loan certificate, may at his option receive from you the Continental certificate or certificates, for which the New-Loan certificate was granted, or receive a like ≈øum of principal in certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of debts of the U.

                        <p n="2">"2. When New-Loan certificates have been cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ≈øeveral certificates have been by you given for the amount thereof, to enable the party to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Land-Office, &amp;c.‚Äîand where one or more of the latter ≈øhall be pre≈øented as part or parts of ≈øuch New-Loan certificate, the per≈øon pre≈øenting the ≈øame may in lieu thereof receive ≈øo many of the original Continental certificates as ≈øhall be equal to, or neare≈øt, it, and under the amount of the New-Loan certificates ≈øo pre≈øented.</p>
                        <p n="3">"3. In tho≈øe in≈øtances in which it may be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to make the exact amount of a New-Loan certificate or certificates with Continental certificates, you will i≈ø≈øue a new certificate or certificates, bearing ≈øimilar intere≈øts for the balance or balances.</p>
                        <p n="4">"4th. In a ≈øet of books to be prepared for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, you will keep exact and fair accounts of all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates you may receive, diliver or i≈ø≈øue, with their numbers, principal ≈øums and dates of intere≈øt.</p>

impeached in the name of the people of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives is the grand inque≈øt of the nation. The Senate will judge without any regard to the impre≈ø≈øions made on the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives. The Comptroller is here in the ≈øame ≈øituation as any defendant in a common law court. The grand jury found the indictment, the Senate as a jury is ≈øworn to try the indictment. Lord <hi>Mansfield's</hi> expre≈ø≈øion on this occa≈øion is worthy of notice, That the juror's mind ≈øhould be like <hi>"blank paper,"</hi> free from any impre≈ø≈øions but that of the evidence. That the late Hou≈øe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatives and the Managers were actuated by the pure≈øt motives, and the pre≈øent Hou≈øe al≈øo, I have no doubt, but from what ≈øource this impeachment ≈øprings time only will di≈øcover. Public bodies are liable to be acted upon when the object in contemplation is to acquire public good or great public evil; the public good is a fa≈øcinating con≈øideration to carry on a pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The good intentions of the Hou≈øe is not doubted, but this goodne≈øs might make them liable to be ea≈øily acted upon. Popular bodies are ea≈øily warped by an artful individual when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour, and impre≈ø≈øes an idea on the A≈ø≈øembly that he has the public good at heart.</p>

But no objection with us. The ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which I have the honor to addre≈øs you, has not been very familiar to me, having no knowledge of it but what I collected ≈øince I have been retained by the Comptroller. Its branches are various, requiring much per≈øpicuity and a thorough acquaintance with the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Comptroller throws him≈øelf on the candor of his Judges, he has always acted from a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction

of the Act, or not.

                              <p>YOU are right in con≈øidering your≈øelf not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øed by law to accept on the loan of the a≈ø≈øumed debt certificates of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> dated on or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fir≈øt day of January 1790.

                              <p>It will not be proper that you commit the examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and checking of the certificates of the a≈ø≈øumed debt to any per≈øon who does not actually belong to your

office. It cannot be deemed a legal execution of your duty to rely upon any per≈øon not duly authori≈øed. You will receive the≈øe certificates and give on the delivery of them to you, and before compari≈øon with the checks, a de≈øcriptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment, that ≈øuch certificates are placed in your hands with a view to the loan. The ≈øub≈øcribers will be ≈øen≈øible that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becau≈øe the ≈øub≈øcriptions may exceed the a≈ø≈øumption, and the certificates may prove counterfeit or forged. Having received them in the manner above mentioned, you will commit to ≈øome per≈øon competent to ≈øo nice and important a bu≈øine≈øs, the compari≈øon of the certificates with the regi≈øters and checks in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ≈øtate, to which no doubt the ea≈øie≈øt acce≈øs will be given. Should however any unexpected impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment occur, you will make it known to me.</p>
                              <p>"I do not perceive any objection to your ≈øtriking a mark in the form you have exhibited (‚â†) upon all the certificates depo≈øited with you towards the loan of the a≈ø≈øumed debt, which however ≈øhould be done in ≈øuch manner as not to obliterate the printed or manu≈øcript words. You will be careful to ≈øelect a proper place for the mark, which as far as po≈ø≈øible ≈øhould be uniformly made, that the eye may in≈øtantly perceive it.</p>
                              <p>"I do not con≈øider you as ju≈øtifiable in refu≈øing the certificates of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> (which are in all other re≈øpects a≈ø≈øumable) becau≈øe they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the ≈øtate in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper to u≈øe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to per≈øuade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they per≈øi≈øt to offer, refu≈øe to receive them.</p>
                              <p>"You will perceive on re-examination that you have mi≈øconceived the in≈øtruction contained in my letter of the 9th ult. in regard to Loan-office certificates i≈ø≈øued prior to March 1778.

double intere≈øt, and that a ≈øurrender was neither practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable nor equitable, <hi>(≈øee page</hi> 220-1-2-3-4); as none of the≈øe had been ≈øub≈øcribed, this inconvenience could not ari≈øe, the intention of the Act of Congre≈øs was fulfilled, I was convinced the rea≈øoning was ju≈øt, there being no ba≈øis on which the U.

                        <p>If the New-Loans in my view of them <hi>at that time</hi> had not been ≈øub≈øcribable, this difficulty could not have ari≈øen.

The ≈øubject had not engaged my con≈øideration, nor did it come forward in a <hi>prominent point of view</hi> until after the ≈øecond a≈ø≈øumption. The Attorney-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> gave his opinion that they are aboli≈øhed, as debts of this ≈øtate.

                        <p>Shortly after the Hou≈øe aro≈øe after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of the 10th April 1792 I was in the Comptroller's office on bu≈øine≈øs‚ÄîMr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> was pre≈øent, I ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the 6th ≈øection was very loo≈øe and would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace unfunded depreciation debt. In which ≈øentiment there was an agreement of opinion, and I think Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ob≈øerved if Congre≈øs would a≈ø≈øume the old bills of credit of the ≈øtate, the Act would embrace them. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ob≈øerved that the ≈øection was more general than he at fir≈øt thought, or intended it, and that it would embrace unfunded depreciation, don't recollect that any conver≈øation took place, nor difference of opinion about that law until after the ≈øub≈øcription of New-Loans, when we had a conference, and we agreed in opinion that they were ≈øub≈øcribable and a≈ø≈øumable. No other conver≈øation about them until the conference above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. I recollect the letter of the 13th of April 1792, re≈øpecting the ≈øale of ≈øtock. But as to that ≈øaid to be lo≈øt, in my letter book there is no reference to ≈øuch a letter, I have been much perplexed about it, ≈øtrongly impre≈ø≈øed that there had been ≈øuch a letter, but cannot account for it, and doubt whether there was any as it is not on my books. When the committee on Ways and

Means had the ≈øubject before them la≈øt year, they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the e≈øtimate‚ÄîI turned to my letter book, but could not find it.</p>
                        <p>The defendant's accounts were pa≈ø≈øed through my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the u≈øual form. His ab≈øtracts were made in his office, this difference, that a≈ø≈øignments were made on them in his office, then they were ≈øent down to mine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø.</hi> Is there any thing upon the≈øe ab≈øtracts from whence, in the common cour≈øe of bu≈øine≈øs, they could be di≈øtingui≈øhed that New-Loans were included?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Yes; dates of intere≈øt on New-Loans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced at mixt and different dates. The date of the commencement of intere≈øt on funded and depreciation debt on fixt and particular dates. Funded debt fir≈øt of January, fir≈øt of July, depreciation 10th April, 10th of October. No other certificates but New-Loans are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated on the principal.</p>

The fact was I never con≈øidered it of any con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence what the ab≈øtracts were made up of, ≈øo that they were received at the Loan-office.</p>
                        <p>I encouraged ≈øub≈øcribing under the idea that <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> would be a creditor ≈øtate, the documents were pre≈øented to the Comptroller, if they pa≈ø≈øed him, that is whether they were a≈ø≈øumable; they then came to me a ≈øecond time, the principal examination was confined to the calculations of principal and intere≈øt, the bu≈øine≈øs was carried thro' in the u≈øual time, no hurry or ≈øolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on the part of the Comptroller to carry his bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs thro', or get his ab≈øtracts pa≈ø≈øed.

                     <p>Having examined a number of witne≈ø≈øes and read many documents to ≈øhew that our con≈øtruction of the Act is con≈øonant to law, and that the defendant's opinion and judgment was the legal one, I will only examine one or two more to the ≈øame point.‚ÄîIn order to ≈øhew this more fully I will quote the Governor's words in the minutes of the A≈ø≈øembly, 10th December, 1791, page 12, where his words allude to the payment of arrears due not on New-Loan certificates but "on the New-Loan debt." Where they are quoted, they are ≈øtiled New-Loan

certificates. The rea≈øon why the New-Loans are not ≈øtated as a debt to be paid, is becau≈øe the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth thought ≈øhe had a fund in her hands equivalent to an≈øwer them at any time, the State and her officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had a fund, commen≈øurate to their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either when the party ≈øhould come to exchange, or when future provi≈øion ≈øhould be made by the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. The word <hi>"redeemed,"</hi> minutes, page 389, 1791, ≈øo much relied on, alluded only to the Land-Office. Page 421, the Regi≈øter-General heads the title "New-Loan Debt." In Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon's</hi> report 15th Augu≈øt, 1791, No. 25, the expre≈ø≈øion is "Arrears of intere≈øt on New-Loan Debt:" with many other ≈øimilar expre≈ø≈øions.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I have under≈øtood that tho≈øe were the points to which I ≈øhould give evidence, and I have ju≈øt ≈øent for the minutes of 1791 to whet my recollection as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is imperfect at this time. <hi>[Gets the books.]</hi> The only difficulty I have is, the date of the conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I do not recollect that very well, whether before the bill was reported, or while the report of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee on ways and means was before the Hou≈øe‚Äîthe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the conver≈øation was that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> had an objection, he gave me his plan, and reque≈øted me to give my opinion, the plan before the Hou≈øe was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the debts, his plan did not propo≈øe a redemption but commutation with an irredeemable quality. I thought the redeeming plan better and therefore did not approve and I returned him his plan. Another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance, After I returned the plan to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> the Secratary of the commonwealth ≈øhewed me that plan or a copy of it, and reque≈øted me to look at it, and that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> reque≈øted the Governor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the Legi≈ølature, the bill agreeably to the report of the committee of Ways and Means was

then under the con≈øideration of the Legi≈ølature, I told Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> that I had ≈øeen it before, and di≈øapproved of it, and told him the Governor had better examine the plan, and not ≈øend it except he approved of it.</p>
                        <p>After the bill pa≈ø≈øed; and the Hou≈øe adjourned. I was in the Comptroller's office; the conver≈øation turned on the po≈ø≈øibility of carrying the Act into execution, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeveral difficulties aro≈øe, and objections were ≈øtarted, on account of the price of ≈øtock in the market being lower than the price limited in the Act, and propo≈øitions were made to get over the difficulty. Al≈øo whether a part of the 3 per cent. ≈øtock ≈øhould be ≈øold or the whole at once; I was afraid the whole plan would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. The≈øe objections were rai≈øed by the officers. The defendant ≈øugge≈øted that by the law unfunded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates were redeemable, altho' the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature perhaps might not intend it: That it appeared to him unfunded depreciation was redeemable, altho' the report excluded them. Upon that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øhewed me the 6th ≈øection, I a≈ø≈øented to what he ≈øaid, and ≈øaid that I thought the unfunded certificates were included in that ≈øection. I added that I had drawn the bill my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and had made the 6th ≈øection a <hi>provi≈øo</hi> to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; expre≈øsly providing for the redemption of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain certificates therein defined, which would put the thing beyond di≈øpute, becau≈øe the ≈øecond ≈øection defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thing to be redeemed, that the <hi>provi≈øo</hi> was made a di≈øtinct ≈øection out of the Hou≈øe; as ≈øome kind of provi≈øo, always con≈øidered in the Hou≈øe, but a≈ø≈øented at the ≈øame time that the con≈øtruction would extend to unfunded depreciation. I had no time to form an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it was of the moment, on the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øion. I al≈øo added that it was very immaterial to the ≈øtate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem this way, or by the Land-Office, the price being at that time nearly the ≈øame as ca≈øh.<note n="*" place="bottom">The defendant refers to the price-current of the brokers to prove that the price of New-Loans in the market was then as high as unfunded Depreciation certificates.</note> Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> was pre≈øent the whole or mo≈øt of the time.

I do not know the time, it was about May, it was not completed at the end of April, I left town with that receipt in my pocket, which I gave to Mr. <hi>Dougla≈øs,</hi> I know I had no idea of their being of any other u≈øe than for the purpo≈øe of exchange, if I had thought they were redeemable, I would enquire and do the be≈øt for him who employed me.</p>

                        <p>It appears al≈øo that Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> was making a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ≈øub≈øcription, it is pre≈øumable that he knew the law.

A counterfeit certificate of <hi>Lawman,</hi> of <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> gave ri≈øe to this certification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Smith</hi> (≈øon to the late Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans) brought the ≈øub≈øcription book to the ≈øtate loan of the U. S. and being ≈øworn, declared as follows.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi>‚Äî</p>
                        <p>Before I proceed to the next head, I will remark that the ≈øtate ought to pay the full amount, that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ≈øtate ought to pay pound for pound, and really the complaint again≈øt the Comptroller is of an extraordinary nature‚Äî<hi>"Mr. Nichol≈øon acquired wealth that the ≈øtate ought to have got!"</hi>‚ÄîI fancy if any que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be rai≈øed, it ought not to be between the commonwealth, but between the per≈øons from whom Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> bought, he however bought fairly. I now come to the Acts of A≈ø≈øembly, and I will ≈øhew that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction drawn by the managers, is injurious and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and I hope to ≈øhew Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be con≈øonant to good faith, honor and equity. If the law is to receive their con≈øtruction, it will oppo≈øe the Federal Con≈øtitution, which is the ≈øupreme law of the land; and therefore it is utterly void.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="302" facs="unknown:027132_0310_0FD3514C4CEE68D8"/>My po≈øitions are, that New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable to the fir≈øt loan, al≈øo to the ≈øecond, and likewi≈øe redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under the ≈øixth ≈øection of the Act of the 10th April 1792.</p>
                        <p>(Here Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> read the 3d, 7th and 11th ≈øections of the Act of March 1, 1786, to prove that New-Loans were as much a debt as any other.) No matter whether the commonwealth became immediately indebted or thro' the agency of others. Temporary provi≈øion is not apparent from the Act. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth entertained temporary views they were not mutual. Mutuality and reciprocity are the e≈ø≈øence of contracts. Whatever is rea≈øonable with private per≈øons in the ca≈øe of contracts is ≈øo with the State.</p>
                        <p>But it hath been contended that the Act of March 27 1789, puts the≈øe certificates into an ambiguous ≈øtate; let us examine the Act it≈øelf‚Äî"Whereas the duties on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and impo≈øts are given to Congre≈øs‚Äî<hi>temporary</hi> relief ‚Äîit became inconvenient to pay half-yearly, &amp;c."‚Äîthis Act does not compel an exchange, it leaves it optional; perhaps the commonwealth could not pay, what then ought to be done?‚Äîwe will give you an option. You are our creditor; we have contracted to pay you prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intere≈øt; we will pay you four year's intere≈øt becau≈øe we are able to do ≈øo, and we will give you back your original certificate at your option, or we will pay you when we can.</p>
                        <p>The 3d ≈øection did not contemplate that all would exchange, and it implies too much inju≈øtice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety to pre≈øume they meant to ab≈øolve them≈øelves from the payment of the remainder; "MANY," is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive term, it does not imply a majority, it means ≈øome may, others would not.</p>
                        <p>Under the con≈øtruction of the Managers the New-Loan holder is a creditor of nobody; but po≈ø≈øibly or probably may become the creditor of the Continent. Notwith≈øtanding the time of payment is altered, yet the State holds the value in her hands and continues no debtor. How can ≈øuch a con≈øtruction be put on this

Act without flying in the face of the Federal Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion‚Äî(Section 10 of the fir≈øt article is cited,) Congre≈øs in the ninth ≈øection of the ≈øame article is denied the power of making <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> laws.</p>
                        <p>This is the la≈øt of all ≈øuppo≈øable ca≈øes, by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution no State can pa≈øs a law impairing the obligation of contracts made between A and B, con≈øequently a State cannot do it, when ≈øhe is a contracting party.</p>
                        <p>I now refer to the Act of 7th April 1791, that the commonwealth contemplated them as a debt. (He quoted Act of 7th April, 1791, page 51 and 54.) Where the State ≈øeemed to contemplate the preventing of New-Loans from ≈øub≈øcription.

                        <p>I had been in the practice of frequently bringing New-Loans to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged. I was once at the Comptroller's office, I met a per≈øon from <hi>Che≈øter</hi> county who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øly left a New-Loan certificate with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to be exchanged, he appeared to be going away, I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to get indents; I offered to do it for him, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> delivered me the certificate which I afterwards exchanged, probably at ≈øome ≈øub≈øequent period when I was exchanging more for my≈øelf, the date I ≈øuppo≈øe in the winter of 1792.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø.</hi> Was it before the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of the 10th April 1792? and inform of any circum≈øtances re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> I will relate a circum≈øtance; previous to the pa≈ø≈øing of that Act, I came to the Comptroller-General's office, I met Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> going down, almo≈øt as ≈øoon as I came up to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> table, I ≈øaid is it po≈ø≈øible that they will pa≈øs that law? if pa≈ø≈øed as reported it will include New-Loans. Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øaid, I have been endeavouring to convince Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> that it will do ≈øo.</p>
                        <p>We conver≈øed on the ≈øubject and both agreed that it would not be for the intere≈øt of the State, and that it would be better if the Act did not pa≈øs. We thought it better for the State not to ≈øell the ≈øtock. Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øaid, he thought he had convinced Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> I do not remember any thing about unfunded debt‚Äîit appeared to me ≈øo extraordinary that I thought it would not pa≈øs. We did not go into particular ≈øtatements, no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience mentioned except the ≈øelling of the public ≈øtock. After the law pa≈ø≈øed I revolved in my mind whether I ≈øhould go into a ≈øpeculation, but from ≈øome con≈øideration I did not.</p>

(by the minutes) re≈øolved it≈øelf into a committee of the whole to take the Act of the 10th April 1792 into con≈øideration. I will ≈øhew from the books of Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> that he ≈øpoke to Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> as the la≈øt witne≈øs had depo≈øed‚Äî(after ≈øome debate the diary, book A, of the Comptroller was rejected as improper te≈øtimony, being the private memorandum of the defendant, as they alledged.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> was called and declared,</p>
                        <p>I was never before the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives; only before the committee of Ways and Means: never on oath. I was reque≈øted to reduce what I had to writing, and ≈øend it to them, which I did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi>‚ÄîIt has been ≈øuppo≈øed that <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> received Continental Loan-office certificates from the commonwealth of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> the≈øe have been ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> on <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> account to the dome≈øtic debt of the United States‚ÄîAnd the corre≈øponding New-Loans al≈øo by the Comptroller-General on his own account to the State loan. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thence drawn is that the New-Loans were fir≈øt exchanged and then ≈øub≈øcribed, we are not charged with having mi≈øapplied the Continental certificates, the charge mu≈øt be that the New-Loans were exchanged and then ≈øub≈øcribed, but this by no means appears, nor was it the ca≈øe, as we ≈øhall prove by the te≈øtimony of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> him≈øelf, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> purcha≈øed tho≈øe New-Loans of him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>J. Donnald≈øon</hi> attended with his books.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt entry of the redeemed debt made on the 2d of July 1792. The number of the ab≈øtract was pre≈øented and the entry was made of the whole. The fir≈øt entry of unfunded depreciation debt was <hi>Samuel Powel,</hi> upon the ≈øeparation of the debt the ab≈øtracts were ≈øent to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> office to mark the ≈øeveral kinds. They were ≈øent in Augu≈øt or September. After their return to my office, I entered the ab≈øtracts. The next of unfunded depreciation was No. 218, <hi>Robert Buchannan.</hi> The next in≈øtance was No. 256, <hi>Ja≈øper Yeates.</hi> The whole amount of unfunded depreciation was 4,070 dollars and 10 cents:
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:027132_0316_0FD351502870D438"/>
It was paid out of the ≈øale of ≈øtock. I find by my report, that my e≈øtimate to the Governor did not include them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The unfunded Depreciation were entitled under the ≈øixth ≈øection of the Act of the 10th April 1792, and yet they contend that no fund was provided: I have now the warrants from the Trea≈øury‚Äî(Here a number of warrants were produced to ≈øhew that ≈øimilar claims were paid by the 3d and 12th appropriations out of the fund for claims and improvements.) Here I will leave the 4th article.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall now proceed to ≈øhew in≈øtances of New-Loan certificates being lodged with the Comptroller-General for exchange and withdrawn by the proprietors. The following letters were then read.</p>

That it was a week

or more ≈øince he called for the book of Exchanges, no intimation was then given of the depo≈øition, nor ≈øince until the evening of the day before ye≈øterday, that the depo≈øition could not be admitted, nor the trial po≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned; that the day of trial had been fixt, and every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacle could have been removed on proper application.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I acknowledge that the depo≈øition cannot be admitted agreeably to the ≈øtrict rules of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. However well this point may be known to the committee and their coun≈øel, it was unknown to the coun≈øel of the Comptroller-General, till lately; Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> did not con≈øult us; if he had applied to us, I can't pretend to ≈øay what we ≈øhould have advi≈øed him to do. I reque≈øt however that we may have time either to procure his depo≈øition, or liberty to prefer the pre≈øent depo≈øition. If the defendant had been negligent, it is hard to condemn him unheard. One of the Managers agreed to inform the Comptroller whether this would be brought forward on the trial or not, which was not done.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll.</hi> I can't conceive that a witne≈øs can come forward as well as if he had not been previou≈øly ≈øworn; I will however agree to ≈øay nothing about <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> If there can be a return of the commi≈ø≈øion before the argument will be clo≈øed: I have no doubt but a return may be had without interruption.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I think the propo≈øition a fair one, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> is known to ≈øome members of the Legi≈ølature. And if the an≈øwers cannot be had in time, the Senate will judge whether they will wait for them or not.</p>
                     <p>Some arguments were adduced re≈øpecting the po≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponement of the 6th and 7th articles, at la≈øt it was agreed to omit <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> altogether.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ≈øhewed from the book of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes kept in the Comptroller-General's office, that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had brought upwards of 74 thou≈øand dollars to the office and had them exchanged.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> a≈øked when the entries were made; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:027132_0323_0FD351830565A338"/>
was, when the indents were paid: the ab≈øtracts were made immediately‚Äîand the≈øe were all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes that were ever made for Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I will now take a retro≈øpective view of the articles of impeachment, and fir≈øt of the 7th, which if taken by it≈øelf, and no objection hereafter to be made the te≈øtimony fixes no criminality on the Comptroller-General; the 5th and 6th are not ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, no criminal conduct in him to do what any per≈øon might have done, the exchange had not been prohibited, any per≈øon might purcha≈øe. 4th article, the holders of principal and intere≈øt are entitled to draw their money out of the 12th appropriation‚Äîit is evident he u≈øed no deceit.</p>
                     <p>3d article. It is manife≈øt that he u≈øed no deceit with the Regi≈øter-General or other officer, the account was ≈øent forward in a po≈øitive manner, the amount of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ≈øum plain, no di≈øgui≈øe in the tran≈øaction, the ab≈øtract was in his own name, from the nature of the account they might ea≈øily di≈øcover they were New-Loans, he did not certify <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> in his own ca≈øe. The 1≈øt and 2d articles‚Äî<hi>the</hi> 6<hi>th ≈øection provided a redemption pound for pound.</hi> Whatever was ≈øub≈øcribable was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable. Attend to the Act of March 1789‚Äî"Many would be willing to exchange" others would not, ≈øhall tho≈øe who are unwilling, be excluded, this is a mi≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, any other con≈øtruction than ours would be derogatory to the honor and dignity of the State.</p>
                     <p>If the defendant had been mi≈øtaken, here is a great que≈øtion, whether he acted with a fraudulent de≈øign, or whether his actions were the re≈øult of his judgment, his opinion was not ≈øimilated but genuine and po≈øitive that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States. To convict him there ought to be proof clear and unequivocal; the con≈øequences of that conviction are terrible, not only di≈ømi≈ø≈øion from office, but incapacity of holding any po≈øt of honor or profit, the party who attempts to criminate ≈øhould prove the charges. Six of the ≈øeven articles conclude with <hi>"Lo≈øs

and injury to the commonwealth."</hi> What lo≈øs and injury? ≈øhe only paid pound for pound, ≈øhe received full value, ≈øhe promi≈øed to pay pound for pound, con≈øequently ought to pay full value, this is no inju≈øtice. Can any ≈øaving of money be put in competition with national honor and the immutable principles of ju≈øtice? and yet ≈øix of the≈øe articles conclude‚Äî<hi>with lo≈øs and injury!</hi> I have no doubt of his con≈øtruction of the law being true and genuine, I ≈øhall therefore leave the matter to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, tru≈øting that as the i≈ø≈øue is important, ≈øo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion will be honorable to the Comptroller-General.</p>

                        <p>This article, after declaring that the New-Loans cea≈øed to be a State-debt on the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 1789, charges the defendant with certifying them to be ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of Congre≈øs as debts of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> contrary to his official tru≈øt, and as he well knew to the manife≈øt injury of the commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øub≈øtantial part of the article con≈øi≈øts in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition that the New-Loans were not State debt after March 1789, nor of cour≈øe ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan, and grounds on this ba≈øis the ≈øub≈øequent charge of guilt in the defendant in declaring them to be ≈øub≈øcribable.</p>
                        <p>To a≈øcertain the weight of this po≈øition it will be nece≈ø≈øary to a≈øcend to the origin of the≈øe certificates, and to trace them from that time to the period men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the article.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>From the whole complexion of this Act it appears that the Legi≈ølature con≈øidered the certificates i≈ø≈øued in pur≈øuance of it, or in other words the New-Loans, as effectually State debt, as tho≈øe of any other de≈øcription. For they on the face of the certificate promi≈øe to pay the principal on or before the year 1796, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt half-yearly until that time. The Land-office is open for their reception as for other certificates; and tho≈øe which were peculiarly ≈øituated as already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are directed to be reduced to ≈øpecie value on the payment of the principal.</p>
                        <p>The merit of the holders of the≈øe certificates was equally great, with the holders of any other. The debts were contracted in a common cau≈øe‚Äîthe citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> were the creditors, and the State her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf enjoyed in common with the other States, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their exertions.</p>
                        <p>That the provi≈øion made in this Act was de≈øigned to be permanent, and the New-Loan creditors con≈øidered by our Legi≈ølature of the mo≈øt meritorious cla≈øs, will appear in the ≈øtronge≈øt manner by referring to a re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legi≈ølature upon this ≈øubject on the 27th December 1786, Minutes of A≈ø≈øembly, p. 97.</p>

                        <p>"That they have examined the object of the ≈øaid report with the attention due to its importance:</p>

                        <p>"That there appears to have been due to the citizens of this commonwealth a ≈øum which ≈øhe has undertaken to pay them, and which probably amounts nearly to her proportion of the whole debt.</p>
                        <p>"That the appropriation of funds for that purpo≈øe is of ≈øuch nature, that the report now referred to your committee (and which was adopted by the la≈øt A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) declares, "an immediate compliance with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation would involve a breach of the faith of this ≈øtate, pledged to the public creditors, citizens thereof, unle≈øs at the ≈øame time ≈øome further and other funds were provided for payment of the intere≈øt due and which ≈øhall become due to them:"</p>
                        <p>"That in the opinion of your committee, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the appropriation ju≈øt mentioned renders the provi≈øion alluded to in the report impracticable.</p>

neither be ju≈øt nor prudent to call on the citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> for payment of taxes, to di≈øcharge the money due to others, while that which is due to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves is unprovided for.</p>
                        <p>"Your committee therefore propo≈øe the following re≈øolution:</p>
                        <p>"That the Delegates of this State in Congre≈øs be in≈øtructed to a≈ø≈øure the United States of the ≈øincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> to make an adequate provi≈øion for all the debts of the Union; that this de≈øire, fully evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her ready compliance with pa≈øt requi≈øitions, will equally operate on future determinations; that the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈øs of her citizens, to whom large ≈øums were due, and who were at the ≈øame time compelled to pay their proportion of ≈øupplies for the current expenditures, called loudly for relief; that having waited in vain for a general a≈ø≈øent to the mea≈øures propo≈øed by Congre≈øs, until the grievance complained of could no longer be borne, it became nece≈ø≈øary to a≈ø≈øume the payment of tho≈øe ≈øums which were due by the Union to her own citizens; that in con≈øequence, the funds now required by the United States were appropriated to this object, and the debts due to individuals were transferred to the State, whereby <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> became the creditor of the Union; that this Hou≈øe cannot divert the funds ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the appropriation formerly made, until ≈øuch ≈øolid provi≈øion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual intere≈øt payable to <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> will be a certain and ≈øufficient fund for di≈øcharging tho≈øe ≈øums, which ≈øhe is bound in the manner abovementioned to pay to her citizens, but that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> will in the mean time account for her full quota of the ≈øums ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to di≈øcharge the intere≈øt, and in≈øtalments of principal, due or to become due by the United States, and, after deducting therefrom the intere≈øt ≈øhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to receive, will regularly pay any balance that may remain due on ≈øuch quota."</p>
                        <p>In this ≈øituation the New-Loans continued; a debt deliberately formed, and ≈øanctioned by this re≈øolution,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:027132_0329_0FD3519E07C132F0"/>
until the Act of the 27th of March 1789, p. 694, which it is contended has de≈øtroyed the debt.</p>
                        <p>It may be proper to glance at the ≈øituation of affairs at the time of pa≈ø≈øing this Act, before we proceed to con≈øider the Act it≈øelf. For by ≈øeeing how far the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of the times required an alteration, and what alteration was requi≈øite to an≈øwer and remove that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity, we obtain a good criterion to determine the true intent of the law;‚Äîas the fir≈øt mu≈øt have been the cau≈øe inducing the Legi≈ølature to pa≈øs it, and the la≈øt the object de≈øigned to be accompli≈øhed by its pa≈ø≈øing.</p>
                        <p>It appears then that by the Act of March 1786, the Legi≈ølature freely and openly e≈øtabli≈øhed the loan upon permanent and liberal principles, that they had con≈øtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a debt, which they con≈øidered them≈øelves <hi>ab≈øolutely</hi> bound to di≈øcharge, and which they could not, con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with good faith attempt to injure. In the year 1789, from the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the Federal Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Congre≈øs became entitled to the impo≈øt, and the State was in con≈øequence deprived of her mo≈øt u≈øeful and productive revenue, and was utterly unable without additional taxes, to di≈øcharge the annual demands, The≈øe additional taxes it would be too burthen≈øome at this time to levy, as the citizens exclu≈øive of tho≈øe they paid in common, were then paying an annual land tax of ¬£.76,000; many of the former were greatly in arrear, and of cour≈øe no additional one would be punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually complied with. The be≈øt mode that occurred to remove the≈øe difficulties was to ≈øu≈øpend the payments of the New-Loan debt, which from its greater magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude pre≈ø≈øed harder man any other. The ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the principal (which might ea≈øily be done as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be exacted by the contract before 1796) immediately clo≈øed the Land-office again≈øt it, which in con≈øequence became a more productive fund for the redemption of the other debt, and together with the pre≈øent ≈øtoppage of the intere≈øt, would remove the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barra≈ø≈øment occa≈øioned by the lo≈øs of the impo≈øt. As Congre≈øs would probably provide for the public debts,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:027132_0330_0FD35156F72C1988"/>
being con≈øtitutionally authori≈øed to do ≈øo, it would be but fair to permit the≈øe creditors to enjoy the benefits of ≈øuch provi≈øion, as a compen≈øation for the lo≈øs now ≈øuffered, and to enable them to become Continental creditors for that purpo≈øe.</p>
                        <p>That this was the intention of the Legi≈ølature we may not only pre≈øume from adverting to the ≈øituation of the times, but it al≈øo appears from the complexion of the Act it≈øelf.</p>
                        <p>The fir≈øt ≈øection which con≈øtitutes a lengthy preamble, recites the Act of March 1786, with its ≈øupplement, and ≈øtates the actual ≈øituation of things. That Congre≈øs have power to provide for the public debts; that they have become entitled to the impo≈øt, which the State con≈øequently lo≈øes; that the aggregate fund, out of which the New-Loans were paid is dimini≈øhed by the withdrawing of the impo≈øt; that Congre≈øs will no doubt provide for the creditors; and declares that on the≈øe con≈øiderations the relief granted by the preceding Acts ≈øhould cea≈øe, provi≈øion ≈øhould be made out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury of the United States, and that proper alterations are nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                        <p>This preamble conforms to the ≈øtatement ju≈øt given. As far as there is a recital and con≈øtruction of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Acts, they mu≈øt both conform to them. The Legi≈ølature certainly had no de≈øign to deceive‚Äînor to form a con≈øtruction, nor to pur≈øue mea≈øures, in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ≈øuch con≈øtruction which the Acts them≈øelves or public faith would not warrant. The provi≈øions made in the former Acts were de≈øigned to be permanent, and if public nece≈ø≈øity now compelled an alteration it ju≈øtified it no further than the inability of the State required‚Äîthat inability required no more than a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of payment, and ju≈øtice to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors demanded that to compen≈øate this lo≈øs, they ≈øhould be entitled to any benefits Congre≈øs might grant by exchanging their certificates ≈øhould that mea≈øure become nece≈ø≈øary. This Act ≈øhould not be con≈øidered ≈øeparately and di≈øtinctly, but relatively to the others on the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:027132_0331_0FD351A028D61DE8"/>
and the con≈øtruction be determined from a general view of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The alterations intended are contained in the ≈øecond ≈øection, which directs "That the intere≈øt due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates i≈ø≈øued by the Comptroller-General in pur≈øuance of the ≈øaid recited Acts or either of them, ≈øhall be paid up ≈øo as to complete the payment of intere≈øt to four years; and that ≈øo much of every Act or Acts of General A≈ø≈øembly as directs or ≈øecures the payment of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ≈øum or ≈øums in the ≈øaid certificates or any of them mentioned, or of the intere≈øt thereof beyond the term of four years ≈øhall be and the ≈øame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</p>
                        <p>The Legi≈ølature in≈øtead of repealing the Act of March 1786, or de≈øtroying the certificates, declaring them in the language of the impeachment to be no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt, due and owing from the State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> merely repeat that part of it, which provides for the payment of the principal or the intere≈øt beyond 4 years: the remainder therefore of the Act continues in full force and every thing already completed ≈øtands unaffected. The expre≈ø≈øions <hi>null and void</hi> could not be here intended to have any reference to the pa≈øt, becau≈øe the intere≈øt is directed to be paid on the whole to complete 4 years, and in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this requi≈øition payments mu≈øt in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances be made of intere≈øt <hi>accruing after</hi> the pa≈ø≈øing of this Act, as in the≈øe ca≈øes its commencement was not four years before its pa≈ø≈øing; the whole clau≈øe therefore with re≈øpect to payment, operates on ≈øome as a pre≈øent on others as a future prohibition, but in no in≈øtance as a retro≈øpect.</p>
                        <p>Moreover had the Act of March 1789 entirely repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Act of March 1786, it would not have thereby effected the de≈øtruction of the certificates. They were completed under the Act while in full force, and could not be injured by any ≈øub≈øequent repeal. Like titles
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:027132_0332_0FD351A17872E1C8"/>
under laws that afterwards become ob≈øolete, expire, or are repealed they ≈øtill remain in full vigour.</p>
                        <p>The Act al≈øo of March 1789 ≈øo far from having a retro≈øpect to the pa≈øt, only refers to the pre≈øent and the future, and be≈øides the payment of the intere≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, contemplates the probability that many New-Loan creditors may wi≈øh under the circum≈øtances in which they are placed, to retake the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates loaned to the State, and therefore appropriates them <hi>a fund</hi> for the redemption of the New-Loans to ≈øuch as chu≈øe to take them; the 3d ≈øection regulating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding‚ÄîCouncil under who≈øe direction the whole was placed, among other regulations direct by rule 3d that where an equal exchange cannot be made <hi>fre≈øh New-Loan certificates</hi> ≈øhall be i≈ø≈øued for the balance. The≈øe have accordingly been i≈ø≈øued in numerous in≈øtances, and have always been con≈øidered of equal validity with tho≈øe originally i≈ø≈øued. This could not be ju≈øtified had the law <hi>aboli≈øhed</hi> the certificates, as their circulation would be de≈øtroyed, they would no longer exi≈øt a demand again≈øt the commonwealth, and of cour≈øe no new ones could legally be i≈ø≈øued.</p>
                        <p>Had the Legi≈ølature de≈øigned to annihilate the debt, they certainly would have taken effectual mea≈øures for that purpo≈øe and have aboli≈øhed the certificates alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. An appo≈øite in≈øtance has taken place in <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> where the Legi≈ølature de≈øigning to de≈øtroy certain certificates, commonly called Warrenton certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, which had corruptly i≈ø≈øued, altho' under legal authority; they explicitly declare that <hi>all the certificates</hi> of this de≈øcription are <hi>null and void</hi> and ≈øhall not be received in payment of taxes or any other public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what≈øoever. <hi>(North-Carolina</hi> Laws, p. 475.)</p>
                        <p>Let us ≈øuppo≈øe however for a moment, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature de≈øigned to de≈øtroy the≈øe certificates. It would then be contended that they were deprived of the power. At the time of pa≈ø≈øing this Act the Federal Con≈øtitution was in complete operation: The 10th ≈øection of the fir≈øt article declares that "No State ≈øhall enter into any
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:027132_0333_0FD351A49FDA0D80"/>
treaty, alliance or confederation; grant letters of marque and repri≈øal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and ≈øilver coin a tender in payment of debts; pa≈øs any bill of attainder, ex po≈øt facto laws, <hi>or law impairing the obligation of contracts,</hi> or grant any title of nobility."‚ÄîThat the ≈øtate by the fir≈øt Act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the holders of New-Loans and engaged her≈øelf to pay them, can admit of no doubt, for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the Act it≈øelf, it is ≈øolemnly acknowledged in the re≈øolution of December 1786. As little doubt can be entertained that if the Legi≈ølature in the la≈øt Act, intended to de≈øtroy the debt, it was invalidating the engagement and of cour≈øe impairing the contract. This Act therefore if de≈øigned for this purpo≈øe is <hi>void</hi> by the Con≈øtitution of the United States. This Con≈øtitution was lately adopted; it had been fully debated before its adoption; many of the members of this Legi≈ølature had al≈øo been members of the Convention that adopted it, they mu≈øt have been fully ≈øen≈øible of its obligatory force, and little inclined to act in direct, and it may be added, violent oppo≈øition to it.</p>
                        <p>To con≈øtrue this law then, as an <hi>abolition</hi> of the debt, would be to make it violate every principle of national honor and ju≈øtice‚Äîto operate in the nature of an ex po≈øt facto law, re≈øcinding contracts fairly made, and ≈øolemnly acknowledged to be binding‚Äîit would make the Legi≈ølature act in direct oppo≈øition to their former explicit declarations and the Federal Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion‚Äîit would in fine be ≈øuppo≈øing intentions very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from tho≈øe that actuated the Legi≈ølature at the time.</p>
                        <p>We have ≈øeen then that the occa≈øion did not require an abolition of the debt; that a repeal of the whole Act of March 1786 would not effect it, much le≈øs then a repeal of a particular part‚Äîthat it would be contrary to the principles of ju≈øtice and the Con≈øtitution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy it‚Äîof cour≈øe we have no rea≈øon to pre≈øume that the Legi≈ølature intended it.</p>

                        <p>By an Act pa≈ø≈øed 7th April 1791, p. 51, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is directed to negociate a loan with the bank of <hi>North-America,</hi> which when effected, together with the other funds are formed into an aggregate fund to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge certain obligations of the commonwealth, and the≈øe are to be paid agreeably to the order they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged in by the Act. Among others are the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of intere≈øt due on the New-Loan certificates.

                        <p>The 3d ≈øection of an Act pa≈ø≈øed 7th of April 1791, page 54, directs the <hi>injurious and impolitic expedient</hi> of re-i≈ø≈øuing the bills of credit which the <hi>public faith</hi> was already plighted to de≈øtroy; to pay off the arrearages of intere≈øt due on the New-Loans, in order that they might not interfere with the arrangements of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth for ≈øub≈øcribing to the loan of Congre≈øs. Their <hi>interference</hi> mu≈øt certainly have been a matter of great importance to render ≈øo injurious an expedient nece≈ø≈øary in order to prevent it; but in what manner it may be a≈øked can they po≈ø≈øibly interfere? If they no longer continue <hi>State debt,</hi> the State is <hi>no longer</hi> under an obligation to pay them, ≈øhe therefore on this account could have no concern‚Äîif they are not <hi>≈øub≈øcribable</hi> to the loan of Congre≈øs, they could not interfere with the arrangements of the State for ≈øub≈øcribing to that loan; for they would be of no validity, and if offered for ≈øub≈øcription, would undoubtedly be rejected. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates which the State had received in lieu of the New-Loans, ≈øhe had already appropriated as a fund for redeeming them, and if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for the New-Loans, the≈øe la≈øt would not be ≈øub≈øcribed by the State, becau≈øe the law of the United States which authori≈øed the ≈øub≈øcription, expre≈øsly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected an equivalent to be ≈øurrendered up, before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt could be paid, and as the State in this in≈øtance, would have parted with the equivalent it would be injurious to do it. The New-Loans could therefore interfere with the≈øe arrangements in no other way than this; they were at this time both State debt, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable to the loan of Congre≈øs; their quantity (if ≈øub≈øcribed) would exclude the other State creditors from ≈øubcribing, and deprive the State of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ≈øhe now had, of di≈øcharging great part of her debts, and of making ample provi≈øion for the future di≈øcharge of the remainder. In order to improve this
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:027132_0336_0FD351A9410FB2B0"/>
favourable opportunity, it became a matter of mo≈øt ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern to exclude the≈øe certificates from ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the State was compelled thro' the want of a better, to pur≈øue the injurious expedient mentioned in the Act, which it was pre≈øumed would be, as it actually was, counterbalanced by the re≈øult.</p>
                        <p>By virtue of the Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt, 1790, two loans were opened; one of the dome≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic debt to its full amount; the other of the State debts to the amount of 21,500,000 dollars, which were a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed by the United States, under the exceptions and re≈øtrictions laid down in the Act. Of the≈øe 21,500,000 dollars, the portion allotted to <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was, 2,200,000, which was payable in tho≈øe ≈øtate certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates which prior to the 1≈øt January, 1790, had i≈ø≈øued for national purpo≈øes. The debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was at this time cla≈ø≈øed under three de≈øcriptions, Funded debt, Depreciation debt, and New-Loan debt. On the whole of the Funded, and part of the Depreciation (thence called Funded Depreciation) the State paid an intere≈øt of 6 per cent.; on the unfounded depreciation, (which include the remainder) intere≈øt tho' payable, had never been paid as no funds had been appropriated for the purpo≈øe: and on the New-Loans, no intere≈øt except the 4 year's arrears was at this time paying. The whole amount of the funded and depreciation debt, did not exceed 1,500,000 dollars; the New-Loans alone exceeded 2,200,000 the ≈øum a≈ø≈øumed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the New-Loans could be <hi>excluded</hi> from ≈øub≈øcription, and the holders <hi>induced</hi> to redeem them by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates, at the ≈øame time proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to tho≈øe State creditors, to whom the State was paying intere≈øt, viz. the holders of the funded debt, and funded depreciation, to ≈øub≈øcribe to the State loan; the State would immediately get rid of all her New-Loan debt, ≈øhe would have the amount of the other ≈øub≈øcribed, redeemed by virtue of the ≈øub≈øcription‚Äî her revenues would be relieved from the greater part of the annual intere≈øt ≈øhe was now paying, as upon the plan
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:027132_0337_0FD351AABA0001D8"/>
≈øhe was pur≈øuing, the intere≈øt ≈øhe would receive from the un≈øub≈øcribed re≈øiduum, would compen≈øate the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribers for what they would otherwi≈øe loo≈øe by ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If on the contrary, the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would exclude the others, and add to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the State. No time however could be more favourable than the pre≈øent, for accompli≈øhing the plan, and no mode better adapted to the purpo≈øe, than the one pur≈øued.</p>
                        <p>In the dome≈øtic loan, the intere≈øt ≈øub≈øcribed, was ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the principal, and exclu≈øively became 3 per cent. ≈øtock: two thirds of the principal became 6 per cent. ≈øtock, and the remaining third, 6 per cents deferred. In the State loan the principal and intere≈øt were thrown into a common ma≈øs, one third of which was converted into 3 per cent. ≈øtock, two thirds of the remaining two thirds into 6 per cent. ≈øtock, and one third of two thirds into 6 per cents. deferred. From this la≈øt arrangement it followed that unle≈øs the intere≈øt ≈øub≈øcribed, amounted to one third of the whole ≈øum ≈øub≈øcribed ≈øo much of the principal as equalled this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, ≈øupplied its place and was converted into 3 per cents. In order that the intere≈øt ≈øhould amount to one third of the whole, it required an arrearage of eight years and a quarter. In the ca≈øe therefore of the New-Loans, when the arrearages was eight years and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the holder might ≈øub≈øcribe them to the State loan, or exchange them for the Continental certificates and ≈øub≈øcribe the≈øe to the dome≈øtic loan, ≈øince in both ca≈øes the intere≈øt alone, became 3 per cent. ≈øtock. Where the arrear was greater it was his intere≈øt to ≈øub≈øcribe the New-Loan in preference to the Continental certificate, as the exce≈øs of intere≈øt became 6 per cent. ≈øtock or 6 per cents. deferred. Where it was le≈øs it became inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to ≈øub≈øcribe them becau≈øe part of the principal went to ≈øupply the deficiency. By paying off four years immediately on the New-Loans, and di≈øcountenancing their ≈øub≈øcription to the State loan, (which was done by the Act pa≈ø≈øed two days afterwards, making the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:027132_0338_0FD350F551B8C228"/>
alluded to in this Act, and which gave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement only to the ≈øub≈øcription of certificates on which an intere≈øt was then paying,) the arrears of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt were reduced below eight years and a quarter, it became the intere≈øt of the holder to redeem the New-Loan by the Continental, and ≈øub≈øcribe to the dome≈øtic loan. It was al≈øo his intere≈øt to receive the 4 years arrear in preference to ≈øub≈øcribing the New-Loan; as the indents to be paid the State on the exchange to equalize the intere≈øt, were then low, the amount he paid the State on the New-Loan became due to him on the Continental, and the money paid him by the State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new principal. The State by agreeing to pay 6 per cent. on the deferred, and 3 per cent. on the 3 per cent. ≈øtock, created by the ≈øub≈øcription of the other State debt, was a ≈øufficient inducement to the creditor to ≈øub≈øcribe, as by this mean the arrears of intere≈øt were converted into 6 per cent. ≈øtock.</p>
                        <p>The State by this policy got rid of mo≈øt of the New-Loans; redeemed 650,000 dollars of her other debt; and became entitled to an intere≈øt of a re≈øiduum of 1,550,000 dollars, which amounted to nearly 56,000 dollars annually or upwards of ¬£. 20,000. The≈øe were the advantages ≈øhe promi≈øed her≈øelf from the plan ≈øhe had then formed; they appeared ≈øufficiently important to be purcha≈øed at the expence of this ruinous expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and they were effectually ≈øecured, in con≈øequence of the mea≈øures pur≈øued. The≈øe two Acts as effectually ≈øhew the ideas the <hi>Legi≈ølature</hi> entertained of the <hi>≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribability</hi> of New-Loans as the mo≈øt expre≈øs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could po≈ø≈øibly be made on the ≈øubject.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing ≈øurvey it ≈øufficiently appears, that the Act of March, 1789, <hi>did not de≈øtroy</hi> the New-Loans, that in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>Legi≈ølature</hi> they ≈øtill continued a debt, and were in their e≈øtimation ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the loan of the United States. It will now be proper to con≈øider the Act e≈øtabli≈øhing that loan and to point out that part which admits their ≈øub≈øcription.</p>
                        <p>The Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th of Augu≈øt 1790,
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:027132_0339_0FD351AD03707288"/>
continued by that of the 8th of May 1792, was formed to introduce order and harmony into the public finances, by reducing to a few kinds the great variety of public ≈øecurities;‚Äîto make a Continental debt of all tho≈øe State certificates which had i≈ø≈øued for national purpo≈øes ‚Äîand to give ≈øecurity and value to the whole by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting counterfeits, and appropriating permanent funds for their regular payment. It therefore in the 13th ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, page 93, a≈ø≈øumes all State certificates or notes which had i≈ø≈øued prior to the fir≈øt of January 1790, as compen≈øations or expenditures for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies towards the pro≈øecution of the war, excepting the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly excluded.</p>
                        <p>The New-Loans clearly come within this de≈øcription. They were directed to i≈ø≈øue, and con≈øequently did i≈ø≈øue, only for Continental certificates which had i≈ø≈øued for the≈øe ≈øervices. The <hi>≈øervices</hi> them≈øelves were the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inducement for i≈ø≈øuing them, and Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of this de≈øcription only were received.</p>
                        <p>If this ≈øection is con≈øtrued ≈øtrictly according to the letter the depreciation certificates about which there has exi≈øted no doubt would al≈øo be excluded, as they ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking did not i≈ø≈øue for <hi>≈øervices</hi> but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øate <hi>lo≈ø≈øes</hi> occa≈øioned by the depreciation of the ≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pay; tho' here as in the ca≈øe of the New-Loans, the ≈øervices rendered were the original inducement.</p>
                        <p>This con≈øtruction would al≈øo operate to exclude a con≈øiderable portion of the funded debt, as it ≈øtood at the time of the loan. For altho' the greater part of it originally i≈ø≈øued agreeably to the letter of the Act, as compen≈øations or expenditures for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies, yet, for the convenience of payments at the Land-office, and to facilitate their circulation, the original certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were frequently ≈øurrendered up, and new ones i≈ø≈øued for different ≈øums, and in different numbers as ≈øuited the convenience of the party. The≈øe la≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having i≈ø≈øued for <hi>other</hi> certificates would agreeably to this <hi>≈øtrict</hi> con≈øtruction be excluded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="332" facs="unknown:027132_0340_0FD3515849ACB710"/>In order to accompli≈øh the de≈øign of this Act it was as nece≈ø≈øary to a≈ø≈øume the New-Loans as any other certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. They were certificates of the State, and the State was a creditor of the United States to an equal amount. Congre≈øs therefore by a≈ø≈øuming them, and directing that before intere≈øt could be paid an equal amount of Continental certificates ≈øhould be ≈øurrendered up, at once withdrew both from circulation. As a holder of New-Loans, the United States could exchange with the State for an equal amount of Continental certificates, and the ≈øum ≈øub≈øcribed, for which the State would be debited in her accounts with the Union, ≈øhe could ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance by pre≈øenting an equal amount of New-Loans which ≈øhe had redeemed in this way, and which would be on the ≈øame footing with the other certificates ≈øhe had redeemed.</p>
                        <p>Could any doubt exi≈øt re≈øpecting the con≈øtruction of the 13th ≈øection, it mu≈øt be removed by the 18th, page 97, which con≈øidering all certificates ≈øituated like the New-Loans, as ≈øub≈øcribable under the 13th ≈øection makes the nece≈ø≈øary regulations to prevent any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that might otherwi≈øe en≈øue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Trea≈øury in his in≈øtructions to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans for this State, declares they are ≈øub≈øcribable, and directs arrangements in con≈øequence. In his letters to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly con≈øiders them ≈øub≈øcribable. His negociations with our government are founded on a belief that they have been <hi>actually</hi> ≈øub≈øcribed, and turn at la≈øt upon the fact of their having been ≈øub≈øcribed or not.</p>
                        <p>If an inconvenience were to ari≈øe to the State in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of their ≈øub≈øcription, this would not de≈øtroy their ≈øub≈øcribability. That ari≈øes from the <hi>a≈ø≈øumption</hi> of Congre≈øs and not from any <hi>arrangement</hi> of the State. The loan is opened to the State creditors and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent or refu≈øal of the State has no concern with it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs may a≈ø≈øume what debts they plea≈øe, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may transfer to them all debts of a transferrable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is a matter entirely between Congre≈øs and the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:027132_0341_0FD351AED574CC40"/>
creditor in which the State cannot interfere more than in the transfer from citizen to citizen. In the ≈øettlement of accounts between the United States and this ≈øtate, the intere≈øt commences, and either party may allow or reject ≈øuch items as are improper, but this can have no effect upon the original a≈ø≈øumption, which concerns merely Congre≈øs and the ≈øtate creditor.</p>
                        <p>One object in view by the a≈ø≈øumption was to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the creditor, from the precarious and frequently inadequate relief of State provi≈øions. The≈øe creditors were certainly of this de≈øcription, and in no ca≈øe except in others ≈øimilarly circum≈øtanced could Congre≈øs a≈ø≈øume certificates with ≈øo much ≈øafety, as they had i≈ø≈øued for debts originally liquidated and adju≈øted by the United States.</p>
                        <p>I hope then it has been ≈øatisfactorily proved, that the New-Loans were in their fir≈øt e≈øtabli≈øhment State debt; placed on a permanent footing, and highly favoured; that their de≈øtruction was not de≈øigned by the Act of March 1789; that at ≈øucceeding periods they have been con≈øidered as State debt and ≈øub≈øcribable by the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature it≈øelf, of cour≈øe the ≈øub≈øcriptions made have been conformable to law.</p>
                        <p>We now come to the po≈øition which forms the e≈ø≈øence of the ≈øecond article, viz. that the New-Loans were not nor could in any way be contemplated as objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the Act of April 1792.</p>
                        <p>This Act was de≈øigned to di≈øcharge the certificates of the State, and her other obligations which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intere≈øt required and which it was now in the power of the State to perform. Our Legi≈ølature had always conceived it to be more advantageous to the State to redeem her certificates in the ca≈øes where ≈øhe had it in her power thro' the <hi>medium</hi> of the United States in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>paying them off</hi> and making that payment a credit in her accounts with the Union. This was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the fir≈øt ≈øub≈øcription to the State loan which was promoted by the ≈øtate, and this was their wi≈øh in the Act of April 1792 as is apparent from the Act it≈øelf.
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:027132_0342_0FD350F816CBDC78"/>
By the fir≈øt ≈øub≈øcription the State redeemed all the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates that were ≈øub≈øcribed, and only paid in return that portion of intere≈øt which the United States did not, which payment was to continue only until the United States paid it. She now wi≈øhed to redeem all her debt inclu≈øive of the evidences of this obligation, commonly called Purpart certificates, and altho' ≈øhe in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, paid off the whole in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, yet ≈øhe received from the United States an equivalent for the greater part of it, which was an active and productive ≈øtock annually encrea≈øing in value, and which by good management might be u≈øefully appropriated. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in value between the certificates received and the money paid by the State in redemption, which was the only lo≈øs ≈øu≈øtained by this mode, (for if they were of equal value it would only amount to a mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of equal intere≈øts) was of le≈øs con≈øequence, than paying off the whole at once, and that payment remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dormant claim upon the Union, until the final adju≈øtment of accounts and provi≈øion for the balance ≈øhould call it into activity. It ≈øhould be con≈øidered al≈øo that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was at this time deemed a creditor State, to a con≈øiderable amount and as in other ca≈øes of debtor and creditor, it was more to her advantage to redeem her certificates by way of ≈øet-off in this account than to advance more money on it and thereby ≈øwell the credit further. Moreover upon ≈øtriking the balance of this account the State had no rea≈øon to pre≈øume that ≈øhe would be more favoured in the di≈øcharge of it, than the citizen creditors had been in the payment of their debts, but that certificates would i≈ø≈øue to her in the ≈øame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, they had already i≈ø≈øued to them. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better to receive them now and make them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately productive than wait a future day.</p>
                        <p>The Act therefore of April, 1792, after appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 3 per cent. ≈øtock as a redeeming fund, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting certain debts to be paid from the proceeds of the ≈øale; contemplates in the ≈øixth ≈øection a further provi≈øion to be made by Congre≈øs, and directs that all
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:027132_0343_0FD351B0B89BBEB8"/>
certificates entitled to ≈øuch provi≈øions, ≈øhall be entitled to the benefits of this Act upon transferring to the ≈øtate all the benefits the creditor was to enjoy from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion. The 8th of May following the loan was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Congre≈øs upon the <hi>≈øame terms,</hi> and of cour≈øe included all certificates that were ≈øub≈øcribable to the fir≈øt. This Act of April 1792 directing all certificates to be paid that were ≈øub≈øcribable of cour≈øe redeemed them. The New-Loans have already been proved to be ≈øub≈øcribable to this loan; and are therefore within the provi≈øions of this Act. That they came within the view of the Legi≈ølature at the time, and were de≈øigned to be redeemed, will appear from the following con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. The Legi≈ølature knew they were in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They had pa≈ø≈øed laws relieving tho≈øe who had lo≈øt them. They had endeavoured to prevent their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription to the fir≈øt loan, and promote their redemption from the fund provided. In this de≈øign they had ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ≈øo far as to redeem the greater quantity; the whole amount now in circulation not exceeding fifty thou≈øand pounds, a ≈øum comparatively ≈ømall. Altho' intere≈øt was not now paying, it was accruing, and the arrear becoming great. Though the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were a fund for their redemption, yet the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor could not be <hi>compelled</hi> to redeem them in that way. The year 1796 was approaching when they were to be paid agreeably to contract. The exten≈øion of the fir≈øt loan was contemplated in this Act, as the mea≈øure mo≈øt probable, which they knew would include them. In fine, every argument that applies to prove the nece≈ø≈øity of redeeming any part of the public debt, applies with equal force in favor of the redemption of the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>The third article charges him with not con≈øulting with the Governor, nor the Regi≈øter-General; nor di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating the certificates on the ab≈øtracts, by which he declared them a≈ø≈øumable, nor on the certificate by which he declared them redeemable, by which means
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:027132_0344_0FD350F94BC1B848"/>
the checks of office were broken, and the other officers deluded into error.</p>
                        <p>Both loans were opened with the concurrence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of our Legi≈ølature, who promoted ≈øub≈øcriptions of ≈øtate debt by laws enacted for the purpo≈øe. It of cour≈øe became the duty of the officers of this ≈øtate who had it in their power to facilitate the ≈øub≈øcription by their a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the conductor of the loan in this ≈øtate, applied to the defendant before the opening of the fir≈øt loan (≈øee page 271) to give him a de≈øcription of the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of certificates ≈øub≈øcribable, and ≈øuch checks as would enable him to conduct the bu≈øine≈øs with ≈øecurity. The defendant was the only per≈øon to apply to, he having i≈ø≈øued all the certificates of the ≈øtate, and having all the checks in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, he accordingly gives him the required information and at the ≈øame time his opinion that the New-Loans <hi>were ≈øub≈øcribable.</hi> None can pre≈øume he had any intere≈øt at this time in giving this opinion, as the loan clo≈øed without any ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of New-Loans being made.</p>
                        <p>After the clo≈øing of the loan; in all the conferences which took place on the ≈øubject of New-Loans, by the direction of the Governor, and which were reported to him, the defendant continues of the <hi>≈øame opinion;</hi> no <hi>exception</hi> is made to its propriety, and all matters re≈øted in this way, till the opening of the ≈øecond loan.</p>
                        <p>Before the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of April 1792, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant oppo≈øed that plan of redemption and propo≈øed another to the Governor in which New-Loans are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly provided for. He deprecated the evil con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which that Act in its original comprehen≈øive form, would probably occa≈øion, and oppo≈øed its pa≈ø≈øing by ≈øpeaking to members of both Hou≈øes on the ≈øubject, and pointing them out, (≈øee page 279 to 286.) The Act was afterwards narrowed down to include certificates only. Had he de≈øigned to ≈øpeculate on the Act, it would have been his intere≈øt to encourage its pa≈ø≈øing, or at lea≈øt not to oppo≈øe it; after it became a law he was as much entitled to its benefits as another citizen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="337" facs="unknown:027132_0345_0FD35192157FEBE8"/>On the opening of the ≈øecond loan it was di≈øcovered, that non-a≈ø≈øumable certificates had been ≈øub≈øcribed, and the owners in con≈øequence deprived of them until the clo≈øing of the loan, at which time they would be returned. To prevent this inconvenience in future, the defendant undertook to examine the certificates brought for ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription, and if they were genuine and a≈ø≈øumable, to mark them ≈øo. His conduct in this tran≈øaction was intended to oblige and a≈ø≈øi≈øt all parties, it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of great trouble, and no profit to him≈øelf; the information given, was for the u≈øe of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and the creditors who might rely upon it or not. There was no law forbidding ≈øuch proceeding. It was further in advancement of the intere≈øt and laws of the State. The mode pur≈øued was the dictate of the moment, the words "genuine and a≈ø≈øumable" being ≈øometimes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the ab≈øtract, at other times on the certificate, and in both ca≈øes ≈øigned with the initials of his name. The matter was notorious. His opinion openly given. No objections advanced again≈øt it, and the loan clo≈øed without any idea of criminality in his conduct being entertained by any body.</p>
                        <p>With the <hi>form</hi> of the ab≈øtracts the defendant had no concern, <hi>That</hi> was ≈øettled by the officers of the United States. Blank forms were printed for general conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and printed forms were generally u≈øed. As all the certificates <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> were <hi>equally</hi> ≈øo; there could be no occa≈øion to <hi>di≈øcriminate</hi> on the ab≈øtracts, their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds. If it had been nece≈ø≈øary as the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he would have reque≈øted it. It was not the <hi>duty</hi> of the defendant to do it, as he had merely undertaken, and that voluntarily to declare them genuine and a≈ø≈øumable; and it would require more of his time than his official engagements would permit. Since all certificates ≈øub≈øcribable were <hi>equally</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there could be no occa≈øion to <hi>di≈øcriminate</hi> on the ab≈øtract on the transfer to the State their ≈øeveral kinds, becau≈øe they were to be <hi>equally</hi> paid. If it were, the Regi≈øter-General ≈øhould have done it, as they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

him in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, and it is his duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter the accounts of the State. After his examination, they were pre≈øented to the Comptroller-General accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a demand on the State for payment. The <hi>ab≈øtracts them≈øelves</hi> afforded every information that a di≈øcrimination could, for the <hi>dates</hi> of intere≈øt marked on the ab≈øtracts, di≈øtingui≈øhed the ≈øeveral kinds of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates; the intere≈øt on the funded debts commencing on one fixed date, that on the depreciation on another, and that of the New-Loans on various and mixed dates, all of them however di≈øtinct from the other two. There could have been no de≈øign in the defendant to conceal any circum≈øtance relating to the New-Loans from the Regi≈øter-General as they had had a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation on the ≈øubject, in the cour≈øe of which they both concurred in opinion that the New-Loans were ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable and redeemable, and the Regi≈øter-General afterwards pa≈ø≈øed the accounts knowing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>His own ≈øub≈øcription being <hi>openly</hi> made in his <hi>own</hi> name, confutes the idea of any clande≈øtine de≈øign, and ≈øtrongly ≈øhews his thorough conviction of being right in his opinion. Had he ≈øuppo≈øed the contrary and wi≈øhed to deceive, how ea≈øy would it have been to divide the ≈øum into ≈ømall parcels, and procure other per≈øons to ≈øub≈øcribe for him in their own names. The idea that he meant to deceive until he obtained <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion</hi> of the money which ≈øeems to be advanced in this article, is too futile to have any weight and was perhaps introduced more from inadvertence than de≈øign. Detection would eventually be certain; and the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that detection would be di≈øappointment and di≈øgrace. His own ≈øub≈øcription was not hurried thro' the offices, it remained the u≈øual time with the Regi≈øter-General who might, and probably did, examine every item.</p>
                        <p>No checks of office have been broken. No official con≈øultation is required by law in <hi>any</hi> in≈øtance; nor can there legally, be any <hi>interference</hi> of the Governor

except upon a <hi>difference</hi> of opinion between the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller and Regi≈øter in which ca≈øe he is called in to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide: Here was <hi>no</hi> ≈øuch <hi>difference</hi> of opinion and of cour≈øe there could be no <hi>interference</hi> of the Governor. The Governor al≈øo knew from the defendant's former communications, and his late propo≈øal for new model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the debt, made at the time the Act was before the Legi≈ølature, that he con≈øidered the New-Loans as a debt and at a future time to be redeemed. The certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pre≈øented to the Governor on which his warrant was grounded was in the <hi>u≈øual form,</hi> there could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no <hi>concealment</hi> implied in it. The accounts which were pre≈øented and adju≈øted and in con≈øequence of which adju≈øtment this certificate was drawn, were al≈øo pre≈øented in the <hi>u≈øual form</hi> and therefore would not <hi>authori≈øe</hi> any deviation from the u≈øual cour≈øe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Any cau≈øe that would require a <hi>di≈øcrimination</hi> of the New-Loans would al≈øo require a <hi>di≈øcrimination</hi> of the funded debt and the depreciation certificates. Yet no ≈øuch di≈øcrimination has been made and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has ari≈øen in con≈øequence.</p>
                        <p>If any interference in the ≈øecond loan by the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was wrong from principle it was equally wrong in the fir≈øt loan, for the two loans were preci≈øely upon the ≈øame footing. Yet no fault has been found with him for it; and he has only been criminal according to the articles for acting between the 10th of April, and 1≈øt of Augu≈øt 1792, the <hi>principle</hi> is therefore admitted to be right and the <hi>execution</hi> only wrong.</p>
                        <p>But if it be (as we hope we have proved) that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable, that all the proceedings on his part have been regular and legal; he has acted in every in≈øtance right and is a ≈øubject of commendation rather than blame.</p>
                        <p>Even on the ≈øuppo≈øition of his having formed a <hi>wrong opinion;</hi> that opinion has been proved to be formed, when there was no <hi>intere≈øt</hi> to induce him to form it. To be advanced upon every <hi>public occa≈øion</hi> that required it. To be per≈øi≈øted in and mentioned at a time when
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:027132_0348_0FD3510389F04BD8"/>
a <hi>≈øelfi≈øh</hi> intere≈øt would induce a concealment; and we cannot look for a <hi>change,</hi> when it had received <hi>≈øanction,</hi> from <hi>time,</hi> from meeting with <hi>no</hi> oppo≈øition of ≈øentiment, from the <hi>concurrence</hi> of others in the ≈øame, and when <hi>nothing</hi> additional aro≈øe to occa≈øion an alteration. Even then upon the ≈øuppo≈øition the opinion on examination ≈øhall be found erroneous; it was innocently formed and cannot ≈øubject its author to the pains and penalties of an impeachment.</p>
                        <p>The following po≈øitions then have it is hoped been fully e≈øtabli≈øhed. That the New-Loan certificates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a <hi>State debt</hi> notwith≈øtanding the Act of <hi>March</hi> 1789, which did not contemplate their de≈øtruction, and which could not effect it had it been its de≈øign. That they were <hi>≈øub≈øcribable</hi> to the loans of the United States and <hi>known</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be ≈øo by the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it≈øelf. Than they were <hi>redeemable</hi> by the Act of April 1792, and <hi>de≈øigned</hi> to be ≈øo by the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that pa≈ø≈øed the Act. That no <hi>checks of office</hi> have been broken, of cour≈øe the defendant has <hi>broken none.</hi> That his conduct throughout has been open, candid and ≈øincere, and <hi>≈øtrictly</hi> conformable to law in every particular. That his <hi>opinion</hi> on the ≈øubject is <hi>right</hi> and ≈øo <hi>innocent</hi> in its formation that had it been <hi>wrong</hi> he could not be amenable to puni≈øhment in this pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

                        <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> Comptroller-General of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> is accu≈øed of having violated the confidence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the tru≈øt repo≈øed in him.

                     <p>But when by the aid of te≈øtimony we probe the heart, when motives unlawful from the ≈øtation and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of the agent are already proved to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to action‚Äîthen the act is clo≈øed in the li≈øt of offences, and the voice of ≈øociety calls for its judicial animadver≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Of offences there are two general cla≈ø≈øes, one is found in the breach of any po≈øitive law, municipal in≈øtitutions, or ≈øtatutes.</p>

                     <p>The penalty of the fir≈øt may be incurred without any criminal intentions, but the other depends upon the will, ignorance may at times occa≈øion a lap≈øe into the fir≈øt, the other is known to all men at all times, in all places.</p>
                     <p>The defendant's coun≈øel have anticipated another very obvious divi≈øion of the que≈øtion; that is, that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller acted under a proper or mi≈øtaken con≈øtruction of the law.

                        <p>Was read by Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> in a ≈øhort and abridged man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, retaining only the principal <hi>data,</hi> ≈øuch as facts, and dates; omitting the u≈øele≈øs appendages of amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>The general charges are thus opened with the ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fact re≈øulting from the plain and obvious text of the law and finally reducible to this ≈øingle point: Whether there exi≈øted a Legi≈ølative power in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                        <p>If the Legi≈ølative power re≈øided in the General A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, and, if the Act of 27th March 1789 was pa≈ø≈øed by that General A≈ø≈øembly we have then only to enquire whether it did not aboli≈øh the former engagements of the State and reduce the certificates to mere receipts for other certificates.</p>
                        <p>Without any efforts of ingenuity, or having recour≈øe to me≈ø≈øages, votes, re≈øolutions and other proceedings of of the Legi≈ølature from their minutes, we are led to acknowledge the affirmative from the exi≈øtence of the Act of March 27, 1789, and to a≈øcertain with accuracy the operation of it, we are led to con≈øider the nature of New-Loans previous to the pa≈ø≈øing of the law.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1, 1786, depended upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances of the public at the time, the ≈øtate po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the impo≈øt, and appropriated it to pay the intere≈øt of the reputed quota of the State debt incurred during the late war.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1785 the Legi≈ølature affected by the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes and yielding to the clamours of many of their own citizens, creditors of the United States, finding it≈øelf po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a great and growing fund ari≈øing from the impo≈øts‚Äîby its Act of 16th March 1785, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ≈øuch a proportion of that fund with the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the taxes as ≈øhould amount to ¬£. 123,932, the e≈øtimated quota of this State of the annual intere≈øt of the federal debt.</p>

                        <p>Having thus ob≈øerved, that, this Act, the parent of the New-Loan Act, could not in its out≈øet be con≈øidered as otherwi≈øe than temporary, for the chief part of the impo≈øt being the principal fund, remained only the <hi>conditional property</hi> of the State; <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> having by her Act of 23d September, 1783, acceded to the requi≈øition of Congre≈øs in regard to the 5 per cent. and the annual tax as ≈øoon as thirteen States ≈øhould accede thereto.</p>
                        <p>To this reference appears in the ≈øecond and third ≈øections of the Act of 16th March 1785.</p>
                        <p>In the 4th ≈øection, one or more have not complied.</p>
                        <p>In the 5th ≈øection, con≈øiderable time <hi>may</hi> elap≈øe.</p>
                        <p>In the 6th ≈øection, citizens labour under hard≈øhips.</p>

                        <p>By this it is apparent that the provi≈øion made by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was temporary, whereas the United States did re≈øolve for 25 years. The declarations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of our Legi≈ølature contained in the la≈øt recited ≈øections are expre≈øsly affected by the 18th ≈øection, in which the provi≈øional limitation of the Act is contained, and this expre≈øs de≈øignation of the original fund confutes one of the arguments of the coun≈øel who opened the defence, (Mr. <hi>Tilghman.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I need not enter into me≈ø≈øages or re≈øolutions to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ≈øignification of this provi≈øion; it was intended and declared to be temporary and conditional, and as ≈øuch the Legi≈ølature has always acted upon it.</p>
                        <p>We are told it is of no u≈øe to the creditors out of what fund this debt is to be paid, whereas the fund is held out and the party accepts it on the faith of that fund, and that only.</p>

                           <pb n="346" facs="unknown:027132_0354_0FD35106BA868B40"/>One of the Managers, (Mr. <hi>Morgan)</hi> has ≈øtated that Congre≈øs was di≈ø≈øatisfied, (≈øee page 211) this leads to con≈øider the Act of March 1, 1786.</p>
                        <p>The articles of Confederation gave no power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the nece≈ø≈øary funds for the payment of the public debts. Hope and view on one ≈øide, and the actual ≈øtate of things on the other. For the≈øe rea≈øons the Act of March 1, 1786 pa≈ø≈øed:‚Äî</p>
                        <p>Fir≈øt, The Act is expre≈øsly occa≈øioned by the re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congre≈øs of the 24th of September 1785, if the re≈øolution had not pa≈ø≈øed the Act would not have been made. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read the preamble to the Act 1≈øt March, 1786.)</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The aggregate conditionally a≈ø≈øigned by the Act of 16th March 1785 is the only fund appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Act of March 1, 1786.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is no repeal of the conditional clau≈øe in Act of the 16th March 1785 by the Act of March 1, 1786; the ≈øpirit is the ≈øame, only differing in mode, and form from the Act March 16th 1785.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is no a≈ø≈øumption of the principal, for the receivability of the certificates in the Land-office was common to almo≈øt all kinds of Continental certificates.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of the country increa≈øing, the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of a common head became more apparent, the Federal Con≈øtitution under which we now ≈øo happily live, was formed and recommended the 17th September, 1787. It was adopted by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> the 13th of December following, and by nine States on the 21≈øt of June, 1788. The Act of 27th March, 1789 adheres to the original contract, it does not deviate from it. The Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> on the 27th of March, 1789, found the Con≈øtitution thus adopted and ready to be put in execution, it con≈øequently found the fund liable to be withdrawn, it found the United States able to do ju≈øtice to her own creditors. The people their con≈øtituents who ≈øurely included the creditors had a≈ø≈øented to the ≈øubtraction of the fund from their fir≈øt application. In adherence therefore to the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:027132_0355_0FD351B84AABA8B0"/>
they confirmed the payment of intere≈øt during the intermediate interval from the fir≈øt ≈øteps taken by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> to the ce≈ø≈øation of the fund: They termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the payment from that time afterwards.</p>
                        <p>In the great ≈øcale upon which this ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, the difference of a few months is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: The fund cea≈øed the 1≈øt Augu≈øt, 1789, four months after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act, when the General Government took place.</p>
                        <p>If the Act of March, 1789 was inactive and wanted efficacy until that time, it then received it, the original contract was terminated. After that, none who agreed to the federal Con≈øtitution can oppo≈øe this con≈øtruction. This ≈øubject was ably handled by the young gentleman (Mr. <hi>Gib≈øon)</hi> who ≈øpoke la≈øt, who≈øe talents exhibited on this occa≈øion are an honour to him≈øelf, and promi≈øe to be an ornament to his country.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1789 repealed part of the law of March 1786, the law of 1786 repealed that of 1785.</p>
                        <p>After the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 1789 nothing of the Act of 1786 remained except what related to the payment of intere≈øt: For by that Act three things were to be done, 1. Receiving certificates on loan; 2. Delivering out New-Loans in exchange for others. 3. The payment of intere≈øt; the loan clo≈øed with the Act of March 1789, after that time no certificates could be i≈ø≈øued, certificates i≈ø≈øued by the Comptroller-General after that period are unwarranted by law. I≈ø≈øuing was unnece≈ø≈øary, the Act of March 1789 is explained and arguments again≈øt our po≈øition are an≈øwered by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1786 was only a loan, it is ≈øo declared in every part of the bill. The obligation ari≈øing from a loan is ended with the re≈øtitution of the thing loaned. <hi>A.</hi> lends <hi>B.</hi> certificates to be paid the 1≈øt of May, <hi>B.</hi> returns the certificates, the loan is ended. Therefore the State is di≈øcharged on the return of the Continental certificates, (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then adverted to the certificates and the length of time, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:027132_0356_0FD35108F4BD1170"/>
by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> as a loan to be returned by the fir≈øt March 1796, or ≈øooner if convenient, and then the whole contract to be at an end, the four year's intere≈øt being paid.)</p>
                        <p>Sir, It cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed the Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> intended to go farther in 1786 than they meant to go in 1785.</p>
                        <p>In the ≈øummer of 1786 the Convention met at <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> on the 30th December ≈øame year delegates were appointed to the General Convention; at this time a federal Union was expected; the an≈øwer returned by the A≈ø≈øembly, 27th December 1786, to Congre≈øs is not ≈øurpri≈øing, (≈øee page 319, 320).</p>
                        <p>We do then aver, that the Act of March 1786 was only a loan, little comment need be made on the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clau≈øes of the law, as the only engagement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was not to di≈øcharge the principal, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the intere≈øt on account of the United States: The Act of March 1789 in unequivocal terms puts an end to that part of the contract, and therefore the New-Loans were not ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan opened by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs. He certified them to be ≈øub≈øcribable, we aver the contrary. The public debt of the United States in June 1790 was divided into three cla≈ø≈øes, 1. Foreign, 2. Dome≈øtic, and 3. State debt.</p>
                        <p>The foreign debt was ≈øomething more than ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: The dome≈øtic debt was about forty or fifty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. Of the State debts an e≈øtimate cannot ea≈øily be made. To the que≈øtion what debts were intended to be a≈ø≈øumed by Congre≈øs, circum≈øtanced as the Union then was, it was propo≈øed to a≈ø≈øume the State debts; and to the que≈øtion, <hi>What were the State debts?</hi> the an≈øwer is obvious, debts at that <hi>time</hi> due by the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the 13th ≈øection of the Act of Congre≈øs 4th Augu≈øt 1790, entitled "An Act making provi≈øion for the debt of the United States," the ≈øum a≈ø≈øumed being 21,500,000 dollars. The two general heads of SERVICES and SUPPLIES de≈øcribe the con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no other certificates admi≈ø≈øible; and the expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:027132_0357_0FD3510B4316AA28"/>
in the Act, "debts by them re≈øpectively owing," therefore a debt of that kind would embarra≈øs indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual States if the fund was withdrawn; <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had then a peculiar and proper debt, and unle≈øs the vacant land and the Continental certificates had afforded a fund, ≈øhe would be con≈øiderably embarra≈ø≈øed, the magnitude of her debt is not ea≈øily a≈øcertained now, if under≈øtood at fir≈øt; the holders had no other to look to, ≈øetting a≈øide the bills of credit: the amount of funded and unfunded depreciation certificates was about four or five hundred thou≈øand pounds of our money, the≈øe were admitted into the general cla≈øs as being i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies in pro≈øecuting the war and for the expences incurred during the general conflict.</p>
                        <p>The New-Loans were not within this de≈øcription, they were only available to withdraw the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and four year's intere≈øt; this is the fact, ≈øo far as we can gather the evidences of the intentions of the Legi≈ølature, and as far as we can collect a knowledge of our finances from the laws of our country.</p>
                        <p>The commonwealth was under no obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>Certificates, therefore originally loaned were divided into two cla≈ø≈øes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Tho≈øe which were the property of the State from the New-Loans having been laid out in the purcha≈øe of land.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Tho≈øe which were to be pre≈øented to the holders pre≈øenting the New-Loan certificate for re-exchange.</p>
                        <p>By the Act of 7th April 1791, no officer of your commonwealth by the Acts of your Legi≈ølature could ≈øub≈øcribe State debts. Her Continental certificates were an incumbrance to her until the New-Loan certificates were brought forward on the dome≈øtic loan.</p>
                        <p>Two days afterwards, the 9th April 1791, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part Act was pa≈ø≈øed by the Legi≈ølature; if the State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> con≈øidered New-Loans as a debt, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable ≈øhe would have included them in that law. The Act of 30th March 1791 by which the Trea≈øurer
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:027132_0358_0FD3515B5AC5AEF8"/>
is directed to ≈øub≈øcribe, refers to and depends upon the provi≈øion of the Act 1≈øt April 1790. By the Act of April 1, 1790 it had been directed that they ≈øhould be depo≈øited with the State-Trea≈øurer: could he part from them without the order of the Legi≈ølature? It was not till the 30th March 1791 that an application was made of them. Then they were ≈øub≈øcribed, not to the State, but to the dome≈øtic loan.</p>
                        <p>By this expo≈øition it is manife≈øt that the law of the 27th March 1789 repealed every former provi≈øion, and that the New-Loan certificates were only a demand to get back the Continental certificates and for equalizing the intere≈øt for four years.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øhall not con≈øider the Con≈øtitution of the United States, ≈øo far as relates to the Acts of a State with its own citizens; no contract was impaired, no <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> law had been pa≈ø≈øed; it is not nece≈ø≈øary on our part to introduce any con≈øideration about it.</p>
                        <p>Yet in a charge of an highly criminal nature ≈øome extenuation is ≈øought in the endeavour to e≈øtabli≈øh that this was not a ≈øingle con≈øtruction of the law; but that others, who≈øe judgments were not perverted by any corrupt motives, were of the ≈øame opinion; that the ≈øame opinion was entertained by the principal officers of the United States' Trea≈øury. If our con≈øtruction is right, contrary opinions are erroneous; but had he, with all the light that ought to have been communicated to him, held the ≈øame opinion, what ≈øhelter can the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of one officer find in the error of another. It is not uncommon to ju≈øtify the culpable tran≈øactions of ≈øome by the erroneous judgments of other individuals; if they do not mean this as an extenuation, it is intended as a ju≈øtification, if not de≈øigned as one, or the other, it ought not to be brought forward at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then a≈øked, whether the opinion of the Secretary of the United States, a mo≈øt re≈øpectable officer, ≈øhould be a ju≈øtification and a proof of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the defendant, whereas the Secretary renounced his former opinion on being better informed, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:027132_0359_0FD351B9C1D22BD8"/>
ought to have been furni≈øhed by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General. This opinion of the Secretary ≈øhould not be depended upon, ina≈ømuch as he renounced the ≈øame on better information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read, commented, and made remarks on the circular letter of Mr. <hi>A. Hamilton</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the re≈øpective States, (≈øee page 275-6). Then on letter <hi>Dallas</hi> to <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> (page 276)‚Äîthen on letter (page 102-3)‚Äîthen letter <hi>Dallas</hi> to <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> (page 220)‚Äîthen letter Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to Governor (page 220-1-2)‚Äîthen on letter Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> (page 277)‚Äîthen on letter Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> (page 277)‚Äîthen on letter Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (page 278).</p>
                        <p>So far as the≈øe communications extend, it is apparent from the evidence or te≈øtimony of the Secretary (≈øee his te≈øtimony page 287-8-9) that no information of the repealing law of the 27th March 1789 was ever brought before him in a <hi>"prominent point of view."</hi> When that was known, an arrangement immediately took place and the re≈øult is known;‚ÄîMr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the letter from Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> (page 76-7-8-9).</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the Comptroller-General was the only officer of the commonwealth, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury on this ≈øubject;‚ÄîMr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the following letter:‚Äî</p>

                        <p>Here again the pro≈øecution commences with an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fact for which we only pray the candid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øtigation of the law: It is averred that New-Loans were not ≈øpecified and could not be contemplated as objects of redemption; that they were not ≈øpecified requires only a peru≈øal of the Act.</p>
                        <p>(The ≈øecond ≈øection of the Act of 10th April 1792 was then read.)</p>
                        <p>That the New-Loan certificates could not be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by any fair unprejudiced and unbia≈ø≈øed mind is not difficult to be e≈øtabli≈øhed; that they are not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ≈øecond ≈øection is apparent; as they were not included in the ≈øecond ≈øection, the ≈øixth ≈øection ought not to be pre≈ø≈øed into their ≈øervice as an auxiliary.</p>
                        <p>The loans on the part of the United States were directed to be opened on the fir≈øt of October 1790, and to continue open until the 30th September 1791.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was then po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a large portion of United States' debt, which the Trea≈øurer was directed to ≈øub≈øcribe by the 30th March 1791: It was believed that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> would be a creditor of the Union.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> glanced at the te≈øtimony of Mr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald≈øon,</hi> which ≈øee la≈øt paragraph, page 292,) this has been ≈øtated by Mr. <hi>Gib≈øon,</hi> (≈øee page 334.)</p>
                        <p>It was doubted whether the balance due to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth would be punctually paid, as the ≈øub≈øcription of every dollar of her own debt was an a≈ø≈øumption of the payment of it by the United States, it was con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Union; but as the manner of funding the State debt would not have yielded to the State creditor a benefit commen≈øurate with that en≈øuing to the State, as ≈øhe was relieved from the payment of 6 per cents. by a mea≈øure which yielded to them only 4 per cent.; an Act was pa≈ø≈øed the 9th of April 1791 inviting her own creditors to accede to the United States' loan by engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compen≈øate them for their lo≈øs. This Act had its effect, ≈øub≈øcriptions took place to the amount of ¬£. 252,697: And purpart certificates were i≈ø≈øued to the amount of ¬£. 136,543.</p>
                        <p>In December 1791 the Legi≈ølature beheld with ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the wealth and pro≈øperity of the State, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the author of the plan of finance, ≈øhe pa≈ø≈øed the Act of the 10th of April 1792‚Äîthe State being then only encumbered with the intere≈øt on funded and unfunded depreciation debt, funded debt, dollar money and purparts.</p>
                        <p>Far from thinking a public debt, attended with ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient advantages, either nece≈ø≈øary to procure her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Union, or to attach her own citizens to her intere≈øts.</p>
                        <p>To counterbalance the≈øe inconveniences, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make u≈øe of the means to relieve her incumbrances at once, they re≈øolved to ≈øell ≈øo much of her 3 per cent. ≈øtock at 12 ≈øhillings in the pound, or ¬£.60 per cent. as would di≈øcharge all her debts: It was propo≈øed by the Legi≈ølature fairly to purcha≈øe the ≈øub≈øcriptions of tho≈øe of her own State creditors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ≈øecond article who would ≈øub≈øcribe; the law it≈øelf ju≈øtifies this con≈øtruction, and manife≈øtly nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the con≈øtruction attempted to be given to the ≈øixth ≈øection. In the law, as it now ≈øtands without any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the ≈øixth ≈øection is a provi≈øo to the ≈øecond ≈øection, this we have in the te≈øtimony of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> (≈øee page 295-6-7-8.) The fifth ≈øection directs the payment by the State-Trea≈øurer on or before the fir≈øt of July ≈øame year; the 6th ≈øection goes on to ≈øtate that they ≈øhall be entitled to the nominal value from the Trea≈øurer
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:027132_0363_0FD351BB934BAE98"/>
upon condition that they ≈øhall ≈øub≈øcribe to the loan, and transfer to the u≈øe of the State-Trea≈øurer.</p>
                        <p>Now, no other law exi≈øts authori≈øing the State-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurer to pay the nominal value, and no other mode of effectuating the payment but by warrants drawn by the Governor, payable out of this fund: The Governor derives his authority from the fifth ≈øection in reference to the ≈øecond; but no additional clau≈øe, no authority is given to draw in execution of the ≈øixth.</p>
                        <p>It follows therefore that the intention was, that, if the loan re-opened, the ≈øecond ≈øection was only to be executed as the parties ≈øhould comply with the ≈øixth ≈øection.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øeventh ≈øection more clearly exhibits the views of the Legi≈ølature; it requires the holders of every cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate intended to be redeemed to apply before the fir≈øt of July, and after that time all intere≈øt ≈øhall cea≈øe, but if no ≈øale, nor notification, intere≈øt ≈øhall continue: Now it is notorious that New-Loans did not bear an intere≈øt of 6 per cent.; it is therefore con≈øequently obvious they were not included in this provi≈øion: Yet this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly extended to all the certificates intended to be redeemed; it follows New-Loans were not intended to be redeemed. If a member of the Legi≈ølature was to be a≈øked by one of his con≈øtituents, "What did you mean by this Act?" the an≈øwer is obvious, "Read the ≈øeventh ≈øection."</p>
                        <p>They contend that the ≈øixth is a ≈øeparate and ab≈øolute provi≈øion; if ≈øo, nothing is more true, than what proves too much, proves nothing at all.</p>
                        <p>Read it in this point of view. (The ≈øixth ≈øection then read.) What is its effect? An engagement that they will pay to every holder of State certificates from New-<hi>Hamp≈øhire</hi> to <hi>Georgia</hi> the nominal value of his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates!</p>
                        <p>No peculiar mention of the <hi>State creditors</hi> of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania!</hi>

                        <p>A con≈øtruction liable and ≈øubject to ≈øuch ob≈øervations ought to be rejected, and mu≈øt be laid a≈øide.</p>

                        <p>Here it is difficult to reconcile the conduct and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Comptroller-General with Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> communication, (≈øee his te≈øtimony, page 295, &amp;c.) as Comptroller-General it forms no matter of exculpation that he was able to catch the State in an error, altho' a third per≈øon might take advantage, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> as Comptroller-General ought not to catch her in this error in which ≈øhe did not intend to fall.</p>

                              <p>"IT is evident that the Legi≈ølature intended to make a general ≈øettlement with the creditors of the State upon the principles expre≈ø≈øed in the Act of the 10th in≈øtant, and con≈øequently a partial ≈øale of ≈øtock, or a partial commutation of State debt for ≈øtock, will not ju≈øtify my i≈ø≈øuing a notification, which, by the terms of the law, mu≈øt be addre≈ø≈øed indi≈øcriminately to all the holders of the ≈øpecified certificates and bills of credit, requiring them to comply with the conditions of the redemption. But if the offers to purcha≈øe ≈øtock and to commute the debt at the rate pre≈øcribed, ≈øhall, together, be commen≈øurate to the aggregate amount of the certificates and bills of credit, which are to be redeemed, I conceive that, without violating the ≈øpirit of the Act of A≈ø≈øembly, the object of the arrangement

                        <p>Accordingly the Comptroller and Regi≈øter-General joined in a report already read, dated 30th April 1792, (≈øee page 225-6.) This letter enclo≈øes the names of the purcha≈øers for the ≈øtock amounting to the ≈øum of 986,000 dollars.

                        <p>But it is ≈øaid that no verbal communication was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, except when differences of opinion between the Comptroller and Regi≈øter-General had occurred, and when they differed in opinion; How? When only one officer knew the tran≈øaction.</p>

formerly rendered, and now ≈øuppo≈øed to be lo≈øt, nor no unfunded depreciation, the ≈øecond e≈øtimate is a proof of this, which is declared by the Regi≈øter-General and Secretary of the Commonwealth to be ≈øub≈øtantially the ≈øame with that which was lo≈øt.</p>

                              <p>"IN con≈øequence of the doubt, which you have ≈øugge≈øted, I am directed by the Governor to inform you, that when he a≈ø≈øented to the idea of the State debts being received on the ≈øales of ≈øtock, it was upon this principle, that it ≈øhould be con≈øidered and e≈øtimated as ca≈øh, at its nominal value; beyond which nominal value, and the rates in particular ca≈øes pre≈øcribed by the Act of A≈ø≈øembly, he is not authori≈øed, upon the redemption, nor, con≈øequently, through the medium of a commutation to liquidate the demands upon the public.</p>
                              <p>"A fund commen≈øurate to the whole amount of the debt to be redeemed, mu≈øt be e≈øtabli≈øhed, before the Governor can i≈ø≈øue his notification; and it is certainly immaterial, whether that fund is ≈øatisfied by ≈øpecie pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by depo≈øits as ca≈øh, in the public ≈øecurities, for which the ≈øpecie is to be rai≈øed: but the Governor conceives, that it would be contrary to the ≈øpirit of the law, to an impartial di≈øtribution of ju≈øtice, and to the public intere≈øt, were the propo≈øals to be accepted, ≈øo that the payments by way of commutation ≈øhould be con≈øidered as ca≈øh, in order to entitle the parties to a transfer of the three per cent. ≈øtock, and al≈øo as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øit in order, to entitle them to intere≈øt until the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the time, which the notice ≈øhall limit for the general redemption.</p>
                              <p>"By an arrangement of this nature, a di≈øcrimination is not only introduced between the purcha≈øers of the ≈øtock for ca≈øh, and tho≈øe who purcha≈øe with State debt, to the great benefit of the Latter cla≈øs; but it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe

operate with ≈øimilar inequality in relation to all tho≈øe State creditors, who cannot have the opportunity of ≈øettling their claims by way of commutation; the State, too, will not only lo≈øe the current intere≈øt on the 3 per cent. ≈øtock; but be precluded from the advantage of an immediate ≈øettlement with ≈øuch of her creditors as ≈øhall be di≈øpo≈øed to anticipate the period, for which the notification mu≈øt i≈ø≈øue.</p>
                              <p>Such have uniformly been the Governor's ≈øentiments; but, if by any means they have been mi≈øunder≈øtood, he would rather relinqui≈øh all advantage from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent propo≈øals than ≈øuffer any cau≈øe of complaint to exi≈øt: He reque≈øts, therefore, that you will be plea≈øed to confer with the parties, on the ≈øubject; and to inform them, that they may now make their election, either to abide by their propo≈øals upon the terms which I have ≈øtated, or to withdraw them.

                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then quoted the Act of A≈ø≈øembly of the 4th April 1792, page 218, which directs the manner of ≈øettling the public accounts;) by this it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt that it was the duty of the Comptroller-General to have informed the Regi≈øter-General, it was their joint duty to draw, and certify the fund, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor might draw his warrant on the State-Trea≈øurer with propriety.

                        <head>THE FOURTH ARTICLE.</head>
                        <p>This article charges the Comptroller-General with a breach of the Con≈øtitution, here no ≈øhelter can be found in the ambiguity or contradiction of the law, it is a direct violation of a ≈øingle clau≈øe in a plain and explicit in≈øtrument; accordingly the endeavour is not to oppo≈øe but to e≈øcape the charge.</p>
                        <p>A≈øtoni≈øhing to hear, that a warrant expre≈øsly to be paid out of a fund created by the Act of the 10th April 1792, and actually ≈øo paid by the Trea≈øurer, and ≈øo reported to the Legi≈ølature by the Governor‚Äîis to be protected from reprehen≈øion by quartering it on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fund previou≈øly appropriated by law to other objects, and altho' his warrants are expre≈øsly drawn and paid <hi>out of the fund</hi> provided by the Act of 10th April 1792, they were drawn out of the fund e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Act of the 7th April 1791‚Äîand not out of the fund provided by the Act of 10th April 1792.</p>
                        <p>By the Act of the 26th March 1789, ¬£.10,000 were ≈øet apart for claims and improvements; that this has always been con≈øidered a peculiar fund, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to tho≈øe ca≈øes which did not belong to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cla≈øs, and as ≈øuch I ≈øhall ≈øhew the ≈øentiments of the Comptroller-General upon it, in an official ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under his own hand.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read a part of the Comptroller's report, page 386, Minutes December 11, 1790, as follows, to wit:)</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="362" facs="unknown:027132_0370_0FD35176F0496F58"/>"There is another ≈øpecies of expence called claims, which cannot properly be arranged under the debts of the State, and which is certain in its amount, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the grants of the Legi≈ølature at the time, and not on accounts adju≈øted upon fixed principles. The ≈øum of ¬£. 5,000 annually is appropriated by Act of March 26th and 28th September 1789, and is con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a fund for this purpo≈øe. It may be worthy the con≈øideration of the Legi≈ølature, whether ≈øuch a fund is not likely to beget many improper applications, and whether, after the State hath, by an Act of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, barred even un≈øettled claims which would have been legal, ≈øuch an invitation ≈øhould continue to be held out."</p>
                        <p>The≈øe claims (the defendant ob≈øerved) were likely to beget "improper applications," nothing in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion relative to the Act of April 1791: No New-Loans could be redeemed under that law, nor any claim on that fund.</p>
                        <p>But an unexpected effort is made to defend, which requires further con≈øideration, the charge is, that he cau≈øed money to be drawn from the Trea≈øury without a previous appropriation by law.</p>
                        <p>Not a ≈øingle in≈øtance can be produced which will ≈øhew, that where a warrant has been drawn on a fund, to which it was not applicable, the ≈øame ≈øhould be paid out of the twelfth appropriation of the 7th April 1791. (Some warrants were then produced, and read by Mr. <hi>Rawle,</hi> to e≈øtabli≈øh his po≈øition, contained in the la≈øt ≈øentence.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈øtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Bingham to</hi> Mr. <hi>Rawle.</hi> Do you ≈øay, that the fund included in the Act of the 26th March 1789 is embraced in the Act of April 1791?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> Yes‚Äîas far as the 12th appropriation extends.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Que≈ø. by the ≈øame.</hi> Is the Act of March 1789 a part of the Act of April 1791?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> No. By the Act of the 7th April 1791 all the revenues of the State were collected into one ma≈øs, and formed an aggregate fund towards paying the debts
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:027132_0371_0FD3511883E471D8"/>
and obligations of the commonwealth, and finally to pay all warrants drawn for claims and improvements.</p>
                        <p>It was with great propriety the warrant in favour of Mr. <hi>Rittenhou≈øe</hi> of the 27th September 1791 was paid out of the fund for claims and improvements.</p>
                        <p>That warrants were drawn without a ≈øpecification of the funds, in the ca≈øe of Dr. <hi>Hutchin≈øon</hi> and others after verdicts in the Supreme Court: Was this agreeable to law? In the ≈øecond ≈øection of the Act of the 4th April 1792 the duty of the Comptroller and Regi≈øter are defined, where it is enacted that the balance and fund ≈øhould be certified by them to the Governor, and a warrant ≈øhould i≈ø≈øue accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Can his conduct on this occa≈øion be ju≈øtified? Can this tran≈øaction be pre≈ø≈øed, as a defence, into the ≈øervice of the Comptroller-General?</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> at this time, and de≈øired him to produce the warrants. Whereupon the warrant No. 14 for unfunded depreciation debt, was read, and ≈øhewn that it was not certified to be payable <hi>out of the fund</hi> of the 10th April 1792, but that it was payable <hi>per Act</hi> of the 10th April 1792, and the following letter.)</p>

                        <p>Had the conduct of the Comptroller-General on the≈øe occa≈øions been otherwi≈øe, no impeachment would ever have lain again≈øt him.</p>
                        <p>I will reduce the remaining three articles into two as conci≈øe as po≈ø≈øible, the fifth and ≈øixth I will con≈øider together as the ≈øame evidence applies to both.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read the fifth and ≈øixth articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.)</p>
                        <p>The fifth ≈øtates in general terms the final objects of the labours to which the preceding articles refer.</p>
                        <p>That the plan of finance (which ≈øee page 280) was not laid for others, when only ¬£.20,000 was e≈øtimated to be out, that he purcha≈øed to ≈øo great an amount, it mu≈øt be acknowledged that he was indu≈øtrious. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> explained the bu≈øine≈øs re≈øpecting the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Dr. <hi>Hutchin≈øon</hi> and others, as not connected with this bu≈øine≈øs.) With regard to the ≈øixth article of impeachment that he ≈øub≈øcribed for his own u≈øe the certificates received to be exchanged.</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øurprizing that ≈øuch a quantum of evidence hath been procured. His coun≈øel do not deny the charge, but the inference, and contend to ju≈øtify the tran≈øaction.</p>
                        <p>That the Comptroller-General led the way is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; 1. Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> a principal broker is at a lo≈øs to divine what u≈øe the defendant intended them for. 2. Mr. <hi>Boggs</hi> certifies New-Loans ro≈øe in price, and unable to know what for. But Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Evans, Hale</hi> and <hi>Stroud</hi> have been produced to prove that the New-Loan certificates have been taken back, after they were lodged for re-exchange. The charge is, that the Comptroller-General made propo≈øals to purcha≈øe, and did actually purcha≈øe from per≈øons bringing certificates to his office to be re-exchanged. Is this an an≈øwer to the charge? The que≈øtion is not whether on an alteration of their
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:027132_0373_0FD351C0C3E95BA8"/>
minds, they took back their certificates after having lodged them with him.</p>
                        <p>But the charge is, that a ≈øteward of the public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue is accu≈øed of having prevented an exchange which the party was de≈øirous to make, and which it was his duty to accelerate, by which the State ≈øuffered a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable lo≈øs: And the defence is that in other in≈øtances wholly indifferent to the public, <hi>he,</hi> and not another officer a≈ø≈øented to the parties receiving back, at their own reque≈øt their own certificates for private purpo≈øes.</p>
                        <p>The la≈øt article is certainly of too ≈øerious and too plain a nature to be viewed with indifference. We have Mr. <hi>M'Connell's</hi> te≈øtimony that he ≈øold that certificate to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan;</hi> Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> te≈øtimony proves that he never ≈øold any certificates nor had any private dealings with the Comptroller-General in his life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the advance of ≈øome indents. That he delivered all the certificates which he had to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon;</hi> that he is of imperfect memory that this certificate was of the number; that on the 15th September 1790 he drew intere≈øt on this certificate. As Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never commuted with him, nor had any other dealings with the Comptroller, he is put to prove how he came by this ≈øu≈øpicious certificate.</p>
                        <p>The Comptroller-General brings his books of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, dates, numbers and ≈øums are not apparent on the face of them.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-≈øix of the≈øe certificates united without dates, &amp;c. make up ¬£.26,000 which is No. 183; forty-five certificates make up ¬£.27,000, No. 184.</p>
                        <p>Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi> ob≈øerves, all evidence <hi>(Couper,</hi> 65,) is to be weighed according to what one party can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and is in the power of the other to contradict.</p>
                        <p>We are not to make te≈øtimony but to find it; if any imputation is thrown on <hi>Blair M'Clenachan,</hi> we did not ≈øelect him, but his te≈øtimony ≈øhould however have this effect, that it de≈øerves a better an≈øwer than hath been yet given to it by the Comptroller-General.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="366" facs="unknown:027132_0374_0FD327F2D8139AD0"/>This impeachment hath not been precipitated, it is now almo≈øt twelve months ≈øince it commenced; the Comptroller-General has had full lei≈øure for the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of official documents nece≈ø≈øary for him: Having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of a great part of his defence, it only remains to notice two circum≈øtances adduced by his coun≈øel.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His innocence is to be inferred from his open and avowed ≈øentiments at former periods relative to the nature of New-Loans; (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then adverted to the Comptroller's letter, December 24, 1791, page 220-1-2, his letter to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> page 278, and his letter to Mr. <hi>Mifflin,</hi> page 223-4.)</p>
                        <p>The unvaried tenor of opinion is certainly evidence of its ≈øincerity‚Äîbut when we find the ≈øame man, at or near the ≈øame period of time, and under the ≈øame circum≈øtances delivering opinions diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite, we are led to enquire which of the two occa≈øions required the mo≈øt ≈øerious reflection.</p>
                        <p>But in the official document, 30th November, 1791, all the claims again≈øt the commonwealth are mentioned and ≈øtated; New-Loans are omitted, yet they are not altogether too inferior objects of notice, as ¬£. 600 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of intere≈øt on them are mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It will not be pretended that he intended to mi≈ølead the Legi≈ølature or the Governor; and it will not be pretended that the nature of the ≈øtatement precluded the mention of the principal of the New-Loans: For, 1. It is an account of "claims," and he profe≈ø≈øes to have always con≈øidered this as a claim. 2. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of other claims was noticed by him, ≈øuch as funded and unfunded depreciation debt, pen≈øions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Yet while on this ≈øtrong ground, this important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the 10th April 1792, it does not in all his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondence appear that practical views, his avowed opinion, his morti≈øing and inlaying of New-Loans into the compo≈øition of the fund for redeeming State debts, ≈øo as to make all appear of one piece was ever commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to any one; no intimation that the redemption
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:027132_0375_0FD351C2CB7DBA08"/>
of New-Loans was practicable altho' that was the time to have avowed the ≈øentiment.</p>
                        <p>This was however (as Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ≈øays) authori≈øed by the ≈øecret and avowed objects of ≈øpeculation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That ≈øome of the Acts in que≈øtion, being lawful to others were lawful to the Comptroller-General.</p>
                        <p>This is important and attacks the ba≈øis of ≈øome of the articles of impeachment. I con≈øider it as applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his purcha≈øes of <hi>Oldden,</hi> and <hi>Biddle;</hi> his avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly pur≈øuing what he profe≈ø≈øed to ≈øuppo≈øe the literal con≈øtruction of the law of April 10, 1792, in oppo≈øition to what he knew to be the meaning of the Legi≈ølature.</p>
                        <p>The intere≈øt of the commonwealth, the happine≈øs and ≈øucce≈øs of a republic depend on the de≈øtruction of this unworthy principle.</p>
                        <p>It is an axiom, nece≈ø≈øary for our pro≈øperity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt in≈øeparable from our exi≈øtence, that a public officer ≈øhould have no intere≈øt oppo≈øed to that of the public: Perverting public offices to private emolument was one of the principal cau≈øes of the downfall of one of the greate≈øt commonwealths in the world.</p>
                        <p>In this grand national view, I will not de≈øcend to the jealous ≈øuperintendance of courts of chancery over executors, guardians and tru≈øtees.</p>
                        <p>You, who are here collected, and delegated to decide this national enquiry, will never forget, that ≈øolemn obligation are derived from important tru≈øts; and that whoever ≈øtipulates faithfully to ≈øerve the public, ≈øtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to renounce every per≈øonal advantage incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the public intere≈øt.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore, for a breach of this engagement he is accu≈øed‚Äîan offence which in all times has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as requiring adequate puni≈øhment. 2. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øon,</hi> 602.</p>
                        <p>I fear no contradiction in ≈øaying, that had <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> in 1782, when about to take the oath "faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ≈øerve the commonwealth," and to execute the office of Comptroller-General, declared his con≈øtruction of it to be, that he was at liberty to pur≈øue his opinion
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:027132_0376_0FD351C4FB160D88"/>
of the letter of the law in oppo≈øition to what he knew to be the intention of the Legi≈ølature.‚ÄîThat he would claim the privilege of private men to prefer his own intere≈øt to that of the public, and that he would avail him≈øelf of his official opportunities for ≈øo doing‚Äîhe would be rejected with di≈øgu≈øt and without he≈øitation.

                     <p>THE Court being called, &amp;c. as u≈øual.</p>
                     <p>MR. HIGGINSON.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Senate of the commonwealth of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> is called upon by the Con≈øtitution to execute one of their mo≈øt important functions, that is, A TRIAL BY IMPEACHMENT.</p>
                     <p>The Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives being the mo≈øt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular branch have exerci≈øed their juri≈ødiction in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the charges again≈øt <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General: This important right devolves upon you, who≈øe part is the more difficult as you have to decide and are ≈øet as judges over this individual, your tribunal is the greate≈øt in the land; being thus con≈øtituted, you have to rea≈øon with capacity; the chain is compo≈øed of mixed bu≈øine≈øs, habits of intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and principles of confidence between the two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ≈øympathy for each other, a mere ≈øugge≈øtion of the danger is ≈øufficient to de≈øtroy the exi≈øtence of the danger.</p>
                     <p>Having premi≈øed this hint to you, his judges, permit me to ≈øay that the defendant has every thing that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable at ≈øtake, his reputation is at i≈ø≈øue by this accu≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if rumour ≈øpread through every corner of the ≈øtate, if the public opinion, envenomed by prejudice, if reports of guilt and torrents of prejudice, rou≈øed and fomented by malice, and fo≈øtered by envy, are ≈øufficient to condemn a man, the defendant is already brought to judgment.</p>
                     <p>Yet the impartiality of the tribunal will ≈øecure the
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:027132_0378_0FD3513B6E05E7F8"/>
officer from condemnation on any other ground than that of a fair trial according to the evidence.</p>
                     <p>We have heard great panegyricks be≈øtowed on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment trials in <hi>England,</hi> but hi≈øtory affords but few examples of ≈øuch trials being any other than pro≈øecutions, oppre≈ø≈øive and violent, and ending in corrupt deci≈øions.</p>
                     <p>The pre≈øent trial, I hope, will be different in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and deci≈øion.</p>
                     <p>The articles of impeachment are divi≈øible into two cla≈ø≈øes.</p>
                     <p>The 1≈øt is ≈øubdivi≈øible into four cla≈ø≈øes.</p>
                     <p>The 2d is of a different nature and ≈øcope, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently worthy of different con≈øideration.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, two points ari≈øe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Whether our con≈øtruction hath been right or wrong.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. If not conformable to law, whether it had not been our hone≈øt faith and good opinion.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt, If New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan opened under the Act of the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. If redeemable.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe depends on the Acts of Congre≈øs. (Mr. <hi>Higgin≈øon</hi> then read the Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th Augu≈øt 1790, ≈øection 13th and the provi≈øo.)</p>
                     <p>By this ≈øection and provi≈øo two things are requi≈øite.</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. That they ≈øhould be i≈ø≈øued before the fir≈øt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1790.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. That they ≈øhould be i≈ø≈øued for SERVICES or SUPPLIES.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the fir≈øt of the≈øe qualities, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they were i≈ø≈øued by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> before the 1≈øt Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1790. And it is equally evident as to the ≈øecond. The gentleman who preceded me did not go on to ≈øay, that the New-Loan holders had no other debtor to look to but the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> They were i≈ø≈øued for Continental certificates, ≈øtrange! He did not recognize this particular! Strange that a transfer of the debt ≈øhould alter the con≈øideration! The transfer was made
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:027132_0379_0FD3511FE29BBDC0"/>
for a valuable con≈øideration.‚ÄîThe law which they ≈øay abrogated them was pa≈ø≈øed before the 4th day of Augu≈øt 1790. The <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates excepted, being i≈ø≈øued in 1786 corruptly, for no valuable con≈øideration, is a ≈øtrong argument in our favour; Congre≈øs prohibited the a≈ø≈øumption of the≈øe <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates, and enacted that they ≈øhould not receive the benefit of this Act, becau≈øe they were i≈ø≈øued without any valuable con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; this exception makes the rule more ≈øtrong; and the New-Loans are much more included in that general provi≈øion, being i≈ø≈øued by government, and having the recognition of public authority, being exchanged for Continental certificates which i≈ø≈øued for a <hi>bona fide</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration.</p>
                     <p>Two objections may be rai≈øed again≈øt this argument. 1. That the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> were in their original form i≈ø≈øued without that exception, and that New-Loan certificates exchanged for Continental ones were not recognized by the general government, nor by their officers, and that they could not be ≈øpecifically included in the 13th ≈øection: But are they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly mentioned in the 18th ≈øection?</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. By concluding from the generality of the rule, that New-Loans could not be included: But as Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> a man of much ingenuity, in the ca≈øe of his conte≈øted election, quoting the words of the 4th article of the confederation, "paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from ju≈øtice, excepted," argued that the≈øe were includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the article had been penned without the≈øe words. The arguments are ≈øtronger here than if they had all ≈øtood without the exception. But Congre≈øs to place it out of all doubt and controver≈øy, enacted a clau≈øe to except the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the loan. There are no rea≈øons which could apply, but would have applied to the nece≈ø≈øity of the New-Loans being expre≈øsly excepted from the loan of the Union, if they had ≈øo de≈øigned.</p>
                     <p>At all events the exception whether ≈øound or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded will be perfectly immaterial, when we con≈øider
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:027132_0380_0FD3517C426A7050"/>
our law of the 27th March 1789, which pa≈ø≈øed after the adoption of the Federal Con≈øtitution, if it meant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from provi≈øion, why not make a literal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to them?</p>
                     <p>Before I come to con≈øider the Act which erects New-Loans into ≈øtate debts, permit me to ob≈øerve, that the Act which authori≈øes the payment of a demand is in fact an appropriation by law previous to the grant of the warrant, and is con≈øtitutionally payable out of monies not otherwi≈øe ≈øpecifically and previou≈øly appropriated.</p>
                     <p>One rea≈øon is, it would always promote the good faith and intere≈øt of the ≈øtate, and it would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
                     <p>The money was to have been drawn from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury by the warrant of the Governor; if the certificate was in the u≈øual form, if it was ≈øuch as the officers would and ought to have made, believing it to be ju≈øt and right, the officer is not to an≈øwer, if there was any thing untrue in the certificate, it mu≈øt be ≈øhewn; if any marks of delu≈øion, it mu≈øt be pointed out. The Trea≈øurer paid the draft, if there had not been an appropriated fund the Governor ought not draw‚Äîthe Trea≈øurer ought not to pay.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øum was certified by the Comptroller-General, the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øed through the office of the Regi≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral before it was handed to the Governor.</p>
                     <p>If the certificates are not redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792, the charge is right, if they are redeemable the charge is not true; if not literally true, the charge mu≈øt fall to the ground: Nay, ≈øomething more is nece≈ø≈øary to make it criminal, than to ≈øay true, or untrue.</p>
                     <p>One criminal point is <hi>an omi≈ø≈øion,</hi> but it mu≈øt be ≈øhewn; that it was the officer's duty to di≈øcriminate, and it is their bu≈øine≈øs to ≈øhew that it was his po≈øitive duty to make it known to the other officers.</p>
                     <p>But if the officer did what he thought right, he is indi≈øputably innocent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="373" facs="unknown:027132_0381_0FD35121E6BE07A0"/>Much has been ≈øaid about the liberality and ju≈øtice of the Legi≈ølature, re≈øpecting the Act of 1786, yet the mea≈øure grew out of ≈øelf-pre≈øervation, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt of government.</p>
                     <p>The State at this time had to choo≈øe the lea≈øt of two evils. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was punctual in paying her quota, other States were deficient; Congre≈øs was obliged then to i≈ø≈øue indents for intere≈øt which depreciated, per≈øons from other States might buy up the≈øe indents to the lo≈øs of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and the advantage of the delinquent States, and yet the payment thro' the State Loan-office was di≈øagreeable to Congre≈øs. The State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was therefore under the nece≈ø≈øity of pa≈ø≈øing the law of 1786 in order to ≈øhun the wor≈øt of two evils. Her quota was a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed; and ≈øhe paid it. The motives were in order to confine her own payment to her own citizens, and the money to circulate in her own territory.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was agreed on all hands in the Legi≈ølature at that time, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øhould a≈ø≈øume the debt to her own citizens, the only difference con≈øi≈øted in the mode: This is fully proven by referring to the plan of finance then brought forward in oppo≈øition to that which was adopted, both equally ≈øupport our argument.</p>
                     <p>(Mr. <hi>Higgin≈øon</hi> read the following parts of the plans of Finance, ≈øee Minutes of A≈ø≈øembly, 22d December, 1785, pages 117, 124, and 126.)</p>
                     <p n="13">"XIII. Thus the foregoing balances due to the United States may readily be di≈øcharged. But there is ≈øomething more that claims the attention of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"According to the e≈øtimation of Congre≈øs, the ≈øum of 4,834,279 16/90 dollars, will be nece≈ø≈øary to di≈øcharge the intere≈øt on the dome≈øtic debt of the United States till the end of the year 1784; and by the re≈øolutions of Congre≈øs of the 27th of September, 1785, facilities or intere≈øt certificates are directed to be i≈ø≈øued for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt due until the 1≈øt of January, 1785, con≈øequently facilities will be i≈ø≈øued nearly to the amount afore≈øaid.</p>

                        <hi>"Note,</hi> The po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors of Loan-office certificates bearing date before the 1≈øt day of March, 1778, are entitled (by re≈øolutions of Congre≈øs) to receive 6 per cent. on the ≈øum ≈øpecified in their certificates, altho' their real value (by the Continental ≈øcale of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is con≈øiderably le≈øs than the nominal ≈øum. Hence it follows that the calculation (in the 13th article) of a principal ≈øum due, which is made according to the amount of intere≈øt actually paid by the Loan-officer, is erroneous. But ≈øince the intere≈øt due on Continental certificates will (as ju≈øt mentioned) be an addition to the principal, it is probable that the exce≈øs of one will balance the deficiency of the other.</p>
                     <p>"By receiving in the propo≈øed loan (at their real value) tho≈øe certificates which bear an intere≈øt of 6 per cent. on more than their real value the State will gain the difference between the intere≈øt on ≈øuch real value, and the intere≈øt now payable by the United States, and the pre≈øent holders of the certificates will have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to complain, becau≈øe they may (at their option) either lend them to the State on the terms held out, or have recour≈øe to the United States on the terms of their re≈øolutions.</p>
                     <p>"On the future requi≈øitions of Congre≈øs, whenever they can be proportioned (either by the rule laid down in the articles of confederation, or by the rule lately recommended to the States) it will be expedient to rai≈øe an account of quotas with the United States, pa≈ø≈øing to their credit the total ≈øum payable by <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and to their debit the total ≈øum which <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> has
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:027132_0386_0FD351C9ED15AFE0"/>
paid. The balance of this account (being the exce≈øs or deficiency of payments) will be carried forward, ≈øo as eventually to be liquidated in the annual demands of Congre≈øs, and annual payments of the State. Since therefore a con≈øiderable ≈øum will (in the event) be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the United States every year (however the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance may now ≈øtand) it will be expedient to continue the pre≈øent annual tax on property, and carry the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the aggregate fund, which will receive.‚Äî"</p>
                     <p>It is true this la≈øt provi≈øion was not carried into effect, owing altogether to circum≈øtances and motives of ≈øtate policy.</p>
                     <p>It may then be ≈øaid, that it is contended the law of March 1786 was temporary. True, this idea is in the preamble of the Act of 1789, but it is not pre≈øumed that it can be con≈øtrued by the <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> explanation of the ≈øame Act, neither intended nor mentioned, nor does the Act contain a ≈øingle idea of a temporary provi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Read this Act according to the minutes already read, it will be ea≈øily ≈øeen that the New-Loans are an exi≈øting ≈øtate debt. Read it you will ≈øee a better rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction than by ≈øpeeches, re≈øolutions or reports of committees. (The 1≈øt and 2d ≈øections were then read.) Now, Sir, let the fir≈øt and ≈øecond ≈øections of this law be taken in any point of view, I contend the New-Loans are not de≈øtroyed as a debt, but at mo≈øt only a ≈øu≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of payment, and a provi≈øion for completing the payment of intere≈øt for four years.</p>
                     <p>Or, a modification as to payment: To tho≈øe who did not chu≈øe to embrace the invitation, there is an offer, in the ≈øecond ≈øection. It was only as a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion, and to tho≈øe who did not chu≈øe to embrace it, it was only a modification of payment.</p>
                     <p>Then follows the provi≈øion of the option held out to New-Loan holders; thus the Act operates either as a ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion, or a modification; in this, two points are to be con≈øidered, enough of the Act of March 1786 is left to con≈øtitute a debt.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="379" facs="unknown:027132_0387_0FD3517F47820AF8"/>2. Repealing a law is not repealing what was done under it.</p>
                     <p>Of the Act of March 1786 enough is unrepealed to make the certificates neither null nor void.</p>
                     <p>For 1. In the 8th ≈øection the intere≈øt is directed to be paid: 2. In the 11th ≈øection they are made receivable in the Land-Office.</p>
                     <p>Both are only mere forms of words, for the Legi≈ølature could not make them null and void if they intended ≈øo to do; to do that, and to exclude them from the loan they mu≈øt be rejected by the Legi≈ølature of the Union as the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> heretofore adverted to.</p>
                     <p>The que≈øtion may be reduced to this ≈øimple po≈øition, that as the gentleman ye≈øterday ≈øaid re≈øpecting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence of a legi≈ølative power in <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> a po≈øition indi≈øputable; ≈øo likewi≈øe in this in≈øtance, the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of Nature, may as well be ≈øet bounds to as to the principles of natural ju≈øtice; in either ca≈øe to become a legi≈ølative act, it might have the form of a law, but not the force of one: There are moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øibilities as well as natural ones, and the≈øe exi≈øt with Legi≈ølatures.</p>
                     <p>A Legi≈ølature therefore can no more effectually anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate any rights, or enact away its own obligations, than it can enact that a body ≈øhall decrea≈øe in gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in proportion as it de≈øcends to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have ≈øaid to enforce that rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction that if a law can receive any po≈ø≈øible con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will avoid ≈øo ≈øerious an imputation as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of public faith, and will comport with ju≈øtice, ≈øuch con≈øtruction we are bound to put upon it. What a government cannot of right do, we ≈øurely ≈øhould not pre≈øume it meant to do; unle≈øs the Act was planned for ≈øuch, unequivocal in its meaning, and un≈øu≈øceptible of any other con≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>In the third ≈øection the words <hi>many</hi> and <hi>≈øo much</hi> are relative terms, and imply that ≈øome would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exchange or to take back the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="380" facs="unknown:027132_0388_0FD3516A3B8D6C20"/>I ob≈øerve that the framers of that Act, in order en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to deprive the holders of the benefit of an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øolemnly i≈ø≈øued by the ≈øtate, would have u≈øed other words, would have gone further than barely to give the holders a permi≈ø≈øion to exchange if they ≈øaw fit; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the ca≈øe of holders who might not chu≈øe to exchange, they would have gone on, and declared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly the con≈øequences of not exchanging.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, do the operative words of the repealing clau≈øe de≈øtroy the debt of which the New-Loans are the evidence. In order to de≈øtroy them, the certificates them≈øelves ≈øhould be declared null and void; becau≈øe the payment of the intere≈øt or principal expre≈ø≈øed on the face of them cea≈øes to be ≈øecured by any law: does the debt of which they are the evidence cea≈øe to exi≈øt? Can the exi≈øtence of a debt depend on the exi≈øtence of a provi≈øion for the payment of it's intere≈øt or principal? May there not be a debt without any exi≈øting appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the payment of the principal or intere≈øt? Surely there may.</p>
                     <p>How then can it be ≈øaid that by repealing all laws ≈øpecifically ≈øecuring the payment of the principal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, the debt it≈øelf is annihilated?</p>
                     <p>No, Sir, both the Preamble and the Act clearly ≈øhow, it was only meant the exchange ≈øhould be optional, and tho≈øe who did not chu≈øe to exchange ≈øhould retain their certificates valid on their original grounds, though without any particular appropriation for the payment of the principal or intere≈øt: This is the ca≈øe under the Continental loan, and tho≈øe who did not choo≈øe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the terms of that loan and ≈øub≈øcribe to it, ≈øtill hold and were meant to hold their evidences of debt as valid as at the fir≈øt moment of their exi≈øtence.</p>
                     <p>The preamble to this Act ≈øtates that the funds which were intended for the payment of this debt were likely under the new government to be transferred to the Trea≈øury of the Union.</p>
                     <p>It was for this rea≈øon that the laws which ≈øpecifically ≈øecured the payment of intere≈øt or principal the New-Loans
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:027132_0389_0FD35127F5626990"/>
was repealed, leaving the debt it≈øelf, of which they were the evidences, ≈øound and entire. Says the ≈øtate, I do not mean to de≈øtroy my obligation, I cannot do it, but my funds are gone, and I mu≈øt ≈øu≈øpend the payment, take your chance of my future competency, eventual ≈øolvency, and ultimate payment, or I will give you another choice, you may if you had rather re-exchange my obligation for tho≈øe of the continent, then take back your Continental certificate, and give back my New-Loan.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, Sir, in≈øtead of charging the Comptroller-General with having tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed the law in violation of his duty and to the prejudice of the ≈øtate, rather let it be ≈øaid, that he magnified the law and made it honorable.</p>
                     <p>If the provi≈øion in the third ≈øection re≈øpecting the Land-Office be regarded, it will be recognized, that by the ≈øecond ≈øection an obligation is impo≈øed not upon the holder but upon the ≈øtate, pay the New-Loans on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with a like ≈øum in Continental certificates, let it be remembered that this idea of exchange is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the que≈øtion, as it does not come after the repealing clau≈øe, the obligation, I ≈øay, is altogether on the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>I a≈øk then when the obligation of this tran≈øaction is not equally obligatory on both ≈øides, and when the ≈øtate is either to pay or take up the New-Loans on the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the holders, by delivery of its own property of a particular kind, but equal value, what is the rea≈øon, or meaning of it?</p>
                     <p>Does it not imply nece≈ø≈øarily a right in the holder to demand, and an obligation on the ≈øtate to pay or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver?</p>
                     <p>Does it acknowledge the debt or not? Are not the Continental certificates ≈øtrictly the property of the ≈øtate? When they are obliged to part from them, does ≈øhe not part from a thing of value?</p>
                     <p>If the ≈øtate lies under this obligation, the New-Loans are a debt due from her, ≈øtrictly and properly ≈øpeaking, though they are redeemable only in a particular mode.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="unknown:027132_0390_0FD3512B541F2F20"/>What are the Continental certificates? They are not money to be ≈øure!</p>
                     <p>But they are a commodity, or thing of value: The exi≈øtence of the debt does not depend on the ≈øpecies of payment: Whether my ≈øatisfaction of a demand, my di≈ølodging an incumbent obligation on me, is done by the delivery of money or any other obligation, it is a debt ≈øtill.</p>
                     <p>Let me a≈øk, whether any ≈øub≈øcriber of ≈øtate debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that Congre≈øs if their funds were to fail for the di≈øcharge of intere≈øt, could compel them to take back ≈øtate certificates again. AH PUNIC FAITH!</p>
                     <p>This would have been a mere tender law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently void; and a nullity.</p>
                     <p>The continent had a≈ø≈øumed ≈øtate debts; the entries were made on the books of the Trea≈øury. In other words, will the United States perform their engagements if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States ≈øhould ≈øay, take back your ≈øtate certificates. Such a law would be unju≈øt, and not binding; any ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the debt would be di≈øhonorable to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it would rip up credit from it's ≈øource‚ÄîOh! ≈øuch an idea is prepo≈øterous. What then is the meaning? Then ≈øure, it does recognize the debt. Are not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates ≈øtrictly the property of the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>Suppo≈øe for in≈øtance, that Congre≈øs had enacted that propo≈øition into the funding ≈øy≈øtem, which was propo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury in his report on public credit, that two thirds of the debt ≈øhould be funded at an annuity of ≈øix per cent. redeemable at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and the other third be paid in lands in the We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Territory, at twenty cents per acre. Would this have been a de≈øtroying of one third of the debt? No; it could only have been in this ca≈øe a modification of the payment. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> in his te≈øtimony (page 296) declared that it was immaterial to redeem that way or by the Land-Office, the price being then nearly equal; the Land-Office was ≈øhut again≈øt the New-Loans by the Act of March 1789, but another door is thrown open, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fund is ≈øub≈øtituted for the holders of the New-Loans,
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:027132_0391_0FD3516D1141F030"/>
in point of principle the ≈øame. The ≈øtate ≈øays, we cannot go no further, the holder does not get quite ≈øo much; Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells you, whil≈øt the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was open, a fund was provided; then the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being open recognizes the debt; ≈øhut the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the lo≈øs is certain. Here is a recognition of the debt; this is a matter of di≈øgrace to <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> fir≈øt make an advantage of a bargain, then depreciate, and la≈øtly buy in at a di≈øcount.</p>
                     <p>Who is our accu≈øer? The State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> I demand that the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> will come with clean hands her≈øelf; we are ready to receive the ≈øtroke of ju≈øtice; there is no force in the objection; it is of no con≈øequence to ≈øay that Congre≈øs would eventually pay the money on the Continental certificates; the means of reducing that to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion are certainly ju≈øt as valuable as the benefits tho≈øe means can procure, and the parting with the means is parting with the end, and therefore with the value.</p>
                     <p>Becau≈øe, I pay my debt to my creditor with the bond of my debtor, it makes no difference.</p>
                     <p>To explain further. If the New-Loans are admitted as debts of any kind; if they inve≈øt the holder with a right, and impo≈øe an obligation on the ≈øtate, as in the words of the Act; if tho≈øe holders are creditors at all of the ≈øtate, then they are within the ≈øixth clau≈øe of the redeeming Act of the 10th of April 1792. (Mr. <hi>Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin≈øon</hi> was interrupted by Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll,</hi> who ≈øaid, <hi>"It is not admitted.")</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the holders are creditors this will not be denied. Are the holders of the New-Loans creditors of any body? If they are creditors then, and the New-Loans are the evidence of that credit, to whom are they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors? Of the Union? No. Are they creditors of the State? No; ≈øay they! that character is de≈øtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Ju≈øtice and ≈øimplicity delight in each other; they are the creditors of the ≈øtate, or more literally ≈øpeaking, they put their tru≈øt in the ≈øtate, and the ≈øtate on the other hand, in this Act, acknowledges that ≈øhe has
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:027132_0392_0FD3513C79F19E40"/>
≈øomething in tru≈øt for them; which ≈øhe obligates her≈øelf in this very Act to pay or deliver.</p>
                     <p>But, it is ≈øaid, that this Act had received a ≈øilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction from the ≈øtatements of this, and other officers, ≈øpeeches of the Governor, wherein the claims again≈øt the ≈øtate are enumerated, in which the New-Loans were omitted, reports of committees on ways and means, in which the actual demands again≈øt the commonwealth are ≈øet forth, in many places they are called New-Loan debts: The≈øe were likewi≈øe omitted, all being after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 1789, make a ≈øtrong argument, as ≈øhewing the uniform con≈øtruction in all their proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.</p>
                     <p>It is not ≈øafe to infer ≈øtrongly from mere omi≈ø≈øions, this is a negative circum≈øtance, to infer from the omi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion more ≈øhould be ≈øhewn than the omi≈ø≈øion; that there ≈øhould have been a propriety or duty in ab≈øolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerting them.</p>
                     <p>The Executive who≈øe part it is to addre≈øs the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the opening of each ≈øe≈ø≈øions; to communicate to them the tran≈øactions of his department, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of pre-exi≈øting laws, to point out the objects which ≈øeem particularly to claim legi≈ølative attention, and above all, to ≈øtate the ≈øituation of the Trea≈øury, the amount of exi≈øting and payable obligations, for which provi≈øions mu≈øt be made by actual appropriations.</p>
                     <p>Finds it nece≈ø≈øary to re≈øort to tho≈øe officers with whom the documents giving this information are lodged: The≈øe officers make reports with an eye to this object; the Governor takes this report for his guide to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his ≈øpeech, or other communications.</p>
                     <p>And then the committees on ways and means, in the Hou≈øe, who≈øe very name and ≈øtile point out their duty, and their ≈øphere, reported upon the ≈øame ≈øubject; in neither ≈øtatements, ≈øpeeches or reports were the New-Loans included after the pa≈ø≈øing the Act of March 1789. And why not?</p>
                     <p>Becau≈øe there was no propriety in including them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were unfunded, and therefore irrelevant to
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:027132_0393_0FD3513ED7327DE8"/>
the ≈øubject of Ways and Means: (Becau≈øe the arrears of intere≈øt excepted which were expre≈øsly ≈øtated) there was not ari≈øing out of them any demand which the Legi≈ølature had made actually payable, and for which an appropriation with Ways and Means would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary. It was on this ground the unfunded deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not included in them. To draw any inference from this omi≈ø≈øion would de≈øtroy the di≈øtinction between funded and unfunded depreciation debt. If an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation had been nece≈ø≈øary, it would be a ≈øubject for the con≈øideration of the committees on Ways and Means. It is one thing for the Legi≈ølature to re≈øolve to pay a demand, and another, and a ≈øub≈øequent one to provide Ways and Means, 'till the former is done, the latter is nugatory and unnece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>Again, Sir, it is true, that in the la≈øt report read, which is the only in≈øtance of the kind, there is a ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the debts of the commonwealth, and al≈øo the ≈øources of revenue, in which the unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation is included, and the New-Loans are not includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this will be accounted for, when we con≈øider; that the Land-office was open to the unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation certificates, whil≈øt it was ≈øhut again≈øt the <hi>New-Loans:</hi> for which there exi≈øted the provi≈øion by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in the Act of March 1789, the State was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming her New-Loans with tho≈øe who choo≈øe to make the application without dimini≈øhing her own active ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, while the holders of the Continental certificates exchanged, ≈øuffered a diminution on the nominal value, contemplated in the funding law of Congre≈øs; but as long as the State kept her Land-office open to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciation certificates ≈øhe was actually paying off the unfunded depreciation out of her own capital.</p>
                     <p>But the≈øe topics may certainly be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, for if the committee had expre≈ø≈øed their opinion directly again≈øt the New-Loans as a debt, it would be neither more nor le≈øs than the la≈øt committee did, who originated this impeachment, and could have no more influence

or weight, except their opinions had been bottomed on a more ≈øolid foundation.</p>
                     <p>But, again, it is contended from another quarter that this ≈øubject hath received a con≈øtruction, and been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly decided upon by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury again≈øt their ≈øub≈øcribability. Permit me to turn for a moment to that corre≈øpondence, the fir≈øt letter which is connected with this ≈øuppo≈øed deci≈øion is the letter of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> of January 14, 1793, (page 74-5-6) and its an≈øwer, (page 76-7-8) by which it is attempted to be proven that he has decided on their non-≈øub≈øcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                     <p>(After the two letters were read, Mr. <hi>Higgin≈øon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved.)</p>
                     <p>I will not undertake to ≈øay how far it was proper for an individual member of the committee to anticipate the Act of the whole, and as it were fore≈øtall informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ≈øubject; however, it may be remembered, that at this time, the impeachment was ≈ølowly growing under the fo≈øtering kind culture of the writer's, <hi>(Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)</hi> hands.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt circum≈øtance that ≈øtrikes me in reading <hi>this letter</hi> and <hi>the an≈øwer,</hi> is, that the two la≈øt que≈øtions were left unan≈øwered by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury; to the la≈øt he replies nothing, and on the matter of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he ob≈øerved hypothetically, that if the New-Loans are not a debt they are not a≈ø≈øumable; from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance I infer, con≈øidering that gentleman's charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (I mean the Secretary of the Trea≈øury) that tho≈øe que≈øtions were in his opinion improper; at all events it is certain that the an≈øwer to it was not what was wi≈øhed for, otherwi≈øe the ≈øub≈øequent letter of the Governor, which I ≈øhall pre≈øently read, would have been unnece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, the object of enquiry being preci≈øely the ≈øame. This letter of Mr. <hi>Gallatin's,</hi> contains a ≈øingular cour≈øe of rea≈øoning, and deductions from premi≈øes, which the writer knew at the time to be unfounded. The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ≈øtates forty thou≈øand pounds, as out≈øtanding; he (Mr. <hi>Gallatin)</hi> then goes on to ob≈øerve, "But as ≈øome
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:027132_0395_0FD351CB855F5208"/>
have been offered," &amp;c. (page 75.) Sir, he had it not more in proof that ≈øome of them were not ≈øo exchanged after they were offered than before. From the documents of the Comptroller-General a report had in the fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance been made to the Governor, and tran≈ømitted to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury; the writer's animadver≈øions therefore on that ground impliedly criminates that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
                     <p>He ob≈øerved al≈øo, that "I ≈øhould be led to think," &amp;c. The grounds of the Secretary's opinion did not imply any ≈øuch declaration; but even if the premi≈øes had been true, the conclu≈øion would not follow: This would indeed be a fiction with a witne≈øs to it.</p>
                     <p>Here I will take it with Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> that the rea≈øon why the Secretary of the Trea≈øury did not require the ≈øurrender or ≈øu≈øpend the intere≈øt, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily have been, becau≈øe, he looked upon all the New-Loans to be either redeemed or re-exchanged; now, if in order to account for the Secretary's not requiring a ≈øurrender or ≈øu≈øpending payment of intere≈øt, the inference is that he con≈øidered them a≈ø≈øumable and redeemable; Does it follow that he ≈øhould reject them as a≈ø≈øumable? by no means. The contrary is the proper conclu≈øion; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows immediately and directly that he ≈øhould admit them as a≈ø≈øumable, and it would al≈øo follow, that the demand could only be on the grounds that they were a≈ø≈øumable, and al≈øo that a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion would follow unle≈øs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates were ≈øurrendered, which the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Trea≈øury agreed might be done.</p>
                     <p>But the an≈øwer to this letter did not contain the idea which ≈øeems to have been anticipated and expected by the writer; therefore we find the Governor writing to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury on the ≈øame ≈øubject the 29th July 1793, (letter page 351-2 then read) and the Secretary's an≈øwer of Augu≈øt 21, 1793 (≈øee page 218-9). This letter left the que≈øtion of the validity of the Act of March 1789, re≈øpecting the a≈ø≈øumability of the New-Loan certificates untouched. The opinion of this officer on the ≈øub≈øcribability of the certificates is not expre≈ø≈øed
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:027132_0396_0FD352608A16D320"/>
in any part of this letter. "The≈øe circum≈øtances, &amp;c." this ≈øentence contains an opinion, but that opinion is not on the principle that New-Loans are not a≈ø≈øumable, is not, that the law of March 27th, 1789 de≈øtroyed them as a debt, but it is that the foregoing enumerated cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances ari≈øing from the interference of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> have amounted to a virtual rejection of them in effect; which does not even implicate his opinion on the que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law.</p>
                     <p>Again, "I was about to conform, &amp;c."‚ÄîThis ≈øurely does not imply his own opinion, and how far this officer, after having referred a que≈øtion of law to the Attorney-General of the United States, the fir≈øt profe≈ø≈øional officer of the government, and received his opinion, may think him≈øelf bound by it, I cannot undertake to determine.</p>
                     <p>It is probable however, when the que≈øtion was ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtful and the opinion founded on public expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency, when this State appeared ≈øo anxious to avoid any mi≈øunder≈øtanding with the Trea≈øury of the Union, that opinion might be con≈øidered obligatory as to the fact of admitting or rejecting them. We contend, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the Secretary of the Trea≈øury had not in this letter expre≈ø≈øed his opinion at all on the operation of the Act of March 1789, much le≈øs on the validity of it; if then, it is clear, that the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury has in the cour≈øe of this tran≈øaction expre≈ø≈øed his opinion unequivocally in favour of the New-Loans, and if in this letter he does not expre≈øs his opinion again≈øt them, there are ≈øtill odds in favour of the officer now on his defence: But I go further, Sir, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that if this officer has at all expre≈ø≈øed his opinion on the principle of this que≈øtion even after the di≈øclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of the Act of March 1789, it is in favour of the New-Loans and not again≈øt them.</p>
                     <p>This will appear from ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages in his letter in an≈øwer to Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> letter; when the Act of March 1789 had been brought into his view, for he expre≈øsly adverts to that objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="unknown:027132_0397_0FD32802D2864F40"/>Before I read tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, ≈øuffer me to make a comment on the fir≈øt part of a former letter (≈øee page 76, &amp;c.) from this officer. It may ≈øerve to ≈øhew that the extreme ≈øolicitude di≈øcovered by the State with regard to this que≈øtion might have betrayed the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Trea≈øury into a want of accuracy, a mi≈øtake which can be very ≈øeldom imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>The paragraph to which I allude is that (page 77) <hi>"that they ≈øhould at the time of being ≈øub≈øcribed be recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the exi≈øting laws of the States as evidences of debts by them re≈øpectively owing."</hi> With the mo≈øt re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful deference to the writer of this letter, I conceive that this expre≈ø≈øion is not ≈øufficiently defined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Becau≈øe, after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of the 4th of Augu≈øt 1790, the whole loan under the a≈ø≈øumption, at that rate, might have been defeated, fru≈øtrated, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered void.</p>
                     <p>In a ≈øucceeding paragraph, he ob≈øerved, "If how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the New-Loan certificates are not by the laws of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> con≈øidered as <hi>debts</hi> but merely as receipts for certificates of the United States," &amp;c. (≈øee page 78.) It may be ob≈øerved that this is a mere hypothetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, and as it comes in as a qualification to the other remark, that as the certificates were then pre≈øented, no doubt could be entertained of their a≈ø≈øumability, it clearly implies that if this condition fails, that is, if the New-Loans cannot be con≈øidered as mere <hi>receipts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable at the plea≈øure of the government, then no doubt could remain of their a≈ø≈øumability al≈øo.</p>
                     <p>Now taking it for granted for a moment that the State could convert that into a mere receipt, which was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally i≈ø≈øued as an obligation, yet ≈øhe has not done it; as there is nothing then which obliges the holder to part
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:027132_0398_0FD351FD454AC450"/>
with his New-Loan on the application of the State, it is utterly impo≈ø≈øible to con≈øider the New-Loans as mere receipts, demandable at the plea≈øure of the State; and their being ≈øo, con≈øtitutes the very object of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Trea≈øury's ≈øuppo≈øition. As then this hypothe≈øis fails, as the New-Loans cannot be con≈øidered as mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts demandable at plea≈øure, what follows? Why, they revert back to their original ground, the propo≈øition a≈ø≈øumes its fir≈øt and original form, and in the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, they are a≈ø≈øumable:‚ÄîThis idea is held out in another of his letters, where he adverts to the Act of March 1789, but to ≈øuppo≈øe that the holders of New-Loans are creditors, and their certificates no more than mere receipts, and con≈øequently no debts, this po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be ≈øupported without doing a violence to the letter of the law; but, on the other hand ≈øuppo≈øe we ≈øhall coincide with their con≈øtruction of the Acts of the Legi≈ølature, and agree with the Attorney-General of the United States him≈øelf, who ≈øays, (page 81) that "the Act of March 1789, &amp;c. aboli≈øhed the≈øe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates as debts of the State, as wanting the due recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from the State, and cannot be legally received upon loan." A moment's con≈øideration will ≈øhew that this was a contract: And when the Con≈øtitution of the United States is brought into view, this in≈øtrument ≈øays, that all debts and engagements ≈øhall be as valid again≈øt the United States under this con≈øtitution as under the confederation. But they ≈øay fir≈øt, this does not apply, and ≈øecondly they ≈øay, the Con≈øtitution refers only to contracts between individuals, and not between a State and her own citizens.</p>
                     <p>Now it is certain, loans are contracts, and if contracts are loans, and the Act of March 1789 pa≈ø≈øed after the adoption of the Federal Con≈øtitution, then it is certain that the New-Loans are ≈øub≈øcribable and con≈øequently redeemable.</p>
                     <p>If it can extend to contracts between citizens of a State, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> it extends to contracts in which the State is a party.</p>

                        <pb n="391" facs="unknown:027132_0399_0FD328041FEFA0F0"/>So intimate is the connection; ≈øo great is the influence which the conduct and character of the ≈øeveral States have upon that of the Union, that the framers of this in≈øtrument mu≈øt have been blind to the general intere≈øt, if they had not introduced this provi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>To tie up the hands of the Union, therefore, in that Con≈øtitution would have been u≈øele≈øs, without tying up al≈øo the hands of the States with re≈øpect to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</p>
                     <p>Will the United States tie up their own hands and not tie up the hands of the individual States? Thus guarding the two extremes and leave a vacuum in the middle unguarded!</p>
                     <p>What was the rea≈øon for in≈øerting it in the Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? To pre≈øerve public credit. Is there a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ≈øubject in the world than public credit?</p>
                     <p>The ≈øituation of the country at the time made ≈øuch a provi≈øion nece≈ø≈øary. The <hi>American</hi> name which from the independence had been ≈øliding fa≈øt to ruin, had every thing to make her happy, but wanted one thing to make her re≈øpectable, that was CREDIT; the grand <hi>de≈øideratum</hi> without which the re≈øt would be nugatory and unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Sir, if the limbs were pal≈øied, what would it avail that the body was ≈øound, I will not in≈øi≈øt upon the proverb of the ≈øheep, but this I will ≈øay, that where the children turn out badly, it is apt to hurt the reputation of the family: If a State had the power of impairing her own contracts and ≈øacrificing her faith, then it would follow, that however well di≈øpo≈øed the general government might be, however ≈øound at the centre; yet all the States in ≈øucce≈ø≈øion might ≈øacrifice their credit by impairing their contracts, and the Union robbed of her re≈øpectability, and her credit by the mi≈ømanagement of her children left to parry the ≈øtrokes of fortune.</p>
                     <p>But another thing; this omi≈ø≈øion would not only have been the road by which the credit of the Union would de≈øert it, but it would have been the ≈øource of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and contention at home. If the Con≈øtitution had
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:027132_0400_0FD351CD9C8911A8"/>
not expre≈ø≈øed this prohibition, civil wars might have been the monuments of its weakne≈øs. While in one State the obligation of contracts was held as ≈øacred as it ought to be; in another they would be pro≈øtrated to temporary convenience.</p>
                     <p>Taking this ca≈øe, then, to be literally within the words and e≈ø≈øentially within the ≈øpirit of this clau≈øe; let us ≈øee in what manner it has been violated.</p>
                     <p>And fir≈øt. Were the New-Loans a debt, or evidence of a debt due from the State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> at any time before the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 27th March, 1789?</p>
                     <p>As to this, I take it to be undeniable that the New-Loans had been a debt of this State. This is not only acknowledged and implied by the tenor of the articles them≈øelves, but they are expre≈øsly called a debt of the State in the Act which created them; and al≈øo in the Act which impaired them.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, this is conceded on all hands, except by one, the Trea≈øurer of the State (≈øee page 68) in his letter to the Speaker of the lower Hou≈øe; wherein he ≈øtiles them <hi>"Which in fact never were a State debt."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be ob≈øerved however, that if the law of March 1789 ≈øhould be found not to abrogate or de≈øtroy the debt, which I think will appear, yet if it in any way impairs the obligation of the contract, it is mo≈øt clearly and undeniably a violation of the Con≈øtitution of the United States, and therefore void to all intents and purpo≈øes, and if ≈øo, this tribunal is bound to con≈øider it, as never having any exi≈øtence.</p>
                     <p>Again, and for the la≈øt time, upon a ≈øtrict compari≈øon of the Acts of March 1786, and that of March 1789, it will be found that the New-Loan certificates were equally unimpaired after the Act, as they were before.</p>
                     <p>Let us ≈øee how much, in order to di≈øtingui≈øh between tho≈øe parts which created the debt it≈øelf, and tho≈øe which directed the payment of principal and intere≈øt: It may be con≈øidered the funds for payment of intere≈øt were temporary. (Mr. <hi>Higgin≈øon</hi> then read the minutes of 1789, page 145, by which it appeared that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:027132_0401_0FD35262B2B72780"/>
re≈øpecting the principal of the New-loans was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced at the third reading of the bill. The original and primary object of the bill being, that the intere≈øt ≈øhould cea≈øe, as the provi≈øion for that purpo≈øe had been temporary.</p>
                     <p>In page 184, "it was moved by Mr. <hi>Fitz≈øimons,</hi> ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Mr. <hi>M'Pher≈øon,"</hi> &amp;c. The bill originated through the exigency of the State. Before the law pa≈ø≈øed, the Land-office was to have been ≈øhut, in what manner was it to be produced? it was forbidden‚ÄîIs not forbidding a <hi>payment</hi> in futuro, a te≈øtimony of the exi≈øtence of the debt.</p>
                     <p>The payment of New-Loan certificates was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Land-office. Now, what parts are tho≈øe of the Act of March 1786 which created the debt? Even the Act it≈øelf did not immediately create the debt; tho≈øe parts in the ≈øecond ≈øection do not. The loan was to be opened, ≈øuppo≈øe none chu≈øe to ≈øub≈øcribe to it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; then there would be no debt: By opening, ≈øub≈øcribing, and paying, the debt ≈øprung into exi≈øtence, that moment it became a debt: and a certificate is given merely as an evidence of that debt. (The ≈øecond ≈øection of the Act of March 1, 1786 was then read.)</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in this to ≈øecure the payment of either principal or intere≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Nothing in the ≈øecond ≈øection directs or ≈øecures the payment of the debt, the kinds of certificates directed to be received on loan are not immediately under the fir≈øt and ≈øecond ≈øections.</p>
                     <p>But the repealing clau≈øe of the Act of March 1789 has full force, ≈øatisfaction and complete exi≈øtence out of the other clau≈øes of the Act of 1786. Ingenuity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf with all her hundred eyes is not able to e≈øcape the inference which I draw from a ≈øtrict compari≈øon of the Acts of March 1789 and 1786.</p>
                     <p>Why then need we be drawn into the imputation of ≈øo di≈øreputable a violation of public faith? How then, can it be charged, as hath been done by one gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that this officer by the <hi>magic wand</hi> of his office
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:027132_0402_0FD35210C6BFB8E0"/>
had conjured up the gho≈øts of the departed New-Loans to frighten away the dollars of the commonwealth, without imputing to the State, who was their creator, the odious crime of unnatural murder?</p>
                     <p>Let us now con≈øider how this hath been con≈øtrued by the Legi≈ølature.</p>
                     <p>In an Act pa≈ø≈øed the 30th September 1791, for the relief of <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> and others, who had lo≈øt New-Loan certificates, the State undertook to ≈øub≈øcribe for their u≈øe, and to pay to them the intere≈øt on ≈øuch ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcriptions, on their giving ≈øecurity to indemnify the State ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>in≈øt the holders of her certificates.</p>
                     <p>This Act proves two things. Fir≈øt, that the New-Loan creditors of them≈øelves could do nothing, they had no claim on the Union, and therefore were not creditors of the Union. And ≈øecondly, By requiring an indemnity from the holder, inevitably implies a right of demand on the State ve≈øted in that holder, and that right of demand whatever it be, con≈øtitutes the ≈øtrictne≈øs and propriety of character of CREDITOR.</p>
                     <p>In the in≈øtructions of the Supreme Executive Council (page 267) are the≈øe words, <hi>"You will i≈ø≈øue a new cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate."</hi> Will it be contended that the≈øe are mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts? can certificates of parts be debts, when the whole was no debt in its original form?</p>
                     <p>As the ca≈øe then is brought thus clearly within the ≈øcope of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, what can be offered in oppo≈øition to our conclu≈øion?</p>
                     <p>One thing only, that as the New-Loans them≈øelves amounted to more than this State's proportion of the a≈ø≈øumed debt, it could not be imputed to the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they meant to include the New-Loans: it may be remarked, that as the inference drawn by Mr. <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> from the con≈øequences of the rule laid down by him relative to the 4th article of the confederation, it only proved the law a bad one.</p>
                     <p>As this is introduced a pre≈øumptive argument is brought forward again≈øt it. They ≈øay, how injurious it is to the State, and of what bad con≈øequences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:027132_0403_0FD352663A9617B8"/>
her own debts at 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g> in the pound! If they call this a bad con≈øequence, give it that con≈øtruction, as a pre≈øumptive argument as it regards the State, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence is with us, and not with them.</p>
                     <p>Here is a ≈øingular circum≈øtance, they have violated the rules of law, they have con≈øtrued the law of 1786 ≈øtrictly with regard to this object; and they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrued the law of 1789, which confers benefits liberally in their own favour.</p>
                     <p>Again, another argument is brought forward.</p>
                     <p>It is ≈øaid the ≈øixth ≈øection is a provi≈øo to the ≈øecond ≈øection.</p>
                     <p>If ≈øo, the object was tho≈øe which ≈øhe had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in the ≈øecond ≈øection to the benefit of the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>If ≈øo, the ≈øixth is co-exten≈øive with the ≈øecond as to objects. If the New-Loans by the ≈øixth ≈øection are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable through the medium of the United States, it is ≈øtill better: If they are not redeemable, the mode is not commen≈øurate to the objects contemplated in the ≈øecond ≈øection, and it is wrong to a≈øcribe that to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, which could not be her motive.</p>
                     <p>Bills of Credit are enumerated and provided for in the ≈øecond ≈øection; the ≈øixth ≈øection is introduced to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and yet Bills of Credit are not included in that ≈øection at all, notwith≈øtanding which, it is called a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion to the ≈øecond ≈øection; with an eye to ≈øuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they a≈øcribe a ridiculous motive to the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature: that by the Act of April 7th 1791, the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is injurious refers only to the Act of March 1789, as an arrangement for the <hi>future:</hi> The State <hi>may</hi> deem it proper to make ≈øuch for the purpo≈øe of avoiding any interference with the State or dome≈øtic ≈øub≈øcription.</p>
                     <p>Had it been the rea≈øon the State would have actually a≈ø≈øumed her dome≈øtic debt.</p>
                     <p>It was ea≈øy to tell the amount of what was out≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>It was only to conduct the out≈øtanding from tho≈øe on hand; there was no difficulty; it was only to add or to ≈øubtract; the object was to leave greater room for tho≈øe
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:027132_0404_0FD351FEBA291960"/>
debts which were a greater and a more immediate bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then on the State.</p>
                     <p>One of two things mu≈øt be their object.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either to narrow down the intere≈øt, or 2 To give a facility to re-exchanging, and to their ≈øub≈øcribing to the Continental loan; and in either ca≈øe the New-Loans would not be re-exchanged at all.</p>
                     <p>No other rea≈øon can be properly given for it; if we con≈øtrue the law liberally, and not fooli≈øhly.</p>
                     <p>It was contended, that if we ≈øhould have con≈øtrued the ≈øixth ≈øection literally, we could not have given it ≈øo fooli≈øh a con≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>It is ≈øaid the Comptroller committed him≈øelf by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering an e≈øtimate to the Governor. If a provi≈øion is made in the ≈øixth ≈øection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, there may be ≈øome rea≈øon for it; but if not, the ≈øuppo≈øition is un≈øupported.</p>
                     <p>Let us con≈øider this a little; it is clear from the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ≈øection, that no provi≈øion is made there for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciation, and none for the New-Loans in the ≈øame ≈øection.</p>
                     <p>One of them it is agreed, and both, we contend, are included in the ≈øixth ≈øection; it is al≈øo clear that no certificates which are not included in the ≈øecond ≈øection, can participate in the funds to be created by the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock; for that fund is limitted to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects therein enumerated.</p>
                     <p>It this be true then in an e≈øtimate which was to direct the Executive in the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock, neither the unfunded depreciation nor New-Loans ≈øhould have been included, even if the e≈øtimate had been made after the Act for re-opening the loan had pa≈ø≈øed: But at all events, I a≈øk, how was it po≈ø≈øible that the two offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, from the 13th to the 16th of April, could include in their e≈øtimate objects that would be embraced even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, if at all by the ≈øixth ≈øection; whereas the Act of Congre≈øs of the 8th of May 1792, was not then pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
                     <p>In≈øtead of u≈øing this con≈øtruction of the law for their
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:027132_0405_0FD3525D43E60430"/>
own purpo≈øes, they are compelled to u≈øe it for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes.</p>
                     <p>Let us for a moment ≈øuppo≈øe, that the Legi≈ølature intended as they are inclined to have it, and ≈øee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences, and how do you find this con≈øtruction of theirs, to work the de≈øtruction of the debt? Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction is conjectural, u≈øele≈øs and dangerous: If ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribability is the criterion, they are mi≈øtaken in the premi≈øes; if the New-Loans are a debt, ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable are convertible terms.</p>
                     <p>If the ideas are not to be collected from the Act it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, then we ≈øhall in time have an hundred laws in≈øtead of one, then an end to legi≈ølation.</p>
                     <p>Having made the≈øe ob≈øervations on the fir≈øt articles re≈øpecting the law, I will in the next place treat of the the motives. But fir≈øt permit me to make ≈øome ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations re≈øpecting the three la≈øt articles of impeachment.</p>
                     <p>We avow the facts contained in the fifth article, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the legality, and contend we had a right ≈øo to do.</p>
                     <p>When the defendant a≈ø≈øumed the office of Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, he did not relinqui≈øh the duties of a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. How far it may be good policy to pa≈øs inhibitory laws, and how far it may be improper, to pa≈øs ≈øuch po≈øitive laws, until ≈øuch laws are pa≈ø≈øed, we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a right, and until a que≈øtion is rai≈øed on ≈øuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitive law, our actions cannot be impeachable.</p>
                     <p>We have heard from <hi>Wode≈øon</hi> that a public officer ≈øhould have no intere≈øt di≈øtinct from the State.</p>
                     <p>Where is the force of this rea≈øoning? attend to the circum≈øtances. That impeachable matter mu≈øt be an injury to the State, and not the gain of the officer. Where is the injury to the commonwealth in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular? In what does it con≈øi≈øt? Does the payment of a ju≈øt and valid debt con≈øtitute this injury and detriment? If ≈øuch can be viewed in this light it is well worthy of ob≈øervation.</p>
                     <p>The 6th and 7th articles aim to place us in a much more irk≈øome and ugly ≈øituation, and here I cannot help remarking on what fell from the other ≈øide; that great
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:027132_0406_0FD3526CC5A7FF80"/>
merit is due to them for being able to ≈øhew ≈øo much, when from the heinou≈øne≈øs of the fact, the Comptroller might conceal the whole matter; how ≈øingular, that this very proof and te≈øtimony is evincive of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Nay, in this particular our accu≈øers take merit, that they have ≈øhewn and proven too much.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing common to both the≈øe articles, they infer property in the State, and make it by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nece≈ø≈øary, and from different premi≈øes; it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumable the framers of the≈øe articles thought property e≈ø≈øential to con≈øtitute the offence.</p>
                     <p>In the ≈øixth article it is inferred from the certificates being lodged for the purpo≈øe of being re-exchanged. It may well be a≈øked, Had the owner no controul over them, what was his ultimate object? On what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were they to become the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
                     <p>Sir, the Act was only inchoate, indents were to be paid, or received. Could the State withhold the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates if the party choo≈øe to withdraw them? Would it not be liable to execution as the property of the party? No doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>The committee, who were the drawers of this article, have ≈øhewn their idea that this conclu≈øion was weak, and un≈øound, for if this con≈øtituted property, the fifth article would be nugatory and unnece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>(The fifth article was then read.) This gives a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the exchange. The committee have plainly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the facts in the ≈øixth may be demurred to.</p>
                     <p>What is the proof brought forward to ≈øupport this 7th article? It is ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> was once the proprietor of a certificate which he never ≈øold to us, and they endeavour to throw the burthen of the proof on us. This witne≈øs ≈øpeaking from memory, ≈øays he did not receive this certificate from <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> he does not pretend to ≈øay that he ≈øold or exchanged this or any other certificate with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller-General; but he tells us expre≈øsly that he ≈øold to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="399" facs="unknown:027132_0407_0FD3526FF9F43268"/>Let us examine this a little<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> He ≈øays he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our certificate of ¬£. 3275:19:4 from <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> this he ab≈øolutely received in April 1788.</p>
                     <p>The witne≈øs, who is brought forward is unable to prove how he came by any of his certificates.</p>
                     <p>This idea involves a new and delicate point of law, taken from analogy in other criminal ca≈øes. When a felony or forgery is ≈øworn to, and the in≈øtrument with which the felony or forgery was committed be found on a per≈øon, the pre≈øumption is ≈øo ≈øtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he has the thing wherewith the crime was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated, that the party with whom the in≈øtrument is found mu≈øt account. Here they ≈øay the witne≈øs did not ≈øell it to us; but they endeavour by the ab≈øence of the fact to lay the burthen of proof on us, to make a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal charge where there is no proof of criminality.</p>
                     <p>A certificate was once Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's;</hi> one of two things mu≈øt be admitted. 1. That the certificate was exchanged, and criminally converted to our u≈øe; or, 2. We bought from ≈øome other per≈øon. It proves nothing again≈øt us. Out of the two modes, which is mo≈øt pre≈øumable? one is a fair purcha≈øe in a circuitous route, the other a criminal conver≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Is there a criminal tribunal on earth which would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a proof ≈øo nugatory to ≈øupport and enforce a pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Need I a≈øk which will be cho≈øen. Is the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt and mo≈øt attrocious item to be ≈øupported by the ≈ølighte≈øt proof, by the vague remnants of a memory frail in its be≈øt e≈øtate? If this were ≈øupported as it is repre≈øented, the breath of the offender might taint the walls that hold him. But we find a mill-≈øtone in the articles, and a feather in the proof.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I do not fear, becau≈øe I do not believe that this tribunal will find it to their ≈øatisfaction to convict a re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable fellow-citizen and a re≈øpon≈øible officer upon a ra≈øh and dangerous implication upon evidence ≈øo trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and indefinite, and that too going to a charge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly vague in it≈øelf and general as the light we ≈øee by.</p>
                     <p>This brings me to the ≈øecond divi≈øion of my ≈øubject,

                     <p>To introduce this, it is nece≈ø≈øary to ob≈øerve, that, out of the doubtfulne≈øs of the que≈øtion on the law it≈øelf, if on all hands the con≈øtruction of the ≈øeveral Acts has created embarra≈ø≈øment, it will be remembered, that on the reading of the report to the Lower Hou≈øe, after the committee had had the ≈øubject before them a very long time, Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> apologized for that delay by inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hou≈øe that they had waited ≈øome time for the opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States (Mr. <hi>Randolph.)</hi>

                     <p>The Secretary of the Trea≈øury doubted the con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act of March 1789, and deemed it ≈øo

doubtful a que≈øtion as to induce him to con≈øult the law officer of the general government.</p>
                     <p>Now, ≈øir, let it be recollected, that in ordinary and per≈øpicuous ca≈øes, this recour≈øe is never had to profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øional and official opinion. From this, then, it may fairly be inferred that this ca≈øe was not ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpicuous.</p>

                     <p>But if the mind of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury in con≈øidering the ca≈øe from the relation that every law bore to the ≈øubject, partook of the≈øe embarra≈ø≈øments, how ea≈øy is it to conceive that from the <hi>bona fide</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of the Comptroller-General, that deci≈øion might have re≈øulted, the con≈øequence of which was the redemption of the≈øe certificates.</p>

                        </gap> that the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury pending the fir≈øt loan was of opinion, that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable, and gave ≈øuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Continental Loan-officer, and that the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs is not to this moment decided upon, and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the ≈øame to the commi≈ø≈øioner afore≈øaid (≈øee page 273-4-5.) "I do not con≈øider you as ju≈øtifiiable." &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Addi≈øon,</hi> a law officer of the government, was
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:027132_0412_0FD352BF8019F870"/>
of this opinion, a gentleman well qualified, and of much integrity. What is to be inferred from the ≈øilence of all the State officers during the demand of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates? they all held the ≈øame opinion. (The letter, page 102, was then read.)</p>
                     <p>If the Secretary of the Trea≈øury had been unacquainted with the law, were the Governor and Secretary of the commonwealth ignorant? The whole tenor of this letter nece≈ø≈øarily implies the ≈øen≈øe of the writer to be that the New-Loans were liable to be a≈ø≈øumed, for the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion being to prevent the payment of intere≈øt twice on the ≈øame ≈øum; no que≈øtion could ari≈øe out of it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the New-Loans, without their being ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: In all, the <hi>≈øu≈øpen≈øion of intere≈øt</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumability</hi> were the principal things to be con≈øidered. If any doubt had exi≈øted with the Governor, would he not have ≈øifted it to the bottom? If any doubt remained re≈øpecting their ≈øub≈øcribability, would they not endeavour to clear up the matter?</p>
                     <p>With regard to the Secretary of the commonwealth, there is a circum≈øtance which ≈øtrongly corroborates the a≈ø≈øertion, that he mu≈øt be ≈øatisfied of the ≈øub≈øcribability of the New-Loans. He appeared to be ≈øurpri≈øed when the matter of the a≈ø≈øumption was communicated to him; this information ≈øeemed to run counter to his judgment! The Secretary had ≈øeen Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> plan of finance, in that plan the New-Loans are recognized as a debt; he approved of the plan, (≈øee his letter page 286.) It came before him with its "prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;" the plan put the New-Loans on the ≈øame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other debts of the commonwealth. Why ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øed? Perhaps the rea≈øon may be, becau≈øe there was no redemption law at that time. Is that a rea≈øon? Why? certainly not.</p>
                     <p>Further, It is given in te≈øtimony that after ≈øeveral conferences the Regi≈øter-General concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and that the accounts contained ≈øome certificates depreciated on the principal which no body could mi≈øtake for any other than New-Loans;
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:027132_0413_0FD35270C36504C0"/>
the probability is, that the ≈øame was redeemed; immaterial whether before or after our ab≈øtract, which had been <hi>bona fide</hi> pre≈øented and redeemed: Yet this man, whom they repre≈øent as hackneyed in perfidy, this man who veiled and ma≈øked the proceedings to delude the other officers of government into error is found expre≈øsly to have communicated with them, while they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in the conviction which that conference produced.</p>
                     <p>The next rea≈øon, then, that I would offer is that the Comptroller-General held the ≈øame opinion on the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumability of the New-Loans, long before the Act of April 10, 1792, by which alone he became intere≈øted.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, From the te≈øtimony of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury (page 287-8-9.) 2dly, From the Comptroller's own letter to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Loan-officer (page 271-2) eighteen months before the redemption law. Nothing is clearer than that the writer of this letter was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the New-Loans were a≈ø≈øumable, although he was convinced they would not be offered ≈øubject to the di≈øadvantages of the funding law.</p>
                     <p>It was again≈øt the intere≈øt of the New-Loan holders to ≈øub≈øcribe them, it was for their intere≈øt to exchange them for Continental certificates, and then to ≈øub≈øcribe tho≈øe. In the next place, the ≈øame opinion is al≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed in his letter (page 220-1-2) to the Governor. I a≈øk whether it is po≈ø≈øible for any thing to expre≈øs more clearly and unequivocally his opinion of their being a debt due from the ≈øtate, and of their ≈øub≈øcribability; it ≈øeems from the former part of this letter that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Trea≈øury had taken higher ground, and demanded a ≈øurrender of Continental certificates equal to the amount of New-Loans out≈øtanding; or ≈øu≈øpend the payment of intere≈øt, this it is evident had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually relinqui≈øhed by the Secretary.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the current of te≈øtimony ≈øets in, ≈øtrongly, on the ≈øide of innocence. (His next letter to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, page 277, then read.)</p>
                     <p>It will be remembered that in the letter of the 24th December 1791, five days before this, the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:027132_0414_0FD3527259134408"/>
tells the Governor, that none of the New-Loans were actually ≈øub≈øcribed; though they were ≈øub≈øcribable, and therefore there was no need of a ≈øurrender. This was the object of the negociation, and therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Secretary of the Trea≈øury of the ≈øame thing; that if a doubt ≈øhould ari≈øe, whether part of the <hi>a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or ≈øub≈øcribed debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> does not con≈øi≈øt of New-Loans, it can be ea≈øily proved it does not. No body can doubt this to be the meaning, when they recollect that in his former letter to the Governor, and that to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> he not only recognized them to be ≈øub≈øcribable, but ≈øaid they were not, or would not be ≈øub≈øcribed; it being again≈øt the intere≈øt of the holders.</p>
                     <p>Still le≈øs ≈øhall we doubt it, when we turn to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (page 278) wherein we trace the ≈øame ≈øentiments.</p>
                     <p>(The letter page 223-4 was then read.)</p>
                     <p>Thus, we ≈øee the con≈øi≈øtency and uniformity of the officer now on defence, in per≈øevering in the ≈øame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the ≈øpace of eighteen months before he became intere≈øted. Sir, I think this gives a mortal blow to the pro≈øecution, and the charge of fraud vani≈øhes like the ba≈øele≈øs fabric of a vi≈øion, which leaves not a wreck behind. But this is not all, for if we de≈øcend to the particular periods when the tran≈øactions took place, we ≈øhall di≈øcover there, al≈øo, a train of co-temporary facts, equally invulnerable and conclu≈øive.</p>
                     <p>The next rea≈øon which I ≈øhall offer, ari≈øes from the caution which he gave the members of the Legi≈ølature when the redemption law was under con≈øideration.</p>
                     <p>When the extent of that law was in contemplation, when gentlemen undertake to paint the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed and ruinous con≈øequences to the ≈øtate, which would follow the admi≈ø≈øion of the New-Loans to ≈øweep away the whole quota of the a≈ø≈øumption of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> while at the ≈øame time it ab≈øorbed the ≈øpecie from her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury; let them have the charity to remember that this officer, who≈øe ≈øpirit they are now grieving, rai≈øed his voice and hands again≈øt that dangerous proceeding at that time. This is not the language of di≈øgrace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="407" facs="unknown:027132_0415_0FD35274AA0A5440"/>But, again; the tran≈øactions were conducted in the u≈øual forms of office, and in his own name; and it is remarkable that the committee on who≈øe report this impeachment was founded, gave their opinion in that report, that the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> has been guilty of a high mi≈ødemeanor for two rea≈øons, one of which was that he pa≈ø≈øed and certified the New-Loans to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive in the u≈øual forms of office, thereby cau≈øing them to be redeemed. The jet of the rea≈øon is in the <hi>"u≈øual forms"</hi> of office, by which they were redeemed.</p>
                     <p>If then forms had been unu≈øual, the very ≈øingularity would have been <hi>prima facie,</hi> a pre≈øumption and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of other than ordinary de≈øign or intention, this charge is indeed to make the u≈øual cour≈øe of bu≈øine≈øs the evidence of guilt.</p>
                     <p>A like charge and equally unimportant appears to me the matters contained in the third article of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>This article is mean in ≈øub≈øtance, and pitifully drawn: The fir≈øt thing ≈øingular is, that they begin with the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality and go on to the facts. "In order to promote and procure his own emolument," &amp;c. till it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reduced to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, implying, that after the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument was reduced to actual po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, there was a certainty or probability of detection; this idea is too futile, nobody in their ≈øen≈øes will believe this to be true; for what purpo≈øe could it an≈øwer to deceive for the po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion, when certain detection was to follow it? Again in order to avoid "di≈øcovery till" &amp;c. "he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult the Regi≈øter-General," implying that after the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments were in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, he did con≈øult the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter-General: Let me a≈øk, how came this peculiar phra≈øeology to be given to this article?</p>
                     <p>We have had the hi≈øtory of that from Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> who was the principal member of the Hou≈øe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives at the time, we have been informed that upon the examination of the Regi≈øter-General, although not examined upon oath, the fir≈øt part of this article was founded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="unknown:027132_0416_0FD352124B7EFA58"/>It was found, that, after mo≈øt of the ab≈øtracts had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and the Comptroller-General had actually received the amount of his; there was a con≈øultation among the officers, when the Regi≈øter fully concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and although there were ≈øufficient di≈øtingui≈øhing marks on the face of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracts, to a≈øcertain that New-Loans were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; and although the≈øe di≈øtingui≈øhing marks were in a part to which the whole bu≈øine≈øs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter was confined, namely the calculation of intere≈øt, and therefore, it was no fault of the Comptroller-Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that they were not ≈øooner known, and although the Regi≈øter declared that when they were known, he was fully of the ≈øame opinion, and accordingly officially pa≈ø≈øed ≈øome ab≈øtracts afterwards, knowing them to be New-Loans; yet the committee, for≈øooth, in≈øtead of throwing a≈øide the article as un≈øupported, re≈øolved to amend the article, to ≈øuit the te≈øtimony whatever it might be, in order that the Comptroller-General might be ≈øet for a while on the ≈øtool of repentance; becau≈øe the Regi≈øter-General in calculating intere≈øt on a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate depreciated on the principal, was not ≈øagacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to find out that it was a New-Loan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the true ≈øtyle of the dramati≈øt, the pa≈ø≈øion for incident is to ab≈øorb every other faculty.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, let me proceed to the facts, facts! Did I ≈øay? I was wrong, ≈øir, there is not a ≈øingle fact charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this article, they are only omi≈ø≈øions. That "he did not con≈øult the Regi≈øter-General, nor communicate the matter to the Governor" before he got his money, and that he did not di≈øcriminate between the New-Loans and others. It is pretended, that this was an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent duty on him, the contrary is clear, for neither did his duty require it, nor the u≈øage or practice of the officers make it nece≈ø≈øary. It is not ≈øhewn to be his duty but it has been ob≈øerved that in ≈øo important a ca≈øe, he ought to u≈øe ≈øome works of ≈øupererrogation.</p>

                     <p>As to his certifications to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Loan-officer, I conceive them to be out of the que≈øtion, for the≈øe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons. 1. He was not acting then as an officer at all, but having received a letter from Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> reque≈øting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he gives it as a friend to the be≈øt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 2. As he was not then performing a duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed on him in his official capacity, ≈øo neither was Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who received the information, bound to give any credit to it, unle≈øs he choo≈øe to do ≈øo. 3. As that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was for the United States, and not this ≈øtate, if that information was attended with lo≈øs or injury, the government of the Union alone have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                     <p>The certifications and proceedings with regard to our own ≈øtate were in the u≈øual forms of office; no certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were more particularly ≈øet forth or de≈øcribed than others. The New-Loans them≈øelves were ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically a≈øcertainable from the variety of dates in the commencement of intere≈øt, which no officer with ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial attention could overlook.‚ÄîBe≈øides this, one certificate in the ≈øub≈øcription of the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was depreciated on the principal, it was not po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to mi≈øtake that for any other than a New-Loan; therefore the certification of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> being done at the reque≈øt of individuals, and in no in≈øtance of the Comptroller's own ≈øub≈øcription, it was a labour without the ≈ømalle≈øt intere≈øt or profit: If then this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable,</hi> had no ≈øort of influence in the right or que≈øtion of ≈øub≈øcribing them, in what ≈øhape can it be criminal? The ≈øub≈øcription was in his own name al≈øo. Sir, however this may be lightly ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, yet to a≈øcertain the motive it is of the fir≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: As the≈øe certificates were payable to bearer it was in his power to have them ≈øub≈øcribed in the name of ≈øome unknown per≈øon, and his intere≈øt in them could not have been di≈øcovered; the whole tran≈øaction becomes
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:027132_0418_0FD352788553F7C8"/>
an ea≈øy riddle in≈øtead of a well concerted plot, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance aro≈øe from con≈øcious rectitude of mind, with that fearle≈øs independence, which is the noble≈øt a≈ø≈øoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of hone≈øty and its ≈øure≈øt indication.</p>
                     <p>Another rea≈øon: Sir, it is notorious, when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was brought forward he ≈øolicited an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate trial: it is not the part of con≈øcious wickedne≈øs to court enquiry, but to dread and procra≈øtinate it even when it is unavoidable, yes time and delay are the only harbours of guilt! the≈øe things may be fetters to the guilty; but they are wings to the innocent, when he was impeached, he flew to met the pro≈øecution. I will not enquire for what purpo≈øe that accu≈øation ≈ølept in impotent ab≈øtraction in the bo≈øom of a numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, till the very clo≈øe of the ≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Although many months have elap≈øed ≈øince this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was preferred, although the committe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øtigation, have u≈øed every effort during the rece≈øs, after trying by every means to di≈øcover official frauds, yet they have been unable to fa≈øten on a ≈øingle in≈øtance of the ≈øort, among the numerous documents and the voluminous records of that department; but they have laid their hands on a ≈øolitary fellow-citizen, the dark and doubtful corners of who≈øe memory they have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øacked again and again, with the plea≈øing hope of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the thong that would bind in di≈øgrace an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor.</p>
                     <p>I will not pretend to ≈øay, that the motive for po≈øtpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inve≈øtigation was to ≈øu≈øpend him during the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as a culprit with his lips ≈øealed for the hand of ≈øcorn to point his ≈ølow and moving finger at. I will not ≈øay that it was to rake up the a≈øhes of long-forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tran≈øactions, in hopes, that while the memory had lo≈øt the co-temporary circum≈øtances nece≈ø≈øary to explain them, they might by the breath of ≈øu≈øpicion and party be invigorated and matured into a crime: But I will ≈øay, that whatever be the motives for po≈øtponing it, the impul≈øe in the accu≈øed in ≈øoliciting an immediate trial, could be no other than the impul≈øe of innocence.</p>

                        <pb n="411" facs="unknown:027132_0419_0FD3527A8FFE3530"/>Sir, need I mention that ≈øuch a thing would be again≈øt his real and ≈øub≈øtantial intere≈øt; on this ground the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have placed the corner-≈øtone of this pro≈øecution. Common ≈øen≈øe decides that the eventual emolument of this officer can have no operation as a proof of guilt.</p>
                     <p>It is under≈øtood in the fir≈øt place, that he directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travened his own intere≈øt in cautioning the members of the Legi≈ølature when the Act was under con≈øideration. For laying it down as a principle that every man is mo≈øt ≈øtrongly inclined to make gain. He was either po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the≈øe certificates at the time the redemption law pa≈ø≈øed, and was of opinion that the law would warrant the con≈øtruction it received, or he had them not at the time, and thought the law would not bear that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction; now, if he was not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of them at the time, there was nothing to induce him to purcha≈øe them, as he had nothing to lo≈øe, and having given his opinion again≈øt them, he would have no motive in becoming po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of them, but a firm belief that the Act would warrant their redemption. If he was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of them, or if he was not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of them, but only intended to become ≈øo, he certainly would not have interpo≈øed his opinion at the time, as it might be expected that it would have produced an amendment to the ≈øixth ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act, by the introduction of ≈øome negative words. In the next place, it is not a difficult ta≈øk to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the appearance of truth in this ≈øort of argument from the real fallacy which gives it a direction again≈øt the officer now on trial; as it is to be under≈øtood that his eventual emolument is contended for, as the ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt proof of guilt; and this is certainly nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>fallacy</hi> of the≈øe tran≈øac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>I take it that in the event, intere≈øt or ≈øpeculation might re≈øult from either ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>If he corruptly put a deci≈øion upon the law, contrary to his real opinion, ≈øpeculation and intere≈øt was his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But I pre≈øume this emolument as we find it, would have followed the con≈øtruction it≈øelf, whether
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:027132_0420_0FD35201B06C58D8"/>
that con≈øtruction originated in an hone≈øt or di≈øhone≈øt motive. In the one ca≈øe, if he acted from a di≈øhone≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ≈øpeculation was his object, and he acted corruptly. In the other if he acted from an hone≈øt motive, ≈øpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was the effect. In the one ca≈øe he would ≈øpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late becau≈øe he had ≈øo decided the law, in the other he would ≈øo decide the law, becau≈øe he had predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ≈øpeculate; ≈øo that the argument of emolument is thus far as broad as it is long; but I apprehend on a clo≈øer in≈øpection it will be found again≈øt the pro≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in favor of innocence.</p>
                     <p>One fact is certain, that a profit has re≈øulted to the officer, it's mother was either hone≈øty or corruption, let it's parentage be decided by natural and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities; arguing from the effect to the cau≈øe. It is a fair rule of ju≈øtice and common ≈øen≈øe, that effects in the natural world ≈øhall be attributed to the mo≈øt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the mo≈øt natural cau≈øes, and in moral ca≈øes to the mo≈øt innocent cau≈øes. This emolument might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult from hone≈øt or di≈øhone≈øt cau≈øes: In the one ca≈øe, ≈øpeculation and emolument is the natural and legitimate effect of a con≈øtruction fairly and hone≈øtly put upon the Act. In the other, it is the corrupt pretext for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction incon≈øi≈øtent with the opinion of the party u≈øing it, and pro≈øecuted at once again≈øt honor and hone≈øty. So far are they from proving any thing, that their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of guilt mu≈øt be de≈øerted, unle≈øs ≈øome other ≈øtrong leading circum≈øtances can be brought forward to its ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Are there any others? No. So far from being able to bring forward any proof to convict the defendant, that all their arguments ≈øeem to militate again≈øt them≈øelves, and every circum≈øtance adduced by them, ≈øeems to favor the cau≈øe of innocence.</p>
                     <p>But the≈øe ob≈øervations might be ≈øpared, for how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakbly ab≈øurd is the argument of intere≈øt when placed in contact with ≈øome part of the te≈øtimony. It has been proved by te≈øtimony in profu≈øion, that this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer entertained the ≈øame opinion as to the a≈ø≈øumability ot the≈øe certificates, pending the fir≈øt loan of Congre≈øs,
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:027132_0421_0FD351D6F89B8808"/>
and long before our redemption law pa≈ø≈øed, as he does now.</p>
                     <p>Sir, can we believe that it was the hope of intere≈øt which ≈øupported this officer through tho≈øe ≈øcenes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, before the Act, which in fact created it, was in exi≈øtence? Behold then the gordian knot untied, for the argument of intere≈øt to have force mu≈øt take it for granted, that this officer, while he expre≈ø≈øed his opinion unequivocally eighteen months before the Act of April 1792, fore≈øaw neverthele≈øs, that ≈øuch a law would pa≈øs and afford him an occa≈øion of profit; nay, further it mu≈øt be taken for granted that his coincidence of opinion with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, and other officers of the ≈øtate and general, government ≈øo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, was a game of hypocri≈øy, which his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning induced him to play to conceal the mercenary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns which futurity was to gratify.</p>
                     <p>Behold then this rope of ≈øand, will this then, bind a victim to the altar? Can we believe that it was the hope of intere≈øt which ≈øupported this officer through tho≈øe ≈øcenes of deception before the Act had an exi≈øtence? For if intere≈øt was at that moment the embryo motive of his heart; if he could at that di≈øtance of time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øee the growing harve≈øt; while he prepared his ≈øickle to partake of it, in≈øtead of being arraigned as a culprit he ≈øhould be deified as a prophet.</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN a public point of view it is much to be regretted that charges of ≈øuch ≈øerious magnitude and importance, ≈øhould be thus built upon the ≈ølendere≈øt foundation.</p>
                     <p>It is ob≈øerved by ≈øome parliamentary ≈øpeakers, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (by <hi>Che≈øterfield,)</hi> that accu≈øations by impeachment are not ≈øo likely to be well founded as pre≈øentments by grand juries, for while in the one ca≈øe political objects and party ≈øpirit are mo≈øt apt to govern the accu≈øers, in the other they are generally governed by the di≈øpa≈ø≈øionate and impartial dictates of judgement operating on the weight of evidence. The hi≈øtory of impeachments in
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:027132_0422_0FD3527D4BA8BDC0"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> verifies this idea, and confirms its truth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Sir, in a more popular government this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance and its con≈øequences are the more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>It augurs not well of the public weal in a free coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where all officers depend directly or remotely on the voice of the people, to find them ≈øwept away from the port of confidence by the plea of groundle≈øs accu≈øation.</p>
                     <p>An impeachment is an engine of State as ≈øacred in its nature, as it is delicate in its con≈øtruction, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but imminent danger will warrant the u≈øe of it, the danger of falling a ≈øacrifice to popular indignation, which ≈øometimes even merit has provoked, or to party re≈øentment, of all the re≈øentments the mo≈øt implacable, will enhance the difficulty of procuring good officers, while it depreciates the incentives to virtuous actions in tho≈øe who are ≈øuch; while events are our preceptors, and have taught us, that we ≈øhould give to government only the ≈øame enlightened ≈øelf intere≈øt, which is granted to a good man in the ordinary concerns of human life.</p>
                     <p>Let then the ≈øword of the people be ≈øu≈øpended over the heads of their ≈øervants, but let not its de≈øcent be ≈øo accidental or precarious that like the ≈øword of <hi>Diony≈øius</hi> over the head of <hi>Damocles,</hi> it ≈øhould be as much the tormentor of the faithful, as the ≈øcourge of the unju≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the officer now on defence, di≈øcards all fear, he provokes no compa≈ø≈øion, he ≈øolicits no favor, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands but ju≈øtice. Here are facts on which he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges your con≈øciences, and defies your per≈øua≈øion. Winnow the chaff from the ≈øub≈øtance and the breath of heaven will di≈ø≈øipate it, ≈øo that it cannot be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To con≈øtrue a law is an act of the under≈øtanding, how wide is the difference between intelligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
                     <p>Let then the records of this tribunal, which his accu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had de≈øtined to emblazon his di≈øgrace, harmonize with the decrees of time, the great arbiter of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay, the decrees of that arbiter who is greater than time, and greater than heaven it≈øelf.</p>

                        <opener>
                           <salute>
                              <hi>Mr. Speaker, and
Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                           </salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>THIS ≈øubject is very complicated in its nature, and my attention hath been much attracted to other objects, and interrupted in the ≈øtudy of this ca≈øe: So ≈øingular were my circum≈øtances that at the fir≈øt appearance I might rea≈øonably claim an apology. A ≈øtranger invited to appear before this re≈øpectable body, nay, invited by the honorable Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> to lend his aid to defend their cau≈øe, and a≈ø≈øert their rights; my obligation was multiplied, when I con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the importance of the honorable Hou≈øe who made the application; con≈øcious as I have been, that I ≈øhall not be able to add to the rea≈øoning of the enlightened gentlemen (Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Rawle)</hi> who preceded me on the ≈øame ≈øide; perhaps prudence would have induced me to decline; but when called upon by ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable a Legi≈ølature, nay, a ≈øtranger ≈øolicited to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the cau≈øe of the public, and to redre≈øs their wrongs again≈øt one of their own citizens, loaded with the wealth and ≈øpoils of the commonwealth!</p>
                        <p>This con≈øideration commanded my exertions and magnanimity; the invitation was too flattering, I could not refu≈øe my aid; I will not wa≈øte your time in making prefatory ob≈øervations, but will endeavor to make the cau≈øe now before the honorable Senate very intelligible, and therefore will divide the ≈øubject into four points.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Has the defendant cau≈øed New-Loans to be ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were not ≈øub≈øcribable by law?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Has he cau≈øed New-Loans to be redeemed, when by law they were not redeemable, and thereby had broken and violated the Con≈øtitution of this commonwealth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Has he not appropriated to his own u≈øe New-Loan certificates which had been ≈øurrendered to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the holders, and ≈øhould have been cancelled?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="416" facs="unknown:027132_0424_0FD3525078DB8AC0"/>4. <hi>Has he not done all this knowingly and corruptly to make unju≈øt gain, betraying the intere≈øt repo≈øed in him, and traded on the public confidence?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The≈øe divi≈øions were nece≈ø≈øary before I begin to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer the objections which have been rai≈øed again≈øt the forms of the≈øe articles of impeachment; but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage can be taken of them, as to their form; they are not deficient either in ≈øub≈øtance or form‚Äîas to forms, two things are only nece≈ø≈øary, 1≈øt. They ≈øhould be clear to be under≈øtood. 2d. They ≈øhould be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent plea in di≈øcharge of another pro≈øecution for the ≈øame offence.</p>
                        <p>To make objections to mere forms, the reliques of antient times, I ≈øay, times of darkne≈øs and ignorance, is like the ob≈øervation re≈øpecting the nets and the traps in which he had been caught: The articles are ≈øufficiently definite, and an≈øwer all the purpo≈øes of ju≈øtice in trials by impeachment. Mere forms are never attended to in ≈øuch ca≈øes.</p>
                        <p>Impeachments ≈øhould be ≈øo worded, as to an≈øwer two purpo≈øes, 1≈øt. They ≈øhould be definite. 2d. They ought to be ≈øub≈øtantial as to form: The articles under con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration are ≈øufficiently <hi>definite</hi> and ≈øub≈øtantial, to an≈øwer the≈øe two purpo≈øes.</p>
                        <p>We have been told that the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives adopted this as a mode of <hi>per≈øecuting,</hi> rather than <hi>pro≈øecuting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That honorable body does not wi≈øh to per≈øecute, the bu≈øine≈øs of the Legi≈ølature is primarily the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the innocent; the protection of the innocent is of greater importance than the puni≈øhment of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet it is of ≈øome importance to the community when a public defaulter is puni≈øhed.</p>
                        <p>A man who is clearly charged with ≈øuch crimes, it is not unimportant to the public to know how he can acquit him≈øelf, and how he hath di≈øcharged his tru≈øt; although it is irritating to any Legi≈ølature to pro≈øecute ≈øuch an offender as the pre≈øent defendant.</p>
                        <p>If zeal in the coun≈øel who have appeared for the
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:027132_0425_0FD3525EBA97C568"/>
Comptroller-General, had been an evidence of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the defendant ought to be acquitted; never had any defendant more brilliant di≈øplay of rhetoric, or apparition of rea≈øon, to prevent his being found guilty, than the Comptroller has had on this pre≈øent trial.</p>
                        <p>In my arguments I will con≈øider two things, to wit, the law and the te≈øtimony; in the way that I have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ≈øubject, the different con≈øtructions of the Acts of A≈ø≈øembly as they ≈øeem to favour or make again≈øt the the defendant ≈øhall be attended to. The con≈øtruction of the Act of 1786 relative the the i≈ø≈øuing of New-Loans is perhaps doubtful, and unimportant; if the defendant's con≈øtruction is the true one, what will be the i≈ø≈øue? But it will be very material if our con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the right one, as guilt is charged home and fixt on him; if his con≈øtruction is right, it by no means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits him; and it will not ultimately determine the ca≈øe.</p>
                        <p>Previou≈øly to my entering further into this bu≈øine≈øs, I will con≈øider the cau≈øes and motives which produced the Acts. I will not read them, they have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy repeated, no per≈øon can be better acquainted with them than the Speaker; it will not be controverted that the Act of 1785 was enacted as a temporary provi≈øion for the payment of intere≈øts, the Act of 1786 was pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed on the failure of the Act of 1785 for the ≈øame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons and had the ≈øame general object in view, and brought the Act of 1785 into execution.</p>
                        <p>I can ≈øee no rea≈øon why the Legi≈ølature in 1786 ≈øhould make that perpetual, which in 1785 was temporary. There is neither rea≈øon nor equity for it; if equity did not require it, there was no rea≈øon to grant it. This is pro≈øtrating the principles of ju≈øtice; the Legi≈ølature would not unnece≈ø≈øarily encrea≈øe its own burthen.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman's rea≈øoning, who opened the defence is ≈øomewhat ≈øingular; he ≈øays it became "an equitable claim," ≈øo far I agree with the Gentleman. But, Sir, will the gentleman go on, and ≈øay, that the contract was not as great to the inhabitants of all the other States who have been creditors of the Union, more equity
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:027132_0426_0FD3527FFA1D8488"/>
was not due to the creditors citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> than to the creditor citizens of other States; if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes are admitted, the con≈øequences can't be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Equity is not partial and would embrace the whole, this is clear rea≈øoning, he cannot deny it.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1786 did not, at all events, pledge the public faith for the redemption of tho≈øe certificates in money; if then it is viewed in this light, why did the State receive the Continental certificates and give their own certificates in lieu of them? The object of the Legi≈ølature was to make a ≈øub≈øtitute. If <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> did not take the certificates, and was to pay, ≈øhe might do it at her lo≈øs, as ≈øhe could have no claim on Congre≈øs. This is confirmed from general opinion, and their ≈øub≈øequent views.</p>
                        <p>If the Trea≈øurer had paid off the Continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates they could not i≈ø≈øue the New-Loans; and for this purpo≈øe <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> cho≈øe to take in the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates and i≈ø≈øue new ones, ≈øo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth might at her option be the creditor of the Union, or debtor to her own citizens, by returning them to the original holders; in the mean time to ≈øettle and pay the intere≈øt was the intention of the Legi≈ølature: It is manife≈øt, and confirmed by the opinion of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen conver≈øant in the tran≈øactions of the A≈ø≈øembly, and by the public Acts.</p>
                        <p>One circum≈øtance of great importance is to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; that is, the margin of the New-Loans and the reference to the Continental certificates; this provides how the debts were to be ≈øecured, and the memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums made in the ≈øame.‚Äî<hi>(Here he read a New-Loan certificate.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This margin was of no con≈øequence unle≈øs they wi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return the New-Loans. We here look for the intention of the Legi≈ølature, and not for the negligence of the executive officer. Was it of con≈øequence to pay in ca≈øh at all events, full intere≈øt on depreciated principal? this was not ≈øufficient for it might have been ≈øettled at the i≈ø≈øuing, why not at the time reduce the
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:027132_0427_0FD35281440D6638"/>
certificate and give the whole amount when reduced by the ≈øcale. If a purcha≈øe, it was worth ju≈øt as much as the value of the certificate's nominal amount of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intere≈øt.</p>
                        <p>Another rea≈øon and a better one than the con≈øtruction of the law, is the intention of the Legi≈ølature,</p>
                        <p>The preamble of the Act of March 27 1789, calls it a temporary provi≈øion, look into the preamble of that Act, is a Legi≈ølative con≈øtruction important, relying on the margin and memorandum in it, does all this weigh nothing?</p>
                        <p>Was it maneuvre in the Legi≈ølature? it is too di≈øre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful, too indelicate to ≈øuppo≈øe, out of the whole I find that the Act of 86 took the certificates into the cu≈øtody of the ≈øtate and that they were only to pay the intere≈øt; if otherwi≈øe they would have found a fund to provide for the payment of the principal, they knew at that time the funds were precariou≈øly in their hands, if ≈øo, it would perhaps be wrong to contend that nothing more was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than a re-exchange by the Act of 1786. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law of 1789 <hi>repealed nothing;</hi> but carried the Act of 1786 into effect.</p>
                        <p>The con≈øtruction of the law of 1786 is much more certain and important. If we chu≈øe to take back our certificate at any time, we ≈øhall have a right ≈øo to do, to do away the≈øe they enacted the repealing law of 1789. The que≈øtion now is not whether the law is right or wrong, but what was the <hi>intention</hi> of the Legi≈ølature. If the law was right, it does away mo≈øt of the difficulty, the Act of 89 is an Act of much importance, of clear and certain con≈øtruction, let us enquire what was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legi≈ølature, not whether it was con≈øtitutional or not, the law is right or wrong only as the Legi≈ølature intended. After we ≈øhall di≈øcover the intention we'll enquire if open under the Con≈øtitution, and whether obligatory as a law is another que≈øtion.</p>
                        <p>The con≈øtruction of the defendant is ≈øo contradictory, ≈øo di≈øtorted, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> language can hardly find a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive idea to corre≈øpond with it, he hardly knows
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:027132_0428_0FD351DC8B741548"/>
what an≈øwer to make, every thing he advances is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppo≈øite to what is mentioned in the Act, ≈øo ob≈øtinate is every part of it in favour of the pro≈øecution; and he is obliged to run counter to every expre≈ø≈øion in the law; if the Act of 1789 de≈øigned only to <hi>unfund the debt,</hi> it is equally unju≈øt with de≈øtroying it, it is different not in principle but in degree. If it is ≈øo, for what rea≈øon: It is alledged they could not de≈øtroy the claim, is it not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a breach of contract to unfund as to de≈øtroy it, truly equal; why unfund the <hi>principal</hi> that was never funded if the rea≈øoning of the Gentlemen be right, they ≈øhould have followed wherever it led them; was it not equally ≈øo to ≈øubtract the fund? What did the law of 89 do? They ≈øay it had no effect, it neither de≈øtroyed nor anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated the operations of the former Acts, yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant mu≈øt admit that the ≈øtate committed a fraud in unfunding the debt, the provi≈øion was repealed, yet they ≈øay it was altogether compatible with the law of 1786.</p>
                        <p>If the alienation of the funds to the General Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been the rea≈øon, was not that ≈øurrender to be perpetual? Did they expect a return of the funds? If they were to pay the intere≈øt, why not the principal? Where were the funds? Where was the debt? It either proves too much, or it proves nothing at all; it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces both principal and intere≈øt, or only principal, and excludes the intere≈øt. If this is not broad enough for them, con≈øider only for a moment the intention of the Legi≈ølature in pa≈ø≈øing the Act.</p>
                        <p>The declaration in the Act of 1789, proves they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in 1786 to make a temporary provi≈øion.</p>
                        <p>Could the Legi≈ølature labour a preamble declaring their intention, if they did not mean to carry that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention into effect?</p>
                        <p>The Legi≈ølature expre≈øly ≈øays, the payment of the ≈øaid debts ought to be from the Trea≈øury of the United States, and not from <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> A con≈øtruction in the Act of 1786, to aboli≈øh the ≈øame Act, if there is no rea≈øon for doing away the Act of 1786, why labour
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:027132_0429_0FD351DF9B8E6D98"/>
three or four pages; to do what they did not intend to do.</p>
                        <p>Yet if the preamble is read, no man will doubt that they did intend to repeal the law, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the right to do ≈øo; look further into it, you'll find the the words <hi>"certificates" "rea≈øonable,"</hi> &amp;c. there.</p>
                        <p>In fine, that the debts, not intere≈øt, is to be paid by Congre≈øs; there is another con≈øtruction of the Act of 1789, almo≈øt too ingenuous to be admitted and not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily under≈øtood, operating not on what is done under the Act.</p>
                        <p>In the ca≈øe of the North-Carolina certificates there was no Act to repeal, as the certificates had i≈ø≈øued frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently.</p>
                        <p>It is a contradiction in rea≈øoning and almo≈øt in terms, do they provide that the principal ≈øhall be paid by the State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania?</hi> Perhaps the Gentlemen would have found no Act to de≈øtroy, when they were not i≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Act. This long Act of 1789 was not made for nothing, the Act of 1786 was completed in 1788. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legi≈ølature in repealing the Act, meant to knock away the foundation on which they ≈øtood.</p>
                        <p>Here the con≈øtruction is too artificial to be credible, the defence is at war with it≈øelf. Fir≈øt, that it did ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the certificates, 2dly, It did not operate. This is an invariable rule of all laws, that all parts ≈øhould be con≈øtrued ≈øo as to ≈øtand and no part peri≈øh.</p>
                        <p>The defendant's con≈øtruction is too fine ≈øpun to be ≈øtrong, it breaks a≈øunder, by another it is held differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ≈øtill, it is ≈øo various that there ari≈øe three contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory modes, but truth is ≈øimple and uniform, there are various accounts, all ≈øimple and con≈øi≈øtent, if the≈øe are true, they are all the creatures of fancy; they could not repeal the fir≈øt and ≈øecond ≈øections of that Act, and therefore could not provide for the payment<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the≈øe are invi≈øible entities of rea≈øoning, we need a micro≈øcope to aid our intellectual optics to ≈øee them. The A≈ø≈øembly could not intend what they could not under≈øtand, where is the law which directs payment? It proves the rever≈øe
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:027132_0430_0FD35282E2458770"/>
of what was intended, this is the rea≈øoning the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is driven to, if the law proves it, they will avail them≈øelves of it, for my part I can't think it was the intention of the Legi≈ølature, the majority never ≈øpun thus finely this creature of metaphy≈øics by the Act of 1789.</p>
                        <p>Can a man have an intention to do what he does not under≈øtand? the exchange being optional does not ≈øerve the defendant, it conforms to our ≈øtatement. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to re-exchange is no objection to our con≈øtruction, <hi>"Many</hi> may be de≈øirous," it is therefore true, that it is optional with the holders, it is therefore con≈øi≈øtent with my explanation, and perfectly con≈øi≈øtent in it≈øelf. Take the whole amount together, it is equity, it is ju≈øtice. We make our option, which is no more than this; come and take your original certificates, we were never bound to pay you in ca≈øh, you may come and take them if you plea≈øe; it was not nece≈ø≈øary to make a law to compel them to take their certificates: It was only this, that if they did not come the obligation on the part of the commonwealth was done away, we are not obliged to pay ca≈øh, we will not pay ca≈øh, we will perform our contract, you may have your certificates, they were never demandable in ca≈øh, they were never a claim for ca≈øh, they were a claim for the original certificates for which they were exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are no claim again≈øt the government.</p>
                        <p>That ≈øub≈øequent laws called them a claim it is true. They were a claim for certificates, the defendant's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to ≈øhew a law to ju≈øtify him; but this rea≈øoning proves there is none, the fir≈øt ≈øection did not provide or payment, and the ≈øub≈øequent ones were repealed. That the≈øe New-Loans were contemplated as claims or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts is undoubtedly true, if we would deny this, we ≈øhould commit an outrage again≈øt common ≈øen≈øe; this is corroborated by the maxim, that we are not to create a being to be de≈øtroyed, they knew ≈øuch po≈øitions were not ≈øupportable: Much rea≈øoning and paper might have been ≈øpared: If our con≈øtruction is the right one, they were a claim for the original certificates; one of the
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:027132_0431_0FD35285B06A0B00"/>
Gentlemen ≈øays, that the providing to pay in certificates is a confe≈ø≈øion that they were a claim for ca≈øh; they were a claim, that claim was merely for re-exchange; but not for ca≈øh.</p>
                        <p>The provi≈øion for exchange is no acknowledgment of debt. Another rea≈øon mu≈øt meet us very forcibly, that the law of 1789 is void, as being again≈øt the con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, and impairing the validity of contracts; it is not ≈øo, if our con≈øtruction of the law of 1786 is right.</p>
                        <p>But let us ≈øuppo≈øe for a moment (being willing to put it in every po≈ø≈øible point of view) that we are wrong, that it was an engagement at all events to pay ca≈øh, this is taking the highe≈øt po≈ø≈øible ground contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean what is contended for on the other ≈øide, for it appears a little ≈øingular, that the con≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the United States ≈øhould herein impair the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of contracts. If the Act of 1786 had made an ab≈øolute debt, it's repeal would not be contrary to the con≈øtitution, the ≈øection only means that a ≈øtate ≈øhould not e≈øtabli≈øh iniquity by law.</p>
                        <p>It was a mere act of favour by the State, or el≈øe it might be under≈øtood that the ≈øtate made laws, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into effect the breach of contracts. Take your New-Loans for the Continental certificates. If it means more than this, it mu≈øt be that the very letter and terms of the contract ≈øhould be carried into effect; if ≈øo, a State could not e≈øtabli≈øh a chancery juri≈ødiction, which ≈øays, penalties ≈øhall not always be exacted.</p>
                        <p>Nor ≈øtatutes of limitations, a thou≈øand pounds pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on demand, is as ju≈øtly due after four years as before; the four years expire, and the contract is not performed; yet it is a bar pleadable and no inju≈øtice.</p>
                        <p>Let us advert to the ≈øtatutes again≈øt u≈øury, giving damages in≈øtead of compelling a ≈øpecific performance, and a contract to pay 12 per cent. if it were not for the law would be a contract; the law ≈øays it ≈øhall be no contract. Is this impairing the obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract?
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:027132_0432_0FD351E0BB5B34A8"/>
this compels a per≈øon to receive what he did not contract for; are the≈øe again≈øt the con≈øtitution of the United States? where ju≈øtice is done the contract is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered.</p>
                        <p>If the con≈øtruction of the law mu≈øt be literal, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damages for ≈øpecific articles, ≈øuch as to deliver lands in≈øtead of ca≈øh, mu≈øt al≈øo be a breach of contract: the ≈øpecific article ≈øhould be given, the Act of 1789 now under con≈øideration, ≈øays take your certificates in≈øtead of ca≈øh; the≈øe ob≈øervations are all unnece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe they go on the foundation that all New-Loans are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in ca≈øh.</p>
                        <p>But to give the Gentlemen every thing they want, admit for a moment that we're wrong, this contract is unfair, ≈øuppo≈øe it is impaired, another que≈øtion ari≈øes, who is to ≈øay it is impairing the contract, where is the proper judicature? Who is to be the arbiter between the State and her own citizens? This is a ≈øerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration; <hi>Monte≈øque, Locke</hi> and other writers will oppo≈øe them here, the power of making laws is the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the State, is there a power ≈øuperior to the ≈øupreme power? If the judges have this power, it follows that the ≈øupreme power is controlled by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior power. If courts cannot, the Senate cannot, both as a court and a part only of the Legi≈ølature.</p>
                        <p>This is a very important que≈øtion, there ≈øhould be ≈øome important judiciary, it is a complex que≈øtion, the con≈øtitution is ≈øilent on the ≈øubject. We mu≈øt arrive at ≈øome period, let us proceed to the end of the chain, another Legi≈ølature to judge the former, another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the latter, and ≈øo on to infinity.</p>
                        <p>Can the Senate rejudge it, being only one branch? the Legi≈ølature of the State has the ≈øupreme power, can any individual enjoy it? ≈øhall we leave it to a jury to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine? they judge of facts, this is uncertainty, and contradiction, ≈øhall every petty officer arraign his ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? ≈øhall any man vainly imagine that he is wi≈øer than his repre≈øentatives? language of this kind hath been held,
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:027132_0433_0FD352873A06C450"/>
nay, hath been prati≈øed. This is ri≈øing again≈øt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of ≈øociety.</p>
                        <p>If he decided wrong, he decided at his peril; here it is contended is the check, the judiciary are to judge; but this brings us back again, the judiciary in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance would ≈øit above the Legi≈ølature, the people only are ≈øuperior to the Legi≈ølature, the Legi≈ølature is amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their repre≈øentative capacity to the people, but ≈øhall a jury judge? Do juries repre≈øent the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? They are not the Repre≈øentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their office is to judge of facts and evidence, not to judge of the con≈øtitutionality of laws. If they are to be the ultimate criterion, it is void to day, becau≈øe a jury ≈øaid ≈øo, it will be in force to-morrow, if a jury ≈øhall ≈øay ≈øo.</p>
                        <p>There is a ≈øufficient check on the Repre≈øentatives, it is this, they are amenable to their con≈øtituents, their ≈øe≈ø≈øions being only temporary, their doings may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed until then it is a law; they may repeal a law orderly by ≈øub≈øequent repre≈øentations‚ÄîNo power on earth can exi≈øt ≈øuperior to the Legi≈ølature of the State, except what exi≈øts in the People, it does not exi≈øt in the Judiciary, not in the Senate, nor in Juries. They will, if they di≈øapprove, choo≈øe others who will repeal obnoxious laws. If they mi≈ø-judge, they are corrupt; they will again choo≈øe others; the power is le≈øs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here, if they refu≈øe, the People may recur to their original ≈øtate, di≈ø≈øolve the ≈øocial compact, untie the knot, and redre≈øs every mi≈øtake. Here is an evil but a le≈øs one; this free agency in man, this torpid debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this <hi>"vis inertiae;"</hi> the former is the fever, the latter the death of patrioti≈øm.</p>
                        <p>I have been the more particular in this in≈øtance, as there are two important points to be con≈øidered, that if the≈øe certificates were not ≈øub≈øcribable, they were not redeemable, although the rever≈øe of the po≈øition is not true; if the ≈øervant is to judge of what his ma≈øter does, then the defendant is to adjudicate between the State and the holders, there is no ≈øituation ≈øo unfit at his to
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:027132_0434_0FD351E2439F8550"/>
decide; the Comptroller a≈ø≈øumes a right to adjudicate, he buys up all the New-Loans, places him≈øelf in the ≈øhoes of one of the parties, and then determines he is to be paid; this is the ground on which this judge ≈øtood on this que≈øtion between the State and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>But ≈øtill di≈øpo≈øed to ≈øuppo≈øe every thing credible; let them ≈øuppo≈øe us ≈øtill wrong; there are yet ample grounds for the conviction of the defendant, if they ≈øtill exi≈øted in the form of debts, they were not ≈øub≈øcribable debts and payable in ca≈øh, it was ≈øaid that the≈øe were, by virtue of the Act of Congre≈øs, ≈øub≈øcribable; ≈øituated as the≈øe certificates were, it was out of the power of Congre≈øs to take them, and to charge <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> with their amount in adju≈øting the ≈øettlement between the United and Individual States: The provi≈øion was only for ≈øuch as the State acknowledged to be debts payable in ca≈øh.</p>
                        <p>They were only acknowledgments of debt. The Secretary of the Trea≈øury ≈øo under≈øtood them, we will go on broader ground than this, and ≈øay, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pay ≈øuch, it would be completely out of their power. The State held the Continental certificates; Congre≈øs could not ≈øay, we will not pay the State, but pay the holders of New-Loans. The Act of 1789 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the di≈ø≈øent of the State.</p>
                        <p>It is true <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> owes <hi>A.</hi> becau≈øe he holds New-Loan certificates, and the Union owes <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øhe holds original certificates. It will not be contended that Congre≈øs de≈øigned to pay both; then could Congre≈øs pay the holders of New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates without the con≈øent of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and pay the State too?</p>
                        <p>The ≈øub≈øcribing New-Loans implies they were not to be exchanged, and makes the State a creditor by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of having the Continental, without the con≈øent of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> Congre≈øs could not a≈ø≈øume the New-Loans and refu≈øe the payment of the Continental.</p>
                        <p>Congre≈øs mu≈øt previou≈øly authori≈øe a power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the New-Loans to be a debt, before they could
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:027132_0435_0FD351E458DB1538"/>
a≈ø≈øume them. This would amount, to decide a ca≈øe between a State and her own citizens.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme Court refu≈øed to decide it. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Trea≈øury never would decide this, if it was to be decided by its nature, none are competent but the people, who might recur to original principles.</p>
                        <p>Congre≈øs could therefore make no ≈øuch provi≈øion, if this is true, the New-Loan certificates were not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable to the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I have been willing to de≈øcend, ≈øtep by ≈øtep, from that ground on which the pro≈øecution re≈øted, to prove the charge again≈øt the Comp. Gen. is well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his defence not maintainable. I will de≈øcend one ≈øtep lower, and admit that the New-Loans are a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumable, yet the defendant is guilty in the true ≈øen≈øe of the articles of impeachment, and upon every principle of ju≈øtice, although no gentleman will agree that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon had a right to decide on their a≈ø≈øumability.</p>
                        <p>It was the intere≈øt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> that the Act of 1789 ≈øhould be complied with. They viewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves bound to pay 20<hi>≈ø.</hi> in the pound. This bu≈øine≈øs was committed to the Comptroller-General, and he had the care of making the bargain. Is it ju≈øt in him to take mea≈øures to defeat this tru≈øt? It was his bu≈øine≈øs to promote it; he oppo≈øed it.</p>
                        <p>Has he not taken every dollar from the Trea≈øury, which he has put into his pocket, and this after the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was completed? She committed the management of this tran≈øaction to her agent, the holders of New-Loans were to apply to him for re-exchanges, he was the agent, nay, call it more, the commonwealth made the offer, and appointed Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the re-exchange. Is this faithfulne≈øs in an agent? Did he fulfil his tru≈øt? Does not this look like perfidy? Did he take pains to procure exchanges? When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons offered to exchange and ≈øurrender, did he not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that exchange? Did he not after they were lodged in his hand as agent, and Comptroller-General, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:027132_0436_0FD3528C9C7074E0"/>
and put them as Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> into his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket? And if they had been ≈øo exchanged, could they have been redeemed? After the parties had agreed to take the offer of the State from this officer entru≈øted to make ≈øuch bargain, and by which the State would gain the difference in the exchange; he clearly had no equity to put this difference into his own pocket. After the parties had con≈øented to carry the exchange into effect, he refu≈øed to deliver the Continental certificates, he ≈øent a line offering to take and buy them him≈øelf; nay, he actually purcha≈øed them, after which he ≈øub≈øcribed them to the loan of the United States, and procured their redemption at the State-Trea≈øury; ≈øo that all con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is out of the que≈øtion.</p>
                        <p>I a≈øk, if guilt is not irre≈øi≈øtably proved on Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon?</hi> Perhaps much le≈øs than this would be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Whenever a per≈øon was willing to ≈øell a certificate, every ≈øuch per≈øon willing to exchange his property, but was prevented by Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> even in the ≈øtreets, by which exchange it would be the property of the State, but had been not only put into the pocket of the Comptroller, but taken out of the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a little ≈øingular that the ground on which the defendant re≈øts his defence, is by doing equity in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to law, and being anxious to defeat the views of the Legi≈ølature, that equity ≈øhould be done to the holders of New-Loans, by procuring for them 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. per pound; in≈øtead of this equity, we find Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> cho≈øe to make a bargain, and to take this equity from them, and the means of doing it in like manner is wre≈øted from them, le≈øt the State ≈øhould take it. This is cru≈øhing equity to death; this aggravates the charges, to deprive them of 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. in the pound, law or no law. If Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> knew it, it was unju≈øt, he defrauded the State or the party; where he took this equity from the State, he defrauded the public, when from the holders he defrauded the holders. Where then is this equity?</p>

                     <p>That he cau≈øed New-Loans to be redeemed, that he certified them to be ≈øo, and that that certificate was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, officially, will not be controverted. That this fi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal arrangement by his certifications, had the effect of
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:027132_0439_0FD3529358838728"/>
drawing the money out of the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> will not be denied.</p>
                     <p>The que≈øtion is, Whether there was, or was not a law:</p>
                     <p>The Act of the 10th April 1792, is much relied on, to ju≈øtify him. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> read a part of that Act.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed that the ≈øecond ≈øection is not exten≈øive enough to cover New-Loans, and for the payment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and di≈øcharge of all the certificates of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed that intere≈øt is not payable on New-Loans, as it is conceded that this expre≈ø≈øion does not cover New-Loans, and as no intere≈øt was payable on them, it is contended that in a part of the 6th ≈øection they are included, a≈ø≈øuming the New-Loans as ≈øub≈øcribable, New-Loans are not mentioned, and yet they are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable, and if ≈øub≈øcribable, they mu≈øt be redeemable, becau≈øe ≈øub≈øcribable certificates are to be paid; but all the ≈øtate and continental officers agree they are not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable, and con≈øequently not redeemable. (He then read the 6th ≈øection). "The holder of a certificate or certificates, <hi>≈øub≈øcribable</hi> to the ≈øub≈øcription," &amp;c. If they are not ≈øub≈øcribable, it cannot be within the purview of this act, it is well under≈øtood from the complexion of the law, that whatever is not ≈øub≈øcribable cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, and whatever is not ≈øub≈øcribable nor redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, cannot be included in this ≈øection. Whatever might have once been the opinion of the Comptroller-General, it is evident it never was the opinion of the law officers of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> nor of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General of the United States. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> wanted to lay his hands on the letter of Mr. <hi>Randolph,</hi> page 81-2, but could not find it) and he added, We need not recur to the unanimous opinion of the officers, the laws are here, the Senate under≈øtand them, and will judge; that paper ought to have been here; if the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates are not redeemable, then all the rea≈øoning of the gentlemen will fall to the ground, becau≈øe they are not ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan opened by Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Admit that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable, ≈øtill
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:027132_0440_0FD3529526879A08"/>
they are not redeemable. The gentleman who opened the defence, agreed that the fund had not been provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the redemption of New-Loans by the 6th ≈øection, but by the 2d. (Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ob≈øerved, The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did not attend to my ≈øtatement. The ≈øixth ≈øection is more exten≈øive than the ≈øecond. The fund by the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock, was not to cover New-Loans.)</p>
                     <p>Taking this to be true, the object of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is not obtained, and it is clear no New-Loans are redeemable; but recour≈øe mu≈øt be had to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fund, nay, the fund for claims and improvements they ≈øay, covers it; the defendant's warrant and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, prove the contrary; the≈øe are raw troops pre≈ø≈øed into his ≈øervice; this is a ≈øtrange departure of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General's plan of defence; his coun≈øel ≈øhift their ground. The Comptroller-General committed the fact, and retained coun≈øel to find other laws for it, but tho≈øe laws are confe≈ø≈øed to be of no u≈øe. It is ≈øaid New-Loan certificates were a debt by the Act of 1786. Could the Act of 1792 make them more than a debt? But the Comptroller being determined to get a fund to draw his money from, and finding he could not ≈øucceed in drawing his ca≈øh by virtue of that law of 1792, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion, and his coun≈øel procured him another fund. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> ≈øaid, If I am not right, they will put me right. Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>You're wrong this long time, but go on.)</hi> The funds for claims and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements ≈øhould be made u≈øe of; this was done by the Act of 1791. This is too remote for di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, fixed by its hi≈øtory rai≈øed per Act of 1789, and limited to ¬£. 10,000 for claims and improvements. <hi>(Here Mr. Bradford interrupted Mr. Dexter, and ≈øaid, The Act of April 7th, 1791, created the fund, and did not limit it.)</hi> This fund without any particular appropriation only to provide for claims and improvements, and without any provi≈øion for minute occa≈øions or any occurrence which may happen during the rece≈øs of the Legi≈ølature; why is this called up? it is a confe≈ø≈øion of di≈øtru≈øt, it is peeping out of the window.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="433" facs="unknown:027132_0441_0FD3529684276A60"/>Let us take the u≈øele≈øs Act of 1792 out of the que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Act of 1786 and 1791 are ≈øufficient for the defendant.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loans are ≈øaid to be a claim, therefore it is ≈øaid to be within the act of 7th April 1791, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciated debt equally within it? There are no debts but are claims, if they exi≈øted at the time of creating the fund, they are all included in the fund for claims and improvements. The≈øe were for objects too various and minute for legi≈ølation: this tran≈øaction mu≈øt be uncon≈øtitutional; if thus general, why not a little zeal in the defendant? By the law of 1789 the defendant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired wealth, and gained money.</p>
                     <p>It is argued that the act of 1789, ≈øtopped intere≈øt on New-Loans, notwith≈øtanding, by this means the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General got intere≈øt. The gentlemen will not contend, that New-Loans are one of the objects.</p>
                     <p>When any money was drawn out of the Trea≈øury, the fund was particularly mentioned, that ≈øuch a warrant or claim was payable out of ≈øuch or ≈øuch a fund; therefore it e≈øpecially behoves the defendant to ≈øhew out of what fund, the money was to be drawn to ≈øatisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. This act goes to ≈øhew what ≈øhall be paid out of the claim found by the act of April 7th 1791. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral clau≈øe covers all warrants hereafter to be drawn by virtue of any law or laws, &amp;c. Was this a claim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? It is clear there was no appropriation; con≈øequently the Con≈øtitution was broken. This ≈øweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clau≈øe (6th ≈øection) cannot cover ≈øo important a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: By the law of 1786, the New-Loans are a debt in ≈øome ≈øhape or other; by the law of 1789, they were made no longer payable in ca≈øh, it was agreed <hi>that the intere≈øt was not to be paid in ca≈øh;</hi> the principal was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver funded. This is a blind general clau≈øe, altogether incapable of altering the conditions of the New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>That the principal and intere≈øt of the New-Loans ≈øhould be paid, but ≈øtill I mi≈øunder≈øtand them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or they are mi≈øtaken, in ≈øaying that the Act of 1786 created a debt. The intere≈øt is not funded by the law of 1789.
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:027132_0442_0FD35216D3F7BD78"/>
If an appropriation to pay by the law of 1789, why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce it by the Act of 1792? If the Act of April 1791 provides for it, and a fund competent for its di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, why is the Act of 1792 ≈øought for to make it more than a debt? This is calling in a law, which gives it no additional ≈øtrength, their own con≈øciou≈øne≈øs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays their faithfulne≈øs to their client, they are convinced that their proof is not ≈øufficient to ≈øupport them; this is manife≈øt, though not expre≈ø≈øed by them, it would be prudent in them to clo≈øe the door of ≈øecrecy on this di≈øtru≈øt. Nothing can be done by the law of 1792 if they are right in their con≈øtruction of the Acts of 1786 or 1789.</p>
                     <p>It will not be contended that the Act of 1792 made the New-Loans a debt. If the law of 1792 is u≈øele≈øs, take it out of the que≈øtion; having taken it out, you apply for payment by the law of 1791.</p>
                     <p>If right in this rea≈øoning, it will be admitted there was no fund, and con≈øequently no appropriation; and therefore the ≈øecond charge is fully proved, and the Con≈øtitution of the commonwealth was broken by the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>That there was an appropriation by the law of 1792, for the redemption of debts, is evident from the ≈øecond ≈øection. What is the Comptroller-General's language? He ≈øays, although the Legi≈ølature ≈øay by the Act of 1789 that the≈øe certificates are no debts, yet he ≈øays, <hi>A. B. C.</hi> are creditors of the commonwealth by the Act of 1792. I know the ≈øtate owes the≈øe people, I will determine, I will take the money, I will pay it to the holders of New-Loans, I will go further, I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe this equitable claim my≈øelf, having the power, although the agent of the government, I will purcha≈øe it from the holders by virtue of my official authority, and retain the money by virtue of the Act of 1792.</p>
                     <p>Is this the language of a faithful agent? On what principles of equity is this ju≈øtified? Is this ju≈øtice to the New-Loan holders? I will no longer detain you on this ≈øecond divi≈øion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="435" facs="unknown:027132_0443_0FD35219257E2500"/>I am now come to the third general que≈øtion, that is, <hi>Has he not appropriated to his own u≈øe, New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates which had been ≈øurrendered to the commonwealth by the holders; and ≈øhould have been cancelled?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Comptroller-General, as tru≈øtee of the commonwealth, had done this, will not be doubted; our evidence however on this point is not now as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as it may be, we expect the te≈øtimony of <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> but there are other evidences, <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Oldden,</hi> by who≈øe te≈øtimony the ≈øame imputation is fixed on the conduct of the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>The te≈øtimony of both are ≈øimilar, both applied to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to exchange, both brought the New-Loan certificates to be exchanged, one of them filled up a blank exchange, they manife≈øted their con≈øent to re-exchange, no expectation ever to receive back their New-Loans again, this is a ≈øtrong evidence of their intention to re-exchange, the≈øe were by all principles of ju≈øtice ≈øurrendered to the commonwealth, and ought to have been cancelled; the property was ≈øhifted from the holders to the State, for the expre≈øs purpo≈øe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing de≈øtroyed, if he ≈øhould have delivered the certificates to the original holders, it would be perfidy in the agent.</p>
                     <p>We are told with confidence, that "the charge is a mill-≈øtone, the evidence as light as a feather." They are much mi≈øtaken in the merits of this controver≈øy; the property was not in the original holders as ≈øoon as the proprietor reached it to the agent of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the ≈øame was completely ≈øhifted from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal holders, not a doubt can remain of their being liable for the holder's debts.</p>
                     <p>It will not be contended that if two parties agree to exchange commodities, and they agree on all the terms, the bargain is completed. One ≈øays, here, take my goods, I will call to-morrow and receive my articles. The property is ≈øhifted. If the≈øe general principles are e≈øtabli≈øhed and admitted, if the ca≈øe before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate be an exception to ≈øuch general principles, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their duty to ≈øhew it. This is not a bold a≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:027132_0444_0FD35297D0D7BCB0"/>
but authority which is acquie≈øced in; the agent was ready, the holder was ready, the party brought the certificates to the agent, the exchange was propo≈øed to the Comptroller, the agent had po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, it was in the cu≈øtody of the commonwealth, an expre≈øs agreement, "give me the original certificates"‚Äînay, more, the exchange is made in writing. I will call to-morrow or when you can look up the original certificates. If this was not a contract for New-Loan certificates, the government had no original right to i≈ø≈øue them.</p>
                     <p>The holder had a claim on the State for the amount of his certificates, and no dealer in the market would doubt, but he had parted with his property.</p>
                     <p>What right, then, had the Comptroller General to make propo≈øals for certificates thus depo≈øited and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of; and to appropriate them to his own u≈øe? The fact is, there was delay. The Senate will judge of the intention of the officer by the application: The certificates being thus depo≈øited, the bargain was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted; he purcha≈øed them from men who held the property, not the property of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> but the property of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> and to give a rea≈øon why he did ≈øo, he produces neither rea≈øon nor authority for his acting in this manner.</p>
                     <p>But there is another ca≈øe ≈øtill ≈øtronger than that of <hi>Oldden's</hi> or <hi>Biddle's;</hi> and that is the certificate of <hi>Blair M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true the matter is not per≈øpicuous enough, but it is true enough to ≈øatisfy certain facts, to wit:</p>
                     <p>It appears <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> held ≈øuch a certificate, he never ≈øold to Mr. <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> it is true, he ≈øold to others; 'tis al≈øo true, and po≈ø≈øible, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> might have bought from others; if a fact, it is capable of proof‚Äîand the weight of that proof re≈øts on the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>It is incumbent on him to ≈øhew how he came by it; he has ≈øub≈øcribed it, it is his duty to point out how he became po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of it, we have paid it, it is ≈øimilar to ≈øtolen good≈ø found on a per≈øon, he mu≈øt account how

                     <p>Can the defendant ≈øhew them? Let him turn to his books and ≈øhew them; will not the books be ≈øufficient to clear up this point? and to ≈øhew the amount on hand and not delivered out, or how he has accounted for them, if the books are kept as they ought to have been, it mu≈øt appear from ≈øome of tho≈øe official docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the defendant, if no other an≈øwer can be procured, but that he is not bound to prove it, it is in vain to make any enquiry into the conduct of a public officer.</p>

                     <p>Having proved the facts which were breaches of laws, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove he is innocent, that it was done through mi≈øtake and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, that he acted with an hone≈øt intention, and that this <hi>killing</hi> was not maliciou≈øly done; if the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller will not prove this, there is no doubt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and criminal intentions.

                     <p>The≈øe claims were only claims for certificates (page 395, ≈øame date) by the Act of March 178 they were excluded from the Land-office, in the ≈øame page are mo≈øt material pa≈ø≈øages, but for what purpo≈øe?

                     <p>It is ≈øaid the Secretary of the Trea≈øury was of that opinion, when he was better informed, he renounced his former opinion.

                     <p>Here is an important que≈øtion, the Comptroller ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets the Act of 1789, is this opinion a proof of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intentions? it proves the rever≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The Regi≈øter-General never knew that any New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribed, until Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> had got his money; he went to Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> office in a ≈øurpri≈øe, a circum≈øtance ≈øo <hi>≈øingular,</hi> to know whether it was true or not.</p>
                     <p>It is al≈øo true, that the Comptroller-General did not know what was the opinion of the Regi≈øter-General; a conver≈øation took place, ≈øame time went to <hi>Smith's</hi> office.

No, until the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler rendered it fa≈øhionable, there is no evidence of any per≈øon entertaining ≈øuch an opinion before the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, who ≈øhould have ≈øaved to the State the wealth that he is now po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of. This opinion would never have been thought of if the Comptroller had not broached it. All the holders would have re-exchanged their certificates if he had not defeated the views of the Legi≈ølature.</p>
                     <p>It is ≈øaid, others determined to purcha≈øe New-Loans before Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon.</hi> The opinion of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

them; ≈øome determined before, others determined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Where is the public officer who has not determined the rever≈øe? They ought to be convinced, as they had been when they had the ≈øame opportunity.</p>
                     <p>It is ≈øaid the defendant had long before the Act of 1792 the ≈øame opinion; it is a mi≈øtake, his report made in 1790 clearly proves the contrary, he conceived the de≈øign that the New-Loans were a claim, not a claim for certificates, but a claim for ca≈øh.</p>
                     <p>His oppo≈øition to the law of 1792 has been much relied on, much credit hath been taken for the ≈øecret ≈øources of wealth contained in his plan of finance from pure and di≈øintere≈øted motives. Why did he oppo≈øe it? Does it prove his innocence? The Comptroller oppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; becau≈øe it would ≈øubject the State to the payment of ≈øome debts, which the commonwealth ought not to pay. Does not this ≈øhew a con≈øciou≈øne≈øs? Does not this prove that he knew New-Loans were not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able either legally or equitably.</p>
                     <p>It ≈øhews covetou≈øne≈øs; to ≈øuffer them to be re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed might include an imprudent proceeding. Was he not bound to take no advantage of their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? And he was not bound to uncover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. This he thought right, and puts the difference into his own pocket; all this under the colour of law. By the≈øe principles he took the advantage of the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with an ill grace. All this is a plan proof of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, converting every thing to his private gain. It is po≈ø≈øible, nay, it is probable that he conceived the de≈øign of oppo≈øing the Act of 10th April 1792, from pure motives, for what rea≈øon? We ≈øay they were afterwards corrupt. There are other parts of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which demon≈øtrate the guilt of the defendant.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øtatement of the Comptroller, that New-Loans were excluded in the provi≈øions for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a proof in point; it cannot be pretended that they are in the law of 1792, it is confe≈ø≈øed not to be in the ≈øecond ≈øection, it is ≈øaid to be in the ≈øixth. Pure motives the≈øe! When this officer wanted an engine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:027132_0449_0FD352A10913A778"/>
the word "≈øub≈øcribable" can be found in that ≈øection.</p>
                     <p>The complete ≈øecrecy is a ≈øtrong proof of his guilt, bound to communicate with the other officers, which he declined until he actually obtained po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the money. If the opinion of the Comptroller was known for ≈øo many years, why ≈øecrecy ≈øo many years? He did not receive money to pay it back again, he carried his plan into execution before the Governor, a faithful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer took mea≈øures to ≈øtop it, the Regi≈øter was check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the progre≈øs. This is the conduct of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.</hi> This is the meaning of the articles. On all that came before the Hou≈øe, I do not ≈øee a clau≈øe by which I can be able to find tho≈øe ≈øigns of innocency, he was the officer of the public, he was paid for his ≈øervices, he was not to ≈øacrifice their intere≈øt to his own private gain; his whole cour≈øe is a ≈øacrifice of duty to gain: he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued it with a ≈øtep as ≈øteady as time. We have ≈øeen the conduct, we have traced the motives of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General; let us take an exten≈øive view, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the general principles of faithfulne≈øs and honour. As an Executive officer, he was an hand to fulfil the volitions of the public, the Legi≈ølature's will was his duty. If we find him going forward in other principles of gain, they are ba≈øe. Is this faithfulne≈øs, fairne≈øs and honour, in a country like ours, where the government lives on public confidence? They are ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by every breath, if they are not equipoi≈øed, the nice balance is ea≈øily di≈øplaced. By this means the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of European politics will de≈øtroy our con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and fal≈øe con≈øtructions will overwhelm our own politics, and ≈øacrifice the principles on which we built our Republic.</p>
                     <p>Of all the parts the public revenue ought to be mo≈øt clo≈øely watched; revenue is food which in a di≈øea≈øed ≈øtate is humour and di≈øea≈øe, and becomes the food of corruption. No jealou≈øy is too great to check un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded power; no jealou≈øy too great to watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited

confidence, in equal ≈øy≈øtems purity and ≈øeverity are nece≈ø≈øary,</p>
                     <p>We have been told that great patriots have been ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to popular fury, through clamour and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Is this an argument again≈øt convicting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant! Where is the clamour, where is the public re≈øentment? The influence of the re≈øpondent is great, more danger of impunity, he has many friends. No compari≈øon between the Republics of antient times and our own, the repre≈øentation here is judicious, their laws were indefinite; no more ≈øimilarity between <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> than there is between their patriots and the re≈øpondent. They knew nothing of repre≈øentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they knew nothing of the divi≈øions of power, they did not decide by fixed laws, pa≈ø≈øion was their only principle.</p>
                     <p>Hence an unju≈øt acquittal is perfidy to the public. I know the Senate have too much under≈øtanding to leave their po≈øt; the proof is competent to authori≈øe a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conviction; if the opinion of the Senate ≈øhould be different, the Comptroller will not be puni≈øhed for mal-conduct, the community will be defrauded, the day of acquittal will be forgotten, it will be e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reward for crimes, in future no re≈øpon≈øibility will be expected, this will be opening the flood-gates of corruption; but con≈øider, they ought to know that you are above them; they will then do ju≈øtice, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Senate will in this ca≈øe do ju≈øtice to the commonwealth of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and to the re≈øpondent, and prevent the torrent of ≈øeduction from ≈øweeping away our liberties and our rights.

                     <p>THE Senate met; the con≈øideration of Legi≈ølative bu≈øine≈øs was po≈øtponed; Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> and his coun≈øel were at the table, in≈øide the bar as u≈øual; the Court was called, as in page 201.</p>
                     <p>Mr. BRADFORD ro≈øe, and ≈øaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THOSE circum≈øtances which have deprived the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant of one of his coun≈øel, occa≈øion my appearance in this cau≈øe. Having been ≈øub≈øtituted in his place, I wi≈øh I were able to ≈øupply his lo≈øs.</p>
                     <p>I appear for an officer who has been long in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ≈øervice, and, I may add, long a public favorite:‚Äî an officer who has been as it were burdened with the public confidence and oppre≈ø≈øed with duties numerous, delicate and difficult in their execution. When ≈øuch an officer is <hi>accu≈øed,</hi> the very confidence with which he has been honored begets ≈øu≈øpicion; and if he be accu≈øed of <hi>peculation,</hi> a jealou≈øy for the people's rights provokes a peculiar zeal in tho≈øe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the pro≈øecution. That zeal has not been wanting: and the re≈øult, I tru≈øt, will be honorable both to the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives and to the defendant. Their committee, in their inve≈øtigation of his conduct, left no tract unexplored‚Äîno office un≈øearched‚Äîno expence ≈øpared: and yet, although the defendant has been twelve years in office, they have been able to bring forward only a ≈øingle charge of <hi>this kind:</hi> and that founded on the ≈øingle te≈øtimony of an unrecollecting individual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="445" facs="unknown:027132_0453_0FD352A301D9D4C8"/>Impre≈ø≈øed with the importance of the cau≈øe I will endeavour to di≈øcu≈øs it as well as my ≈øtrength will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: and in order to follow ≈øome method, the articles of impeachment ≈øhall be my guide. They will be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately con≈øidered and probably ≈øeperately decided on by you: and therefore a di≈øtinct and ≈øeperate di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of them is in ≈øome degree nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt article may be divided into three di≈øtinct po≈øitions,</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. That the Act of March 1789, rendered the New-Loan certificates no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. That he declared the≈øe certificates to be ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable to the loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. That this was a mi≈ødemeanor, in violation of his duty.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe po≈øitions, is the ba≈øis of the whole pro≈øecution. It therefore de≈øerves a minute examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for unle≈øs it can be ≈øupported, the Colo≈ø≈øus which is reared upon it mu≈øt inevitably fall.‚ÄîIts importance ari≈øes from the Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th of Augu≈øt 1790, which makes the ≈øums ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan, payable in certificates i≈ø≈øued by the re≈øpective ≈øtates "as acknowledgements or evidences of debts by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpectively owing."</p>
                     <p>That the New-Loan certificates were at <hi>one time</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a debt owing by <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> ≈øeemed ≈øo manife≈øt that it could not be denied; and accordingly the committee thought it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øtate, that the Act of 1789 had de≈øtroyed that quality. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore placed this po≈øition in the front of the battle: It is our duty to encounter it; and in ≈øo doing I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove,</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. That the≈øe certificates were debts of <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> before the Act of March 1789.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. That the Act of that date neither <hi>did</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> annihilate the debt.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe is a principle conceded in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of impeachment. When they ≈øtate that the Act
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:027132_0454_0FD352A825E848E0"/>
rendered the≈øe certificates <hi>no longer</hi> a debt, they impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly admit that they <hi>were</hi> a debt before the Act was pa≈ø≈øed. The learned managers, al≈øo, have occa≈øionly admitted it; but as their coun≈øel have told us that it was not a debt‚Äîbut a temporary exchange of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates‚Äîthat they were not ab≈øolute contracts for the payment of money‚Äîbut mere receipts to enable the holder to get back his Continental certificates‚Äîit has become nece≈ø≈øary to examine this point.</p>
                     <p>By a debt every lawyer under≈øtands <hi>ex vi termeni,</hi> a ≈øum of money due by certain and expre≈øs contract. Such we hold the≈øe certificates to be:‚Äîa debt created by the Act of March 1786.</p>
                     <p>The hi≈øtory of that Act hath been gone into to prove that this was only an engagement to pay the intere≈øt as long as the ≈øtate cho≈øe, and not a permament debt. And it was ≈øaid to be a mere temporary provi≈øion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was originally the debt of the United States and not the proper debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will therefore be proper in this place to mention a few facts which illu≈øtrate the hi≈øtory of the certificate ‚Äîdebt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the war commenced it was under≈øtood and afterwards expres≈øly ≈øtipulated that all expences ≈øhould be paid out of a common trea≈øury. Congre≈øs had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally the power of rai≈øing money but no organ by which they could effectually exert that power. They could make requi≈øitions but could not enforce them: and it has properly been called a government of ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.‚ÄîHence they were obliged to i≈ø≈øue paper-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but that depreciated and large debts were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably contracted.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe debts were for ≈øervices rendered, articles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed or monies advanced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1≈øt. Part of this debt aro≈øe from the depreciation of the ≈øoldiers pay. Congre≈øs in 1786 determined to make up that depreciation, and not being able to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, reque≈øted the ≈øeveral ≈øtates to compen≈øate their re≈øpective troops for the deficiency of their pay. Hence
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:027132_0455_0FD352AA57AD5B08"/>
aro≈øe the depreciation debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> originally the debt of the United States, and ≈øtill chargeable in account to them. But as ≈øoon as the certificates were i≈ø≈øued by the ≈øtate, it became <hi>her own debt</hi> and ≈øo it has always been con≈øidered. For the re≈øidue of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ≈øoldier received the paper of Congre≈øs; and for ≈øervices rendered to the United States, he held in one hand his depreciation certificate i≈ø≈øued by the ≈øtate, and in his other a final ≈øettlement certificate granted by Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The ≈øecond ≈øpecies of certificates were tho≈øe i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued under the Act of 1≈øt April 1784. The≈øe have of late been called Funded debt‚Äîbut the greate≈øt part of them were i≈ø≈øued for militia ≈øervices, when called our by order of Congre≈øs, or for commi≈ø≈øary or quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øter certificates and other debts properly chargeable to the United States. Here again the ≈øtate ≈øtepped in to a≈ø≈øume; yet the≈øe certificates are not denied to be the proper debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3d. But the greate≈øt part of the public creditors who were citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> held Continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates. Neither principal nor intere≈øt was paid upon the≈øe; and though this was not the proper debt of the ≈øtate yet ≈øhe was one of the partner≈øhip, and as far as her quot<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> went, was bound to contribute. She was willing to do this: but amid≈øt a general delinquency of the ≈øtates, ≈øhe had no encouragement to exert her≈øelf for the payment of any but her own citizens‚Äîand the≈øe ≈øhe cho≈øe to prefer.</p>
                     <p>The Legi≈ølature accordingly made Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates receivable in the Land-Office. They went further, and by an Act of 1783 enabled the Loan-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to pay <hi>one</hi> year's intere≈øt on ≈øuch of the Continental certificates as were held by the citizens of the ≈øtate. There were hopes, at this time, that Congre≈øs would be authori≈øed to lay a duty of five per cent. on impo≈øts: but <hi>Rhode-I≈øland</hi> refu≈øed to accede to it, and the hopes of a Continental provi≈øion for the payment of the debt became more di≈øtant. Still <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:027132_0456_0FD351EA5CEA6F70"/>
to a≈ø≈øume ≈øo large a debt as was in the hands of her citizens: But de≈øirous of relieving them, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature directed the ≈øtate's quota of the annual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt of the aggregate debt to be paid into the hands of the Continental Loan-officer for the purpo≈øe of paying its own citizens, until <hi>permanent</hi> provi≈øion ≈øhould be made by Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>But this would have left foreign creditors unprovid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: and Congre≈øs by their ordinance of the 27th September 1785, di≈øabled the Loan-officer from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the plan into effect. This defeated the Act of 1785. The indent ≈øy≈øtem, propo≈øed by Congre≈øs, was ≈øeem to be delu≈øive; the creditors ≈øuffered; and the moment was arrived when <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øaw ≈øhe mu≈øt either abandon the relief of her own citizens or take the debt due to them upon her≈øelf. In ≈øuch a cri≈øis ≈øhe did not he≈øitate, but nobly re≈øolved to a≈ø≈øume the debt, to become the creditor of Congre≈øs in≈øtead of the debtor; and by interpo≈øing her own credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øources, to ≈øave her citizens from di≈øtre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>This gave birth to the Act of March 1786. The Legi≈ølature determined to open a loan‚Äîto receive the Continental certificates as gold and ≈øilver‚Äîand to give the note of the ≈øtate for their amount, payable in ten years.‚ÄîIn nothing but its amount did this a≈ø≈øumption differ from that of the depreciation and other debts of the United States. The different ≈øpecies of certificates ≈øeemed to be equal favorites: All of them were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Land-office, all of them bore intere≈øt at 6 per cent. and by the Act of 1786 intere≈øt on all of them was made payable half yearly.</p>
                     <p>In the a≈ø≈øumption of the <hi>Depreciation</hi> and <hi>Funded</hi> debt, <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> became entitled to a credit in <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> with Congre≈øs equal to the amount a≈ø≈øumed:‚Äî In that of the New-Loan debt ≈øhe acquired a <hi>transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> credit: in both ca≈øes ≈øhe contracted a debt to her own citizens and the certificates i≈ø≈øued were <hi>equally</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of that debt.‚ÄîWhy then are we told in ≈øuch pointed terms that this was not an original debt of

                        <hi>Penn≈øylvania?</hi> Is the contract le≈øs valid becau≈øe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration is a negociable debt, and not ca≈øh or produce? Certainly not. The engagement was thus, "Transfer to me your certificate and I will give you my note to pay you an equivalent in money." If individuals had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained ≈øo, what court of law or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>uity would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that the note thus given created a debt?‚ÄîHere the <hi>con≈øideration</hi> was a valuable one‚Äîthe ≈øum certain ‚Äîthe time of payment fixed‚Äîthe note negociable. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, ≈øee page 317.) It has the nature and all the properties of a legal debt; and as to ≈øub≈øequent hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they had only to look at the face of the certificate, to learn that the ≈øtate was obliged to pay that debt to <hi>the bearer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again: The Act which created the≈øe certificates ≈øpeaks of them <hi>as debts.</hi> Thus in ≈øection II, it directs that the margin of the certificates ≈øhall be "≈øufficient for a memorandum of the e≈ø≈øential circum≈øtances of the <hi>debts</hi> to be thereby re≈øpectively ≈øecured." The ≈øame expre≈ø≈øion occurs in the eighth ≈øection.‚ÄîThey are con≈øidered as <hi>debts</hi> by the Acts of 28th March 1786, and are ≈øo called in all the Legi≈ølative proceedings. It was ≈øo con≈øidered when the Act or 1789 was before the Hou≈øe, and in their minutes it is ≈øtiled a "debt originally due by the United States and a≈ø≈øumed by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> for the relief of her citizens." (See votes A≈ø≈øembly, 26th December 1786, page 93-97, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1787, page 69; minutes 1789, page 77, 78, and 82, &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>Before I di≈ømi≈øs this part of the ≈øubject, permit me to make an ob≈øervation on what fell from the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> ye≈øterday. He was mi≈øtaken when he ≈øuppo≈øed that the memorandum on the margin was to be a memorandum of the <hi>Continental</hi> certificates loaned. On the contrary the memorandum was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned to ≈øerve <hi>as a check</hi> and to record the e≈ø≈øential circum≈øtances of the <hi>New-Loan certificates,</hi> on who≈øe margin it was made. The inference ≈øo ingeniou≈øly
<pb n="450" facs="unknown:027132_0458_0FD3524C0F551C20"/>
drawn from it, is therefore unfounded: but mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was a natural one for a gentleman to whom this ≈øubject could not be familiar.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that the ≈øtate made a contract for the payment of the debt not only with the original creditors but with every <hi>bona fide</hi> holder. And if the ≈øtate re≈øerved a right to aboli≈øh the debt, where is the evidence of that right to be found? It is not in the law; it is not on the face of the certificate; nor had it a being till the ingenuity of coun≈øel created it.</p>
                     <p>I here di≈ømi≈øs this point. It is proved that the New-Loans were originally evidences of a debt. 1. By the hi≈øtory of the Act which created it. 2. By the nature of the contract. 3. By the terms of the Act. 4. By the written documents of the Legi≈ølature. And, 5. By the articles of impeachment them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to prove, <hi>That the Legi≈ølature did not mean nor bad the power to impair the contract or de≈øtroy the debt, by the Act of</hi> 1789.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Legi≈ølature did not mean it; becau≈øe upon a fair and legal con≈øtruction of the Act, it only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to <hi>≈øu≈øpend the payment</hi> but does not affect the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence</hi> of the debt.‚ÄîThe Act of 1786 made provi≈øion for the <hi>payment</hi> of the intere≈øt‚Äîbut the certificates i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued under it <hi>≈øecured the debt it≈øelf.</hi> I u≈øe this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage becau≈øe it is the language of the Act.‚ÄîA repeal therefore of the Act of 1786 cannot affect tho≈øe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. There are no words in the Act under con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which di≈øcover any intention to affect them, to render them irredeemable or to annul the debt.‚ÄîThis is always expre≈øsly enacted where the determination is ≈øuch. It is ≈øo in all ca≈øes where bills of credit are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in. It is ≈øo in the Act of 4th December 1789 <hi>(Dal.</hi> 759) where certain certificates for ≈øupplies are directed to be brought in, and are declared after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day to be irredeemable. This has always been done when the evidence of the debt was meant to be affected. But in the ca≈øe before us there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øion on the holders of the New-Loans to bring them
<pb n="451" facs="unknown:027132_0459_0FD352220B4D0D18"/>
in and exchange them. They were left at liberty to hold them, or to exchange them, or to transfer them to others‚ÄîThe debt and the evidence of it remained ≈øecure though the funds provided by the Act of 1786 were withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>But it has been much relied on, "that ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as ≈øecures the payment of the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ≈øum,"</hi> is al≈øo repealed: And it is urged that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal to pay either intere≈øt or principal is tantamount to annulling the debt.‚ÄîBut it is obvious that this clau≈øe affected only the certificate's <hi>receivability in the Land-office.</hi> No part of the Act of 1786 directed or ≈øecured the payment of the <hi>principal,</hi> except the ≈øection which made the certificates receivable in that office. There was no adequate fund provided for their redemption, and the hopes of receiving payment in 1796, re≈øted on the <hi>national faith and honour</hi> of the ≈øtate.‚ÄîThe≈øe were the ≈øecurity of the holder and the≈øe were not affected by the repeal in que≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>That the word "principal" was not in≈øerted with an intention to annihilate the debt, appears al≈øo by the hi≈øtory of the Act. The bill in its fir≈øt concoction and in all its ≈øub≈øequent ≈øtages till two days before it pa≈ø≈øed, was calculated merely to ≈øtop the payment of intere≈øt. (Minutes A≈ø≈øembly 1789, page 78, 143-5.) If it had been pa≈ø≈øed into a law in this form, no que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind would have ari≈øen: And as the word "principal" appears to have been in≈øerted on a ≈øudden thought, merely to meet that part of the Act of 1786 which made them receivable in the Land-office, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford a ground for the inference that is drawn from it.</p>
                     <p>The preamble has al≈øo been relied on as proving the intention of the Act. But, without in≈øi≈øting that the preamble cannot controul the purview, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, that it ≈øtates the want of funds, which had been diverted to the general government, as the ground of the difficulty: and that it was rea≈øonable that payment of the debts due to the creditors ≈øhould be provided
<pb n="452" facs="unknown:027132_0460_0FD3524D8C6CC558"/>
for out of the Trea≈øury of the United States.‚ÄîIt was hoped, probably, that Congre≈øs would a≈ø≈øume them‚Äî or, paying the intere≈øt to the ≈øtate, enable her to pay it over to the creditors‚Äîand until events ≈øhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the incapacity of the ≈øtate to meet the demand required a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the payment. But in the mean time an exchange of certificates was offered to tho≈øe who cho≈øe it.‚ÄîCircum≈øtances of imperious nece≈ø≈øity may excu≈øe the ≈øtoppage of payment‚Äîbut nothing can ju≈øtify an attempt to de≈øtroy the debt.</p>
                     <p>Again: The debt is ≈øo far from being extingui≈øhed by the Act, that the Legi≈ølature recognizes it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the payment of four years intere≈øt complete and providing a new fund for its redemption. But they do not <hi>compel</hi> the creditors to re≈øort to this fund. All the expre≈ø≈øions of the Act ≈øhew that they have an option either to take back their Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or to rely on the future ability of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It recites that <hi>"many may be de≈øirous"</hi> to take back their certificates‚Äîthat it is "ju≈øt and rea≈øonable" to grant it to tho≈øe <hi>"applying"</hi> therefor, &amp;c.‚ÄîExpre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions which prove that the exchange was di≈øcretionary with the creditors.</p>
                     <p>"But can that be a debt of which the payment both of intere≈øt and of principal is withdrawn?" Unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably it can.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is plain that the de≈øtruction of the intere≈øt is not the de≈øtruction of the debt. Thus during the war, intere≈øt cea≈øed on <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> debts. So on money attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The intere≈øt on the ≈øtate debts due from confi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated e≈øtates are at this moment in that ≈øituation. There is no fund for payment of principal or intere≈øt, and yet it is certainly a debt. 2. Neither will the annihilation of funds for the payment of the principal operate thus. If the≈øe certificates had never been receivable in the Land-office, they would neverthele≈øs have been evidences of a debt. The debt is created by the promi≈øe; the means of fullfilling that promi≈øe are quite different from the promi≈øe it≈øelf.‚ÄîBe≈øides, a debt may exi≈øt
<pb n="453" facs="unknown:027132_0461_0FD3524F18520B30"/>
where there are no means of compelling payment. A debt due from one individual to another is not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a defect of remedy. For in≈øtance, when the revolution took place all po≈øitive laws cea≈øed; the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor had no means of compelling payment; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the remedy was extinct the debt was in force. So in the ca≈øe of alien enemies; their debts are ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, not extingui≈øhed. A ≈øimilar point was lately ruled in the highe≈øt tribunal of the United States, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgia</hi> v. <hi>Brailsford.</hi> It is the ≈øame ca≈øe in tho≈øe ≈øtates where there is no mode of ≈øuing the government; tho' they refu≈øe to provide funds for the payment of the principal or intere≈øt of their certificates, tho≈øe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates are not le≈øs evidences of debts owing from them. So the New-Loans being evidences of a debt rightfully created are not de≈øtroyed by the withdrawing tho≈øe funds which the Act of 1786 provided.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me that the ≈øen≈øe of the Legi≈ølature ≈øince the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 1789 corre≈øponds with this con≈øtruction. This may be collected from the Act of 29th March 1790, page 784. (Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> read the Act and commented upon it.)</p>
                     <p>From the view already taken of this point, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the Legi≈ølature did not mean to render the New-Loan certificates no longer evidences of a debt; but there is ≈øtill a ≈øtronger rea≈øon for avoiding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite con≈øtruction, which is, that it tarni≈øhes the honor of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>‚ÄîIt has been proved that there was a debt ≈øolemnly contracted by the ≈øtate on a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration. Now what is ≈øuppo≈øed by the articles of impeachment? That the Legi≈ølature intended‚Äînot on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cancel this ≈øolemn obligation‚Äîto violate the ≈øanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> to ≈øubvert the hone≈øt principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and violate the Federal Con≈øtitution. Sir, it is imputing to the Legi≈ølature a crime greater than that with which the defendant ≈øtands charged.</p>
                     <p>All government is in≈øtituted for the protection of our natural rights. Property is one of the≈øe,‚Äîand proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:027132_0462_0FD352250BB84268"/>
in contract is as ≈øacred as property in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. We have no ≈øafety if this can be violated; and tho≈øe who think that liberty can be ≈øecure where property is not protected will find them≈øelves mi≈øerably mi≈øtaken.</p>
                     <p>The nece≈ø≈øity of pre≈øerving the faith of contracts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween individuals is very apparent. If one man ≈øhould give his own obligation in exchange for another, no court of law or equity would di≈ø≈øolve the contract:‚Äî and the con≈øtitution of the United States prohibits this inju≈øtice in <hi>all</hi> ca≈øes. Why ≈øhould there be a difference made between the promi≈ø≈øory note of an individual and of a ≈øtate? States are moral per≈øons, capable of duties and obligations; and none but tho≈øe who adopt the di≈øhone≈øt refinements of the <hi>Florentine</hi> politician will in ≈øuch a ca≈øe di≈øtingui≈øh between them. What is it to ju≈øtice whether the one of parties to a contract be one, or many‚Äîan individual‚Äîa corporation or a ≈øtate? Power, indeed, may be on one ≈øide, but power is not right. The naked arm of violence may tear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in pieces, but the immutable ju≈øtice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, remains the ≈øame. It is the ≈øacred law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øays <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> that the faith of contracts be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved. The mo≈øt de≈øpotic governments are obliged to re≈øpect this ≈øalutary principle‚Äîthis voice of the divinity which is heard in every heart amid≈øt all the violence of de≈øire and the clamours of ≈øelf intere≈øt.‚ÄîBut in republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can governments the pre≈øervation of this principle is e≈ø≈øential to liberty. Such at lea≈øt was the conviction of the people of <hi>America</hi> when they formed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution. They would not ≈øuffer ≈øo important a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be at hazard and ≈øolemnly declared "That no ≈øtate ≈øhall have power to impair the obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts." This is at once our glory and our reproach; our reproach as the evidence of pa≈øt inju≈øtice; our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as an eternal bar to ≈øuch inju≈øtice in future. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraction of power‚Äîthis inability to do wrong is more truly honorable to the ≈øeveral ≈øtates than unbounded authority. I ≈øpeak not only as coun≈øel for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but as a citizen who loves his country, when I ≈øay;
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:027132_0463_0FD352267A01A7B8"/>
that the pre≈øervation of this article of the Con≈øtitution is of the la≈øt importance. We ought to watch over it with a holy jealou≈øy‚Äîwe ought to guard it with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting zeal‚Äîwe ought to re≈øi≈øt the ≈ølighte≈øt attempt to de≈øtroy or impair it. Among all the captious excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and hone≈øt prejudices again≈øt the Federal Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, no oppo≈øition was made to this principle‚Äîno amendment propo≈øed by any ≈øtate. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> not only formally approved of, but after three years con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration tran≈øplanted it into her own Con≈øtitution. We there find it placed among "the great and e≈ø≈øential principles of liberty and free government." (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here read the articles in the Con≈øtitution of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.)</hi> Around this every hone≈øt citizen ought to rally: and yet this mu≈øt be beaten down before the defendant can be reached.</p>
                     <p>At the time of pa≈ø≈øing the Act of 1789, the Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States was in full force. Ought we then to ≈øuppo≈øe the legi≈ølature ≈øo forgetful of their duty as to violate it? Is it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øully the fair fame of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by a har≈øh con≈øtruction of the Act when an hone≈øt meaning is ea≈øily di≈øcoverable in it?</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid the Act of 1789 re≈øtores all things to their old ≈øituation‚Äîthat this is <hi>equitable and ju≈øt</hi>‚Äîand therefore no violation of the Con≈øtitution. To this we an≈øwer, 1. That the contract was to pay money not to re-exchange certificates. The United States might as well annihilate their a≈ø≈øumed debts in the ≈øame manner. A man who purcha≈øes land on ground rent might as well in≈øi≈øt upon the ≈øeller taking back his land and extingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rent; or when farms have been exchanged, that they ≈øhould be mutually re≈øtored. This argument will not hold in common life nor in the ca≈øe before us, 2. It did not re≈øtore things to their old ≈øtate. The <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øer</hi> of a New-Loan certificate never loaned any thing and the proferred exchange was offering what he did not wi≈øh and taking from him what he cho≈øe to keep. 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>It has been ≈øaid that even a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the payment of the intere≈øt was a breach of the contract as much as the annihilation of the debt. But it may be ob≈øerved that funds for the payment of the intere≈øt were withdrawn by the con≈øent of the people them≈øelves; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to pay will excu≈øe the pre≈øent ≈øtoppage of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the obligation of the contract remains. Thus the ≈øudden revolution in the form of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ab≈øtracted the funds ju≈øtified a pre≈øent ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion of payment; and in the mean time a re-exchange was offered to tho≈øe who cho≈øe to look to Congre≈øs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than rely on the future ability and faith of the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid, Suppo≈øe the Act were contrary to the Con≈øtitution, who ≈øhall ≈øay ≈øo‚Äîwhat judicature has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to determine upon it? That point need not be much di≈øcu≈ø≈øed. It has more than once been ≈øettled, that the judicial power is inve≈øted with authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on the con≈øtitutionality of an Act of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature.

proper and ought to govern every tribunal in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful point; but an undue ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion would be a de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of duty.</p>
                     <p>But we are pre≈ø≈øed with the objection that this is to ≈øet the Judiciary above the Legi≈ølative. But this is by no means the ca≈øe. It only e≈øtabli≈øhes the preeminent authority of the <hi>people. They</hi> are above the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Judicial. To both they have delegated limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted powers; and the Con≈øtitution is the ≈øupreme rule by which both ought to govern their deci≈øions.</p>
                     <p>The objection is founded on principles long ≈øince abandoned. After the truths e≈øtabli≈øhed by our revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution‚Äîand in the blaze of political knowledge which illuminates the clo≈øe of the 18th century, I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear it affirmed in a republican government, that the ≈øupreme power re≈øides in the Legi≈ølature. It re≈øides only in the people who have delegated certain portions of it to the different branches of government. Properly ≈øpeaking neither of the≈øe is ≈øuperior‚ÄîThey are in one ≈øen≈øe equal and co-ordinate‚ÄîThe Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is controuled by the Con≈øtitution; and to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary the people have entru≈øted the power of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws. And as the Con≈øtitution is the ≈øupreme law, the courts in the exerci≈øe of their functions mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily determine whether the Acts of the Legi≈ølature interfere with its provi≈øions. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to and read ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages from <hi>Publius's</hi> letters on the ≈øubject.)</p>
                     <p>It is ≈øaid that the people in ca≈øe of a violation of the Con≈øtitution have no remedy but another election. If this be true, there is no ≈øecurity that another election will be in their power. If this be true, the Legi≈ølature might have been ≈øpared the trouble and expence of an impeachment. They might have pa≈ø≈øed a bill of pains and penalties again≈øt the defendant, or erected a torture chamber to oblige him to confe≈øs. If this be true our liberties are pro≈øtrate at the feet of the A≈ø≈øembly, and a <hi>limited</hi> Con≈øtitution is of no avail.‚ÄîWhat will the Freemen of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øay when they find the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives ≈øo liberal in ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering their ine≈øtimable rights? or what mu≈øt they think of this cau≈øe which cannot be ≈øupported without ≈øhaking the pillars of the Con≈øtitution?</p>
                     <p>To enforce his rea≈øoning on this point the gentleman added that he never heard that any power on earth had a right to adjudge a ca≈øe between a ≈øtate and its own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Then, Sir, he never read the Con≈øtitution of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> which expre≈øsly provides that a ≈øtate ≈øhall be ≈øued as an individual. The po≈øition is a remnant of feudal ignorance;‚Äîand ≈øurely in a criminal pro≈øecution every man has a right to avail him≈øelf, before any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, of the ≈øhelter the Con≈øtitution affords.</p>
                     <p>I will dwell no longer on this ≈øubject. From our examination of it, it is equally evident that the New-Loans are ≈øtill a debt‚Äîand that the Legi≈ølature did not mean nor had the power to de≈øtroy it.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to examine the other po≈øition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fir≈øt article. They are, <hi>That</hi> John Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon <hi>declared the≈øe certificates ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United Sates, and that this was a mi≈ødemeanor.</hi> The fact of his certifying or declaring them to be ≈øub≈øcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is admitted, except, that he did not certify this, in his own ca≈øe; in which alone he could have derived any advantage from it. But no guilt re≈øults from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, if it can be <hi>ju≈øtified</hi> or <hi>excu≈øed.</hi> We mean to do both, and contend, 1≈øt. That this debt was by law ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan. 2d. That if it was not, it was at lea≈øt his real opinion;‚Äîan opinion hone≈øtly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him and many others.</p>
                     <p>New-Loans are within the de≈øcription of 13th ≈øection of the Act of Congre≈øs. Compare them with it. They were certificates i≈ø≈øued before the 1≈øt January 1790, by the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi>‚Äîas acknowledgments or evidences of debts by her owing.‚ÄîThey are not within the exception of the ≈øection;‚Äînor could they be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refu≈øed at the Loan-office unle≈øs they could be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no longer evidences of a debt.‚ÄîI admit that they mu≈øt be evidences of a <hi>≈øub≈øi≈øting</hi> debt;‚Äîbut we
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:027132_0467_0FD3523309D0D140"/>
have already proved it to be a debt,‚Äîand it has never been paid off, redeemed or otherwi≈øe legally di≈øcharged. The argument need to be repeated.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid it mu≈øt be a debt <hi>recogni≈øed</hi> by the ≈øtate. We an≈øwer, 1≈øt. That it never was di≈øclaimed by the ≈øtate; though unfunded, it was ≈øtill a debt undenied. 2d. If it was really an exi≈øting debt, the ≈øub≈øequent acknowledgement or di≈øclaimer of the ≈øtate would be of no avail. To decline receiving certificates of a di≈øput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed debt, was a proper rule in the Trea≈øury, as they had no power finally to decide on it; but their doubts or difficulties cannot affect the creditor's right. The Act ≈øays no ≈øuch thing. Whether the debt be <hi>really owing,</hi> is the only que≈øtion: If it be, it will exi≈øt independant of the will of the debtor.</p>
                     <p>This a≈ø≈øumption by Congre≈øs was not made for the ≈øake of the ≈øtate but of the people. The hi≈øtory of the Act is well known. Congre≈øs could not rai≈øe money to pay their debts during the war, and the ≈øeveral ≈øtates were obliged to advance their credit for the United States. The certificates they i≈ø≈øued were con≈øidered as a Federal charge, and yet in many of the ≈øtates they were not paid; while in others the ≈øtate creditor was a favorite. To put the≈øe, who were in ju≈øtice, creditors of the Union, on a footing, the a≈ø≈øumption was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on.‚ÄîCould a ≈øtate therefore which might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to this a≈ø≈øumption, defeat the mea≈øure by refu≈øing to recogni≈øe the debt? The very exception of the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates is a proof that it could not. The≈øe were di≈øclaimed by that ≈øtate, and yet an expre≈øs exception was thought to be nece≈ø≈øary to exclude them.</p>
                     <p>The amount of the Secratary's letter on this ≈øubject is, that the officers of the Trea≈øury, who are merely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øterial, take a ≈øafe rule in receiving certificates on loan. But this does not preclude an enquiry. A <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <pb n="460" facs="unknown:027132_0468_0FD352369257D4D0"/>The opinion of the Secretary therefore is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this que≈øtion. Yet it may be remarked that he did ≈øo far decide upon it as to write to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Loan-officer that he could not refu≈øe the New-Loans if the holders in≈øi≈øted on ≈øub≈øcribing them. We are told however that the Act of 1789 was not brought into his view; but on comparing what he was written on this ≈øubject it is probable that he did ≈øee it, though he could not ≈øee any ≈øuch doctrine in it as is now drawn from it. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here commented upon ≈øeveral of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary's letters which were read in evidence.)‚ÄîIt is true, that the certificates have been <hi>virtually</hi> rejected. The expre≈ø≈øion was a cautious one; but the rea≈øon of their being in this ≈øituation is, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> who was the holder, took no ≈øteps to have them loaned, or the que≈øtion decided. The ≈øtate officers even de≈øired that they might not be received, and the opinion of the Attorney-General of the ≈øtate was, that they were not receivable.‚ÄîBe≈øides, in the late con≈øideration which the Secretary have to the Act of 1789, he ≈øays, that the circum≈øtances of its being pa≈ø≈øed after the ratification of the Federal Con≈øtitution did not occur to him.</p>
                     <p>Whether ≈øub≈øcribable or not, depends therefore whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Acts of Congre≈øs.‚ÄîIt is evident, that the Act contemplates this <hi>very debt</hi> as a ≈øtate debt. The 18th ≈øection expre≈øsly provides for a difficulty which could ari≈øe in no other ca≈øe. (Here it was read and explained.) The very nature of <hi>the≈øe</hi> ≈øtate debts, was urged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs as a rea≈øon for the a≈ø≈øumption;‚Äîand there was a peculiar and evident propriety in a≈ø≈øuming them. But no difficulty was made on account of the Act of 1789. ‚ÄîIf the New-Loans were to be excluded, why not the ≈øame exception as that re≈øpecting the <hi>North Carolina</hi> certificates? Our delegates were as attentive to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> as tho≈øe of other ≈øtates; and one of them was a member of the A≈ø≈øembly in 1789. The Act of Congre≈øs was not pa≈ø≈øed in a ha≈øty manner. It lay over a whole ≈øe≈ø≈øion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this two an≈øwers may be given and both of them ≈øatisfactory. 1≈øt. This debt was ≈øub≈øcribable under the general inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent clau≈øe of the Act. The provi≈øo re≈øpects only the payment of the intere≈øt and was introduced merely for the ≈øecurity of the United States. It does not in any manner limit or re≈øtrain the <hi>≈øub≈øcription.</hi> Such is the con≈øtruction given to it by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury. (Here Mr. <hi>Gib≈øon</hi> read the letter p. 272-3, at the reque≈øt of Mr. <hi>Bradford.)</hi> The ≈øtate therefore had the power to ≈øub≈øcribe the Continental certificates to the dome≈øtic loan and the holders of the New-Loans to ≈øub≈øcribe to the ≈øtate loan. But intere≈øt would have been paid only on one of the ≈øub≈øcription; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øition of the Legi≈ølature to ≈øurrender their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription; would not have been with holden, if the rights of their creditors had required it. 2d. Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> had power to exchange the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for New-Loans, whether they were pre≈øented by the United States or by individuals. The negociation in 1791 e≈øtabli≈øhed this. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here ob≈øerved upon the letter relative to that ≈øubject, ≈øee p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>2.)</p>
                     <p>Another objection is, That the ≈øum of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øtate debts a≈ø≈øumed by Congre≈øs amounts to 2,200,000 dollars only; whereas if the New-Loans were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it would have been much greater. But the argument turns the other way; for the whole of what is called the <hi>proper</hi> debt of the ≈øtate did not amount near to that ≈øum. But the whole amount of the debts of the ≈øeveral ≈øtates was not intended to be a≈ø≈øumed; but only a proportionable part of each. And although the New-Loan debt was large, yet great part of it had been already exchanged, and there was rea≈øon to believe that almo≈øt the whole would be ≈øo; becau≈øe, generally ≈øpeaking, it was the intere≈øt of the holders to ≈øub≈øcribe the Continental certificates rather than the New-Loans.
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:027132_0470_0FD352069F01B2C8"/>
(Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here exhibited ≈øome calculations of long and ≈øhort intere≈øt on the different certificates, to ≈øhew their effect on the different loans.) Be≈øides this advantage, the payment of the intere≈øt on Continental certificates commenced one year before that on the a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed debt. It was therefore probable that this ≈øum of 2,200,000 dollars would embrace all that would be ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed.‚ÄîI will not enlarge on this ≈øubject. The re≈øult of our enquiry is, that New-Loans <hi>were</hi> ≈øub≈øcribable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were evidences of a debt owing by the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>But if a different con≈øtruction could be put upon the Act, is it ≈øo plain a point that the oppo≈øite opinion mu≈øt be imputed to di≈øhone≈øt motives and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of judgment? Is it a mi≈øtake, that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Forbid it candor‚Äîforbid it ju≈øtice!</p>
                     <p>I ought now to con≈øider the <hi>motives</hi> which really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated the defendant; but it will be more convenient to defer this till the <hi>principle</hi> ≈øtated in the 2d article is al≈øo examined.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond, third and fourth articles are ≈øo intimately connected that the whole may be reduced to this; that the defendant certified certain certificates to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable which were not redeemable, with a corrupt and di≈øhone≈øt view.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt que≈øtion therefore is, Were the New-Loan certificates redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792? The article under con≈øideration declares that they were not; and on the ≈øoundne≈øs of this opinion all the re≈øt of the three articles depend.</p>
                     <p>The Senate will be plea≈øed to remember that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that whatever was ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan was made redeemable by that Act. We admit that they are not within the ≈øecond ≈øection of that Act; but they are manife≈øtly included in the ≈øixth. The words of that clau≈øe are remarkably ≈øtrong: "The holder or holders of any certificate <hi>≈øub≈øcribable</hi> to the ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

≈øo to be renewed, ≈øhall be entitled," &amp;c.‚ÄîHence ≈øub≈øcribability and redeemability became convertible terms. The Legi≈ølature put them≈øelves in the power of Congre≈øs. Whatever <hi>≈øtate debts</hi> Congre≈øs ≈øhould chu≈øe to a≈ø≈øume, entitled the holder to the benefits of that Act. No other con≈øtruction can rationally be put upon this clau≈øe. Even Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> who drew the bill and gave us the ≈øecret hi≈øtory of it, acknowledged the ju≈øtne≈øs of that con≈øtruction.</p>
                     <p>But it has been urged that the ≈øixth ≈øection was not intended to include any debts not included in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                     <p>Permit me here to remind this honorable body, that a mode of con≈øtruction has been introduced which is ≈øubver≈øive of all legal certainty as well as of per≈øonal ≈øafety. We are led from the language of the law, to the private ≈øentiments of the members of the legi≈ølature, and to the very manner of drawing the bill. Though mo≈øt the members of this court, were members of the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature wich pa≈ø≈øed the Act, they will remember that all recollection of private intention at that time, is to be laid a≈øide con≈øtruing its meaning. Its language alone is to be attended to. It is that on which every citizen mu≈øt form his opinion of the law; and to depart from this in judicial con≈øtruction is to poi≈øon the fountains of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The danger of this has created doubts concerning the propriety of erecting ≈øuch a court for the trial of impeachment; and it has been made a great political que≈øtion whether one branch of the Legi≈ølature ≈øhould ever decide on charges exhibited by the other. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the particular objects they had in view, they are in danger of limiting or extending the words within or beyond their natural and proper import; while the ≈øafety of the citizen con≈øi≈øts in confining the judge to the meaning of the Legi≈ølature as <hi>expre≈ø≈øed in the law it≈øelf.</hi> Inconveniences may ≈øometimes re≈øult from this; but the partial evil is overbalanced by the general good. <hi>Beccaria</hi> has an excellent chapter on this point. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here read ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages from that author.)</p>

                        <pb n="464" facs="unknown:027132_0472_0FD352ABFA8B84B0"/>But why do I dwell on this ≈øubject?‚ÄîI am ≈øpeaking to the Senate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Judging therefore by the <hi>expre≈ø≈øion</hi> of the ≈øixth ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no doubt of the redeemability of the certificates could remain. But ≈øeveral objections are made to this; and they ≈øeem to be all contained in the report of the committee on that bu≈øine≈øs. The fir≈øt is, That no funds were provided by the Act for the redemption of the≈øe certificates. I am di≈øpo≈øed to admit that the funds provided, are confined to the debts mentioned in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ≈øection; but whether any ≈øpecific funds were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not is immaterial, as by the exi≈øting laws there was a fund for all <hi>claims.</hi>‚ÄîBut we mu≈øt recollect that the ≈øecond ≈øecond was to operate at all events, whether Congre≈øs renewed the ≈øub≈øcription or not; but the ≈øixth was eventual and dependant on that contingency.‚ÄîThe A≈ø≈øembly therefore might chu≈øe to let it re≈øt upon the aggregate funds already mentioned. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here went into ≈øome calculations to ≈øhew that this might be ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.)</p>
                     <p>But the fallacy of their argument is proved by the ca≈øe of the Unfunded Depreciation certificates. They are not included in the ≈øecond ≈øection, and yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied they are included in the ≈øixth.‚ÄîNo ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific funds were provided for <hi>them;</hi>‚Äîyet as they were ≈øtate debts and a≈ø≈øumable, they were of cour≈øe redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The induction is fair, and even Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> who drew the bill and did not intend to include them, could not with≈øtand its force.</p>
                     <p>That the Unfunded Depreciation were included was a general opinion. The Regi≈øter-General and Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> the late re≈øpectable Speaker of the Senate, were the fir≈øt to put this con≈øtruction on the Act. He did not he≈øitate to pre≈øent ≈øuch certificates for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were redeemed accordingly. Judge <hi>Yeates</hi> did the ≈øame; and the Legi≈ølature to whom the Regi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-General made a report of a large ≈øum of the≈øe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates being redeemed, did not di≈øapprove of it. To this day there is no di≈øapprobation of it,‚Äîno ≈øuit

brought;‚Äîand well, ‚Äîfor where is the court that would ≈øu≈øtain it?‚ÄîIf then Unfunded Depreciation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, ≈øo are New-Loan certificates.</p>
                     <p>But to do away the force of this, we are favored with the ≈øecret meaning of the author of the Act. Although we were in darkne≈øs before, now truly we are enlightened‚Äî the film is purged‚Äîa new ray of light breaks in upon us‚Äî and knowing what the drawer of the Act intended, we ≈øee as it were face to face!‚ÄîSin, if ≈øuch principles of con≈øtruction are to prevail in a criminal pre≈øecution, the will of a <hi>Turki≈øh</hi> Cadi would be as ≈øafe a rule of conduct as the laws of <hi>Penn≈øylvania<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is urged that the ≈øixth ≈øection can only be regarded as a provi≈øo or exception to the ≈øecond. If the Legi≈ølature intended it as ≈øuch, how ea≈øy would it have been, to have added after "certificates? the word "herein before ≈øpecified." This would have confined its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the certificates mentioned in the ≈øecond ≈øection. But <hi>≈øi voluit non dixit.</hi>‚ÄîThe ≈øixth ≈øection as it now ≈øtands is a di≈øtinct independant clau≈øe If it operates as ≈øuch on the Unfunded Depreciation, why not on the New-Loans? "Becau≈øe, ≈øay they, the≈øe are not a <hi>≈øtate debt."</hi> Here we are thrown back upon the old que≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>This forms the mind objection in the report of the committee.‚Äî"Becau≈øe," ≈øay they, "it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any but <hi>≈øtate creditors."</hi> Now, if New-Loans were ≈øtate debts, the holders of them mi≈øt be ≈øtate creditors. There is no magic in the≈øe words to include Depreciation and to exclude the Loan debt. They are u≈øed merely to di≈øtingui≈øh the creditors of the ≈øtate from the creditors of the United States. We are therefore brought back to that which is the only real que≈øtion in the cau≈øe; whether the≈øe certificates were evidences of an exi≈øting debt or not?</p>
                     <p>But it has been hinted that whether in ≈øtrictne≈øs it were a debt or not, yet it was not <hi>≈øo con≈øidered</hi> by the Legi≈ølature in 1792. What is the proof of this? Their Acts contain no ≈øuch thing‚Äîand if an appeal is made to the private opinions of the members, I repeat it, we
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:027132_0474_0FD3525BB474B600"/>
cannot take notice of them.‚ÄîAs to the Comptroller, <hi>he</hi> always con≈øidered them as debts. In his ≈øtatement of the 10th December 1791, he ≈øpeaks of them as ≈øuch, and the word "redemption" which has been urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again≈øt him, refers only to the Land-office, from which the Act of 1789 had excluded them.‚ÄîIt was properly ob≈øerved that it was not the duty of the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller to bring them forward in any other view, as there was no pre≈øent intention or ability to pay them.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that none of the rea≈øons urged in ≈øupport of the con≈øtruction which the articles put upon the Act, will apply. We mu≈øt therefore re≈øort to the plain <hi>language</hi> of the Act. Whatever Congre≈øs ≈øhould make a≈ø≈øumable the Legi≈ølature made redeemable. Nay, thee Act goes further, and makes the acceptance in the Continental Loan-office, the rule for paying the nominal value by the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loans therefore are included. And what are the inconviences of this con≈øtruction?‚ÄîThe hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> they have given up certificates for the payment of which the ≈øtate was bound at lea≈øt to the amount of her quota‚Äîand reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ≈øolemn promi≈øe to be paid 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g> in the pound.‚ÄîAnd yet the burden of the complaint is, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was by the defendant's conduct obliged to pay this 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g> in the pound!</p>
                     <p>The certificates which the ≈øtate received in exchange have been and may be again ≈øold at their nominal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;‚Äîbut if the ≈øtate could get them without paying a ≈øhilling in the pound, it ≈øeems as if it would be very acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Sir, this eagerne≈øs to put a little profit by the rife and fall of ≈øtock into the pocket of the ≈øtate is di≈øreputable. It is to repre≈øent the ≈øovereign ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> as a jobber in the ≈øtocks. Such was not the intention of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives when they brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this impeachment.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole it appears that the≈øe New-Loans were a debt‚Äîthat its exi≈øtence was not affected by the
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:027132_0475_0FD3523BD2ACF5C8"/>
Act of 1789‚Äîthat of cour≈øe they were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan, and being ≈øub≈øcribable were redeemable. Hence if <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> did "recogni≈øe, certify and declare them to be ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable" he did no more than the law authori≈øed him to do.</p>
                     <p>Having now come to a dividing point of my argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and finding it impo≈ø≈øible to fini≈øh the whole in the cour≈øe of the morning, I ≈øubmit it to the Senate whether it will not be convenient to adjourn.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> ro≈øe, and ob≈øerved, that the gentleman mu≈øt have been much exhau≈øted, having ≈øpoken four hours, had yet much to ≈øay, and he reque≈øted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to adjourn till next morning. Adjourned.</p>

                     <p>SENATE met as u≈øual.</p>
                     <p>Mr. BRADFORD in continuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having, ye≈øterday, di≈øcu≈ø≈øed the <hi>legal</hi> po≈øitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fir≈øt and ≈øecond articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am now prepared to examine the <hi>fact</hi> charged in tho≈øe articles. It is, That the defendant declared New-Loan certificates to be ≈øub≈øcribable and redeema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cau≈øed them to be redeemed, with corrupt views, and in wilful violation of his duty.</p>
                     <p>We have endeavoured to prove that he was right in his con≈øtruction of the law; but if it be admitted that he was wrong in that, ≈øtill he is excu≈øable, and no guilt is imputable to him, if his conduct flowed from conviction of judgment and not from corruption of heart. It is therefore of importance to ≈øift his conduct thoroughly, and to ≈øee what were his real opinions and motives. The que≈øtion then is, <hi>Did John Nichol≈øon act thus knowing or believing it to be wrong?</hi> I am willing to put the cau≈øe on this ≈øimple i≈ø≈øue without holding the oppo≈øite coun≈øel to the proof of all the aggravations charged in the articles. It may however be proper to take ≈øome ≈ølight notice of the≈øe, as they have been pre≈ø≈øed again≈øt the defendant.</p>
                     <p>To begin, then, with the fir≈øt article: It is ≈øtated that he declared the≈øe certificates ≈øub≈øcribable‚Äî" under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office‚Äîand in violation of the confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed in him."‚ÄîIt appears that he made this certification in very few in≈øtances; and that this was done at the reque≈øt of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> or of individuals, who wi≈øhed to
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:027132_0477_0FD352B04C567280"/>
transfer or ≈øell their ab≈øtracts before the certificates due on them, would i≈ø≈øue from the Loan-office. This was an accommodation to tho≈øe who reque≈øted it, but it was not an <hi>official</hi> act. No Act of Congre≈øs nor of the ≈øtate, either required or forbid it. Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> did not certify it officially; he did not affix his official ≈øignature; he merely ≈øub≈øcribed the initials of his name. This was not obligatory on the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, nor did he ab≈øolutely depend upon it. It is in proof that he gave a receipt importing that the certificates were ≈øtill ≈øubject to examination; and in this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was directed by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury to depend on no one but him≈øelf and his own clerks.‚ÄîBe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore tru≈øted neither by the United States or the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> re≈øpecting this matter, the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's conduct could be no violation of official duty. But to ≈øay "that if it was an official act it was a breach of duty and if it was not an official act, he exceeded his powers and thus violated the confidence repo≈øed in him" ‚Äîis a very convenient argument! This is to put the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant on the bed of <hi>Procru≈øtes:</hi> If he is too long, lop him; if he is too ≈øhort, ≈øtretch him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. It is charged that it was done "in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own emolument." This cannot be true, for he did not certify the certificates, pre≈øented by him≈øelf, to be a≈ø≈øumable; and in tho≈øe ca≈øes where he did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, no emolument was or could have been in view. But this circum≈øtance <hi>of it≈øelf</hi> cannot aggravate the charge. To promote our own intere≈øt, is an hone≈øt end, if pur≈øued by hone≈øt means. If the certification was <hi>wilfully</hi> wrong, whether it was done for his own or another's emolument, he ought to ≈øuffer; nay, it would be inexcu≈øable to promote the greate≈øt charity on earth, by di≈øhone≈øt means.‚ÄîBut it will pre≈øently be ≈øeen that he acted hone≈øtly; and that he ≈øincerely believed what he certified to be true. It was an opinion which he entertained ≈øo early as the 30th September 1790 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>efore the loan opened, and ≈øo late as December 1791, after it was clo≈øed.</p>
                     <p n="3">

We have already di≈øcu≈ø≈øed that point, and ≈øhewn that it was not contrary to that Act; but if it were, yet, if the heart was free it could he no mi≈ødemeanor.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. La≈øtly, it is ≈øaid to be manife≈øtly to the ri≈øk and <hi>injury</hi> of the commonwealth <hi>as he well knew.</hi> This is the point‚Äîthe ≈øting of the accu≈øation. If this be true, we do not a≈øk his acquittal; and I ha≈øten to ≈øhew he did not <hi>know or believe</hi> that he was injuring the commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>In taking a view of the defendant's conduct, I am led to notice the repre≈øentation that has been given of it by the gentlemen who preceded me. I acknowledge the beauty of the painting‚Äîthe ≈øtrength of the figures and the glowing elegance of the colouring; but I cannot perceive that a likene≈øs to the original has been at all regarded. It is, in truth, a fancy picture, which ≈øhews the ≈økill of the painter; but it is not a portrait, which exhibits the ju≈øt features of the cau≈øe. It may impo≈øe on an inattentive ob≈øerver; but I tru≈øt that ≈øo delu≈øive a repre≈øentation will have no effect on this court, to whom all the facts are di≈øtinctly known, and who will form their judgment from an impartial view of the whole.</p>
                     <p>That the conduct of the comptroller did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the di≈øhone≈øt motives will appear, fir≈øt. From its being founded on an early opinion‚Äîconceived at a time when no advantage could be derived from it‚Äîan opinion fortified by that of the mo≈øt re≈øpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and re≈øulting from a thorough view of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Secondly. From all the circum≈øtances of the tran≈øaction which taken ≈øeperately or together evince the rectitude of his intentions.</p>
                     <p>The Senate will con≈øider that proof of his holding the≈øe opinions at a time when no private or intere≈øted views could po≈ø≈øibly actuate him, mu≈øt be deci≈øive. I will endeavor to trace the proofs of this in order of time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="471" facs="unknown:027132_0479_0FD3523E7808C9A0"/>(Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> then went into a minute examination of the evidence, and to prove the early and continued opinion of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> that New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he made ≈øeveral ob≈øervations, 1≈øt. Upon the letter of the Comptroller 30th September 1790, p. 271-2. 2d. His letter to the Governor 24th December 1791. p. 220-1. 3d. His letter to Secretary <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> 29th December 1791, p. 227. 4th. Upon the conference between him and the Secretary, p. 288. 5th. His report to the Governor 29th December 1792, p. 223-4. 6th. His plan of finance and his ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thereon, p. 284.)</p>
                     <p>Being ≈øatisfied that the≈øe certificates were ≈øub≈øcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could not avoid believing that they were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becau≈øe the≈øe were in fact convertible terms. As ≈øoon as the Bill or Act of 1792 was publi≈øhed for con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he informed Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> of his opinion on this point, in which that gentleman concurred; and in a conference with Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> it was agreed by them all, that whatever certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable were al≈øo redeemable. Hence it follows, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> opinion of their being redeemable was not a new opinion but ≈øub≈øtantially the ≈øame with that which he had entertained long before, and at a time when no po≈ø≈øible intere≈øt could influence him.</p>
                     <p>Although he perceived ≈øo early as the middle of March that the New-Loans would, if the bill pa≈ø≈øed, become redeemable, he was ≈øo far from de≈øiring to avail him≈øelf of the advantages it pre≈øented, that we find him ≈øolicitous to prevent its pa≈ø≈øing into a law. He even remon≈øtrated again≈øt it to ≈øeveral members of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly; and declared that he thought the words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øive enough to embrace bills of credit. But the repre≈øentations which he made to Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> and others were not attended to‚Äîthe Act was pa≈ø≈øed; and the door being opened, he had as good a right to enter as any other per≈øon.</p>
                     <p>From that time until June, when he certified ≈øome of the≈øe certificates to be a≈ø≈øumable, we have no proof
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:027132_0480_0FD352B27B273810"/>
of his opinion on this ≈øubject being expre≈ø≈øed; but his conduct ≈øhews that it was firmly fixed;‚Äî≈øo firmly that he ri≈øked his property and reputation upon it. He purcha≈øed this ≈øpecies of certificates with a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ≈øub≈øcribe them; nay, to ≈øub≈øcribe them under circum≈øtances, which made the hopes of profit <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon the ≈øoundne≈øs of his opinion;</hi> for he affected no concealment, and if he had, it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing. He knew al≈øo that if he was wrong in his con≈øtruction of the law, he would be expo≈øed to the lo≈øs of character.</p>
                     <p>In July, Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> who had heard the opinion of New-Loans being ≈øub≈øcribable, circulated out of doors, con≈øulted the Comptroller about it. Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> avowed the opinion, and ≈øatisfied the Regi≈øter-General of its ju≈øtne≈øs; and ≈øo fully that he did not think it nece≈ø≈øary to con≈øult any other officer, but pa≈ø≈øed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and ab≈øtracts, although he knew them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>New-Loans.</hi> He certified them to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and would have gone farther, if the warrants i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued upon them had not been ≈øtopped in his hands.‚Äî Why then is not the Regi≈øter included in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment? Becau≈øe it is evident that he acted from conviction of judgment. Why not extend the ≈øame charity to the Comptroller; for it is not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the under≈øtanding of the Regi≈øter is more cloudy or weak than that of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, we find the Comptroller avowing the ≈øame opinion to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who found him pa≈ø≈øing the account of Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> which related to New-Loan certificates. His expre≈ø≈øion was, "I am ≈øure I am right, and that it is the regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of the Act."</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that long before as well as after the Act, he con≈øtantly avowed one unvaried opinion on this ≈øubject, and under circum≈øtances which prove that it could be no other than the re≈øult of a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment.</p>
                     <p>Here it will be proper to notice a few objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="473" facs="unknown:027132_0481_0FD351EF40605FE0"/>1≈øt. It is ≈øaid, that the letter alledged to be written to the Governor on the 16th April 1792 did not include the New-Loans, and therefore that neither the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller nor Regi≈øter con≈øidered them as redeemable.‚Äî Admitting that ≈øuch a letter was written, which is very doubtful on the evidence, it is ≈øaid to have been in con≈øequence of the requi≈øition of the Governor, who de≈øired a calculation might be made of the quantity of ≈øtock nece≈ø≈øary to be ≈øold under the Act of 1792.‚ÄîThe calculation that was then made could only be founded on the 2d ≈øection, which did not include the New-Loans. The Act of Congre≈øs had not then pa≈ø≈øed; and the ≈øixth ≈øection of the law had then no operation, and it was therefore unnece≈ø≈øary to include <hi>the≈øe</hi> certificates in the calculation. For the ≈øame rea≈øon the Unfunded Depreciation were not included, although Me≈ø≈ørs. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin, Donnald≈øon</hi> and <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> concurred in opinion that they would be redeemable if Congre≈øs ≈øhould a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume them. Here, again, we may a≈øk, why do we acquit the Regi≈øter-General and not the Comptroller al≈øo?</p>
                     <p>Again: It was hinted, that whatever the language of the Act might have been, yet he knew the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Hou≈øe, which was explained to him by Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> The an≈øwer is, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> could only give his own opinion; the intention of the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be collected from the law; the Act ≈øpeaks for it≈øelf. Nothing more need be ≈øaid on this point.</p>
                     <p>From this review, the inference is clear, that the defendant was fully and hone≈øtly of opinion, that the≈øe certificates were both ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable.</p>
                     <p>I have ≈øaid that this opinion was ≈øtrongly fortified by that of the mo≈øt re≈øpectable characters.‚ÄîIt is true this is no <hi>proof</hi> of his con≈øtruction of the law being right; but it forms a ≈øtrong ground of excu≈øe if he was mi≈øtaken, to ≈øhew that others were mi≈øtaken with him. If it was an error, it certainly was an error which had the appearance of truth.</p>
                     <p>Among tho≈øe who entertained this opinion we find the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, who≈øe di≈øcernment and
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:027132_0482_0FD351F0A6F2B400"/>
penetration will be doubted by no one. It was his duty to decide in the fir≈øt in≈øtance upon this que≈øtion. He had called upon the Loan-officer for all the laws rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it, and he afterwards declared to him, "That the holders of the New-Loans have a right to ≈øub≈øcribe them; that he might endeavour to per≈øuade them to re-exchange their certificates, but if they per≈øi≈øted that he could not refu≈øe them." He intimates the ≈øame opinion to the Governor in his letter, 21≈øt December 1791, and the conference with the Comptroller was founded upon it. At this time, it is evident, he mu≈øt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Act of 1789, though he does not recollect that it was before him; and if he afterwards di≈øtru≈øted his former opinion, he explained it by adding, that it did not occur to him that the Act of 1789 was pa≈ø≈øed after the ratification of the Federal Con≈øtitution.‚ÄîBut the que≈øtion is, What was the Secretary's opinion at the time he had the conference with the Comptroller, not, what it appears to be at pre≈øent?</p>
                     <p>The Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans entertained the ≈øame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their ≈øub≈øcribability; ≈øo did Mr. <hi>Wolcot,</hi> as may be fairly inferred from his letter. The Governor al≈øo is officially apprized of the ≈øame opinion, and tho' he does not expre≈øs his concurrence, yet his conduct was founded on a belief that the Comptroller was right in his con≈øtruction of the law. Indeed it ≈øeemed ≈øo obvious a con≈øtruction, that few who examined the Act, doubted it. Almo≈øt all, whom he conver≈øed with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him. Mr <hi>Evans</hi> was convinced of the ≈øoundne≈øs of the opinion, and determined to adventure in a purcha≈øe of the≈øe certificates. Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> was convinced, though not <hi>deluded.</hi> Of the ≈øame opinion were Mr. <hi>Boggs,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Rittenhou≈øe,</hi> Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> and others. The la≈øt mentioned gentleman examined the Act which Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> ≈øhewed to him in the Council-chamber, and he was ≈øo fully ≈øatisfied, that he received the amount of his certificates from Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> who advanced the money, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him.‚ÄîWhy then ≈øhould it be deemed cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal

in the Comptroller to yield his a≈ø≈øent to what convinced ≈øo many?</p>
                     <p>Second. The hone≈øty of his intentions appears from all the circum≈øtances of the tran≈øaction.‚ÄîIf he had been con≈øcious of any unju≈øtifiable views he would have attempted concealment; but his conduct was open and fair. He concealed nothing but what was proper to be concealed; and as ≈øoon as the ≈øub≈øcription was made he was carele≈øs who knew it.</p>
                     <p>In the fir≈øt place, it appears that he made the loan, and ≈øub≈øcribed in his <hi>own name.</hi> It would have been ea≈øy to have u≈øed another's, and to have concealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf under the name of a friend. Again: He in≈øerted certificates in his ab≈øtract, which mu≈øt have di≈øcovered to the Regi≈øter-General and others, that they were New-Loans.‚ÄîThirdly. He did not attempt to hurry it through the offices. It lay there the u≈øual time and went through the u≈øual train of bu≈øine≈øs.‚ÄîBe≈øides, he knew that the ≈øub≈øcription of New-Loans mu≈øt be known not only to all the officers of the Trea≈øury of the United States, but al≈øo to the ≈øtate, when an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement for delivering up the Continental certificates became nece≈ø≈øary. He al≈øo certified the ab≈øtracts of others, who had no motives for concealment and would no doubt mention the tran≈øaction. In this ca≈øe, if his con≈øtruction of the law was not tenable, he would be obliged to refund. The clum≈øy fraud, if it had been a fraud, could not fail of being detected, and if it were detected, his hopes would be blown up, and mu≈øt have proved fruitle≈øs.</p>
                     <p>To the in≈øinuation that all this was done for the purpo≈øe of getting money into his hands <hi>for a time,</hi> which he could not finally keep, I have nothing to ≈øay. His circum≈øtances were not ≈øo mi≈øerably dependant as to make this pitiful ≈øcheme po≈ø≈øible.‚ÄîIn ≈øhort, he mu≈øt have been de≈øtitute of common ≈øen≈øe if he had acted thus openly and incautiou≈øly, without a perfect convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was legally as well as morally right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="476" facs="unknown:027132_0484_0FD352471F95E830"/>I ≈øhall now di≈ømi≈øs the fir≈øt and ≈øecond articles, and proceed briefly to examine the third and fourth.</p>
                     <p>I con≈øider the third article as a mere ≈øtatement of evidence, and if the two former articles cannot be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, neither can <hi>this,</hi> which is urged to prove his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt views and his endeavours to avoid di≈øcovery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For this purpo≈øe it is charged, 1. That he did not con≈øult the Regi≈øter. To this the an≈øwer is plain, that no law obliged him to con≈øult that officer; and why ≈øhould he have con≈øulted him when he had no doubts on the ≈øubject? Be≈øides, it was unnece≈ø≈øary; for ≈øoon after the law pa≈ø≈øed, he and the Regi≈øter ≈øettled the principle, that whatever was ≈øub≈øcribable was redeemable.‚ÄîA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: It is ≈øaid, 2. That "he did not con≈øult the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor;" and to this it has been replied, that the law directs him to con≈øult the Governor only in tho≈øe ca≈øes where the officers differ in opinion. It may be added that he did in fact appri≈øe the Governor of it when he informed him that the New-Loans were a ≈øub≈øcribable debt.‚ÄîIt is charged, 3. "That he did not <hi>di≈øcriminate</hi> in his certification nor in his accounts," &amp;c. As to this certification to the Loan-officer, it was not an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act, and the ≈øtate has nothing to do with the form of it; and as to the account rai≈øed and tran≈ømitted to the Governor, it is a deci≈øive an≈øwer that they were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the manner which had been ≈øettled in April 1791. The≈øe accounts <hi>originated</hi> in the Regi≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's office and were ≈øent up to the Comptroller mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for concurrence. Yet the purity of the Regi≈øter's views is not impeached, nor is <hi>he</hi> included in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øation.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, the ab≈øurdity of the charge is evident, for this conduct could not have been adopted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe or avoiding detection, becau≈øe the ≈øpecies or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates contained in the ab≈øtracts were di≈øcoverable from the ab≈øtracts them≈øelves: 1. By the different dates of intere≈øt. And, 2. By the reduction of the principal ≈øum, which took place in no other ≈øtate certificates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="477" facs="unknown:027132_0485_0FD352B48B1EA248"/>La≈øtly, it is ≈øaid that the checks of office were thereby de≈øtroyed. What checks are there pointed out by law or former u≈øage, which have not been ob≈øerved? There are none; and the Regi≈øter-General, even after he was informed that the ab≈øtracts comprehended New-Loans, pur≈øued the ≈øame method as before. There are no grounds for this flim≈øy charge, which ≈øeems to be thrown in merely to ≈øwell the account! (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made ≈øome further ob≈øervations on the evidence, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the fourth article.)</p>
                     <p>The fourth article depends upon the third‚Äî"In the <hi>above</hi> delu≈øive manner," &amp;c.‚ÄîIt is but another mode of ≈øtating the ≈øame thing.‚ÄîIf he be acquitted of the third charge, he cannot be convicted of this.‚ÄîThe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle goes on and ≈øays, that "he certified that the New-Loans were redeemable and payable." He had a <hi>right</hi> to do ≈øo, if by law they were redeemable‚Äîhe is <hi>excu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> in doing ≈øo, if he really thought them to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.‚ÄîAs to the funds, the Act of 1792 is not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, but that of April 1791. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then made ≈øome ob≈øervations on this Act to ≈øhew that this fund for claims might be applied to the redemption of the New-Loans.) There was no other fund than this for the redemption of the Unfunded Depreciation. Yet the Governor did not ≈øcruple to i≈ø≈øue warrants for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the≈øe, though it was evident from the amount of the intere≈øt ≈øtated in the accounts that it could ari≈øe from that ≈øpecies of certificates only.</p>
                     <p>Here again I may be permitted to a≈øk, why is not the Regi≈øter-General included in the accu≈øation, ≈øince he joined in this certification to the Governor as well as the defendant? Since both acted alike, why this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination? I am per≈øuaded that both are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
                     <p>But I quit this article, which is of no importance if the defendant ≈øhould be convicted of the other charges ‚Äîand if he is acquitted of them, he cannot be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this.‚ÄîThey depend one upon the other, in a manner that reminds us of the Indian philo≈øophy. The
<pb n="478" facs="unknown:027132_0486_0FD351F2CDBF68C0"/>
world, ≈øaid the <hi>Bramins,</hi> re≈øts upon the back of a great elephant‚Äîthe elephant on the back of a huge tortoi≈øe‚Äî and the tortoi≈øe on‚Äîthey did not know what. So the fourth article ≈øtands on the back of the third‚Äîthe third on the ≈øecond‚Äîthe ≈øecond on the fir≈øt‚Äîand the fir≈øt on ‚Äînothing at all.</p>
                     <p>We now come to charges of a different nature from tho≈øe which have hitherto pa≈ø≈øed in review before us. The fifth and ≈øixth articles are, however, ≈øub≈øtantially the ≈øame, and charge the defendant with availing him≈øelf of certain official advantages for the purpo≈øe of ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating in certificates. To the fir≈øt of the≈øe we might have ≈øafely demurred, and admitting the fact, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on the law that it is not impeachable. But this would have heen u≈øele≈øs, ≈øince the Senate being judges both of law and fact, will acquit the defendant, unle≈øs the facts proved are the proper ≈øubject of <hi>legal</hi> pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                     <p>Permit me to remind the Senate that impeachments mu≈øt be founded on the breaches of exi≈øting laws. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence may be ≈øhewn to the <hi>form,</hi> but none to the <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> of the charge: And an impeachment cannot make that criminal here which would not be ≈øo before the ordinary tribunals of ju≈øtice. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4 <hi>Black.</hi> Com. 256.2. <hi>H. P. C.</hi> 250, and <hi>Woodi≈øon's</hi> lectures.) Indeed the learned gentlemen, although one of them talks of "doing ≈øub≈øtantial ju≈øtice," will not openly contend that any thing is impeachable which is not ab≈øolutely illegal.</p>
                     <p>This honorable body therefore will recollect that they are not <hi>now</hi> to judge by the rules of expediency. That is the province of a Legi≈ølature not of a Court. Some things are lawful which many may think inexpedient; but while the citizen only exerci≈øes his rights, he is amenable only to the tribunal of public opinion. True liberty con≈øi≈øts in being always permitted to do that which the <hi>laws</hi> do not forbid; and a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been well defined to be a government of laws and not of men. We are, therefore, not to di≈øcu≈øs
<pb n="479" facs="unknown:027132_0487_0FD352B5B79C7728"/>
in this place the <hi>propriety</hi> or <hi>impropriety</hi> of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's conduct; but its <hi>lawfulne≈øs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulne≈øs.</hi> We are not to enquire whether in any in≈øtance he has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtepped the extreme delicacy of official conduct, but whether he hath overleaped the mounds of the law. Delicacy is one thing, crime is another; and we judge by very different rules re≈øpecting them. To mark the preci≈øe limits of the <hi>proper</hi> and the <hi>improper</hi> is the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of critici≈øm and ta≈øte; and the deci≈øion will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our education, habits, feelings and temper. ‚ÄîBut the law is the only ≈øtandard by which we can mea≈øure the conduct of a citizen criminally accu≈øed.</p>
                     <p>There are men of ≈øo ≈øoft a contexture, that far from in≈øi≈øting on their rights, they make the expedient the rule of their conduct. They will not even eat meat, if thereby they ≈øhould offend a weaker brother. They ≈øhrink like a ≈øen≈øitive plant from the touch of cen≈øure ‚Äîand their minds are accu≈øtomed to take the varying hue of public opinion. But men of more republican firmne≈øs will ≈øtand on their rights. They will judge for them≈øelves of the proper and improper; and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with confidence on the conclu≈øions of their own minds, they are ≈øatisfied if they find the laws do not prohibit their conduct.‚ÄîJudging therefore by the≈øe principles, the defendant mu≈øt be acquitted; for what law made it unlawful for him to purcha≈øe certificates in the manner this article ≈øtates?‚ÄîWhether ≈øuch official advantages ≈øhall be allowed or not, is a matter of <hi>po≈øitive</hi> regulation. Some ≈øtates allow their officers to ≈øpeculate in articles, in which their official ≈øituation gives them manife≈øt advantages: Some forbid them; and the general government prohibits it more generally than the ≈øtates. Thus in <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> the auctioneers were allowed to purcha≈øe at their own auctions until l783, when it was forbidden. The officers of the Cu≈øtoms by the laws of the ≈øtate mght have traded; by tho≈øe of the United States they cannot. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Trea≈øury and even the clerks in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice cannot ≈øpeculate in certificate; but in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:027132_0488_0FD352B9AB4D1158"/>
of our Trea≈øury it is different. So the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of our Land-office may deal with great advantage in land; and it is clearly lawful becau≈øe no Act forbids it.‚ÄîIf the conduct of any officer is in the opinion of the Executive manife≈øtly improper though not illegal, the remedy is by removal not by impeachment.</p>
                     <p>But in the ca≈øe before us there were no official advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that de≈øerve any con≈øideration. He could have bought the≈øe certificates as conveniently at a brokers as from tho≈øe who came to the office; and a ≈ømall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance would have poured them into his hands. He is charged with purcha≈øing them of <hi>many;</hi> but only two in≈øtances of ≈øuch purcha≈øes are proved; that from <hi>Oldden</hi> and that from <hi>Biddle.</hi> If this be criminal, by what Act is it made ≈øo?‚ÄîHe has broken no law of the ≈øtate, and therefore no guilt is imputable to him.</p>
                     <p>We now proceed to the ≈øixth article, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the fifth new-vamped. It charges the ≈øame facts but ≈øuppo≈øes that the certificates bought were really <hi>the property of the ≈øtate.</hi> This legal po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wholly unfounded. Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> ≈øtated the offer to exchange as an executed contract‚Äîand as a complete transfer of the certificates to the ≈øtate, before an <hi>actual</hi> exchange took place. But his rea≈øoning on this point is fallacious. The certificates were lodged merely for examination, and the indents, required to complete the exchange, were not offered. How then could they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the property of the commonwealth?</p>
                     <p>Let us bring this point to the touch-≈øtone of the law. Could the ≈øtate have ≈øued Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> for the indents? No, for an <hi>option</hi> is given him only on condition of his payment of the indents. The Act of 1789 permits, but does not compel an exchange. Again: Could <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> or <hi>Oldden</hi> have maintained a ≈øuit again≈øt the ≈øtate for the Continental certificates without an actual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the indents? Surely not; for it is ≈øettled, that where two concurrent acts are to be done at the ≈øame time, one party mu≈øt do all that on his part is to be done before he can maintain a ≈øuit again≈øt the other.‚Äî
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:027132_0489_0FD352BBEED5D288"/>
The property therefore remained as before. The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who lodged them, might have wre≈øted them from the Comptroller in an action of trover; and they would have been liable in his hands, to the debts of the individual.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides, it was the uninterrupted practice to re-deliver them, if required, after they had been lodged in the office. In proof of this we have the ca≈øes of <hi>Thomas Hale</hi> in 1791, <hi>Danniel Stroud</hi> in 1793 and Col. <hi>Porter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the gentlemen be right in their law, all the≈øe per≈øons were plundering the commonwealth, becau≈øe they took back their certificates‚Äîand yet they do not ≈øeem con≈øcious of any impropriety! But really this refinement on the charges is unworthy of a ≈øtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution!</p>
                     <p>It has been ≈øaid "that if the Comptroller delivered back the≈øe certificates to tho≈øe who lodged them, he was guilty of perfidy." Well Sir! the Comptroller offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed the Governor that <hi>S. Mark</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his certificates and parted with them to others. Here is an avowal of "this perfidy" to the Executive Magi≈øtrate who is ≈øo far from di≈ømi≈ø≈øing or puni≈øhing the Comptroller that he does not expre≈øs any ≈øurprize at the information. If this be a crime you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the defendant without involving the Governor in a degree of the ≈øame guilt.</p>
                     <p>There being, therefore, no ground to ≈øay that certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in that ≈øituation were the <hi>property of the ≈øtate,</hi> it follows that the 6th article does not differ from the fifth.</p>
                     <p>But we are told that re≈øpon≈øibility of officers is the great ≈øecurity of Republics. Sir, there is a re≈øpon≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of character and a re≈øpon≈øibility of puni≈øhment. The former we will an≈øwer in another place; the latter ari≈øes only from a breach of the laws. Shew us then the Act of A≈ø≈øembly that we have broken; if there be none, ≈øhew us at lea≈øt ≈øome adjudged ca≈øe which makes ≈øuch kind of dealing a crime. If there be ≈øuch a ca≈øe, it will ≈øweep like the ≈øcythe of time; it will cut down
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:027132_0490_0FD352BD40ADACF0"/>
great and ≈ømall, and many fair and unblemi≈øhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters will come within its reach and may be brought before this honorable court.</p>
                     <p>If there be circum≈øtances here that require further di≈øcu≈ø≈øion they ≈øhould be di≈øcu≈ø≈øed el≈øewhere. I wave any further enquiry‚Äîfor the Senate cannot decide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                     <p>I ha≈øten to the <hi>la≈øt</hi> article‚Äîand rejoice that at length I ≈øee land. The amount of this is, that he plundered the ≈øtate‚Äîthat he filched from the ma≈øs of public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty a certain certificate which had been exchanged with the commonwealth. If this be true, he mu≈øt be a wretch indeed! he would not de≈øerve the honor of an impeachment. Such a charge brought again≈øt <hi>any</hi> man ought to be well ≈øupported; but brought again≈øt a man of unblemi≈øhed character, the proof ought to be ≈øtrong indeed. It ought to be ≈øupported by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of witne≈ø≈øes, or at the lea≈øt, by the lucid te≈øtimony of one man ≈øpeaking po≈øitively to the fact, on who≈øe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and recollection the firme≈øt reliance might be placed. But what is the number of witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt the defendant?‚ÄîOne. What the impre≈ø≈øions on his memory? They re≈øemble the traces on the ≈øand of the ≈øea-≈øhore.</p>
                     <p>The charge is, That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> exchanged this certificate with the ≈øtate,‚Äîand as it was afterwards ≈øub≈øcribed by the defendant‚Äîthe inference is that he embezzled it.‚ÄîIt mu≈øt therefore be fir≈øt proved ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan did exchange it.</hi> Let us examine this.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that he had ≈øuch a certificate ≈øo late as September 1790;‚Äîand it is certain that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> had it in July 1792. He ≈øays he did not <hi>≈øell</hi> it to <hi>Nichol≈øon;</hi> but whether he exchanged it or not he cannot tell, for he ≈øold to others. Such certificates as were un≈øold he carried to the Comptroller to be exchanged. When the witne≈øs cannot ≈øwear that he delivered the certificate in que≈øtion to the defendant, can you, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:027132_0491_0FD327FE5C335858"/>
upon your oaths ≈øay that he did? Here is not the ≈øhadow even of pre≈øumptive proof!</p>
                     <p>Even in the ca≈øe of a mi≈øerable felon indicted for larceny, it mu≈øt be fir≈øt proved that a larceny was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, before he ≈øhall be put to make any defence. If the owner ≈øhould ≈øay, I cannot ≈øay it was ≈øtolen‚Äî" I had ≈øuch articles"‚Äî"I ≈øold to others."‚ÄîThe candor, of the Attorney-General would induce him to direct an acquittal. Principles e≈øtabli≈øhed for the ≈øafety of all mu≈øt not be violated. They require proof in this ca≈øe as well as in that ju≈øt ≈øtated: but Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> cannot recollect what became of the certificate in que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid altho' the evidence is not very per≈øpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yet it is ≈øufficient to oblige the defendant to ≈øhow how he came by it. No! <hi>They</hi> aver the fact. They cannot ≈øtir a ≈øtep till they have proved the exchange: But if any fact can be di≈øtinctly ≈øeen thro' the thick mi≈øt‚Äîthe palpable ob≈øcurity which the te≈øtimony of this witne≈øs has ≈øhed upon the tran≈øaction, I am ≈øure it is not the fact required. The witne≈øs will not ≈øwear that.</p>
                     <p>But it is urged "That if Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon bought</hi> this certificate, it is capable of proof." Indeed! then if Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan exchanged</hi> it, it is al≈øo capable of proof. "But the latter kept no account of his certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates!" and what proof have we that the former did. Why, it is ≈øaid, he is a regular man‚Äîhe keeps a diary! I appeal to you gentlemen if that was fairly urged; ≈øince we offered to produce it and they would not ≈øuffer it to be read. But that was a diary of his official, not of his private, tran≈øactions. It commenced in March 1792. How then could it a≈ø≈øi≈øt us in tracing a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ≈øub≈øcribed to the loan which clo≈øed in 1791?</p>
                     <p>Again it is ≈øaid, "If the per≈øon exi≈øts upon earth who ≈øold it to the defendant he may be produced." At pre≈øent it is ≈øufficient to a≈øk, What if he does not exi≈øt upon earth? Who can keep his witne≈ø≈øes alive? In what a terrible ≈øituation would many be if ≈øuch modes of proof are to prevail. Thou≈øands would be unable
<pb n="484" facs="unknown:027132_0492_0FD351F509547550"/>
to trace the certificates they hone≈øtly bought. They pa≈øs from hand to hand. Often no note made of the ≈øeller's name or of the purcha≈øe. In ≈øuch ca≈øe your own oath will not be received; and a purcha≈øe of this kind will be incapable of proof.</p>
                     <p>The danger of obliging a defendant to produce ≈øuch proof even when there are ≈øtrong pre≈øumptions again≈øt him is con≈øiderable. What would Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> have done, had <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> been dead?</p>
                     <p>Once more it is ≈øaid that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> delivered him <hi>many</hi> certificates. We an≈øwer that we <hi>bought</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The an≈øwer is equal to the proof.‚ÄîLa≈øtly, it was ≈øaid, "What other proof could be produced?" I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they ought clearly and po≈øitively to prove the exchange or to forbear the charge. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty in making ≈øuch proof if ≈øuch were the fact.</p>
                     <p>This is a ≈øufficient an≈øwer <hi>at pre≈øent.</hi> The time may come when this matter ≈øhall be fully under≈øtood. Here, in a criminal pro≈øecution, it would not be proper for him to an≈øwer upon oath; but in the civil ≈øuit, he will ≈øubmit to interrogatories. They may prove his heart to the bottom and I tru≈øt they will find it hone≈øt.</p>
                     <p>But what is the manner in which the te≈øtimony on this article has been taken?‚ÄîThe longer I live the more I perceive the nece≈ø≈øity and advantage of <hi>viva voce</hi> te≈øtimony in criminal pro≈øecutions.‚ÄîHad the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs been examined openly before you, the doubt or the certainty with which he ≈øpoke would have evidently appeared. But when his an≈øwers are reduced to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they appear to the be≈øt advantage, and we can only judge from the expre≈ø≈øion. Yet even this exhibits a recollection feeble and uncertain. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> is known to be a man of the mo≈øt perfect integrity and uprightne≈øs. He will not ≈øwear what he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; and in his examination the burden of the ≈øong is, <hi>I cannot recollect</hi>‚ÄîI cannot tell." (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then read the an≈øwers to ≈øhew how very frequently the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions occurred.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="485" facs="unknown:027132_0493_0FD351FAD3C06580"/>Can we then be ≈øure, even when he ≈øtates a fact, that he has not forgotten all the circum≈øtances attending it which ≈øerve to explain or qualify it? If every que≈øtion that leads to an explanation is an≈øwered with, "I cannot tell," or refu≈øed to be an≈øwered at all, what can we rely on? All that we can be ≈øure of is, that he carried a bundle of certificates to the Comptroller's office and left them with him, even without counting them, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he ≈øays, the mo≈øt unbounded confidence in Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> integrity. That the certificate in que≈øtion was one of them, we have not the ≈øhadow of proof.‚Äî Shall the defendant then be convicted on ≈øuch flim≈øy evidence‚Äîthe imperfect te≈øtimony of an unrecollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individual? There is no <hi>proof</hi> of the exchange‚Äî there is not even a probability‚Äîthere is a bare po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Even that po≈ø≈øibility is an≈øwered by our produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ab≈øtracts of the certificates exchanged by Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi> In the≈øe, the certificate in que≈øtion does not appear.‚ÄîWe might therefore venture to ≈øay that it is not po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p>Again≈øt ≈øuch evidence a ≈øimple denial of the charge is enough; but when it is aided by a fair fame and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right character, formed by a life of unblemi≈øhed inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, every ≈øu≈øpicion vani≈øhes.</p>
                     <p>When I ≈øpeak of character, I mean the reputation he enjoyed before the jealou≈øies and cruel ≈øu≈øpicions which the manner of conducting this bu≈øine≈øs has excited again≈øt him, exi≈øted. The≈øe however will not injure him here. We call no witne≈ø≈øes to prove his character becau≈øe it is well known. I appeal then to you, gentlemen, who have per≈øonally <hi>known</hi> him‚Äîto you who have known him <hi>long</hi>‚Äîto you who have known him <hi>intimately</hi>‚Äî who have looked as it were into his bo≈øom and ≈øeen the bottom of his heart‚ÄîI a≈øk you, if ye have not always found him an upright citizen‚Äîan hone≈øt man! Put this into the ≈øcale again≈øt that which is charged with the the accu≈øation‚Äîand ye will find that the proof again≈øt him is as du≈øt upon the balance.</p>

                        <pb n="486" facs="unknown:027132_0494_0FD352C10AED39D8"/>Here then let us pau≈øe; and from this point as from the eminence of truth, look back upon the field over which we have travelled. Where are the traces of this <hi>"fraud,</hi> di≈øhonour and perfidy," which have been ≈øo freely charged? Where are the "≈øpoils of his country" with which he has been loaded? Where do we perceive the arts, the tricks, the deceit, the undue concealment of which we have heard? Where is the <hi>peculation</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Where the <hi>delu≈øions</hi> by which he accompli≈øhed it? I ≈øee them not; they exi≈øt only in the creative imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ≈øpeaker (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> not in the evidence. I ≈øee a conduct open, but firm, and founded on the ba≈øis of the law. I ≈øee an hone≈øt mind acting from convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment: I ≈øee him exerci≈øing the rights of an independant citizen, and finally facing this accu≈øation with that intrepidity which is the characteri≈øtic of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
                     <p>We rely therefore with confidence upon your ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:‚Äîthat we ≈øhall be judged, not by opinion but by the law and the te≈øtimony; not by reports circulated out of doors, but by the te≈øtimony given here in court.</p>
                     <p>We feel not the weight of the accu≈øation; but we cannot be in≈øen≈øible to that of our accu≈øers.‚ÄîThe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øation of the Repre≈øentatives of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but in≈øpire prejudice.

                     <p>As this is the fir≈øt impeachment, we are now to make an experiment intere≈øting to republican government. We are to ≈øee if the citizen is as ≈øafe here as before the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tribunals of ju≈øtice. It is to decide, whether one order of the repre≈øentatives may ≈øafely be the judge when the other is the accu≈øer; and whether under any circum≈øtances it be advi≈øable to depart from a trial by a jury of our peers.‚ÄîAs for us, <hi>we</hi> have no doubt but
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:027132_0495_0FD352C33A399FD8"/>
that this Judicial authority is ≈øafely depo≈øited.

Do you, or do you not know whether the funded ≈øtock of the United States which Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> gave you in commutation of the New-Loan certificates mentioned in his interrogatories, was the ≈øtock ari≈øing from the ≈øub≈øcription of tho≈øe continental certificates which the ≈øtate had received from you on loan?</p>

Did you after your original continental certificates were depo≈øited on loan with the Comptroller-General, and at the ≈øame time or ≈øub≈øequently to your delivery of the New-Loan certificates to him to be exchanged, purcha≈øe the continental certificates originally loaned by you to the State, or become any way proprietor of the ≈øame?

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 3. This deponent after having depo≈øited the New-Loan certificates of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> with <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> as an agent and obliging acquaintance, and not in his official ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as Comptroller, did not then or at any ≈øub≈øequent time purcha≈øe the Continental certificates originally loaned by him to this ≈øtate, or become any way proprietor of the ≈øame. This deponent, on the contrary, was obliged to di≈øpo≈øe of ¬£.1300 out of, or being part of an original certificate for the ≈øum of ¬£.1969:8:2 i≈ø≈øued in his name, for ≈øervices rendered the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as pack-hor≈øe-ma≈øter, by Major <hi>Story,</hi> Commi≈ø≈øioner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ≈øettling and adju≈øting ≈øuch claims.

When you took your New-Loan certificates to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to be re-exchanged for Continental certificates, did you receive the Continental certificates from him, and then deliver them to him to be ≈øub≈øcribed in your name and for your u≈øe, as equivalent for the New-Loans depo≈øited with him, or did you before the receipt of the Continental certificates, and immediately after you depo≈øited the New-Loans reque≈øt Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to take the Continental certificates and ≈øub≈øcribe them on your behalf to the loan of the United States?</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø</hi> 4. This deponent ≈øays that in the year A. D, 1786, he thinks he exchanged the Continental certificates his property for New-Loan certificates of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and that he occa≈øionally drew intere≈øt which became due thereon, and that the ≈øaid certificates were in his this deponent's own care

and charge until the month of February, A.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 5. Did you re-exchange any New-Loan certificates for any of your original Continental certificates, or did you commute all your New-Loans with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> for funded ≈øtock of the United States?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 5. This deponent ≈øays he made no ≈øuch re-exchange; that he left his certificates as before mentioned with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> for the purpo≈øe of being funded in ≈øtock of the United States. That this deponent received the fir≈øt year's intere≈øt on ≈øaid ≈øtock on the 10th of April, A. D. 1792 on Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> order in this deponent's favour, as before mentioned; but that he had not then or previous to his receiving the ≈øaid certificates ≈øo funded in ≈øtock of the United States, ≈øeen the ≈øaid certificates ≈øo obtained in lieu of his ≈øaid New-Loan certificates, but had under≈øtood they were i≈ø≈øued in his name. But this deponent further ≈øaith that he had not at any time previous to the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of January la≈øt pa≈øt, when they were returned to him.

If you an≈øwer affirmatively to the fir≈øt and ≈øecond of the defendant's interrogatories, relate why the Continental certificates ≈øo depo≈øited on loan were ≈øub≈øcribed by Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> to the loan of the United States on your account?</p>

                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 6. This deponent ≈øays, that the an≈øwer to this que≈øtion is given in his reply to interrogatory fir≈øt on the part of the ≈øaid <hi>Nichol≈øon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 7. Had you any other tran≈øaction with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> either in exchanging or commuting certificates of any de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion except that of commuting your New-Loans for funded debt of the United States? If yea, plea≈øe to relate the ≈øame ≈øo far as ≈øuch tran≈øactions re≈øpect the ≈øaid New-Loans, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> paid you therefor?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An≈ø.</hi> 7. This deponent does not recollect having any other tran≈øaction with the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> in exchanging or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting of certificates than before mentioned, except the loaning of three certificates, one in the name of <hi>James Reynolds</hi> for the ≈øum of ¬£. 12:15:2; one in the name of <hi>John Bri≈øby</hi> for the ≈øum of ¬£.4:4:6 and one other in the name of <hi>James Smith</hi> for the ≈øum of ¬£.4:19:6 in the New-Loans, for their ≈øeveral u≈øes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øited with this deponent, and for which he holds him≈øelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="496" facs="unknown:027132_0504_0FD328216C3BDA40"/>
to them or their repre≈øentatives, further than that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> at this deponent's reque≈øt, gave him two certificates one for ¬£. 1300; the other for ¬£. 669:8:2 in lieu of a New-Loan certificate in his name for ¬£. 1969:8:2, and which this deponent forthwith returned to the ≈øaid <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> upon receiving the ≈øaid two loan certificates equal in amount to the loan certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate by him returned as afore≈øaid‚Äîand this deponent ≈øays that his rea≈øon for reque≈øting the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> as Comptroller, to divide the ≈øaid certificate, was to enable this deponent to make ≈øale of the certificates for ¬£. 1300, in order to enable this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to di≈øcharge debts due by him. And that this tran≈øaction of i≈ø≈øuing and granting the two certificates equal in amount to the one returned, was in the month of September in the year 1790, as near as this deponent can recollect.</p>
                        <p>

again≈øt the Comptroller-General of the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> This cau≈øe is very important in it≈øelf, from the nature of the charges, the high authority of the tribunal, and the intere≈øt of the party. I tru≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs that this la≈øt con≈øideration will not influence the tribunal, but that if ≈øtrong ample evidence be produced, the conviction of the defendant will be the con≈øequence, public ju≈øtice require that a meritorious and innocent per≈øon who ≈øhould receive an injury ≈øhould be acquitted: The ≈øame principles demand the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the guilty, as an acquittal in the re≈øpect would be improper.

                     <p>We find the ≈øame Con≈øtitution denies the Supreme Executive the power of pardoning. The Senate in ca≈øes of conviction is therefore in ≈øome degree ve≈øted with a di≈øcretionary power to puni≈øh. The ≈øame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution has certain limits which cannot be pa≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but within the extremities of it are certain di≈øcretion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary powers. The puni≈øhment of the officer ≈øhould be proportionate to the nature of the offence or mi≈øde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor. What if an officer is found unworthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and unfit to ≈øerve his country?

                     <p>The two fir≈øt articles can be con≈øidered in one point of view; the ≈øeveral Acts of Congre≈øs and A≈ø≈øembly to which each of the≈øe articles refers, makes it proper to cla≈øs them together, as the ob≈øervations and rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will bring them into one point of view at the ≈øame time <hi>(He then read the ≈øub≈øtance of the two fir≈øt articles.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the facts contained in the≈øe two articles, they are plainly proved, or openly acknowledged and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It appears from an in≈øpection of all the ab≈øtracts except his own large one, that they are certified to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> in the hand writing of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General. It hath been remarked on by every gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man engaged as coun≈øel for the defendant, but not much relied on, that his own ab≈øtract was not certified <hi>genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable;</hi> I am clearly of opinion, that it need not be much relied on; for if one ≈øingle in≈øtance can be proved, in which he criminally certified New-loan certificates to be <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable,</hi> it is ≈øufficient to ≈øupport the charges.</p>
                     <p>They ≈øay he certified none of his own ab≈øtracts. When the circum≈øtances come to be con≈øidered, all his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracts are in his own hand-writing, and contain all the information to the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans that he could de≈øire. Advert to the two fir≈øt articles, he is not charged that he certified on the face of the ab≈øtracts; but he is charged with recognizing, certifying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring New-Loans <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable,</hi> If there is any ≈øpecies of common law proof, that he certified to the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, it is ≈øufficient to ≈øupport the charges; then why will it not appear as well from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracts being made out in his own hand-writing. He was early called upon by <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> the Commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Loans, for checks to prevent counterfeits and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition;
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:027132_0508_0FD352E803A77C60"/>
Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øends two certificates to him (≈øee letters page 271-2.) What can be more ≈øatisfactorily proven, than that the commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans thought them a≈ø≈øumable, when the ab≈øtracts appeared in his own hand-writing?</p>
                     <p>With regard to the certification to the Governor (≈øee letter, page 356) it was certainly official. This will not be di≈øputed here as it hath been el≈øewhere, where they contend that he certified as <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> and not as Comptroller-General. If neither the laws of the Union, or of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> enjoined it on him, this is a very ≈øingular and ≈øtrange doctrine indeed!</p>
                     <p>In thus certifying it is very true, that he acted in his official capacity. Nineteen twentieths of the agency of the public officers ace not pre≈øcribed by law, ≈øo in the departments of the Land-office, Finance or any others, there are various in≈øtances in all of them to be di≈øcovered, which are not particularly mentioned in the laws; the Acts generally point out only the outlines of the different offices. To act contrary to the cour≈øe of the offices, or to devi≈øe ways and means in oppo≈øition to the rotine of the offices, are offences again≈øt the≈øe Acts, equally obvious as if ≈øpecially and expre≈øsly pointed out by law.</p>
                     <p>Independently, therefore, the Comptroller-General could not act in any other than in his official character. The commonwealth of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øted in that Act; ≈øhe wi≈øhed to act fairly and ≈øecurely with the United States. If the law is not expre≈ø≈øive enough, ≈øhall nothing be done? Every officer was to act according to the duties of his re≈øpective department and when called upon to act with zeal in his official ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                     <p>We therefore find <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> deeply intere≈øted in the due execution of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, which made redeemable the debts which were ≈øub≈øcribable. It was of great con≈øequence to <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> that none ≈øhould be improperly ≈øub≈øcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="501" facs="unknown:027132_0509_0FD352ED7B8B06D8"/>How can the Comptroller-General deny his official agency? That officer and the Regi≈øter-General, in their joint communication to the Governor (≈øee letter, page 217, 218) are conclu≈øive on this head, wherein they point out the mode of conducting this bu≈øine≈øs with the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans: <hi>"Examine the ≈øame as to their being genuine certificates and a≈ø≈øumable,"</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>How then can the Comptroller-General ≈øay, that he was not acting in his official department?</p>
                     <p>I now come to the con≈øideration of the que≈øtion, whether the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable as State debts to the loan opened by the Act of Congre≈øs of the 4th of Augu≈øt 1790. It hath ever been impre≈ø≈øed on my mind, that independent of the Act of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> of the 27th March 1789, New-Loans were not ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the loan of Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>After the adoption of the pre≈øent Con≈øtitution, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs found her≈øelf ea≈øy in her ≈øituation and perfectly competent to the ≈øatisfying all her dome≈øtic debt; and then contemplated the ≈øituation of the different ≈øtates; among them ≈øhe ≈øaw a number of individuals labouring under debts created by the war; ≈øhe contemplated the taking of ≈øuch, as in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, the United States were not ≈øubject to be called upon, nor liable to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on them. This was the motive the General Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had for opening the loan.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen have mentioned the de≈øcription of <hi>State Debts</hi> receivable in this loan, and then a≈øk if the New-Loans are not comprehended under this de≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! It is true they are, but tho≈øe are not the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requi≈øites; for in the ≈øame ≈øection we find, they mu≈øt be <hi>i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies:</hi> The≈øe were the e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øential requi≈øites, and the New-Loans <hi>being only grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others,</hi> they could not be within the meaning of the Act.</p>
                     <p>Now, ≈øuppo≈øe for a moment that the New-Loans were receivable, what would be the effect? <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> was to have the benefit of ≈øub≈øcribing 2,200,000 dollars; nay, let us ≈øuppo≈øe twice the ≈øum if you plea≈øe,
<pb n="502" facs="unknown:027132_0510_0FD352EF1D59EE68"/>
for there was then near twice the ≈øum out, the ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New-Loans would exclude the proper State debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> This would burthen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which the law was de≈øigned to a≈ø≈øi≈øt. How would <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> be ca≈øed then? Her condition would not be meliorated, for New-Loans are in effect no more than Continental certificates, only in another name.</p>
                     <p>The 18th ≈øection of the law of Congre≈øs was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced not to invite the New-Loan holders to ≈øub≈øcribe, but from an apprehen≈øion that they would be offered, and to guard again≈øt the con≈øequences. This clau≈øe (18th ≈øection) hath been, and I ≈øuppo≈øe will again be urged, that the≈øe New-Loan certificates will be received. They might by po≈ø≈øibility, or by mi≈øtake be ≈øub≈øcribed, but then all intere≈øt is to cea≈øe until the Continental certificates be delivered up. Can it be ≈øuppo≈øed that Congre≈øs would a≈ø≈øume them, when double intere≈øt might have been paid on the ≈øame ≈øum?</p>
                     <p>New-Loans were never a money debt of <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> neither were they ≈øub≈øcribable or redeemable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her laws. The con≈øideration of this part leads me to think that Congre≈øs never meant to include them in the a≈ø≈øumption.</p>
                     <p>But a more important que≈øtion ari≈øes, that is, Can they be contemplated as ≈øub≈øcribable after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 1789?</p>
                     <p>I apprehend New-Loans were never a money debt to be paid on or before the year 1796. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Act of 1786.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loan was a certificate of a contract or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between the commonwealth and the public creditors, her citizens. The intent of which was that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> engaged to pay the intere≈øt half yearly, and the creditor pledged with her his certificate as a ≈øecurity, the provi≈øion was intended as a temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to continue until Congre≈øs ≈øhould be able to di≈øcharge her own engagements, and then if <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> cho≈øe ≈øhe might authori≈øe an exchange of New-Loans
<pb n="503" facs="unknown:027132_0511_0FD32821A7410AB0"/>
for Continental certificates, and the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors have re≈øort to Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Our attention hath been called to the Act of December 18th, 1780, for the depreciation of the the pay of the army; and it is a≈øked, why ≈øhould not <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> a≈ø≈øume the one as well as the other? It was in order to ≈øhew when <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> contemplated a permanent debt ≈øhe knew how to di≈øtingui≈øh between the depreciation certificates and tho≈øe i≈ø≈øued in 1786. The depreciation certificates were i≈ø≈øued at the earne≈øt ≈øolicitation of Congre≈øs; this commonwealth agreed to a≈ø≈øume the depreciation certificates, Congre≈øs being unable to pay the debt, called upon the individual ≈øtates to pay it, promi≈øing at the ≈øame time, that they would repay them.</p>
                     <p>Here then, are circum≈øtances and inducements to do the one, and not the other. All ≈øhe did was to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ≈øum due to each per≈øon for the depreciation of his pay in the army, the Act makes a provi≈øion for the redemption both of principal and intere≈øt, and re≈øerves the right of paying them off in ≈øpecie, or in any other current money equivalent.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceed to con≈øider the nature of New-Loan certificates. Previous to the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 16th March 1785, it is obvious to the recollection of every per≈øon, that the war was then over, the Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation ≈øhewed it≈øelf inadequate to the purpo≈øes of good government; Congre≈øs had a great foreign and do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> for re≈øources and revenues. In this torpid ≈øitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the public creditors who were citizens of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania,</hi> laboured under inconveniences, re≈øorted to their own government, praying relief.</p>
                     <p>The Legi≈ølature then pa≈ø≈øed the Act of the 16th of March 1785, in which ≈øhe ordered her quota ¬£.123932 of intere≈øt to be paid into the Loan-office of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and ordered the Loan-officer to pay it to the public creditors, citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> this ≈øhe did at the pre≈ø≈øing ≈øolicitations of her citizens; who were
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:027132_0512_0FD3281B759B8A90"/>
in di≈øtre≈øs, as Congre≈øs could not relieve them, this is ≈øtated in the preamble to be their motive, the 18th ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes it temporary until Congre≈øs could pay; this is the ≈øpirit and intention of the law of 1785, the ≈øame motives pervade all the ≈øub≈øequent Acts on the ≈øubject: And her de≈øigns were never to make any other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments further than therein contained.</p>
                     <p>It may be a≈øked, and I now mention it, why did not <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> a≈ø≈øume all this debt, as ≈øhe did in the ca≈øe of the depreciation of the pay of the army? <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> It was not done at the de≈øire or in≈øtance of Congre≈øs, but by her own voluntary act. If this commonwealth had waited for the recognition of Congre≈øs, perhaps Congre≈øs would not recogni≈øe what <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had done. She knew this appropriation was unplea≈øant and di≈øagreeable to Congre≈øs, who wanted her≈øelf the application of the funds in her own hands. Moreover the depreciation of the pay of the army, was an a≈øcertained ≈øum very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and far inferior to the other debt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the object of the act of 1785, was found di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Congre≈øs, and in September 1785, ≈øix months afterwards Congre≈øs determined to defeat the provi≈øions of that act, as being di≈øagreeable to her, and gave directions to her officer accordingly. Thus we find all the benevolence, all the advantages intended by <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> ab≈øolutely defeated by tho≈øe re≈øolves of Congre≈øs, and the creditors reduced to the ≈øame difficult ≈øituation they were in before the pa≈ø≈øing of the act of 1785. Thus circum≈øtanced, when the Legi≈ølature met in March 1786, ≈øhe found the ≈øame cau≈øe exi≈øting as in 1785, the creditors ≈øtill craving further relief, as there had been no change in their condition ≈øince March 1785; it was a rea≈øonable idea, that finding the citizens, public creditors in the ≈øame ≈øituation, ≈øhe ≈øhould contemplate how they might make ≈øome other provi≈øions for the exigencies of tho≈øe creditors on the ≈øame ground, ≈øame principles and ≈øame manners: It is pre≈øumed, that the ≈øame men called upon to act in the cour≈øe of one year would act as they did before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="505" facs="unknown:027132_0513_0FD352F04012E008"/>It was not nece≈ø≈øary to give more relief, but it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to give it in a different way. The Legi≈ølature rea≈øoned a little here, they con≈øidered their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was defeated by Congre≈øs. How was it to be done? It was a perplexing thing; ≈øome other mode mu≈øt be adopted without the intervention of the public offices of Congre≈øs; ≈øome good arrangements were nece≈ø≈øary. It would not do to ≈øay, that every creditor ≈øhould bring his bundle of Continental certificates to the State-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurer to receive his intere≈øt on them; this was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable and un≈øafe to the commonwealth; be≈øides, where was her ≈øecurity, that if ≈øhe paid ≈øo, it ever would be repaid her? The Legi≈ølature knew that it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øant bu≈øine≈øs to Congre≈øs, and that ≈øhe defeated the ≈øame mea≈øure ≈øix months before.</p>
                     <p>Some other mode mu≈øt therefore be devi≈øed; the idea of a loan was propo≈øed, and the expedient adopted; the i≈ø≈øuing of New-Loans were devi≈øed only to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient mode to the creditor, and to continue only till Congre≈øs ≈øhould do ju≈øtice to all her own creditors. How is this project to be carried into execution? We find, Sir, to effect this bu≈øine≈øs, ≈øhe directs certain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of her own to be i≈ø≈øued and given in exchange for Continental certificates: The amount of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates, their numbers, dates and other e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øential circum≈øtances of the debt to be ≈øtated in a large margin; it is worthy of attention to con≈øider how it was directed to be done. <hi>(Mr, Wilcocks then read a part of the Act of March</hi> 1786.) The preamble ≈øhews the Act of 1786 grew out of the re≈øolves of Congre≈øs, which defeated the Act of 1785, and only went to ≈øecure the intere≈øt, becau≈øe it was not done at the call of Congre≈øs, but voluntarily by <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> to relieve her own citizens. It is "inexpedient" to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that law, ≈øays the Legi≈ølature, but ju≈øt and rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that our creditors ≈øhould be relieved as far as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances will admit. The Trea≈øurer is to provide certificates with a proper <hi>margin</hi> ≈øufficient to contain the e≈ø≈øentials of the debt to be ≈øecured. It was calculated
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:027132_0514_0FD328224D79DFF8"/>
with this view to make it ea≈øy to return it; they never meant an ab≈øolute engagement, never meant to pay, el≈øe why not make a certificate for the amount of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intere≈øt? Every caution was taken by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature to ≈øhew they meant ≈øomething beyond a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe: Had they de≈øigned a purcha≈øe they would have required the principal and intere≈øt to be calculated, and have directed a certificate to i≈ø≈øue at once for their amount, not doing it ≈øhews they did not de≈øign a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe; an individual would have given his bond for the amount; therefore the ca≈øe of the depreciation New-Loan certificates are very different; in the depreciation there was no margin, they meant different things, a ≈øpecial ≈øpecies of ≈øecurity, to contain the e≈ø≈øentials of the debts thereby to be ≈øecured, and the annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intere≈øt which ≈øhall have been made thereon, to be prepared by the Trea≈øurer, delivered to the Compt. Gen. to be by him counter≈øigned and delivered out.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, I tru≈øt from the≈øe ob≈øervations, that the ca≈øe of the i≈ø≈øuing of depreciation and New-Loans are very different, and that the Legi≈ølature meant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this as the mo≈øt convenient mode to facilitate the payment of intere≈øt on the New-Loans. All the≈øe circum≈øtances mentioned to be recorded in the margin, and directed by the Act are as good as if they had a place in the very body of the certificate, and are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a part of the contract.</p>
                     <p>The marginal notes and the printed part are one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, as if they had borrowed or received per margin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al notes ≈øuch a certificate and to ≈øuch an amount ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the margin: That the Comptroller-General or Trea≈øurer might not be at the trouble of going over and over again the Continental certificates, but be able at one view on what ≈øum intere≈øt is to be calculated.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, if the≈øe things be ≈øo, it appears by this Act of A≈ø≈øembly that the New-Loans were never an evidence of a money debt but an evidence of a ≈øpecial contract to pay the intere≈øt, and the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt to be ultimately paid by the United States.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="507" facs="unknown:027132_0515_0FD3283D1A59A6B8"/>The next con≈øideration is, that of whatever nature the engagements of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> were, they were done away by the repealing law of March 1789.</p>
                     <p>All the laws preceding that Act were of a temporary nature, calculated to remove the difficulties of the times, and only to continue until Congre≈øs ≈øhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, which provi≈øion was now made, the 27th of March 1789 being the day ≈øo long wi≈øhed for, now the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief is withdrawn (Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> read the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Act of 1789) with regard to the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Legi≈ølature there can be no doubt of their de≈øigns, they could mean nothing le≈øs than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away all obligations under which they lay by the preceding laws.</p>
                     <p>Nothing remained but to make the provi≈øion, which is ab≈øolutely and completely done in the ≈øub≈øequent ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Act. In the ca≈øe of two individuals, one of whom is indebted to the other, if a law is pa≈ø≈øed or a circum≈øtance takes place to acquit the debtor from the payment of principal and intere≈øt, can any obligation remain? Is not the debt di≈øcharged? How then, is it po≈ø≈øible any thing el≈øe can be meant here, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely to annul the debt?</p>
                     <p>The third ≈øection directs the manner in which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was to have been effected, and when that was done, they had performed all that in ju≈øtice and equity they could be called upon to do.</p>
                     <p>It was not a contract for the payment of money but only payment of intere≈øt for four years, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but directing the manner of returning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates; <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> then had acquitted her≈øelf with honor and character from any engagement ≈øhe was under from the New-Loan creditors.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable that the words <hi>pay</hi> and <hi>≈øecure</hi> are made u≈øe of at the i≈ø≈øuing of the certificates by the law of 1786, which are al≈øo u≈øed in the repealing Act of March 1789, ju≈øt commen≈øurate to the law of 1786; this preci≈øion is worthy of attention, it makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal commen≈øurate to the obligation, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:027132_0516_0FD3535B990F5C08"/>
to be annulled by the u≈øe of tho≈øe words‚Äîmeaning <hi>to pay</hi> the intere≈øt, and <hi>to ≈øecure</hi> the return of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates; and being u≈øed in the repealing Act de≈øigned to revoke the pa≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Whether or not this law was repugnant to the Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States, if the above are right, the Con≈øtitution need not be attended to, becau≈øe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was impaired by this commonwealth, the contract being in its origin only conditional. Therefore, Sir, I apprehend the law of 1789 is not to be taken in the defendant's view, but as an Act of the Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> intended to do good in the different means pointed out by the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>The Con≈øtitution of the United States, ≈øo far from deviating from, actually concurred with the repealing Act of March 1789 in defeating the obligations of the Act of 1786, and repealed the contract of it≈øelf: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the funds were thereby transferred to Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Let us attend to ≈øee in what manner the contract was impaired, if at all. The funds were a part of the contract, as much ≈øo as any other. The New-Loan holders a≈ø≈øented to the change, and con≈øented that the revenues and impo≈øts ≈øhould be taken away from this commonwealth and be for ever ve≈øted in the United States; the New-Loan holders were repre≈øented in convention, then that part of the contract was repealed, annulled and made void.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it may be ≈øaid with more truth, that the Con≈øtitution repealed the obligation of the Act of 1786, than that the law of 1789 is in violation thereof, and again≈øt the ≈øpirit of the Con≈øtitution.</p>
                     <p>If then the law of 1786 was not a purcha≈øe of the certificates, but an engagement ≈øuch as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the State is fairly and honorably di≈øcharged, and ≈øhe di≈øengaged her≈øelf by offering the holders the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates which ≈øhe had received.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceed to con≈øider whether the New-Loans are redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="509" facs="unknown:027132_0517_0FD352D79489E770"/>When we come to con≈øider that law, we ≈øhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably find that the Legi≈ølature intended to place all the financial engagements of the State on as ≈øimple a footing as po≈ø≈øible, by a≈øcertaining the <hi>extent</hi> of all her <hi>debts,</hi> and to di≈øcharge the mo≈øt of them by <hi>payment,</hi> the means by which this was to be accompli≈øhed was a ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock therein enumerated.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt ≈øection directs the payment of intere≈øt on all certificates that bore intere≈øt to the time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came due.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øecond ≈øection authori≈øes the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock as much as ≈øhould have been nece≈ø≈øary to redeem, 1. All certificates bearing an intere≈øt of 6 per cent. 2. Six per cent. purparts on the deferred ≈øtock of the United States. 3. All three per cent. purparts; and 4. Dollar money.</p>
                     <p>The above ≈øection comprehended every ≈øpecies of State debt, the unfunded depreciation and New-Loan debt excepted; the intere≈øt only of the New-Loans was an engagement, and the unfunded depreciation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øuppo≈øed to be in the hands of ≈øpeculators with a long arrear of intere≈øt, being bought up at a low rate, It was thought it might as well re≈øt to be redeemed at the Land-office.</p>
                     <p>Let us ≈øee if it is po≈ø≈øible, they ever contemplated the redemption of any other debts than tho≈øe enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ≈øecond ≈øection.</p>
                     <p>The third ≈øection provides for the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock, and giving warrants for its delivery.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ≈øection directs the Comptroller and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter-General to keep the accounts.</p>
                     <p>The fifth ≈øection provides how they are to be paid on the 1≈øt of July, after due notice be given, and the certificates be depo≈øited.</p>
                     <p>In this manner and thus far, it ≈øhould ≈øeem, ample provi≈øion had been made to pay off the≈øe ≈øtate debts. It was not known at this time that Congre≈øs would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely open their loan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="510" facs="unknown:027132_0518_0FD352F1D98AE508"/>Then comes the ≈øixth ≈øection, which we con≈øider and contend as a provi≈øo, as much as if the Legi≈ølature had ≈øaid that you ≈øhall at all events have your money, but there is an event which yet may happen, if Congre≈øs ≈øhould open their loan, we will impo≈øe an additional duty, that is, that you the holders of certificates ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribable to the loan ≈øo to be opened, ≈øhall not be treated and paid in the manner mentioned in the five foregoing ≈øections, but you ≈øhall be obliged to one thing more, namely, ≈øub≈øcribe your certificates to the loan, and transfer them to the State-Trea≈øurer for the u≈øe of the commonwealth, and then you ≈øhall receive your pay. The redemptive powers of the 6th ≈øection, were never de≈øigned to exceed tho≈øe in the 2d ≈øection, and was only a different modification upon the event of Congre≈øs opening their loan. <hi>(Mr. Wilcocks then read the 6th ≈øection.)</hi> All the ≈øub≈øequent ≈øections of the law are eventually provi≈øional, in ca≈øe the price pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed could not be procured for the ≈øtock, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the fifth ≈øection be delayed, &amp;c‚ÄîI ≈øay every other part of the ≈øections are provi≈øional.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, we are told this 6th ≈øection is an independent clau≈øe, and conceived ≈øo exten≈øive as to oblige the ≈øtate to redeem whatever Congre≈øs ≈øhould have a≈ø≈øumed. Even old bills of credit mu≈øt be paid by the State if Congre≈øs would a≈ø≈øume them. <hi>(Mr. Wilcocks was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by Mr. Lewis, who ≈øaid, Bills of Credit were not included in the te≈øtimony. Mr. Wilcocks repeated that it was given in evidence, as the opinion of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, that if old bills of credit were a≈ø≈øumed by Congre≈øs, the State would be obliged to redeem them.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a good rule in the con≈øtruction of ≈øtatutes, to con≈øider all together, but how much more ≈øo in the pre≈øent in≈øtance of the individual Act of the 10th April 1792, the ≈øixth ≈øection ≈øhould not be con≈øidered inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently, but connected with the other ≈øections of the ≈øame Act.</p>
                     <p>This is plainly and obviou≈øly militating again≈øt the defendant, and his Coun≈øel; they ≈øay the State commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

her≈øelf to Congre≈øs; this con≈øtruction is narrow; the true and ju≈øt con≈øtruction is not to enlarge the bounds of redeemability; in that ca≈øe the ≈øixth ≈øection is a provi≈øo to the ≈øecond. When two con≈øtructions are brought into view, the one ab≈øurd and incon≈øi≈øtent, the other rational and con≈øi≈øtent, ari≈øing from a comparative view of the whole Act, no doubt can be entertained which of them will be adopted. Shall a con≈øtruction ≈øo in≈øulting to the integrity and under≈øtanding of our Legi≈ølature be courted? To ≈øay, that they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them≈øelves to Congre≈øs, that they blindly threw them≈øelves into the arms of Congre≈øs, ≈øo unre≈øtrained, ≈øo regardle≈øs of their duty, void of prudence and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to ≈øuppo≈øe that the ≈øixth ≈øection was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øive than the fir≈øt and ≈øecond, as to embrace every de≈øcription of State debts; we will redeem whatever Congre≈øs will a≈ø≈øume!</p>
                     <p>No Act of Congre≈øs was then extended; it appears an unrea≈øonable and extravagant ≈øuppo≈øition; the idea cannot be admitted on any other ground, but that the Legi≈ølature were remi≈øs, and did not do their duty.</p>
                     <p>But the law of February 1795<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> providing for the unfunded depreciation certificates being redeemed, ≈øhews they con≈øidered nothing redeemable but what the ≈øecond ≈øection compri≈øed. <hi>(Mr. Lewis a≈øked Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, Do you produce a legi≈ølative con≈øtruction after the fact happened, as a proof where many of the unfunded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates were redeemed? Mr. Wilcocks ≈øaid he meant to ≈øhew the ≈øen≈øe of the Legi≈ølature, that by this law of 1793, their ≈øen≈øe of the law of</hi> 1792 <hi>was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the unfunded depreciation; therefore the New-Loans could not be included.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It therefore appears that New-Loan certificates were di≈øcarded by <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> the State had acquitted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf; the arrears of intere≈øt on them were to be paid; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequently, it is impo≈ø≈øible that New-Loans could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the Act of 1792, when in 1793 ≈øhe declared that even unfunded depreciation certificates were not contemplated to be redeemable by the Act of 1792.</p>

                        <p>But ≈øay the learned Coun≈øel for the defendant, there were ways and means, there is a fund for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New-Loan debt, under the heads of <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improvements,</hi> by the act of the 7th of April 1791. By this, ≈øay the gentlemen, it is provided "to pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> by virtue of any law or laws of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth." This appears to me one of the mo≈øt ≈øingular ideas that hath been ≈øtarted in the whole cour≈øe of this mo≈øt important cau≈øe; 1. If it was liable for the New-Loan debt, ≈øtill this fund was not named, the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller did not draw out of this fund, but out of the fund created by the ≈øale of 3 per cent. ≈øtock under the act of April 10th, 1792. Therefore this argument and the certifications of the Comptroller-General, mu≈øt be diametrically oppo≈øite. This ≈øeems oppo≈øite to the knowledge of every per≈øon who is any ways conver≈øant in legi≈ølative appropriations.</p>
                        <p>This fund was a few years before limited to ¬£. 10,000, and therefore in≈øufficient for the purpo≈øe; it is true, by the act of the 7th of April 1791, the limitation is taken away, and makes it the la≈øt appropriation; every other obligation is done away, but ≈øtill holds with equal force, yet ≈øtill the fir≈øt act ≈øhews their idea of its probable amount, out of this claim Mr. <hi>Rittenhou≈øe</hi> and others, were paid, for ≈øurveying the <hi>Lanca≈øter</hi> road. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the idea of the Legi≈ølature was to make it a fund on which the Legi≈ølature might draw, but not to be drawn on, at the di≈øcretion of the Governor or other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. Then there is a nece≈ø≈øity for an order of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature
<pb n="513" facs="unknown:027132_0521_0FD3283E98DB1150"/>
that that fund be drawn on, otherwi≈øe there would be no occa≈øion for any appropriations at all, this would be a general ≈øub≈øi≈øting fund, and would an≈øwer all demands without any ≈øpecific appropriations.</p>
                        <p>That my con≈øtruction of the act is a rea≈øonable one, and their con≈øtruction unrea≈øonable, I will mention the Act of the 4th April 1792, which directs certificates to be granted for ≈øettled demands without intere≈øt, but no warrants ≈øhould i≈ø≈øue, only reports to be made of them to the Legi≈ølature of the number of unprovided debts without fund for payment; where was the nece≈ø≈øity of this act, where was the nece≈ø≈øity of reporting, to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, if the funds for <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improvements</hi> were to an≈øwer all claims and demands without any further order from the Legi≈ølature?</p>

                     <p>HAVING arrived at the con≈øideration of that point of this bu≈øine≈øs, which re≈øpects the criminal motives and intention of the Comptroller-General, and although it is alledged that the conduct of that officer, is not wrong in certifying the ≈øub≈øcribability and redeemabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of New-Loan certificates, and effecting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption under the act of Congre≈øs and law of the 10th April 1792; and that his opinion and judgment are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and he is not re≈øpon≈øible in a criminal point of view.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe pleas will be inadmi≈ø≈øible, when weighed with all the circum≈øtances attending this tran≈øaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider his ≈øentiments, and his opinion on this ≈øubject, how extremely cautious he has been in promulgating his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; con≈øider, whether he acted in his official charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and directly contrary to the intentions of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature of his country; let us examine whether he is criminal or innocent, let us attend to the time when he wrote on this ≈øubject, what circum≈øtances may favour his intentions, and ≈øee whether there are ≈øufficient and rea≈øonable grounds for acquitting him, deliberate well whether his judgment was uninfluenced; if it is po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ≈øuppo≈øe he really did believe that New-Loans were a≈ø≈øumable and redeemable. Connected with all
<pb n="515" facs="unknown:027132_0523_0FD3284049BA0168"/>
the≈øe circum≈øtances, it is to be called an ob≈øtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe opinion, and can ≈øerve as no excu≈øe or apology. His former opinion, although much relied on, mu≈øt have been formed from private views, he ≈øhould have taken advice.</p>
                     <p>I will recapitulate all the circum≈øtances in his favour, and tho≈øe again≈øt him, and place them in one point of view. It ha≈ø been much relied on, and is worthy of ob≈øervation, that his opinion of the ≈øub≈øcribability of New-Loans was long before the pa≈ø≈øing of the act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                     <p>In his letter to <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> (page 271-2) he writes,</p>
                     <p>"It is not pre≈øumable the <hi>New-Loans</hi> will be offered."</p>
                     <p>In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he writes, "I think too highly of the faith of the public," &amp;c. It is true, he did ≈øo, but this declaration was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nece≈ø≈øary, being made at a time when it was connected with the ≈øubject of difficulty, namely, that of withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the payment of intere≈øt, in five days afterwards (≈øee letter page 277) it was found New-Loans were not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed, all the difficulty was over, con≈øequently the Governor did not an≈øwer that letter, nor took any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the opinion.</p>
                     <p>In another letter (page 223) he ≈øtates the conference and ≈øhews his opinion that New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; true, and it is equally true, that the conference was founded on an idea, that New-Loans were ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe are all that are given in te≈øtimony that the Comptroller thought the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable.</p>
                     <p>The Governor did not care about the ≈øentiment, he was for another thing, he directed the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to confer with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of ≈øtating to him in an open and candid manner, he only ≈øends him a New-Loan certificate, and the law of 1786, under which they were i≈ø≈øued, and withheld the repealing law of 1789, which would have removed every difficulty as appears from his la≈øt letters; we find that the Secretary of the Trea≈øury did not know the law
<pb n="516" facs="unknown:027132_0524_0FD353394C7D9220"/>
of 1789, but as ≈øoon as that officer knew that the law of 1786 was completely and fully repealed, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every difficulty vani≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>But the gentlemen ≈øay, he not only held the opinion, that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable, but al≈øo that they were redeemable under the Act of 1792. I reque≈øt the attention of the Senate in di≈øtingui≈øhing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular periods to which this evidence points, as it is of the utmo≈øt importance to determine the degree of innocence or criminality.</p>
                     <p>After the month of February 1792 we find no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his opinion, that the New-Loans were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable or even a≈ø≈øumable.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ≈øaid, that with regard to the Act of the 10th April 1792, the Comptroller expected the words there made u≈øe of would include New-Loans: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume this was the rea≈øon of his objection, and oppo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the pa≈ø≈øing of that law.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Griffith Evans</hi> had no other authority for his conver≈øation, that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans, than the declaration and opinion of the Comptroller-General on this head (≈øee page 306) who told him he had been endeavouring to convince Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> that if old bills of credit were a≈ø≈øumed, they mu≈øt be redeemed; Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> had ju≈øt pa≈ø≈øed out of the office, it re≈øts on Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> veracity, Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin</hi> was either gone or did not hear this, but he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocally denies the conver≈øation; with re≈øpect to the unfunded depreciation, Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed that to be included, and thought it immaterial whether they were redeemed that way, or through the Land-office. (≈øee page 296.)</p>
                     <p>Again: It is ≈øaid, that he ≈øub≈øcribed New-Loans openly ≈øo as to hazard detection and di≈øgrace. <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> Not ≈øo very openly, as facts and events will ≈øhew, he did not communicate his opinion to any other officer, his opinion was ≈øingular indeed; his conduct was more ≈øecret than open, the mo≈øt intelligent brokers and others had no idea of their ≈øub≈øcribability.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="unknown:027132_0525_0FD3535E885EAB70"/>The arrangement of the bu≈øine≈øs was ≈øuch, that no officer of the government ≈øaw the certificates intended to be loaned but the Comptroller-General. No man could ≈øee what he was doing, and yet the≈øe are the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments adduced to ≈øhew the innocence of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, re≈øpecting his opinion of the ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability and redeemability of New-Loan certificates!</p>
                     <p>It will be nece≈ø≈øary in this place to recapitulate all the circum≈øtances, which came within his knowledge in direct oppo≈øition to this opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General mu≈øt have known, that the Act of March 1789 repealed all the obligations of the State re≈øpecting New-Loans. He mu≈øt have known that his opinion was wrong at lea≈øt, as he was acting in direct oppo≈øition to an expre≈øs law.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General ≈øays, New-Loans are a State debt. They are not ≈øo, ≈øays the Legi≈ølature; he in≈øi≈øts upon it that they are; nay, ≈øub≈øcribable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable too! Every department of government con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them as no longer having an exi≈øtence; but the Comptroller-General in defiance of the Legi≈ølature, per≈øi≈øts on their exi≈øtence as a State debt! The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in his communications to the Legi≈ølature, referred to all the debts and engagements of the commonwealth, but omits New-Loans among the debts, and when he mentions them, he only adverts to the arrears of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt due on the New-Loan debt.</p>
                     <p>The committees of ways and means officially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in like manner. His own and the Regi≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's ≈øtatements were made in the ≈øame manner. The Legi≈ølature them≈øelves had by a parliamentary declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for the payment of the balance of intere≈øt on bills of credit; this ≈øhews, that in doing ≈øo, they acquitted them≈øelves of all their obligations as to New-Loans; and by providing for the intere≈øt they had abandoned the debt.</p>
                     <p>The people, the citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> con≈øidered the repealing Act as a good and valid law, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it; and in conformity to it, and at the call of
<pb n="518" facs="unknown:027132_0526_0FD3533C12230160"/>
the State came forward and out of ¬£.1,819,415:18:9, they had exchanged all under it but about ¬£. 50,000 as appears by his letter (page 220-1-2.)</p>
                     <p>And ≈øhall the Comptroller-General, an officer of high tru≈øt under the commonwealth, with all this knowledge and information in his own brea≈øt, pretend to ≈øay "I am innocent?" Shall he excu≈øe and ju≈øtify this, by ≈øhewing, that, he thought the year before, that the New-Loan certificates were a≈ø≈øumable, ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable? Is it rea≈øonable, or can we ≈øuppo≈øe after all this information in the Comptroller's own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and brea≈øt, that he could entertain an hone≈øt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under all the≈øe circum≈øtances, and in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to all this great body of information, that the New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable? I ≈øay, in oppo≈øition to the ≈øentiments of the Governor, the Legi≈ølature, the committees on ways and means, and all the officers of government.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me, that if this opinion ever exi≈øted, it mu≈øt have been formed opon principles of ob≈øtinacy and perver≈øene≈øs, adhered to again≈øt the dictates of rea≈øon and good ≈øen≈øe, and not agreeable to the better light and information of a well informed mind.</p>
                     <p>If, then, Sir, ≈øuch an affected opinion can be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acted upon, in violation of law; nay, admitted, as a ju≈øtification and apology; where ≈øhall we find of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial duty, honour or integrity?</p>
                     <p>There is another circum≈øtance in this ca≈øe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of con≈øideration, that, in point of time; all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are prior to the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of the 10th April 1792. He never communicated to any of the official characters of the State that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans. What are the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances re≈øpecting his interviews with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Senate and Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives? He was oppo≈øed to the pa≈ø≈øing of that law! He ≈øaid it would be injurious to the State! What were the objects of the≈øe communications! Undoubtedly they were for for ≈øome con≈øideration! When the law was about to
<pb n="519" facs="unknown:027132_0527_0FD353600A92B5F8"/>
pa≈øs, we find him ha≈øtening from one public character to another. In general, we find him manife≈øting great zeal for the intere≈øt of the State, as this Act would be injurious to her intere≈øt.</p>
                     <p>At the ≈øame time we find him manife≈øting equal zeal for his own plan of finance, to help it to go down; many of the witne≈ø≈øes do not remember his objections, yet no man approved of his plan. What were his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the bill? They are of a very trivial nature‚Äî 1. <hi>The price too high!</hi> 2. <hi>Ordering all the</hi> 3 <hi>per cent. ≈øtock to be ≈øold at once,</hi> &amp;c. I appeal to you, if the≈øe objections were not perfectly nugatory. He urged his plan of finance with all po≈ø≈øible warmth: If I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand his plan right, its object was not to pay off any of the debts of the commonwealth, but to fund them, and New-Loans among≈øt the re≈øt.</p>
                     <p>I infer from this ≈øpecies of oppo≈øition to the one, and zeal to ≈øupport the other, that the Senate will judge the motives; in all the≈øe conver≈øations hath he di≈øclo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any of tho≈øe members whom he con≈øulted, that the bill might injure the public, or does he produce any means whereby the commonwealth might not be hurt? Has he mentioned to any per≈øon that any debts were a≈ø≈øumable and redeemable under the ≈øixth ≈øection, other than tho≈øe ≈øpecified in the ≈øecond ≈øection? Certainly not.</p>
                     <p>If motives of public duty induced him to oppo≈øe the law of April 1792, if he ≈øaw that individuals would ≈øpeculate to the di≈øadvantage of the State, why did he not ≈øays ≈øo? Does not all this ≈øtir in favour of his own plan, and again≈øt the bill, ≈øhew that it was not for the good of the State? and becau≈øe he liked his own plan of finance better.</p>
                     <p>Further, in a conver≈øation with Mr. <hi>Gallatin, Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> warned him that his opinion was contrary to that of the Ligi≈ølature, and expre≈øsly informed him, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though unfunded depreciation might be redeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øixth ≈øection, yet he ≈øaid it was not ≈øo intended. <hi>(Mr. Morris, the Speaker of the Senate, ob≈øerved, that
<pb n="520" facs="unknown:027132_0528_0FD353617A228D98"/>
agreeably to his notes, the Comptroller had ≈øaid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the te≈øtimony of Mr. Thomas (page</hi> 287<hi>) "The bill as it ≈øtood would admit of con≈øtructions that would open a door for ≈øpeculation," and "that ≈øome individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als would take advantage to the lo≈øs of the State," ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the te≈øtimony of Mr. Montgomery (page</hi> 290.)</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> proceeded, and ≈øaid (addre≈ø≈øing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the Speaker) you have altered my recollection. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> made this ob≈øervation on the Act, and yet he (Mr. <hi>Gallatin)</hi> allowed unfunded depreciation certificates were redeemable under the ≈øixth ≈øection of that law.</p>
                     <p>It may be ≈øaid, and it is true, that <hi>Gallatin's</hi> opinion was not to be pur≈øued, nor admitted as the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction in oppo≈øition to the <hi>words of the law.</hi> It is evident from the information of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> to the Comptroller-General that he knew the ≈øen≈øe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, and that New-Loans were neither ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nor redeemable, nor embraced under that law; he ≈øhould therefore have he≈øitated and applied to the Governor for advice and have con≈øulted legal charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for official explanation.</p>
                     <p>Had he done this, how ea≈øy would it be to prevent the ≈øub≈øcription of the≈øe New-Loans, and ≈øub≈øequent lo≈øs to the State; it ought, at lea≈øt, to have excited ≈øome doubt, and to have procured the Governor's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and if nece≈ø≈øary, the Attorney-General's explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But in order to conduct his ≈øpeculation with ≈øucce≈øs, he di≈øregards all Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> ob≈øervations, he did not, as his duty required of him, apply to the Governor, he not only neglected to do this but he proceeded in a manner to deceive the Governor.</p>
                     <p>When the Governor called for a ≈øtatement of the 3 per cent. ≈øtock to be ≈øold and of the debts to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed under the Act of the 10th of April 1792, the Comptroller rendered only tho≈øe redeemable under the ≈øecond ≈øection, and to keep his tran≈øactions further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
<pb n="521" facs="unknown:027132_0529_0FD35366132152D8"/>
he does not ≈øpecify New-Loans in his certificate to the Governor as one of them.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øay they, How could he do it, the loan of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs was not then open? Poor excu≈øe! he was not a≈øk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a ≈øtatement under a particular ≈øection of the Act, the call was general and extended to the whole law. (Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> a≈øked for the letter alluded to, calling for the ≈øtatement. Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> went for the letter into the Secretary's office (≈øee page 232) which being read, and not an≈øwering the ideas of Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> re≈øpecting the <hi>general call,</hi> for the letter called for no ≈øtatement; Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> ≈øaid, that Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> in his te≈øtimony declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the call was general. This a≈ø≈øertion was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered by Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> with no! no!!</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> then proceeded,‚ÄîLa≈øtly, we find the certificate to the Governor was not explicit enough to have decided what debt was to have been redeemed. The New-Loans might have been ≈øub≈øcribable, yet not <hi>redeemable,</hi> as we contend that <hi>≈øub≈øcribable</hi> and <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> were not convertible terms: After all it mu≈øt be ≈øubmitted to the Senate, whether they were ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and if ≈øo, whether they were redeemable. I ≈øhall now di≈ømi≈øs this head, and proceed to the</p>
                     <div n="5,6" type="articles">
                        <head>FIFTH AND SIXTH ARTICLES.</head>
                        <p>By the fifth article, the Comptroller-General is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with purcha≈øing New-Loan certificates from tho≈øe who came to his office for the purpo≈øe of exchanging them.</p>
                        <p>In the ≈øixth article he is charged with taking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures in his private capacity for preventing the re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of New-Loan certificates after they had been depo≈øited with him.</p>
                        <p>We are now arrived at that part of the ≈øubject, which is free from embarra≈ø≈øing con≈øtructions, we may now even for the pre≈øent admit that they were ≈øub≈øcribable and redeemable. Here it is not nece≈ø≈øary to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the abilities of a lawyer. The≈øe la≈øt articles depend upon the principles of MORALITY and PRUDENCE! the degree
<pb n="522" facs="unknown:027132_0530_0FD35369834328C8"/>
of guilt will depend upon the intent. Has the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General acted with rectitude and propriety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? Has he acquitted him≈øelf of the duties which other laws impo≈øed on him, or not?</p>
                        <p>The≈øe charges do not depend on the violation of Acts of A≈ø≈øembly, or Legi≈ølative Statutes, but they depend on moral principles interwoven with the common law as applied to all official characters. The crime is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by fir≈øt a≈øcertaining the duty of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, and by examining, whether he has acted in oppo≈øition to that duty. If he has acted again≈øt it, he is guilty, the degree of guilt is determined by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances. The wrong, if done, the wilfulne≈øs, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and inducements of the doer of the wrong, and the degree of criminality, will depend on circum≈øtances of aggravation or extenuation. That he is guilty in ≈øome degree or other, appears from a conviction that he hath violated the≈øe principles of integrity, morality and prudence, in the execution of his official obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This will be evident from the te≈øtimony of Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Oldden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is in evidence that young Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> depo≈øited a certificate agreeably to Act of A≈ø≈øembly, and a printed exchange was filled up. In the in≈øtance of <hi>Oldden</hi> he rendered his certificates for re-exchange, went home, was de≈øired to call again the next day; in the evening the Comptroller-General wrote to him, offering him the a≈ø≈øumable value, <hi>Oldden</hi> being a little ≈øtruck with the offer, ≈øuppo≈øed they mu≈øt have been of ≈øome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him, came up to his office, the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were not yet ready; he came up again the next day, ≈øtill the exchanges were not ready; he told the Comptroller, "give me thirty dollars and their nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal value, and you ≈øhall have them."</p>
                        <p>Is this conduct right or wrong? Where is honor, where is integrity, where is uprightne≈øs or equity? Is this conduct reconcilable with the principles of duty, prudence and official agency? The council for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="523" facs="unknown:027132_0531_0FD3536B96BD6D28"/>
have laboured to ≈øhew that the Act of March 1789, was void, as operating again≈øt the Con≈øtitution of the United States. Let it be admitted, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended that that part of the Act is void, which directs the Comptroller-General to exchange the Continental certificates for the New-Loans, many may be de≈øirous, is an expre≈ø≈øion much relied on by them, and is cited from the law; with this plain direction <hi>"well and faithfully to do his duty,"</hi> under the ≈øanction of an oath to act hone≈øtly and uprightly towards the Commonwealth, he is directed by the Act of March 1789 to exchange when required. Yet he ≈øteps from his ≈øtation, and purcha≈øes <hi>in</hi> the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øay, under an oath well and faithfully to execute his office, what does he do? The≈øe Gentlemen came forward and offered their certificates for exchange, and depo≈øited them for that purpo≈øe, he receives them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a time for the purpo≈øe of exchanging them, we find him ≈øtepping forward, offering to purcha≈øe, nay, actually purcha≈øing the ≈øame certificates.</p>
                        <p>Surely, Sir, this is an high mi≈ødemeanor, if any ≈øuch thing as mi≈ødemeanor can be found any where; although it is mentioned in the articles that New-Loans on depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit, became the property of the State, this is not the git of the charge, but only a circum≈øtance of aggravation.</p>
                        <p>The charge is, his preventing the execution of the act, and heightening the offence by purcha≈øing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, defeating the law, and ≈øpeculating on them to his own great gain, and to the lo≈øs of the commonwealth. I repeat it, Sir, it is mentioned here only as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance; but I will now ≈øay, that when the certificates were depo≈øited; they became the property of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and the con≈øequence was that ≈øhe had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them, and no body had a right to return them.</p>
                        <p>It is evidently and manife≈øtly proved, that the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates were in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the commonwealth; the State had a property in them. Who had the authority to ≈øurrender the Continental certificates for them? The Legi≈ølature ≈øpoke by its laws directing the exchange

to be done. It was wrong in the Comptroller-General to do it in any in≈øtance; but we do not come forward to impeach him for merely returning the certificates when he had no intere≈øt him≈øelf. It was the intere≈øt which he held in the≈øe certificates, every ≈øuch intere≈øt mu≈øt be connected with corre≈øpondent property. The State had a property, and ≈øhe gave no power to any per≈øon to take it from her.</p>
                        <p>I beg the attention of the Senate to the recollection of the ideas of property, we know that bare po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion gives a property in ca≈øes of larceny.</p>
                        <p>When the certificates were in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, they were in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the State, and not in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of <hi>John Nichol≈øon:</hi> occupancy gives a right. A hor≈øe lo≈øt or ≈øtolen from one man, and found in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of another, leather from a ≈øhoemaker, or cloth from a taylor; the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of any of the≈øe articles is enough, the indictment is always for the property.</p>
                        <p>Here, Sir, the commonwealth had an intere≈øt and a property: The gentlemen once made a conce≈ø≈øion, that no exchange was completed until the indents were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. I rather think Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> had no indents to pay, con≈øequently the balance was due to him, and Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> repaid it; of cour≈øe the State had them to pay, therefore the exchange ≈øhould be completed when the certificates were offered.</p>
                        <p>I apprehend then that this was a mo≈øt unwarrantable and unju≈øtifiable proceeding in the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to ≈øtep forward to take this property which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the commonwealth, and purcha≈øe them.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman who ≈øpoke la≈øt, ≈øaid, that <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> had not yet decided, how far ≈øhe ≈øhould re≈øtrain the public officers from dealing; he mentioned that a law was pa≈ø≈øed prohibiting vendue ma≈øters to purcha≈øe at their <hi>own ≈øales,</hi> that the General Government prevented the Secretary of the Trea≈øury and the clerks in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from ≈øpeculating in the funds, but that no law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øted to prevent the Camptroller-General from dealing in this ≈øpecies of property!

                        <head>SEVENTH ARTICLE.</head>
                        <p>The la≈øt article charges the Comptroller-General, that after the exchange was actually completed, he ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed a New-Loan certificate for thirty-two hundred odd pounds, in his own name, and had it redeemed at the Trea≈øury, and received the money for it.</p>
                        <p>The hi≈øtory of this certificate is, that Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of it on the 30th March 1790, that it was i≈ø≈øued in his own name for ¬£. 3275:19:4‚Äîthat he delivered it on that day to <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> (Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> the Speaker interrupted Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> here and ≈øaid, the entry was made on the 6th of March, and not on the 30th.) He entered it at the Trea≈øury on the 6th of March 1790, and received intere≈øt in September 1790, from the Trea≈øury. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øwears that when he went to the Comptroller's office to exchange his certificates, he carried ALL his certificates with him, and received the corre≈øponding Continental certificates in exchange. He ≈øwears unequivocally, that he never ≈øold or commuted any certificates with the Comptroller-General in his life. It appears, the Comptroller ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed this identical certificate.</p>
                        <p>If the≈øe facts are true, I forbear to make any further animadver≈øions on them! It hath been attempted to rai≈øe doubts re≈øpecting the witne≈øs who ≈øupports this charge, his veracity and integrity hath not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached but his memory.</p>
                        <p>His depo≈øition hath been treated in ≈øuch a manner, as no human te≈øtimony could ≈øtand the te≈øt. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did not read the interrogatories and an≈øwers throughout. I cannot tell what evidence could ≈øtand ≈øuch ≈øcrutiny.</p>

(Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> then read the interrogatories and an≈øwers, and commented on them, ≈øee page 253 to 260.)</p>
                        <p>His refu≈øal to an≈øwer four interrogatories will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed, when their nature is con≈øidered, ≈øome of them look as if calculated to affront him (18th and 19th read) Sir, <hi>his feelings were hurt,</hi> it excited his re≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (20th read) perhaps he thought it implied ≈øome ≈øu≈øpicions not very honorable (21≈øt read.) None of the≈øe contains a que≈øtion calculated to draw an an≈øwer material to the enquiry about the certificate, about which the enquiry was made: which induced him to ≈øay they <hi>"did not de≈øerve an an≈øwer,"</hi> it mu≈øt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed they were calculated to confu≈øe and irritate him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øwears he never commuted with <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> This certificate is ≈øub≈øcribed by Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øub≈øcribed all his certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. Where is there any room for any other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, but that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> had exchanged it. The evidence under this la≈øt charge is ≈øtriking and conclu≈øive; if there was a doubt, what can be ea≈øier than for the Comptroller to bring forward information where he got it? If his brokers bought it, they have a bill, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep an account.</p>
                        <p>Is it of ≈øuch a nature, and <hi>≈øo trivial,</hi> as to merit no attention? A certificate for three thou≈øand odd hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds!

                        <p>His books of exchange are ≈øo irregularly kept, as that it is impo≈ø≈øible to get any thing from them: They are not kept agreeably to the directions of Council, nor at the proper times.

then things might be known; the≈øe exchanges exhibit no receipts; they are not in the hand-writing of the party; you find only the initials of their names. There are forty-≈øix odd thou≈øand dollars in two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. No individual certificates are identified or ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE defendant ≈øtands impeached on ≈øeven articles of high crimes and mi≈ødemeanors in his official capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as Comptroller-General of this commonwealth. The Repre≈øentatives of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> have pledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to make good their charges, and to add counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and influence to their pro≈øecution, they have at a very great expence to the commonwealth, abandoned their duties el≈øe where to pay daily attendance here. To di≈øappoint them in their favourite object and to defend him, is the occa≈øion of my troubling you at pre≈øent. It is to be regretted that my indi≈øpo≈øition will prevent me from rendering him that ju≈øtice to which I deem him entitled: But it is no ≈ømall con≈øolation to me that I have been preceded by able colleagues, and if I had not yet that I appear before impartial judges who will be no le≈øs able than willing to render him ample ju≈øtice.</p>
                     <p>I have always thought that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> was po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed of too many and too exten≈øive powers to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øted to any man, and if the que≈øtion at pre≈øent turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this, I ≈øhould have been far from advocating their propriety. If this was wrong it was not however his fault, but it re≈øted with tho≈øe who thought proper to entru≈øt them to him, with ≈øo few checks or means
<pb n="529" facs="unknown:027132_0537_0FD3284641655878"/>
of controul. I cannot however but con≈øider this as the real grounds of accu≈øation, and to lament how degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is to human nature, that ≈øhe affords ≈øo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances of men high in popular favour, becoming en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, ≈øu≈øpected, per≈øecuted, hunted down and ruined, ≈øo that the old adage of <hi>ho≈øannah</hi> to day and <hi>crucify</hi> him to-morrow, is not yet out of date.</p>
                     <p>As the doctrine which I have advanced with re≈øpect to exten≈øive powers entru≈øted to an individual applies to the <hi>accu≈øed,</hi> there ≈øeems to be an exception to the general rule, and my mind is much changed, ≈øince I have ≈øeen a mountain ≈øo long in labour without even producing a <hi>mou≈øe.</hi> The keen-eyed and quick ≈øcented committee of inve≈øtigation, of hunters and of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have probed every channel of information, and ≈øearched every corner for intelligence, have with unwearied indu≈øtry traced all the uncounted millions and tens of millions with which he had been entru≈øted, and it now appears that THE TEMPTATIONS HOWEVER GREAT COULD NOT CORRUPT HIM ≈øince nothing has been found again≈øt him except with re≈øpect to the New-Loan certificates. Hence I am induced to believe that the public confidence was not mi≈øplaced. Months of laborious indu≈øtry have been employed by a committee con≈øtantly ≈øitting during the rece≈øs of the Hou≈øe, with free acce≈øs to his books, papers and official documents, and yet they have been able to bring forward nothing el≈øe again≈øt him. He has undergone this fiery ordeal of more than inqui≈øitorial per≈øecution; and if he ≈øhall not be found guilty, his character mu≈øt, like pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doubly refined by an over ≈øevere heat, appear with unexampled lu≈øtre.</p>
                     <p>The charges are of the mo≈øt ≈øerious nature;‚Äîwilful and corrupt violation of the law! wilful and corrupt di≈øregard of official duty! wilful and corrupt violation of his oath! and all this from motives of private gain and ≈øordid lucre! and all this too, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public who had confided in him! If all the≈øe things are true, an unanimous vote of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="530" facs="unknown:027132_0538_0FD32846E5125370"/>
ought to take place, but if they are unfounded, an unanimous acquittal ≈øhould be the re≈øult.</p>
                     <p>The accu≈øed labours under di≈øadvantages which even common culprits do not experience. In ordinary ca≈øes an unanimous voice is nece≈ø≈øary to a conviction; not ≈øo with re≈øpect to him, and therefore more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proofs ≈øhould be required. Again, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>harged and boldly too, with a violation of his oath of office. On this ground too, the mo≈øt conclu≈øive evidence ≈øhould be required. On an indictment for perjury two witne≈ø≈øes are nece≈ø≈øary to a conviction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe where there is but one oath of guilt, there is oath again≈øt oath, and truth hangs in an equilibrium. 10th <hi>Mod.</hi> 194.4 <hi>Blac.</hi> Comm. 351. This principle is ≈øurely applicable upon the pre≈øent occa≈øion, where the defendant is charged with a violation of his oath of office, and it will be found that this charge is at mo≈øt ≈øupported by the treacherous and confu≈øed memory of Mr. <hi>Blair M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are told, Mr. Speaker, that this pro≈øecution me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits peculiar attention from the re≈øpectability of the accu≈øers, and a line of di≈øtinction favourable to them has been drawn, between an impeachment and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentment by a grand jury. Of this re≈øpectability and of the propriety of this line of di≈øtinction we have not however any proof, nor am I at all ≈øatisfied with it. In public bodies heat too frequently takes place, and pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion too often bears ≈øway. When that is the ca≈øe, the judgment is too often warped, and the innocent not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently fall victims to the rage of party. This is not the ca≈øe in pre≈øentments by grand juries. <hi>There,</hi> generally ≈øpeaking, the accu≈øed meets his accu≈øer face to face before the magi≈øtrate. They meet on equal grounds, the allegations again≈øt him are heard and he has an opportunity of vindicating his innocence. This palladium of ≈øacred rights is it is true but ≈øeldom refu≈øed in the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Hou≈øe of Commons; where it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent for the party accu≈øed to be heard at the bar previous to the articles of impeachment being voted
<pb n="531" facs="unknown:027132_0539_0FD3531FF2146B58"/>
again≈øt him. The ≈øame indulgence (if an indulgence it is to be called) was upon a late occa≈øion afforded to Judge <hi>Hopkin≈øon,</hi> and had the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives been worthy of that re≈øpectability which the learned managers have been plea≈øed to impute to them, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, that the ≈øame mea≈øure of ju≈øtice would have been meted to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon:</hi> I neverthele≈øs tru≈øt that clothed as he is with con≈øcious innocence and ≈øhield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that coat of armour which truth and virtue never fail to afford, he will be able to baffle the views of his <hi>re≈øpectable</hi> but heated and mi≈øguided accu≈øers.</p>
                     <p>We have been in≈øtructed, Mr. Speaker, by a long and laboured, though rather clum≈øy account of the ri≈øe, progre≈øs and <hi>nece≈ø≈øity</hi> of impeachments in <hi>England,</hi> and we are told that they are intended to prevent great and mighty offenders from e≈øcaping puni≈øhment for fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious crimes by an over-bearing influence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true this may be, I cannot ≈øee any nece≈ø≈øity for its di≈øcu≈ø≈øion here. Our own con≈øtitution and our own laws have erected ramparts of ≈øafe-guard round the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, while they have provided means of cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the guilty, and to them only ≈øhould our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal be made. By the eighth ≈øection of the ninth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Con≈øtitution, it is provided that "no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ≈øhall i≈ø≈øue to ≈øeize any per≈øon without probable cau≈øe ≈øupported by oath or affirmation;" and the mo≈øt ≈øolemn oath is required from every grand juror in order to prevent pre≈øentments of the innocent, or the crimes of the guilty from pa≈ø≈øing unpuni≈øhed. In monarchical governments where the royal favour leads to a di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ranks, the rea≈øon a≈ø≈øigned for impeachments may perhaps be a ju≈øt one, but in a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where no ≈øuch di≈øtinction prevails, it is as different as a beggar in his cottage wrapped in his rags can po≈ø≈øibly be from a monarch on his throne with his diadem ≈øparkling upon his brow. Here the law is ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme‚Äîit neither admits nor knows of any influence in its admini≈øtration; an admini≈øtration which is too pure to oppre≈øs the poor, or to ≈øcreen the rich; to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øe
<pb n="532" facs="unknown:027132_0540_0FD3533F175AF548"/>
the humble innocent, or to let the haughty guilty go free. It neverthele≈øs admits of impeachments; not upon the ground which has been mentioned, but upon a much more ≈øub≈øtantial one: The innocence or guilt of a public officer may and often does depend on a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of nice intricacies of law, which but few jurymen are competent to determine, and therefore our Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution wi≈øely declares that "The Governor and all other civil officers under this commonwealth ≈øhall be liable to impeachment for any mi≈ødemeanor in office." It is therefore evident that the humble≈øt man in office is liable to impeachment for any mi≈ødemeanor in office, and that no man however wealthy he may be, is liable to impeachment for any other cau≈øe; and hence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øults, that all the in≈øtruction which we have received on this head was ill-timed, and could only have been intended to mi≈ølead or to make a vain parade of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing, Mr. Speaker, which my client has ju≈øt cau≈øe to complain of. The Hou≈øe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives, (≈øee page 108) after exhibiting their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, pledged them≈øelves to offer proof of the premi≈øes; but upon what grounds did they thus pledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves? Why as to the very <hi>e≈ø≈øence</hi> of the third article it was on the hear-≈øay of the committee of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; founded on the hear≈øay of the committee of ways and means; founded on the hear≈øay of a man <hi>not under oath;</hi> and they afterwards materially altered that charge, on a <hi>chit-chat</hi> conver≈øation between the ≈øame man, and a member of the Hou≈øe, as it was reported to the Hou≈øe by that member, and without requiring any oath from that member or his informant, or taking any trouble to enquire into the truth of it.</p>
                     <p>By this extraordinary procedure has the defendant been deprived of that ≈øecurity to which every man is by the laws and con≈øtitution of his country entitled; and this too by the very men who have thought proper to impeach the defendant for a ≈øuppo≈øed violation of the law and con≈øtitution! If he is guilty, they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="533" facs="unknown:027132_0541_0FD3536F37634688"/>
been ≈øo complai≈øant as to keep him in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and he may ju≈øtly retort upon them <hi>Turpe e≈øt doctori cum culpa redarguit ip≈øum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When it is con≈øidered that they are the ≈øworn guardians of the laws and con≈øtitution of the country, they mu≈øt appear but with an ill grace as the accu≈øers of others, at the moment of committing ≈øo flagrant a violation on their part. I allude to the third article which charges that the defendant did "not con≈øult the Regi≈øter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nor the Governor," and yet tho≈øe who made this charge, knew no more about the truth or fal≈øity of it, legally ≈øpeaking, than any man in <hi>Europe.</hi> It appears indeed that Mr. <hi>Gallatin told</hi> the Hou≈øe, that Mr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald≈øon</hi> had <hi>told</hi> him ≈øo, but it al≈øo appears, that the Hou≈øe upon this information, un≈øupported by any oath or enquiry before them≈øelves or a committee, voted the charge <hi>true;</hi> and what aggravates their conduct (if it be capable of aggravation) is, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> a leading member in bringing forward the impeachment, now ≈øwears that <hi>as Mr.</hi> Donnald≈øon <hi>was an officer of government they thought he might be heard without an oath!</hi> A <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> peer, when ≈øitting on an impeachment, an≈øwers upon his <hi>honour;</hi> when te≈øtifying as a witne≈øs he an≈øwers upon his <hi>oath,</hi> but the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives have attached to the officers of government, a privilege ≈øanctioned by no experience, and reprobated by the laws and con≈øtitution of this country!</p>
                     <p>So much for the manner in which the impeachment has been brought forward. Whether it is ≈øupported or not, remains to be con≈øidered.</p>
                     <p>It may not be improper however to ob≈øerve, that in writing or ≈øpeaking, our arrangements ≈øhould be ≈øuch, as that, <hi>that</hi> which precedes, ≈øhould prepare the way for that which is to follow; and that the latter may be the re≈øult of the former; el≈øe repetition, ob≈øcurity and wa≈øte of time will be the con≈øequence. Under this idea I cannot think of con≈øidering the articles in the order of their arrangement, nor has the Coun≈øel on either ≈øide found it practicable. My po≈øitions will be‚Äî</p>

                     <p>Under this po≈øition, we are ≈øo far from agreeing with our opponents the learned managers, that the Act of March 27, 1789 aboli≈øhed the New-Loan debt, created by the Act of March 1≈øt 1786, as to boldly contend, that it left it as it was before, with this difference only, that it was funded by the law of 1786 and unfunded by the law of 1789, and left without the means of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until ≈øome new provi≈øion ≈øhould be made for that purpo≈øe.</p>
                     <p>We ≈øay that ≈øo much of the Act of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> of March 1≈øt, 1786, as a≈ø≈øumed the debt due to her own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens from the U. S. was a noble exertion of patrioti≈øm, benevolently intended and wi≈øely calculated to add value to their certificates, and in≈øpire them with confidence, when they had but little in the funds of the United States; but that ≈øo much of it as provided the means of payment, was originally founded on a breach of faith; was beyond the power of the Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and if not originally uncon≈øtitutional and void, it became ≈øo by the adoption of the Federal Con≈øtitution. It was therefore the meaning and duty of the A≈ø≈øembly in March 1789 to repeal one part of the Act of 1786, but it had neither the power nor the will to repeal the other part of it.</p>

                        <pb n="535" facs="unknown:027132_0543_0FD353750BD173A0"/>To determine this, a minute attention to ≈øome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious matters is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary, and the que≈øtion will be found to be ≈øo important, that it ≈øhould not be lo≈øt ≈øight of in any ≈øtage of our enquiries.</p>
                     <p>All debts due to foreign and dome≈øtic creditors of every de≈øcription, for monies loaned, ≈øupplies furni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ≈øervices performed for the general defence, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and each of tho≈øe creditors, whether con≈øi≈øting of a nation or of a private individual, had both an equitable and legal claim on the aggregate fund, compo≈øed of the quotas of the ≈øeveral ≈øtates for payment. Foreign nations as well as foreign and dome≈øtic citizens, tru≈øted on the ≈øecurity of this aggregate fund and on the plighted faith of the Union for payment out of it, and no one ≈øtate had the power of extricating her≈øelf or her quota of the public debt, from the claim of all the public creditors, by appropriating her quota in favour of any particular cla≈øs of citizens in exclu≈øion of others‚Äîyet it will be found that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by her Act of 1786 undertook to make a partial appropriation of her quota in favour of her own citizens, and to the prejudice of all other public creditors of every de≈øcription. If this ≈øhall be found to be the ca≈øe, and if it ≈øhall al≈øo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had no ≈øuch power, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult as a nece≈ø≈øary conclu≈øion, that ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment of the New-Loan certificates, was founded on a breach of public faith and was under the articles of Confederation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øtitutional‚ÄîIt was therefore the duty of the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature in the year 1789 to repeal this part of the Act of 1786‚ÄîBut in 1786 <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had the power of a≈ø≈øuming upon her≈øelf the payment of that part of the public debt which was due to her own citizens, either upon any other funds than her quota of the public debt due from the Union, or without funding it at all‚ÄîBy her Act of 1786 ≈øhe did a≈ø≈øume it, and therefore ≈øo much of that Act as related to the a≈ø≈øumption could not without a breach of faith be repealed by her in

1789‚ÄîThe≈øe remarks will afford a ≈øufficient clue for the true interpretation of the law of 1789 and which I ≈øhall come to con≈øider its letter and ≈øpirit, I tru≈øt it will appear that the Legi≈ølature of 1789 intended to re≈øtore public faith by repealing ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as was founded on a breach of it, but that it did not intend committing a new breach of the public faith, by repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which was ≈øo far from being uncon≈øtitutional as to be highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable‚ÄîAs a foundation for what has been ≈øaid and for that which is to follow, it is now proper to turn to the articles of Confederation which contain the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provi≈øions‚Äî</p>

                        <p>The fir≈øt mea≈øure recommended is, effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion for the debt of the U. S.

To di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the principal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any ≈øhort period, is evidently not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs of our re≈øources; and even if it could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed, the ca≈øe of the community would require that the debt it≈øelf ≈øhould be le≈øs to a cour≈øe of gradual extingui≈øhment, and certain funds be provided for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean time the annual intere≈øt. The amount of the annual intere≈øt, as will appear by the paper la≈øt referred to, is computed to be 2,415,956 dollars. Funds, therefore, which will certainly and punctually produce this annual ≈øum at lea≈øt, mu≈øt be provided.</p>
                        <p>"In devi≈øing the≈øe funds Congre≈øs did not overlook the mode of ≈øupplying the common Trea≈øury, provided by the articles of Confederation; but after the mo≈øt re≈øpectful con≈øideration of that mode, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to regard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the public debt mu≈øt be thrown. The delays and uncertainties incident to a revenue to be e≈øtabli≈øhed and collected form time to time by thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen independent authorities, is at fir≈øt view irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable

with the punctuality e≈ø≈øential in the di≈øcharge of the intere≈øt of a national debt<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Our own experience after making every allowance for tran≈øient impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has been a ≈øufficient illu≈øtration of this truth. Some departure, therefore, in the recommendations of Congre≈øs, from the Federal Con≈øtitution, was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but it will be found to be as ≈ømall as could be reconciled with the object in view, and to be ≈øupported be≈øides by ≈øolid con≈øiderations of intere≈øt and ≈øound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
                        <p>"The fund which fir≈øt pre≈øented it≈øelf on this, as it did on a former occa≈øion, was a tax on imports. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons which recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been ≈øtated in an Act, of which a copy, No. 2, is now forwarded, and need not be here repeated. It will ≈øuffice to recapitulate, that taxes on con≈øumption are always lea≈øt burden≈øome, becau≈øe they are lea≈øt felt, and are borne too, by tho≈øe who are both willing and able to pay them; that, of all taxes on con≈øumption, tho≈øe on foreign commerce are mo≈øt compatible with the genius and policy of free ≈øtates; that from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative po≈øitions of ≈øome of the more commercial ≈øtates, it will be impo≈ø≈øible to bring this e≈ø≈øential re≈øource into u≈øe without a concerted uniformity; that this uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity cannot be concerted through any channel ≈øo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as through Congre≈øs, nor for any purpo≈øe ≈øo aptly as for paying the debts of a revolution, from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce.</p>
                        <p>"In renewing this propo≈øition to the ≈øtates, we have not been unmindful to the objections which heretofore fru≈øtated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of 25 years; and we have left to the ≈øtates them≈øelves the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the officers who are to collect it. If the ≈øtrict maxims of national credit alone were to be con≈øulted, the revenue ought manife≈øtly to be con≈øi≈øtent with the object of it, and the collection placed in every re≈øpect under that authority which is to di≈øpen≈øe the former, and is re≈øpon≈øible for the latter. The≈øe relaxations

will, we tru≈øt, be regarded on one hand as the effect of a di≈øpo≈øition in Congre≈øs to attend at all times to the ≈øentiments of tho≈øe whom they ≈øerve, and on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious de≈øire that provi≈øion may be made in ≈øome way or other for an honorable and ju≈øt fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed.</p>
                        <p>"To render this fund as productive as po≈ø≈øible, and at the ≈øame time to narrow the room for collu≈øions and frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan, to recommend a liberal duty on ≈øuch articles as are mo≈øt ≈øu≈øceptible of a tax according to their quantity, and are of mo≈øt equal and general con≈øumption; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other articles, as heretofore propo≈øed, to be taxed according to their value.</p>

                        <p>"The nece≈ø≈øity of making the two foregoing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions one indivi≈øible and irrevocable act, is apparent. Without the fir≈øt quality, partial provi≈øion only might be made where complete provi≈øion is e≈ø≈øential; nay, as ≈øome ≈øtates might prefer and adopt one of the funds only, and the other ≈øtates the other fund only, it might happen that no provi≈øion at all would be made: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ≈øecond a ≈øingle ≈øtate out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment of national credit. In≈øtead of enlarging on the≈øe topics, two ob≈øervations are ≈øubmitted to the ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and wi≈ødom of the Legi≈ølatures. Fir≈øt: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent creditors, or rather the dome≈øtic part of them, having either made their loans for a period which has expired, or having become creditors in the fir≈øt in≈øtance involuntarily, are entitled on the clear principles of ju≈øtice and good faith, to demand the principle of their credits, in≈øtead of accepting the annual intere≈øt. It is nece≈ø≈øary, therefore, as the principal cannot be paid to them on demand, that the intere≈øt ≈øhould be ≈øo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and ≈øatisfactorily ≈øecured, as to enable them if they incline, to transfer their ≈øtock at its full value. Secondly; if the funds be ≈øo firmly con≈øtituted as to in≈øpire a thorough and univer≈øal confidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the dome≈øtic debt, which bears the high intere≈øt of ≈øix per cent. may be concel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by other loans obtained at a more moderate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt? The ≈øaving by ≈øuch an operation, would be a clear one, and might be a con≈øiderable one. As a proof of the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øub≈øtantial funds for the ≈øupport of our credit abroad, we refer to paper No. 4.</p>
                        <p>"Thus much for the intere≈øt of the national debt: for the di≈øcharge of the principal within the term li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, we rely on the natural increa≈øe of the revenue from commerce, on requi≈øitions to be made from time to time for that purpo≈øe, as circum≈øtances may dictate,

and on the pro≈øpect of vacant territory. If the≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øources ≈øhould prove inadequate, it will be nece≈ø≈øary, at the expiration of twenty-five years, to continue the funds now recommended, or to e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øuch others as may then be found more canvenient.</p>
                        <p>"With a view to the re≈øource la≈øt mentioned, as well as to obviate di≈øagreeable controver≈øies and confu≈øions, Congre≈øs have included in their pre≈øent recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a renewal of tho≈øe of the 6th day of September, and of the 10th day of October, 1780.

                        <p>"The la≈øt object recommended is, a con≈øtitutional change of the rule by which a partition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burdens is to be made.

although not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be devi≈øed. The only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of Congre≈øs, was to fix the proper difference between the labour and indu≈øtry of free inhabitants, and of all other inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual conce≈ø≈øions; and if it ≈øhould be ≈øuppo≈øed not to corre≈øpond preci≈øely with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal ≈øpirit of accommodation among the ≈øeveral Legi≈ølatures, will prevail again≈øt little inequalities which may be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on one ≈øide or on the other. But notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confidence of Congre≈øs, as to the ≈øucce≈øs of this propo≈øition, it is their duty to recollect that the event may po≈ø≈øibly di≈øappoint them, and to reque≈øt that mea≈øures may ≈øtill be pur≈øued for obtaining and tran≈ømitting the information called for in the Act of the 17th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary la≈øt, which in ≈øuch event will be e≈ø≈øential.</p>
                        <p>"The plan thus communicated and explained by Congre≈øs mu≈øt now receive its fate from their con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.

                        <p>On the 27th of March 1789 the Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> pa≈ø≈øed a law, which after ≈øome recitals, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to be read at pre≈øent, though they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be ob≈øerved upon by and by, enacted that "the intere≈øt due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certificates i≈ø≈øued by the Comptroller-General in pur≈øuance of the ≈øaid recited Acts or either of them, ≈øhall be paid up, ≈øo as to complete the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intere≈øt to four years; and that ≈øo much of every Act or Acts of General A≈ø≈øembly, as directs or

                        <p>The fir≈øt po≈øition, Mr. Speaker, which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed maintaining is, <hi>That the New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States; and of cour≈øe, were redeemable at the Trea≈øury of</hi> Penn≈øylvania;" and I have in an early ≈øtage of my remarks ventured to ≈øtate as the ground of this po≈øition, that "the Act of the 27th of March 1789 was ≈øo far from aboli≈øhing the New-Loan debt created by the Act of the 1≈øt of March 1786, as to leave it as it was before, with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only, that it was funded by the law of 1786, and unfunded by that of 1789, and left without the means of payment, until ≈øome new provi≈øion ≈øhould be made for that purpo≈øe; and I at the ≈øame time added, that it was the meaning and duty of the A≈ø≈øembly in March 1789 to repeal ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment; as was originally founded on a breach of faith, and as was beyond the power of the Legi≈ølature to enact; but I denied that the Legi≈ølature of 1789 had either the power or the will to repeal that part of the Act which a≈ø≈øumed the debt.</p>

                        <p>The ground which I have hitherto taken is intended to ≈øhew, that the New-Loan debt as it is called, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Act of 1786, continued to exi≈øt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the law of 1789‚ÄîIf it did not continue to exi≈øt, I mu≈øt admit that the New-Loan certificates were not ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States; and if it did continue to exi≈øt, it follows as a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that they were ≈øub≈øcribable‚ÄîThe e≈øtabli≈øhing of the point is therefore of ≈øo much importance to the defendant as to afford a ≈øufficient apology for my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring

to draw the attention of the honorable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to a ≈øhort review of the ground over which I have pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
                        <p>It has been ≈øhewn, that all debts due to foreign and dome≈øtic creditors of every de≈øcription, for monies loaned, ≈øupplies furni≈øhed and ≈øervices performed for the general defence during the late war, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and of cour≈øe that each of the≈øe creditors whether foreign or dome≈øtic, and whether con≈øi≈øting of a nation or of a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, has both an equitable and a legal claim on all the ≈øtates for payment‚ÄîIt may have ≈øometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that nations in all the pride of power and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary omnipotence, have been ≈øo regardle≈øs of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and of the ≈øacred voice of ju≈øtice, as to ≈øub≈øtitute <hi>that</hi> power as the only mea≈øure of right, and by adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conduct which in the humble walks of private life, would con≈øign an individual to de≈øerved di≈øgrace and infamy, have undertaken to cancel their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Admitting for a moment, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was willing to appear as a pro≈øtitute among nations, yet ≈øhe had no authority to legi≈ølate for foreign nations or foreign citizens, and of cour≈øe ≈øhe could not annul her obligations with them‚ÄîAgain, <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was but an Integral part of the United States, and ≈øhe could have no preten≈øions to the right of annulling their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or extricating her≈øelf from their binding obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on her.</p>
                        <p>It has been ≈øhewn, that the articles of Confederation were propo≈øed to, and ratified by all the ≈øtates; that every ≈øtate thereby bound her≈øelf to abide by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the United States in Congre≈øs a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, on all que≈øtions thereby ≈øubmitted to them; that each ≈øtate by a ≈øolemn compact declared that they ≈øhould be inviolably ob≈øerved by every ≈øtate, and that no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration ≈øhould at any time be made in any of them, unle≈øs it ≈øhould be agreed to in a Congre≈øs of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølatures of every ≈øtate; that all the charges of war
<pb n="558" facs="unknown:027132_0566_0FD35383483FB990"/>
and other expences incurred for the common defence or general welfare, ≈øhould be defrayed out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trea≈øury ≈øupplied by the ≈øeveral ≈øtates in ≈øuch proportion as ≈øhould be fixed by Congre≈øs, and that for the payment and ≈øatisfaction thereof the United States and the public faith were thereby pledged; that the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was fixed in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by the articles of Confederation, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unle≈øs a part is greater than the whole; unle≈øs the power of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øingly, is greater than that of all the ≈øtates collectively; unle≈øs ≈øhe had a right to legi≈ølate for foreign citizens and foreign nations, and unle≈øs ≈øhe could at plea≈øure withdraw her faith and cancel her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, her quota could not be applied by her in favour of one cla≈ø≈ø of creditors, and to the exclu≈øion of others.</p>
                        <p>It has been ≈øhewn that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by her law of 1783 granted her quota, which had been fixed and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for by Congre≈øs for the payment of the intere≈øt due to the public creditors until provi≈øion ≈øhould be made for the di≈øcharge of the principal, and that by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ratification of her former obligations ≈øhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came doubly bound to a faithful compliance with them.</p>
                        <p>It has been ≈øhewn that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by another Act of the 23d of September 1783 authori≈øed Congre≈øs, when the other ≈øtates ≈øhould come into the ≈øame mea≈øure, for the term of 25 years to levy certain duties; and that ≈øhe her≈øelf provided for rai≈øing certain taxes; at the ≈øame time, and in the mo≈øt explicit manner ≈øhe appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them to the di≈øcharge of the intere≈øt and principal of the debts contracted on the faith of the United States for ≈øupporting the war.</p>
                        <p>After all the≈øe engagements, ≈øurely no rational man will ≈øeriou≈øly contend, that the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was not irrevocably mortgaged to all the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, or that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had the power of le≈ø≈øening the claims of any of them upon her for retribution‚Äî The Con≈øtitution of the United States is the ≈øupreme law of the land; it declares that "all debts contracted
<pb n="559" facs="unknown:027132_0567_0FD352F4BA1A6F78"/>
and engagements entered into before its adoption, ≈øhall be as valid again≈øt the United States as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Confederation; the ≈øovereign people of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> by adopting that Con≈øtitution, agreed that tho≈øe debts ≈øhould be ≈øo‚ÄîUnder the articles of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was bound and her quota was mortgaged for their payment; by her Act of March 1786 ≈øhe undertook to ≈øay, that the debts contracted and engagements entered into ≈øhould not be as valid again≈øt her as by the articles of Confederation they had been declared to be, and that her quota ≈øhould no longer be liable for the payment of them.</p>
                        <p>In what ≈øituation then did <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> find her≈øelf in the year 1789? She found among her records an Act ≈øtamped with the name of a law, but part of it disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by features which ≈øhewed that it rather merited the name of an arbitrary and de≈øpotic edict‚Äî<hi>That</hi> part ≈øhe con≈øidered as a monument of her di≈øgrace, and ≈øhe determined to repeal it, and by doing ≈øo to re≈øtore her credit and the rights of all the creditors of the Union; but ≈øhe ≈øaw another part of it, which infringed the rights of no one; interfered with no former engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ≈øhe had an unque≈øtionable right to enact it; that ≈øhe had enacted it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that ≈øhe had thereby pledged her faith where ≈øhe had a right to pledge it, and that it could not be repealed without a breach of that faith; that part therefore ≈øhe determined not to touch, and with the delicate hand of a ≈økilful ≈øurgeon, ≈øhe probed the wound; ≈øhe ≈øeparated the rotten from the ≈øound, and ≈øhe repealed ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as funded the New-Loan debt on her quota, in favour of her own citizens only, when it belonged not to them alone but to them in common with every other cla≈øs of creditors; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>It has al≈øo been ≈øaid, Mr. Speaker by the honorable managers and the learned coun≈øel, that "The clau≈øe in the Con≈øtitution of the United States, prohibiting the pa≈ø≈øing of <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> laws, and laws annulling the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of contracts, does not relate to ≈øtates, but to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate per≈øons only."

                        <p>Again, it has been ≈øaid that "The clau≈øe in que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not extend to the conduct of a ≈øtate towards her own citizens, but that it leaves her to act with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to them, as ≈øhe may think proper."‚ÄîTo this I an≈øwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. That the clau≈øe in que≈øtion, contains no ≈øuch exception, and that I am far from being ≈øatisfied of the gentlemen's right to add it to the Con≈øtitution.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. That, foreign citizens and foreign ≈øtates are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øted, and that therefore, if the propo≈øition were true, yet that the conclu≈øion would be unwarrantable.</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. That the rea≈øon is much ≈øtronger, for the clau≈øe applying to the conduct of a ≈øtate towards her own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, than towards any body el≈øe; ≈øince ≈øhe has no right to legi≈ølate, but for her own citizens, and the clau≈øe could not therefore be nece≈ø≈øary to pre≈øerve the rights of other citizens or foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>We are al≈øo told that "The clau≈øe refered to, only relates to contracts, and not to laws," but before I can po≈ø≈øibly give any other an≈øwer to this objection, than by laughing at it, I mu≈øt be informed how it is po≈ø≈øible that the≈øe words, "NO STATE SHALL PASS ANY EX POST FACTO LAW, OR LAW IMPAIRING THE OBLIGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF CONTRACTS," do not relate to laws, but only to contracts.</p>
                        <p>Again, ≈øuppo≈øing the propro≈øition to be true; I a≈øk if it has not been inconte≈øtably proved, that a ≈øtate is as capable of making a contract as a private individual
<pb n="562" facs="unknown:027132_0570_0FD3532B395DA370"/>
can po≈ø≈øibly be? If <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had not made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts? If they were not as binding on her, as they could be on an individual? and if ≈øo, need I to add, that ≈øhe could pa≈øs no <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> law, or law impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligation of contracts, more e≈øpecially in <hi>her own ca≈øe; in her own favor, and to the prejudice of her own creditors!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I conclude, that the Legi≈ølature of 1789 had not the power, even had it been ≈øo weak or ≈øo wicked as to have the will, of repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which a≈ø≈øumed ≈øo much of the debt of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States as was due to the citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> Independent of the uncon≈øtitutionality of ≈øuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, it would have been ≈øo extremely unju≈øt, that the intention is not fairly imputable, without much ≈øtronger proofs, than are furni≈øhed by the language of the law of that date.</p>
                        <p>We have, it is true, been told that "Con≈øidering the proceedings which took place under the law of 1786 as but merely an <hi>exchange</hi> of one certificate for another, a <hi>re-exchange</hi> might with great propriety be ordered by a ≈øub≈øequent law, ≈øince this would only be putting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they were before, and leaving them in <hi>≈øtatu quo,</hi> ≈øo that no harm could po≈ø≈øibly be done"‚ÄîBut ≈øurely this kind of rea≈øoning is altogether inadmi≈ø≈øible, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the merit of plau≈øibility‚ÄîIn the year 1786 the United States, with the be≈øt of wi≈øhes towards their creditors, were, owing to the delinquency of ≈øome of the ≈øtates; without the means of rendering them ju≈øtice ‚ÄîThis was ≈øo well known as in a great mea≈øure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy all confidence in them, and a ≈øtate ≈øecurity was by mo≈øt people deemed preferable to a continental one. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> therefore by a≈ø≈øuming ≈øo much of the debt as was due to her own citizens, added confidence to them, enhanced the value of their claims, and ≈øtamped them with a curr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not ≈øo would have been the ca≈øe, had ≈øhe undertaken to de≈øtroy the debt‚ÄîThe debt due from the United States was either not funded at all, or it was funded on the quotas of the ≈øeveral ≈øtates.‚Äî In the former ≈øituation, were the New-Loan creditors placed by the law of 1789, with the liberty, if they thought proper of being placed in the latter, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing their new certificates for the old ones. This far it was the duty of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> to go, but ≈øhe could not have gone farther without a violation of that duty, and it will pre≈øently appear that ≈øhe had no ≈øuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>It can hardly be nece≈ø≈øary to again remind the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senate of the Act of the 23d of September 1783, whereby Penn≈øylvania, by a full and complete grant, authori≈øed Congre≈øs to rai≈øe and levy the whole of her quota of the debt of the United States, to take effect as ≈øoon as the like powers ≈øhould be given by all the other ≈øtates. By the Con≈øtitution of the United States, the like powers were delegated to Congre≈øs by all the ≈øtates,
<pb n="564" facs="unknown:027132_0572_0FD352FDC2DB8D58"/>
and therefore by its adoption this grant became ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and irrevocable. In proof of this, I mu≈øt again have recour≈øe to the following clau≈øe, "The Congre≈øs ≈øhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øts and exci≈øes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States."</p>
                        <p>As this clau≈øe transfers to Congre≈øs the identical du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon which the New-Loan debt had been funded, it may with more propriety be ≈øaid, that it became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded by the adoption of the Con≈øtitution in 1788, than in by the law of 1789, ≈øince that law only renders the one of 1786 conformable to it.</p>
                        <p>That may idea of the New-Loan debt continuing as a debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> though it ≈øhould become unfund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not a novel one, I will now afford the mo≈øt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable proof, and my authority ≈øhall be no le≈øs than that <hi>of the ≈øame Legi≈ølature which by the Act of</hi> 1786 <hi>created that debt.</hi>

                        <p>It mu≈øt be fre≈øh in the memory of every man who hears me, that when the delinquency of ≈øome of the ≈øtates in their federal duties, had ari≈øen to ≈øuch a height, as to almo≈øt menace a di≈ø≈øolution of the Union, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs ≈øtood firm at their po≈øt, and exerted every nerve to pre≈øerve, or rather to re≈øcue the tainted honour of the country‚ÄîOn one of the≈øe trying occa≈øions, they ≈øent a committee con≈øi≈øting of Mr. <hi>King</hi> and Mr. <hi>Monroe</hi> to confer with the Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> This event took place in the year 1786, and the Journals of the A≈ø≈øembly of that year ≈øhew what took place on that occa≈øion.</p>

                        <p>This report ≈øtates the nece≈ø≈øity which the State had been under of "a≈ø≈øuming the debt," and it ≈øpeaks of the a≈ø≈øumption as being unconditional in its nature, and unlimited in point of time; but it a≈ø≈øumes a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language when ≈øpeaking of the funding of the debt, for the expre≈ø≈øion there is, that "This Hou≈øe cannot divert the funds until ≈øuch ≈øolid provi≈øion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt payable to <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> will be a certain and ≈øufficient fund for di≈øcharging tho≈øe ≈øums, which ≈øhe is bound to pay to her citizens"‚ÄîBy the Con≈øtitution of the United States ≈øuch "≈øolid provi≈øion" as is here ≈øpoken of was amply ≈øecured, and therefore the law of 1789 is in this particular conformable to what the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature in 1786 con≈øidered as proper under the like circum≈øtances.</p>

Hou≈øe in its original ≈øhape, it propo≈øed no more than to repeal ≈øo much of the law of 1786, as directed the payment of the intere≈øt half yearly, and had it retained this form it would hardly be contended that the debt it≈øelf was de≈øtroyed‚ÄîThe cau≈øe of the alteration may however be ea≈øily traced, and when that is known, there will appear no more rea≈øon for concluding the intention to have been to de≈øtroy the debt, than if no alteration had taken place. That cau≈øe was as follows ‚ÄîAs the intere≈øt was funded upon and made payable out of the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> and as it was proper to repeal this part of the Act, the Legi≈ølature at fir≈øt propo≈øed to do nothing more‚ÄîIt was however in the progre≈øs of the bill ob≈øerved, that the principal was receivable at the Land-office, in order to form a charge again≈øt the United States, and to be deducted from the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> Hence this part of the Act was al≈øo exceptional, and a very proper object for a repealing clau≈øe. The≈øe circum≈øtances certainly afford ≈øtrong grounds for the conclu≈øion, that in 1789 no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was intended than to prevent any part of the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> from being applied to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial purpo≈øes, and to leave to her future con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what funds ≈øhe would provide for the payment of the≈øe debts, or indeed whether ≈øhe would provide for them at all.</p>
                        <p>We have been told, Sir, that "The long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured preamble to the law of 1789, ≈øhews the anxiety of the Legi≈ølature to afford a ju≈øtification for what was about to be done, and that this proves a total de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the debt to have been intended." But were I to admit, that it is not the <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> but the <hi>length</hi> of the preamble, which affords a key for the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enacting clau≈øe, yet a very ≈øtrong conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion might fairly be drawn in favour of my con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øince not one world is to be found in any part of the preamble, in favour of de≈øtroying the debt, while every ≈øentence of it, is calculated to ≈øhew the propriety of rendering it an unfunded one.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="567" facs="unknown:027132_0575_0FD352CAF74AB190"/>The preamble ≈øays, "And whereas Congre≈øs having the power to provide for the payment of the debts of the United States, no doubt can be entertained but they will with all convenient ≈øpeed make due provi≈øion for the ≈øame"‚Äîand this has been relied on to ≈øhew, that the intention was to de≈øtroy the New-Loan debt altogether, but to me it appears that a very different inference is deducible.</p>
                        <p>The preamble recites that "Congre≈øs have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo≈øts and exci≈øes; to pay the debts of the United States; that no ≈øtate can without the con≈øent of Congre≈øs lay any impo≈øts or duties on imports or exports, and as that part of the aggregate fund created by the Act of March the 16th 1785 which ari≈øes from the duties and impo≈øts therein mentioned, will ≈øhortly cea≈øe to come into the Trea≈øury of this ≈øtate, it is rea≈øonable and ju≈øt that the temporary relief which by the ≈øaid recited Acts was granted, &amp;c. ≈øhould al≈øo cea≈øe."</p>
                        <p>In the≈øe recitals we di≈øcover no intention to annul the debt, but we ≈øee very ≈øtrong ones for withdrawing the funds and providing no others at that time; Congre≈øs had the power, and therefore, there could be no doubt of their having the will;‚Äîthe proper funds were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the ≈øtate and ve≈øted in Congre≈øs;‚Äîthe quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was re≈øtored to the proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and therefore the plain language of this preamble is, that as we are under no obligation to provide other funds, we will not do it at pre≈øent, but we will give you an opportunity of receiving back your old certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, in order to apply to your original debtor for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before you ≈øhall look to us who are but the guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</p>
                        <p>Again, the preamble after reciting the law of 1786 and ≈øome former ones, ≈øays "It is rea≈øonable and ju≈øt that the <hi>alterations</hi> of the ≈øaid recited laws herein after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ≈øhould be made." Can any thing ≈øhew more clearly than this, that they were to be <hi>altered,</hi> not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed; amended,</hi> not <hi>repealed?</hi> and if ≈øo, that part was to

remain, and <hi>that</hi> part is ≈øo much thereof as was a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed debt.</p>
                        <p>But further ≈øays the preamble; "It is rea≈øonable and ju≈øt that the <hi>temporary</hi> relief granted by the ≈øaid recited Acts ≈øhould cea≈øe." Let us ≈øee, Mr. Speaker, what this temporary relief was, and when we know this we ≈øhall have the Legi≈ølature's own declaration of what was deemed rea≈øonable and ju≈øt to do‚ÄîThe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal was made payable at the end of ten years, but it was not ≈øecured on any grounds; this was hard upon the creditors, who had long ≈øought in vain for their ju≈øt rights‚ÄîThe finances of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> did not admit of her promi≈øing payment of the principal at an earlier period, nor of fixing on any funds even for that time; ‚Äîbut in con≈øideration of their di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, ≈øhe granted them <hi>temporary relief,</hi> and that temporary relief was,</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. The payment of the intere≈øt half yearly during ten years but no longer; and,</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. As ≈øhe wi≈øhed to di≈øpo≈øe of her back lands, and found much difficulty in doing it, ≈øhe agreed to receive New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in payment for her back lands.</p>
                        <p>And ≈øhe provided that both of the≈øe ≈øhould be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again≈øt the United States and be deducted from her quota‚ÄîWe now ≈øee what this <hi>temporary relief</hi> was, which it <hi>was rea≈øonable and ju≈øt ≈øhould cea≈øe;</hi> we find that it had no relation to the validity of the certificate; that it was confined to payments out of the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> and after this, the con≈øtruction mu≈øt be a very ≈øtrained one indeed, which ≈øuppo≈øes that the Legi≈ølature thought it rea≈øonable and ju≈øt that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates <hi>≈øhould be cancelled and the debt aboli≈øhed!</hi>‚ÄîHad ≈øuch been the intention, would not the preamble have ≈øaid ≈øo? Or could ≈øuch be the intention, when the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is ≈øo very different?‚ÄîTo <hi>cea≈øe,</hi> and to <hi>aboli≈øh,</hi> are different things, in the one ca≈øe the thing which cea≈øed may begin again: in the other it is de≈øtroyed and gone forever.‚ÄîBut if this were not ≈øo, yet it is only the <hi>temporary relief</hi> which was to cea≈øe, and we
<pb n="569" facs="unknown:027132_0577_0FD35300BA095C60"/>
we have ≈øeen what that temporary relief was. The words temporary relief, can with no kind of propriety be applied to a debt made payable <hi>at the di≈øtance of ten years,</hi> without any funds being provided for its di≈øcharge at that time, or means of compelling the Legi≈ølature to provide them at all. The words <hi>future</hi> relief might be applicable to ≈øuch a ca≈øe, but I have not a very clear idea of that kind of temporary relief which I mu≈øt wait ten years for, and I therefore conclude that it was not intended to aboli≈øh the debt it≈øelf. The rea≈øon a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned for repealing certain parts of the Act of 1786, may be a good one, but it is no rea≈øon for a total ≈øilence re≈øpecting that part of the law of 1786, which a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the debt, if a repeal of it was really intended.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øay a <hi>total ≈øilence,</hi> re≈øpecting the <hi>a≈ø≈øumption,</hi> for I can find nothing at all re≈øpecting it, in the clau≈øe in que≈øtion.‚ÄîLet us, Mr. Speaker, pay a little more minute attention, to the≈øe <hi>all-powerful</hi> words,‚Äî "So much of every Act, &amp;c. as <hi>directs or ≈øecures</hi> the <hi>payment of the principal ≈øum or of the intere≈øt,</hi> beyond the term of four years, ≈øhall be, and the ≈øame is hereby repealed, and made null and void."</p>
                        <p>Unle≈øs the≈øe words de≈øtroy the debt, it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that there is any thing in the Act of 1789 which can have that effect‚ÄîThe words "≈øo much as <hi>directs the payment of the principal or intere≈øt,"</hi> can with no kind of propriety be ≈øaid to have the lea≈øt operation in the way contended.‚Äî<hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by her Act of 1786 <hi>directed</hi> her proper officer, to pay the intere≈øt half yearly, until the end of the ten years, out of her quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta of the debt of the United States; ≈øhe al≈øo directed her proper officer to pay the principal out of the ≈øame quota at her Land-office, to ≈øuch per≈øons as might be willing to accept of payment in that way; but ≈øhe <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi> no other payment to be made, nor did ≈øhe make any provi≈øion for it. In 1789 ≈øhe <hi>directed</hi> that the≈øe payments ≈øhould cea≈øe, and ≈øhe did this with great propriety, becau≈øe the≈øe payments in the manner <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> and out of a fund not <hi>at her di≈øpo≈øal,</hi> were at
<pb n="570" facs="unknown:027132_0578_0FD3534A0633A968"/>
all times ≈øo improper, that no Act of hers could render them legal.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore clear that this part of the clau≈øe, does not afford even the ≈øemblance of rea≈øon, for the ≈øtrange ≈øuppo≈øition that the law of 1789 meant to <hi>de≈øtroy</hi> the debt, or to do any thing more than to <hi>unfund</hi> it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe, if the expre≈ø≈øion be allowable, it had been <hi>fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> on <hi>funds,</hi> which ≈øhe had no right to <hi>fund</hi> it upon.</p>
                        <p>But it is ≈øaid, that the Act of 1789, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed ≈øo much of the Act of 1786, as <hi>directed</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. but al≈øo ≈øo much of it as <hi>≈øecured</hi> payment; and it is contended that whatever the con≈øtruction may be of the former expre≈ø≈øion, that the latter will admit of nothing le≈øs than an ab≈øolute annihilation of the debt.</p>
                        <p>This ≈øeems, Sir, to be con≈øidered by our enemies as their ≈øtrong ground, but I neverthele≈øs believe that they may without difficulty be driven from it by regular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and fair argument, and I ≈øhall proceed in this way, with full confidence of ≈øucce≈øs and of complete victory.</p>
                        <p>"SO MUCH AS SECURE PAYMENT"‚ÄîWhat do the≈øe words imply? Why that ≈øo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means or afforded ≈øecurity for payment ≈øhould be repealed. But how far did it provide the means or afford ≈øecurity or give a pledge for payment? Why it gave and it pledged as ≈øecurity for payment of the intere≈øt for ten years, the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> of the debt of the United States‚ÄîThe repeal of this part of the law of 1786 which only related to the intere≈øt, has ≈øurely nothing to do with the de≈øtruction of the principal‚ÄîBut it may be ≈øaid, that it al≈øo gave as a pledge or ≈øecurity for redeeming the principal, the right of paying the New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in exchange for vacant lands.‚ÄîAdmitting that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal was in this manner not only <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> but <hi>≈øecured,</hi> what is the con≈øequence of a repeal of this provi≈øion of ≈øecurity? Why ≈øurely not an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of the debt; or any thing more than a legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative declaration that however ju≈øt, legal and la≈øting
<pb n="571" facs="unknown:027132_0579_0FD352CC3A860A58"/>
the debt may be, the payment of it ≈øhall not be <hi>≈øecured</hi> in this particular way, becau≈øe it was not in the power of the Legi≈ølature of 1786 to ≈øecure the payment out of her quota, and therefore ≈øo far as that Act ≈øecures the payment we repeal it becau≈øe it ≈øecured payment from funds not belonging to or at the di≈øpo≈øal of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Did the Act of 1786 ≈øecure payment in any other manner than has been mentioned? ≈øurely not‚ÄîIt mu≈øt I think be admitted, that an a≈ø≈øumption of a debt by a ≈øovereign and independent ≈øtate, without funding it, or providing any means for payment, does not ≈øecure its payment; ≈øince there is no office to apply to for payment;‚Äîno officer directed to make payment;‚Äîno funds provided from which payment is to be made;‚Äî no means of compelling the commonwealth to provide ≈øuch funds; no proce≈øs by which ≈øhe is ameanable to her own citizens; or in ≈øhort any po≈ø≈øible mode whereby the creditor can, independant of the will and plea≈øure of the ≈øtate, be ≈øecure in his payment under ≈øuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances. If this is really the ca≈øe, and I can perceive no room for doubting it, the conclu≈øion nece≈ø≈øarily follows, that the payment of the New-Loan debt was only ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the law of 1786 on the quota of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and that the withdrawing of that ≈øecurity did not de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the debt, altho' it was left without the means of payment until ≈øome other means ≈øhould be provided‚Äî Whether ≈øuch means were afterwards provided or not, will be a que≈øtion of ≈øub≈øequent enquiry.</p>
                        <p>If the payment of the principal and intere≈øt of the New-Loan debt was ≈øecured, <hi>other than has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi> it mu≈øt have been ≈øecured in <hi>≈øome particular way or manner;</hi> for to ≈øay that a <hi>thing is done,</hi> but that it is <hi>not done in any particular way or manner;</hi> would be to talk a language which no rational man will do.‚ÄîWe very well know in <hi>what way and in what manner,</hi> the payment of the intere≈øt was ≈øecured; and we al≈øo know in <hi>what way,</hi> and in <hi>what manner</hi> the payment of the principal at the Land-Office was ≈øecured; but we know
<pb n="572" facs="unknown:027132_0580_0FD3532DA946DD30"/>
of no other way or manner in which either of them was ≈øecured, and of <hi>cour≈øe they were not ≈øecured at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is contended indeed, that the i≈ø≈øuing of the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, was ≈øecuring the payment of them; and we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of of the po≈øition ≈øo far as funds were provided and pledged for that purpo≈øe, but beyond this we ≈øay it is not tenable. There is ≈øurely a wide difference between <hi>evidence</hi> of a debt, and <hi>≈øecurity</hi> for its payment, and the one may exi≈øt without the other. This doctrine may be well exemplified by ca≈øes which have been determined under the ≈øtatutes of limitation. If I have a note of hand of ≈øo long ≈øtanding, as that a recovery is barred by any of the≈øe ≈øtatutes, it is evidence of my debt, but it does not ≈øecure the payment, becau≈øe I can have no remedy to enforce a recovery. The debt is not however de≈øtroyed under the≈øe circum≈øtances, but ≈øtill exi≈øts, and if the debtor by his will provides a <hi>fund</hi> for the payment of his debts <hi>generally,</hi> and directs his executor to pay them out of that fund, without making any particular mention of ≈øuch as are barred by lenghth of time, I am now intitled to payment. Ju≈øt ≈øo it is, I apprehend, with re≈øpect to certificates in the ca≈øe put by our opponents. The certificate is evidence of the debt, and if it be a funded one, it is <hi>≈øecurity</hi> for its payment; otherwi≈øe not, until future means of payment are provided, becau≈øe until then there is no po≈ø≈øible mode of <hi>compelling payment,</hi> and without this, it is idle to talk, of, <hi>the certificates ≈øecuring payment!</hi> ‚ÄîJu≈øt ≈øo was the ca≈øe with re≈øpect to the <hi>unfunded</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates‚Äî It is admitted that they were evidences of a debt, altho' they did not <hi>≈øecure the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of that debt, for the rea≈øons mentioned. Ju≈øt ≈øo was the ca≈øe too with re≈øpect to the old paper-money or bills of credit if they were not funded; and ju≈øt ≈øo it is with re≈øpect to all unfunded debts of every de≈øcription. The debt exi≈øts and the certificate, &amp;c. is evidence of it, but it does not ≈øecure its payment.</p>

                        <p>Had the Legi≈ølature of 1789 contemplated the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> nefarious de≈øign, its language would have been plain and explicit, and the abolition of the New-Loan debt, would (in ca≈øe of a non re-exchange) have been declared in terms clear and unequivocal; unle≈øs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are to ≈øuppo≈øe the Legi≈ølature of 1789, to have been no le≈øs corrupt than one branch of the pre≈øent Legi≈ølature, ≈øeems to ≈øuppo≈øe the Legi≈ølature of 1786 to have been‚Äîbut of this hereafter.</p>
                        <p>In order to prove, that a total de≈øtruction of the New-Loan debt was intended by the Act of 1789, and that this was within the power of the Legi≈ølature, it has been warmly urged, that the Act of 1786 was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="575" facs="unknown:027132_0583_0FD352DE4AAF07F8"/>
intended to be, of but ≈øhort duration; and to give colour to this doctrine, the words <hi>"temporary relief,"</hi> which appear in the Act of 1789 have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being under≈øtood, been perverted to an≈øwer this purpo≈øe. The gentlemen tell us that the≈øe words fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh a Legi≈ølative con≈øtruction in their favor, and that this being the ca≈øe, the honorable Senate have nothing to do but to abide by that con≈øtruction; a con≈øtruction ≈øay they, which ≈øhews that <hi>Penn≈øylvnnia</hi> meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the right of <hi>aboli≈øhing</hi> the New-Loan debt at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and of <hi>demanding</hi> the new certificates in exchange for the old ones.</p>
                        <p>I am ≈øorry, Mr. Speaker, to have occa≈øion for ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that white the Repre≈øentatives of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> affect ≈øo much anxiety for her rights, as to give daily attendance here, they are ≈øo carele≈øs of her honor, as to remain <hi>unmoved,</hi> while that honor is ≈øo deeply wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their honorable managers and learned coun≈øel! Do the≈øe words appear in the law of 1786? They do not. Is not the con≈øtruction of a law to be ≈øought for in the law it≈øelf? It certainly <hi>is.</hi> Would not this kind of rea≈øoning authori≈øe the pa≈ø≈øing of "an <hi>ex po≈øt facto</hi> law, of law impairing the obligation of contracts on every occa≈øion? It certainly would, by declaring the former one, to have been intended but as a <hi>temporary one!</hi> Does the law of 1786 contain a ≈øingle word which can po≈ø≈øibly lead to ≈øuch a con≈øtruction? It does <hi>not.</hi> Does every certificate i≈ø≈øued under that law, contain an ab≈øolute and unconditional promi≈øe for payment, at all events? and does that law expre≈øsly direct that they ≈øhall contain ≈øuch a promi≈øe? The≈øe things <hi>cannot be denied.</hi> Are not all ≈øuch certificates transferrable and made payable to bearer? They <hi>are,</hi> If <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> meant to re≈øerve the rights contended for under the <hi>benign au≈øpices</hi> of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, was it honourable? was it candid? was it fair? or to make u≈øe of more proper language; if ≈øhe had ≈øuch <hi>covert views,</hi> was it not fraud; perfidy; ba≈øene≈øs in the extreme! to direct the i≈ø≈øuing of certificates, which

on the face of them contained an ab≈øolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promi≈øe for payment? Let tho≈øe who counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ≈øuch a con≈øtruction an≈øwer the≈øe que≈øtons! But the words <hi>"temporary relief,"</hi> u≈øed in the Act of 1789 <hi>only</hi> relate, as has already been ≈øhewn, to the <hi>temporary</hi> payment of intere≈øt, and the <hi>temporary</hi> di≈øcharge of the principal and intere≈øt at the Land-office. This <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief only,</hi> was to cea≈øe; no other temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was afforded; and therefore nothing can be more clear, than that every thing beyond this temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was to continue.</p>
                        <p>But the gentlemen tell us "That the Act of 1786 was but a ≈øub≈øtitute for the Act of 1785, and as one was temporary ≈øo was the other."‚ÄîThis kind of logic may perhaps do very well in the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives, when Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> is the object, but it will not go down here‚ÄîIf it ≈øhould prevail it will prove that no ≈øub≈øequent law can be of longer duration than a preceding one! It will prove that the law of 1785, being a ≈øub≈øtitute for that of September 1783, could be of no longer continnuance! It will prove, that the law of Sept, 1783, being a ≈øub≈øtitute for that of March 1783, could be of no longer continuance! and of cour≈øe that the law of 1786 only granted one years intere≈øt! The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that all new laws on the ≈øame ≈øubject, are intended to make different provi≈øion, of ≈øome kind or other from the former ones, and it generally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the fir≈øt law is limited to a ≈øhort period, but that after experience has manife≈øted its utility, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is taken off, and it is, with the nece≈ø≈øary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, made perpetual. On this principle we find that when <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> meant to afford temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <hi>only;</hi> ≈øhe ≈øaid ≈øo; but that when ≈øhe meant that her law ≈øhould be <hi>perpetual,</hi> ≈øhe did not think proper to <hi>limit it,</hi> as ≈øhe had formerly done.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øame kind of logic, Sir, makes its appearance again, and we are next told, "That as the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors had no more merit in the year 1786, than they had in the year 1785, there could be no rea≈øon for
<pb n="577" facs="unknown:027132_0585_0FD3532F687C49D0"/>
granting them greater relief in the la≈øt year, than in the former one, and that it may be therefore fairly conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not intended."‚ÄîTo this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, that they had no more merit in the year 1786 than they had in the year 1783, and that therefore this argument, if it proves any thing at all, proves that the law of 1786 was only intended to make provi≈øion for one year's intere≈øt! If <hi>all</hi> Legi≈ølatures, at <hi>all</hi> times, thought <hi>preci≈øely alike,</hi> on the ≈øame ≈øubject; and if the ≈øituation of the country, the finances of the State, and <hi>all other</hi> circum≈øtances, were at <hi>all times</hi> the ≈øame, this argument might claim ≈øome attention; but as this is not the ca≈øe, it would be but a wa≈øte of time to enter upon its ≈øerious refutation.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> only contemplated the payment of ≈øo much of the debt of the United States, as was due to her own citizens, but her finances did not admit of it; ≈øhe therefore at fir≈øt afforded tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief, and in the year 1786 made an ab≈øolute engagement; and that ab≈øolute engagement remained, although from the circum≈øtances already mentioned, the holders of the certificates were deprived of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief provided for them.</p>
                        <p>(Here Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> read ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the A≈ø≈øembly of the 24th of December, 1784, page 97-8-9-100-1, in order to prove that <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> at that early period, contemplated the a≈ø≈øumption of the debt due to her own citizens; and then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as follows)‚Äî</p>
                        <p>We have al≈øo been told, Sir, that the Act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1780, making up the depreciation, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the old certificates to be given up, as the Act of 1786 did, and that therefore it was intended in 1786, that the old certificates ≈øhould be delivered to the State, to be held until ≈øhe might think proper to demand a re-exchange; but to this the an≈øwer is ea≈øy and mu≈øt ≈øatisfactory; that the Act of December 1780 did not a≈ø≈øume the debt, but only provided for making up the depreciation, and of cour≈øe, the certificates ought
<pb n="578" facs="unknown:027132_0586_0FD3533147869320"/>
to remain in the hands of the holders, and could with no propriety be a≈øked for by the State.</p>
                        <p>Only one argument more, Mr. Speaker, connected with the pre≈øent que≈øtion, remains to be an≈øwered, and a mo≈øt extraordinary one it is.</p>
                        <p>In February 1793, when the game had been ≈øtarted, and the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives were in full chace, they, if the manager's con≈øtruction be right, provided them≈øelves with an in≈øtrument of de≈øtruction, and a dreadful one it will be, unle≈øs we can di≈øarm them of it. At that time they pa≈ø≈øed a law, proving as the managers ≈øay, that the New-Loan debt was aboli≈øhed by the Act of 1789, and no longer exi≈øted as a debt due from <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> This was long after all the tran≈øactions had taken place on which the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is found, it was after they had commenced their enquiries and the charges; it was at a time when they were maturing them for his conviction; and this act of his accu≈øers is now brought forward as a Legi≈ølative con≈øtruction in order to in≈øure his conviction! Had ≈øuch an Act been pa≈ø≈øed by any other ≈øet of men than his accu≈øers, and if ≈øuch was their intention, it might have been imputed to the wantonne≈øs of power merely; but when it is con≈øidered that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> could not know that ≈øuch a law would pa≈øs; that it is ≈øufficient for a man to ≈øquare his actions according to the exi≈øting law; that this Act was pa≈ø≈øed by his accu≈øers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; after the accu≈øation had commenced, and is now relied on by them, in order to en≈øure his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> language affords not a name for ≈øuch a proceeding.</p>

                        <p>If, Mr. Speaker, my principles are hitherto ≈øound, it will I think follow as a nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, <hi>"That the New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the</hi> United States, <hi>and of cour≈øe were redeemable at the Trea≈øury of</hi> Penn≈øylvania."</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øtated, I think, by one of the Managers, that the Act of Congre≈øs of the 8th of May, 1792, is but a continuation of that of the 4th of Augu≈øt, 1790, ≈øo far as relates to the pre≈øent que≈øtion, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of both mu≈øt be the ≈øame‚ÄîThat of the 4th of Augu≈øt 1790, enacts that "The ≈øums which ≈øhall be ≈øub≈øcribed to the loan, ≈øhall be payable in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intere≈øt of the certificates, or notes, which prior to 1≈øt of January la≈øt, were i≈ø≈øued by the re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective

                        <p>But, ≈øay the gentlemen, however true this may be, yet that they were not i≈ø≈øued for compen≈øations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures towards the pro≈øecution of the late war, but in lieu of other certificates.</p>
                        <p>What argument can be more fallacious than this? were they not i≈ø≈øued for payment of ≈øuch compen≈øations in lieu of other certificates, on which payment could not be obtained? and do they not therefore come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the letter and the ≈øpirit of the Act of Congre≈øs?

                        <p>But it is objected, that none were ≈øub≈øcribable but ≈øuch as were <hi>recogni≈øed</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> by the ≈øtate, and it is added, that the≈øe were rejected by the law of 1789, and could not therefore be ≈øub≈øcribable, <hi>even though that Act were void.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Let us next, Sir, examine the opinion of the late Attorney-General of the U. S. ≈øince it has been given in evidence, and relied on by the pro≈øecutors. (See p. 81-2.)</p>
                        <p>Without taking the objection, as I certainly might, that in point of law, this opinion is not legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I ≈øhall wave the objection; ≈øince it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently appear, that the opinion is ≈øo <hi>harmle≈øs,</hi> as to be of no con≈øequence either way‚ÄîThe public di≈øcu≈ø≈øion of the propriety of an opinion, of a brother practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is an unplea≈øing ta≈øk, but when it is given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in order to ≈øhew what the law is, it becomes as fair an object of free examination, as the opinion of a Judge when under examination upon a writ of error.</p>
                        <p>The late Attorney-General <hi>was</hi> "of opinion that the New-Loan certificates were aboli≈øhed by the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and the 20<hi>th of March,</hi> and 1≈øt of April, 1790," but as no Act of any kind was pa≈ø≈øed on the 20<hi>th of March,</hi> 1790, except one for the ≈øale of the barracks at <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> and another for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the tax upon writs, it is fair to conclude, that
<pb n="585" facs="unknown:027132_0593_0FD352F7CFA31CE0"/>
this opinion was given, without much <hi>enquiry, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but very little con≈øideration.</hi> This ≈øuppo≈øition is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more than probable, when we con≈øider, that in the cour≈øe of the trial, it has been often ≈øtated and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied, that the ≈øame gentleman afterwards gave and I pre≈øume on more mature reflection) an opinion on the ≈øame point, on the other ≈øide of the que≈øtion! The la≈øt opinion, tho' often called for, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.‚ÄîWe have traced it to the hands of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of impeachments, and as it is ≈øtated without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be in favor of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> it may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been thought <hi>worth pre≈øerving.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the opinion which does appear, he begins with ≈øaying‚Äî"What may be the re≈øult of a conte≈øt between the holders of tho≈øe certificates, and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania,</hi> I pre≈øume not to determine‚ÄîBut that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States, and that State I have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in deciding," and he concludes by ≈øaying‚Äî"I am of opinion, that the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th of March, and 1≈øt of April 1790, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed the≈øe certificates as debts of the ≈øtate, except for the purpo≈øe of being re-exchanged for Continental certificates, and therefore that the former, as wanting the due recognition from that State, cannot be legally received upon loan."</p>
                        <p>It is not ea≈øy to comprehend, and it is ≈øtill more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to reconcile the various parts of this opinion‚Äî Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> ≈øeems not to have been able to <hi>e≈øtabli≈øh the premi≈øes</hi> either way, but to have been very capable of <hi>drawing his conclu≈øion,</hi> with great clearne≈øs. If a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion without premi≈øes, is to be regarded, the weight of his authority is again≈øt us, but if premi≈øes are e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øential to a conclu≈øion, it will be found that his opinion can be of no weight at all.</p>
                        <p>I have ≈øaid, Sir, that Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> drew his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion without determining on the premi≈øes, and that this was the ca≈øe will ≈øufficiently appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks‚Äî"What may be the re≈øult," ≈øays he, "of a conte≈øt, between the holders of tho≈øe certificates,
<pb n="586" facs="unknown:027132_0594_0FD35332D397ABB8"/>
and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania, I pre≈øume not to determine,"</hi> and I undertake to prove that without fir≈øt determining this, or at lea≈øt forming an opinion of the law on the ≈øubject, it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to give an opinion on the que≈øtion ≈øubmitted to him, or to draw any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion whatever. The que≈øtion of law was preci≈øely the ≈øame, between the then holders of the certificates, and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> as it would be, between the United States, (≈øhould they become the holders) and <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi>‚ÄîThe certificates were transferrable and payable to bearer; if therefore they were <hi>valid</hi> in the hands of the then holders, they would be equally ≈øo, when in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the United States; but if they were not <hi>valid</hi> in the hands of the then holders, neither could they be ≈øo, in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States. Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> however finds the que≈øtion ≈øo difficult, as between the then holders, and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> that he cannot, or will not pre≈øume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, but he is neverthele≈øs clear in his opinion in favour of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> on the que≈øtion between her and the United States, ≈øhould they become the holders or bearers of the certificates. Nothing can I think more fully expo≈øe the impropriety of this opinion than the ca≈øe which I am about to put.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> a bond is transferrable by a≈ø≈øignment; the≈øe certificates were transferrable by delivery. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe I have a bond from my debtor, who refu≈øes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ground of its having been already di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged‚ÄîThis he alledges to be the ca≈øe; as <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> does with re≈øpect to the certificates under con≈øideration, and I deny it, as is done by the certificate-holders.‚ÄîIf I am right, I have a legal claim upon him; and ≈øo have the holders of certificates if they are right, upon the ≈øtate; but if I am wrong, I have no ≈øuch legal claim; in like manner if the holders of the certificates are wrong, they have no ≈øuch legal claim‚ÄîIf I a≈ø≈øign the bond, my a≈ø≈øignee has as good a claim as I had, and in like manner, if the holders of the certificates transfer them to the United States, the United States cannot be
<pb n="587" facs="unknown:027132_0595_0FD3538C43886758"/>
in a wor≈øe ≈øituation than the holders were‚ÄîThere are many ca≈øes in the law, where the a≈ø≈øignee or indor≈øee is in a better ≈øituation than the original payee was, but there is no ca≈øe in which that ≈øituation can be wor≈øe: yet Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> determines again≈øt the transferree, tho' he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to ≈øay, what the law may be between the original parties!</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir; he is of "opinion, that the Acts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, aboli≈øhed the certificates as debts of the State, except for the purpo≈øe of being re-exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," and yet he will not pre≈øume to determine the que≈øtion! How can he be of opinion that they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed, if he can give no opinion between the holders and the State! Since the que≈øtion of abolition, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether depends on a right opinion being formed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the holders and the State!</p>
                        <p>In ≈øhort, Sir, the different parts of this opinion are entirely at variance, and the learned gentleman who gave it, appears to have had <hi>"no difficulty in deciding"</hi> while he "could <hi>not pre≈øume to determine!"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It concludes by ≈øaying, "and therefore the former, to wit, the New-Loan certificates, as wanting the <hi>due recognition</hi> from the State, cannot be legally received upon loan!"‚ÄîWhat is meant by the≈øe words, <hi>"as wanting the due recognition from the State"</hi> I cannot po≈ø≈øibly ≈øay, ≈øince the gentleman who made u≈øe of them, "will not pre≈øume to give an opinion on the exi≈øting law of the State, as between her and the holders of the certificates‚ÄîShe cannot, as already ob≈øerved, <hi>recogni≈øe</hi> them in any other way than by law, and without form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opinion on the law, it is to me inconceivable how an opinion can be formed, that they want her <hi>due</hi> recognition‚ÄîIf the former parts of the opinion were at variance, this ≈øeems to be altogether incomprehen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!</p>

                        <p>Caution in doubtful ca≈øes was nece≈ø≈øary, and the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of legal advice was prudent, but if he erred, and under any advice whatever, refu≈øed ≈øub≈øcriptions, which the law authori≈øed, he would have been compelled by a <hi>mendamus</hi> from the Supreme Court of the United States, to admit of ≈øuch ≈øub≈øcriptions.</p>

re≈øpecting that Act, as well as a ≈øuppo≈øed one of the 30th of March, 1790, ≈øufficiently ≈øhews however, that he did not think, the New-Loan debt was aboli≈øhed by the Act of 1789. His words are "I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Acts of the <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> A≈ø≈øembly of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th March, and 1≈øt of April, 1790, aboli≈øhed the≈øe certificates as debts of the ≈øtate, &amp;c."‚ÄîThis ≈øurely amounts to a declaration that they were <hi>not aboli≈øhed,</hi> as has been contended <hi>by the Act of</hi> 1789, <hi>only;</hi> for if they were aboli≈øhed by that Act, they could not po≈ø≈øibly be aboli≈øhed by the three Acts taken together, nor could either of the two la≈øt operate in the ≈ømalle≈øt degree towards <hi>aboli≈øhing</hi> a thing which had been <hi>aboli≈øhed</hi> before‚ÄîIt follows then, that unle≈øs two la≈øt Acts operate in ≈øome degree towards <hi>aboli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the certificates, they are not, on Mr. <hi>Randolph's</hi> con≈øtruction of the Act of 1789, aboli≈øhed at this day; but as the only Acts which were pa≈ø≈øed on the 30th of March, 1790 related to the ≈øale of the barracks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the tax upon writs, they could have no effect in the way contended.

                        <p>It has in the next place been alledged, that "The New-Loan certificates, even tho' not aboli≈øhed, were not ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe, ≈øay the gentlemen, "They did not bear intere≈øt" but unfortunately for them, they are no le≈øs mi≈øtaken here, than in any of their former points: The certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and the law under which they were i≈ø≈øued declare, that they ≈øhall bear an intere≈øt of ≈øix per cent. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the law of 1789 prevented the holders from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

the intere≈øt for the pre≈øent, yet if it did not aboli≈øh the debt, the intere≈øt ran on, until means of payment ≈øhould be provided‚Äîa debt does not the le≈øs bear intere≈øt, becau≈øe whether owing to its not being payable till a future day, or to the inability of the defendant, or any other cau≈øe, the creditor cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure payment for the pre≈øent, and is obliged to wait for both principal and intere≈øt, until ≈øome future day.

                        </p>
                        <p>It has al≈øo been ≈øaid Sir, that no part of the New-Loan debt was ≈øub≈øcribed under the fir≈øt Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, and as the la≈øt Act is, in this particular, but a continuation of the former one, it has been concluded, that the debt is not ≈øub≈øcribable under either. To this I an≈øwer, that under the fir≈øt Act, it was not the intere≈øt of any man to ≈øub≈øcribe the New-Loan debt, becau≈øe at <hi>that time,</hi> means of redeeming it at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> were not provided, and that therefore no one was ≈øo ≈øilly as to do an act from which he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no benefit; but that ≈øuch means of redemption were afterwards provided, and therefore ≈øuch ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions took place, when they were found to be beneficial. The conclu≈øion, that the New-Loan debt, was not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable under the la≈øt Act of Congre≈øs, becau≈øe no part of it was ≈øub≈øcribed under the fir≈øt Act, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then without foundation.</p>

                        <p>I have ≈øaid, Sir, that <hi>"Penn≈øylvania</hi> might redeem the≈øe debts, without the ≈ømalle≈øt inju≈øtice to her≈øelf, or any thing more than ju≈øtice to her creditors;" and ≈øhe her≈øelf ≈øhall te≈øtify to the truth of this doctrine‚ÄîThe United States had done much for their creditors, but ≈øuch were their arrangements, with re≈øpect to the ≈øit <hi>per cent.</hi> the three <hi>per cent.</hi> and the deferred ≈øtock, that they had not, at lea≈øt in the opinion of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> done ample ju≈øtice.‚Äî<hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> therefore by an Act of the 9th of April, 1791, after reciting; "That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs had by their Act of the 4th of Augu≈øt, 1790. propo≈øed a certain loan; that a compliance with it would greatly benefit this commonwealth, promote the plan of the general government, and facilitate the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and liquidation of the accounts depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and the United States; and that in order to induce the creditors of this ≈øtate to ≈øub≈øcribe to the ≈øaid loan, and at the ≈øame time, to <hi>pre≈øerve the faith and honor of the commonwealth, by indemnifying them for the injury which they might ≈øu≈øtain in con≈øequence of ≈øuch ≈øub≈øcription,</hi> IT SHOULD BE ENACTED AND IT THEREBY WAS ENACTED, that "Every creditor of this State, who ≈øhould ≈øub≈øcribe to the ≈øaid loan certificate whereon intere≈øt ≈øhould be by law payable annually, at the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> ≈øhould, be≈øides the ≈øaid certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, which ≈øuch creditor was thereupon entitled to have and receive from the United States, in pur≈øuance of the ≈øaid recited Act, be entitled to have and receive from the commonwealth, certificates purporting that the ≈øtate ≈øtands pledge from the fir≈øt of January next, to pay ≈øix <hi>per cent.</hi> intere≈øt annually, on that part of the ≈øub≈øcribed debt, which is termed the deferred debt, until the United States ≈øhould make provi≈øion for the payment of the ≈øaid intere≈øt, and al≈øo that the ≈øtate ≈øtands further pledged to pay an additional intere≈øt of three <hi>per cent.</hi> annually, from the 1≈øt of January next, on that part of the ≈øub≈øcribed debt, which bears an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt

The ≈øuppo≈øition therefore, that <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> did not mean to afford them the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at her Trea≈øury, carries with it a high charge of partiality and inju≈øtice with re≈øpect to her own citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. If admitted, it would in fact amount to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration on her part, that although the preten≈øions and the rights of her creditors were alike, ≈øhe meant to admini≈øter ju≈øtice to them by different weights, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal mea≈øures; and that while ≈øhe amply provided for a part of them, ≈øhe intended, that tho≈øe who ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed to the ≈øecond loan, <hi>under her own invitation</hi> ≈øhould ≈øu≈øtain a heavy lo≈øs.</p>
                        <p>But exclaim the gentlemen;‚Äîwere the≈øe ≈øub≈øcribers to have the <hi>enormous</hi> ≈øum of twenty ≈øhillings in the pound!

                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it follows, that on principles of equal ju≈øtice, there is every rea≈øon to conclude, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended by her Act of April, 1792, to render the New-Loan debts, ≈øub≈øcribed to the loan of the United States, redeemable at her Trea≈øury.</p>
                        <p>But the gentlemen exclaim again;‚Äî"Is it po≈ø≈øible to ≈øuppo≈øe, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> really intended, by her Act of April, 1792, to put her≈øelf intirely within the power of the United States, by providing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>every ≈øpecies of pretended debt,</hi> which they might think proper to a≈ø≈øume!‚ÄîI an≈øwer, that nothing can be more certain, than that ≈øhe did not; and I freely admit, that if the New-Loan debt was not <hi>a real,</hi> but only a <hi>pretended one,</hi> I ≈øhould be ≈øo far from contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it it was redeemable, that I ≈øhould have taken no trouble to prove its exi≈øtence, or that it was ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable.</p>
                        <p>We are again told Sir, that the objects of redemption are enumerated in the 2d ≈øection of the Act of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> of the 10th of April, 1792; and that, at the New-Loan debt is not among them, it is not within the provi≈øions of that Act, nor redeemable.</p>
                        <p>If the premi≈øes were admitted to be true, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion might perhaps be incontrovertable, but if they are fal≈øe, it is certainly unwarranted. An examination of them is therefore nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                        <p>To me it appears, that THAT ≈øection of the Act of April, 1792, does not enumerate all the objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.‚ÄîI admit that it enumerates all the objects of immediate redemption from the particular funds ≈øpecially provided by the early part of that Act; and I think that I may ≈øafely make this admi≈ø≈øion, without weakening, or detracting from my opinion, that the
<pb n="595" facs="unknown:027132_0603_0FD353AD50084B38"/>
≈øame Act makes eventual provi≈øion for ca≈øes not enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in the 2d ≈øection:‚ÄîAt the time of that Act being pa≈ø≈øed, the fir≈øt loan of the United States was clo≈øed, and it could not po≈ø≈øibly be known whether it would or would not be opened again‚Äî<hi>eventual</hi> provi≈øion might therefore be very proper, but, <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> provi≈øion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt, mu≈øt have been very improper at that time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> then knew that ≈øhe had <hi>certain debts</hi> to provide for at <hi>all events,</hi> and the≈øe ≈øhe enumerated in the 2d ≈øection and took care to make ≈øpecial and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular provi≈øion for;‚Äîbut ≈øhe al≈øo knew, that ≈øhe owed certain other debts, which ≈øhe deemed it proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the payment of, or not, as the United States ≈øhould, or ≈øhould not open or extend the loan‚ÄîIf they ≈øhould not, ≈øhe did not think proper to provide for their redemption, but if they ≈øhould, ≈øhe deemed it proper, and I think that, if we carefully attend to the 2d and 6th ≈øections, it will appear that the fir≈øt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> provi≈øion for the di≈øcharge of certain debts; the latter to make <hi>eventual</hi> provi≈øion for certain others, if the loan of the United States ≈øhould be again opened‚ÄîThat the 2d ≈øection does not enumerate <hi>all</hi> the objects of redemption at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, is I think evident both from its letter and ≈øpirit.</p>
                        <p>After providing, in part, an aggregate fund for the immediate di≈øcharge of the enumerated debts, we find the preamble to the 2d ≈øection, to be worded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows‚Äî"And in order to provide effectually for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of CERTAIN public debts herein after ≈øpecified, upon ju≈øt and rea≈øonable terms, "BE IT ENACTED," &amp;c. ‚ÄîThe law then proceeds to encrea≈øe the funds and to direct the order in which <hi>certain</hi> debts ≈øhall be di≈øcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed‚ÄîNow, Sir, what is the meaning of the≈øe words, "In order to provide for the redemption of CERTAIN public debts?" Certainly not that <hi>all</hi> of them were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the ≈øection, which is introduced by the≈øe words, and the expre≈ø≈øion clearly ≈øhews, that <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> acknowledge other ones, be≈øides the CERTAIN
<pb n="596" facs="unknown:027132_0604_0FD353B3FAC8A908"/>
ones referred to in the preamble, and enumerated in the enacting clau≈øe. Had not this been the ca≈øe, the expre≈ø≈øion would have been, In order to provide for the redemption of THE public debts, in≈øtead of providing for <hi>certain</hi> of them‚ÄîThe expre≈ø≈øion; THE public debts, would have been the ≈øame with that of <hi>all</hi> of them, but the words CERTAIN of them have certainly a more confined meaning, and the u≈øing of this language, ≈øhews, that ≈øhe <hi>recogni≈øed</hi> and acknowledged <hi>other</hi> ones be≈øides tho≈øe enumerated in this ≈øection‚ÄîBut it is not pretended that ≈øhe owed any other debts than the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated ones, except the <hi>New-Loan debt,</hi> and the <hi>debt</hi> due on the unfunded depreciation certificates. If then the expre≈ø≈øion u≈øed in this law, ≈øhews that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> acknowledged <hi>other</hi> debts, than the enumerated ones, it al≈øo ≈øhews, that ≈øhe acknowledged the New-Loan and unfunded Depreciation-Debts, to which, and to which only, they clearly implied, and ≈øtrongly marked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception could relate. The truth is, that all the debts enumerated in the 2d ≈øection, were originally contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and were due from her≈øelf‚Äî≈øhe therefore by the fir≈øt and ≈øecond ≈øection provided a fund for their <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> di≈øcharge, and by the 2d ≈øection, ≈øhe directs the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which they ≈øhall be di≈øcharged out of it; and this nece≈ø≈øarily lead to their enumeration‚ÄîBut as ≈øhe did not intend that the New-Loan and unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation debts, ≈øhould be paid out of this fund, ≈øhe could with no propriety enumerate them, as coming within this provi≈øion, for immediate redemption.‚Äî The≈øe debts ≈øhe con≈øidered as not being originally and properly ≈øpeaking her own debts, but the debts of the United States, and ≈øhe therefore thought proper to let them re≈øt as they were, until the United States ≈øhould extend or again open their loan, and that their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> ≈øhould depend on this event taking place or not.

                        <p>It has been warmly contended, that "The ≈øecond ≈øection is equally exten≈øive with the ≈øixth, and that the latter does not embrace a ≈øingle object which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the former."

the meaning of the law is, but mu≈øt endeavour to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the hidden rece≈ø≈øes of Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> mind, and there grovel for it in the dark!</p>
                        <p>The bu≈øine≈øs of a provi≈øo, Sir, is to <hi>re≈øtrain</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> that which has gone before, but there is not a ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle feature of this kind, in any part of the ≈øixth ≈øection.

                        <p>Nor is it po≈ø≈øible, Sir, for that to be a provi≈øo, which <hi>is more exten≈øive than the enacting clau≈øe.</hi>

                        <p>Al≈øo that the ≈øixth ≈øection has never been con≈øidered as a provi≈øo upon the 2d ≈øection, nor confined to the ca≈øes mentioned in it, is clear from what I am now about to ≈øay‚ÄîIt is admitted that the unfunded depreciation cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, are not included in the ≈øecond ≈øection, and that <hi>that</hi> ≈øection makes no provi≈øion for their redemption at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and yet it is in proof, that it has been the con≈øtant practice, for them to be <hi>≈øo redeemed</hi> under the ≈øixth ≈øection.</p>
                        <p>Among others who have under≈øtood the law as I do, and who≈øe old unfunded depreciation certificates, were redeemed in this way, were Mr. <hi>Rittenhou≈øe:</hi> The late Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> Speaker of the Senate, at the time when the redemption law of April, 1792, was pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed;

and Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> and Judge <hi>Yeates,</hi> who were very competent to the true interpretation of the law;‚Äî The Regi≈øter-General certified the payment to be due; the Governor drew his warrants for payment, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were actually made by the State Trea≈øurer‚ÄîWhy then is criminality imputed to the Comptroller-General and to <hi>him only?</hi> and why do not the≈øe mighty aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the law, direct its ≈øword again≈øt all the≈øe other officers of government!</p>
                        <p>They perhaps have not the misfortune to <hi>have fallen under the di≈øplea≈øure of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But further Sir; it is in evidence, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> him≈øelf, in a conver≈øation with Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> expre≈ø≈øed his opinion, in clear and pointed terms, that the old unfunded depreciation certificates, were, under the 6th ≈øection, <hi>redeemable at the Trea≈øury</hi> of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>‚Äî He therefore, at lea≈øt at that time, thought the 6th ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>more exten≈øive</hi> than the 2d; that the one was <hi>not a provi≈øo</hi> on the other; and that <hi>other</hi> ca≈øes than tho≈øe mentioned in the 2d ≈øection were intended to be provided for by the 6th.</p>
                        <p>But ≈øay the gentlemen, is it po≈ø≈øible to ≈øuppo≈øe, that the State meant to ≈øacrifice her three <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øtock, in order to redeem the New-Loan debt, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the debt of the United States?</p>
                        <p>Whether ≈øuch a ≈øuppo≈øition is po≈ø≈øible or not, I do not think worth con≈øidering, ≈øince we have made no ≈øuch ≈øuppo≈øition, nor is it at all nece≈ø≈øary to our con≈øtruction ‚ÄîThe 2d ≈øection directs the ≈øale of the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øtock, for the redemption of the debts enumerated in that ≈øection, and we admit, that the New-Loan debt is not enumerated in it, nor entitled to redemption out of the fund which it provides.</p>
                        <p>We have been told Sir, by the learned coun≈øel, "That if the 6th ≈øection is not to be taken as a provi≈øo to the 2d one, or if it is interpreted to extend to a ≈øingle new object, it mu≈øt extend <hi>to all the debts, due from all the ≈øtates in the Union, to their own citizens!</hi> and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably

                        <p>This is to be ≈øure a fine flight in the regions of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and imagination, and ≈øuppo≈øing it to have been ≈øo intended. I ≈øhall re≈øt ≈øatisfied with gazing with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wonder at the plea≈øing phantom!</p>
                        <p>I have done with this point Mr. Speaker, and ≈øhall proceed to the</p>
                        <p>Second po≈øition;‚ÄîNamely, THAT THERE WAS AN AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATION MADE BY LAW, FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES, AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
                        <p>The Con≈øtitution of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> provides, that "NO MONEY SHALL BE DRAWN FROM THE TREASURY, BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS MADE BY LAW." and one of the articles charges, that the defendant "with a view to his own emolument, did under colour of his office, certify to the Governor, that certain debts, including the ≈øaid certificates, but not naming or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing the ≈øame, were redeemable and payable when, <hi>no fund was by law provided for paying the ≈øame."</hi>‚Äî This charge is certainly a pretty high one, but if it ≈øhall appear, as I tru≈øt it will, to be without foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it mu≈øt fall.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March the 1≈øt, 1786, created the New-Loan debt and funded it as to part.</p>
                        <p>The Act of the 27th of March, 1789, unfunded it altogether.</p>
                        <p>An Act of the 7th of April, 1791, for "appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating certain funds and revenues for the ≈øupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the payment of the public debts," after making certain ≈øpecific appropriations, provides by the 12th appropriation, that the re≈øidue of the aggregate fund therein mentioned, ≈øhall be applied "to pay all warrants thereafter to to be drawn for <hi>claims</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, by virtue of <hi>any law or laws of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And the 6th ≈øection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, provides that "The holder or holders of any

certificate or certificates, ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States, if it ≈øhould be again opened, ≈øhall be entitled to have and receive the nominal value of the ≈øaid certificate or certificates, <hi>from the State-Trea≈øurer,</hi> upon ≈øub≈øcribing to the ≈øaid loan, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to the State-Trea≈øurer, for the u≈øe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, the certificates which they ≈øhould receive from the United States, in con≈øequence of ≈øuch ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription."</p>
                        <p>The certificates certified to the Governor by Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> in the manner already mentioned, were the New-Loan certificates; they had been ≈øub≈øcribed to the loan of the United States; ≈øuch transfer as is in this Act mentioned had been made, and if I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and redeemable at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania,</hi> I think hardly any thing can be more clear than that, <hi>"an appropriation was made by law for that purpo≈øe."</hi>

                        <p>That the New-Loan debt was payable by the Act of April 1792, and not by the Act of April 1791, will clearly appear when we con≈øider, that after the pa≈ø≈øing of the fir≈øt, and until the pa≈ø≈øing of the la≈øt, it was <hi>not payable at all.</hi> It was a claim again≈øt the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth it is true, but as payment of that claim had been ≈øtopped by a former law, it could not take place, until it was directed by a ≈øub≈øequent law. This was directed by the Act of April 1792, and not before, and of cour≈øe it was by this Act and by no other that it was payable.</p>
                        <p>Here, Sir, it is material to recollect, that in every in≈øtance of the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> certified to the Governor in <hi>the ≈øame words</hi> as he has done with re≈øpect to the New-Loan debt; that the Regi≈øter-General joined with him in certifying in like manner; that warrants were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon i≈ø≈øued by the Governor, and payments were made by the Trea≈øurer, to <hi>able law judges,</hi> without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øuppo≈øing it to be wrong, until the di≈øcovery was made by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives. The que≈øtion as to an appropriation having been made by law, or not, was preci≈øely the ≈øame in both ca≈øes, and what was right in one of them, cannot be wrong in the other.</p>
                        <p>But we are told "That the Act of the 26th of March 1789, ≈øet apart only ¬£. 10,000 annually for <hi>claims</hi> and improvements, and as <hi>that</hi> ≈øum was too ≈ømall to ≈øatisfy the New-Loan debt, the fund could not be intended for that purpo≈øe." This I admit to be true, and I have no objection to furni≈øhing our opponents with a much ≈øtronger rea≈øon in ≈øupport of their argument. <hi>That</hi> law was pa≈ø≈øed the very day next preceding the pa≈ø≈øing of the law which ≈øtopped payment of the New-Loan debt, and while the bill for that purpo≈øe was before the

Hou≈øe, ≈øo that payment could hot have been then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>out of any funds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This does not however operate again≈øt us, ≈øince in≈øufficient to this purpo≈øe, the annual ≈øum of ¬£. 10,000 may have been in March 1789, when <hi>all the New-Loan certificates were in circulation,</hi> the re≈øidue of the aggregate fund ≈øet apart for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Act of April 1791, was abundantly more than ≈øufficient. At this time there were but <hi>few</hi> of the New-Loan certificates in circulation, and the ≈øum ≈øet apart by the 12th appropriation for claims and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, was ≈øo great, as, among many other things, to furni≈øh the <hi>whole of the State ≈øub≈øcription to the</hi> Penn≈øylvania <hi>bank.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is further objected, "That the law of April 1791, did not contemplate the payment of the New-Loan debt, ≈øince in none of the enumerated appropriations is that debt mentioned." This may perhaps be true, ≈øince I can hardly ≈øuppo≈øe, that the Legi≈ølature of 1791, could contemplate providing for the payment of a debt, which was not at that time payable at all, nor until more than one year after, and this ≈øufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for there being no ≈øpecial appropriation for that purpo≈øe. There is not however a ≈øhadow of pretence for the objection, ≈øince the clau≈øe ≈øpecially appropriates all the re≈øidue of the aggregate fund "To pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by virtue of any law or laws of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth"‚ÄîThis ≈øurely ≈øupercedes the nece≈ø≈øity of a ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appropriation upon every occa≈øion, for claims then due and payable, but not otherwi≈øe provided for, or which ≈øhould be made due and payable by ≈øub≈øequent laws. The Con≈øtitution does not require a ≈øpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation on every particular occa≈øion, mentioning the object and the fund at the ≈øame time: or if it does, the whole of the 12th appropriation is uncon≈øtitutional, ina≈ømuch as it mentions no particular object to be provided for, but creates a fund for the payment of all warrants i≈ø≈øued under any law for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments‚ÄîIn

1791 <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> owed certain debts, and the Legi≈ølature provided for their payment, and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated certain funds for that purpo≈øe; but ≈øhe al≈øo owed many others, of various de≈øcriptions, and ≈øhe knew that ≈øhe would, under her future laws, be liable for their payments‚ÄîShe therefore by the 12th appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provided a fund "To pay all warrants to be drawn for claims and improvements by virtue of any law or laws." What the then exi≈øting claims were, ≈øhe did not think it nece≈ø≈øary to determine; what claims might be due under any future law or laws, ≈øhe left to the con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future Legi≈ølatures, but ≈øhe provided and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated a fund for the di≈øcharge of all ≈øuch claims as were then payable or ≈øhould be made ≈øo; "By virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth.‚Äî By a law of March, 1786, the New-Loan debt was created; by a law of the 10th of April, 1792, it was made payable, and of cour≈øe it was payable out of a fund provided "to pay all warrants drawn for claims by virtue of any law of this commonwealth."‚ÄîUnle≈øs therefore the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, is <hi>not a law of this commonwealth;</hi> the law of the 7th of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 1791, provides and appropriates a fund, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is payable under that of April, 1792.‚ÄîThe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution only requires, that there ≈øhould be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation; but there may be one appropriation, for ten thou≈øand purpo≈øes;‚Äîas well for the future, as the pre≈øent, and it may be left to future Legi≈ølatures to ≈øay, what debts ≈øhall be contracted or made payable, but when they are contracted and made payable, it will be from this <hi>previous appropriation,</hi> without an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional one being made.

for claims or improvements by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth!"</hi> By virtue of a law of the 10th of April, 1792, the claims of the holders of the New-Loan certificates were, as we ≈øay, entitled to be paid ‚Äîcould I ≈øuppo≈øe, Sir, that any Legi≈ølature after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 1791, had thought that the Legi≈ølature of that time, had made u≈øe of language not ≈øufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive of an appropriation, and to have wi≈øhed to make u≈øe of language more clear, pointed and expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive than this; "To <hi>pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improvements, by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth;"</hi>‚ÄîI a≈øk what expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion more clear;‚Äîwhat terms more per≈øpicuous; what language more ≈øtrong and expre≈ø≈øive of an appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could po≈ø≈øibly have been u≈øed!‚ÄîIf our language affords them, I have no conception of it, nor can I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how an appropriation could by any ≈øub≈øequent law have been made, if it was not already done.</p>
                        <p>I have admitted, Sir, that the Legi≈ølature of April, 1791, may not have contemplated the New-Loan debt, but if this proves any thing, it proves what has not, and I am ≈øure will not be contended;‚Äînamely, that nothing made payable by any law, ≈øub≈øequent to that time, and not then in the contemplation of the Legi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, was payable out of the 12th appropriation: The que≈øtion is not, whether it was in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legi≈ølature of April, 1791; but of the Legi≈ølature of April, 1792. What adds con≈øiderable weight to the idea that the Legi≈ølature of April, 1791, intended the 12th appropriation as a fund for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the un-enumerated debts of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whether funded or not, ≈øo ≈øoon as the latter ≈øhould be by law made payable, is a report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ways and means, on the 8th of February, 1791, adopted by the very Hou≈øe which pa≈ø≈øed the law of April, 1791.

"The large amount of public ≈øecurities of the United States, which are the property of the State, obliged your committee to take into con≈øideration, the terms of the loan propo≈øed by Congre≈øs to the dome≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic creditors, in the Act, "entitled an Act making provi≈øion for the debt of the United States."

                        </p>
                        <p>This report, Sir, having been adopted by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, is not only indicative of its ≈øentiments, but is expre≈ø≈øed in its own words and language.‚ÄîI read it for ≈øeveral purpo≈øes. The ≈øhameful imputation has been made again≈øt <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> that ≈øhe only meant to free her≈øelf from her embarra≈ø≈øments; and as ≈øhe was not embarra≈ø≈øed by her unfunded debt, ≈øhe did not mean to provide a fund or make an appropriation for its di≈øcharge.‚ÄîIf the an≈øwers already given to this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not ≈øufficient, I hope that they are afforded by this report‚ÄîIt was adopted in February 1791 by the <hi>≈øome Legi≈ølature,</hi> which in April 1791, created and ≈øet apart the fund out of which we ≈øay the New-Loan debt is, under the law of April 1792, payable, and it is therefore worthy of peculiar attention. In it we find nothing in ≈øupport of the a≈ø≈øertion, that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> only intended to free her≈øelf from her embarra≈ø≈øments, by providing for the di≈øcharge of her funded debts‚Äîon the contrary we find her ≈øaying, that "The embarra≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her finances, chiefly aro≈øe from her large un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded debt, the whole amount whereof was an actual demand again≈øt the Trea≈øury." What was this large unfunded debt? Nothing that I know of, except the <hi>New-Loan Debt,</hi> and the debt due upon the old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded Depreciation certificates. Is not this therefore a full acknowledgment of the New-Loan debt? But how it may be a≈øked could ≈øhe be embarra≈ø≈øed by it? <hi>In promptu e≈øt re≈øpon≈øio;</hi> and that an≈øwer is, that as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt was accumulating and pay-day mu≈øt come, ≈øhe felt her≈øelf as much embarra≈ø≈øed by the pro≈øpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evils as by the exi≈øtence of pre≈øent ones.</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir;‚Äî≈øhe felt an embarra≈ø≈øment from her faith being pro≈øtrated and her honour tainted, and from this

embarra≈ø≈øment ≈øhe wi≈øhed to be freed. That I may avoid repetition I will not again read any part of the report, nor be guilty of u≈øele≈øs quotations from it, but ≈øhall re≈øt ≈øatisfied with a≈øking, if its great; nay, its principal object does not appear to be, to re≈øtore public faith, by making either immediate or eventual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion for the di≈øcharge of the unfunded debt? If this que≈øtion is an≈øwered in the affirmative, how futile mu≈øt the objection be, that ≈øhe only wi≈øhed to free her≈øelf from her embarra≈ø≈øments by providing for the funded ones! That ≈øhe did not make immediate and certain provi≈øion for its payment is true, becau≈øe ≈øhe did not know whether the loan of the United States, on which that provi≈øion was to depend, would or would not be again opened. But ≈øhe neverthele≈øs <hi>provided a fund and made an appropriation</hi> for the payment, if it ≈øhould be opened, and the Act of April 1792 fixed the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that fund and appropriation, upon the terms and conditions contained in the la≈øt mentioned Act.</p>

                        <p>But, Sir, the mo≈øt important part of this report re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be mentioned‚ÄîIt offered, for the adoption of the Hou≈øe, a re≈øolution <hi>which was adopted by the Hou≈øe</hi> in the following words, to wit: That the re≈øidue of the aggregate fund ≈øhould be appropriated to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and di≈øcharge of "THE ARREARAGES OF INTEREST NOW DUE ON THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES."</p>
                        <p>This re≈øolution was pa≈ø≈øed before the tran≈øactions took place which are imputed to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
                        <p>It was pa≈ø≈øed by the ≈øame Hou≈øe, which pa≈ø≈øed the law of April 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, making the 12th appropriation, out of which we ≈øay the New-Loan debt was by the law of April 1792 made payable.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øhews that <hi>that</hi> Hou≈øe was ≈øo far from being of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt had been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed by the Act of March 1789, that it not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged its exi≈øtence, but thought that the intere≈øt due upon it, ≈øhould be paid independent of the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It ≈øhews that the 12th appropriation was intended for this purpo≈øe, and although the law pa≈ø≈øed ≈øoon after by the ≈øame Hou≈øe, left the ≈øame appropriation to ≈øatisfy <hi>all claims</hi> which future Legi≈ølatures ≈øhould make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>After all this, can it be nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øay any thing more to prove, that when by the Act of April 1792, the New-Loan debt was made payable, the Act of April 1791 contained an appropriation for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe?</p>
                        <p>Yes! ≈øay the gentlemen; for that the words "To ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all <hi>claims"</hi> are not de≈øcriptive of the New-Loan certificates, ≈øince they formed no <hi>claim</hi> again≈øt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but were only receipts for the return of the certificates at the plea≈øure of the commonwealth." With what dexterity do the gentlemen ≈øhift their ground? In order to get rid of one difficulty, they
<pb n="612" facs="unknown:027132_0620_0FD353CADF2E2D80"/>
warmly contended, that the New-Loan certificates did not create a <hi>debt,</hi> but only a <hi>claim</hi> again≈øt the State. Lord <hi>Coke</hi> was our authority that the word <hi>claim</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>debts</hi> and is of more exten≈øive meaning than the word <hi>debt.</hi> They now abandon their former ground, and ≈øay that the New-Loan certificates were only in nature of <hi>receipts</hi> for the old Continental ones, but that they <hi>did not amount to a claim again≈øt the State.</hi> They are driven to this ≈øubterfuge, by our ≈øhewing, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidue of the 12th appropriation is for the payment of all un-enumerated <hi>claims</hi> again≈øt the commonwealth; and they can find no way of getting rid of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but by contending, that <hi>that</hi> which they had before ≈øaid <hi>was a claim</hi> again≈øt the commonwealth, is <hi>not a claim</hi> again≈øt the commonwealth!</p>
                        <p>It may therefore I think be fairly concluded, that there is not a ≈øhadow of ground for this charge, of <hi>a violation of the Con≈øtitution;</hi> and that if the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives had under≈øtood the law but half as well as Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> did, they would hardly have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them≈øelves by making it. If <hi>they</hi> were impeached for this part of their conduct, there is perhaps <hi>one ground</hi> on which they might be acquitted.‚ÄîI will proceed, Sir, to my</p>
                        <p>Third and la≈øt po≈øition; namely‚ÄîTHAT NO CRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINAL OFFENCE IS SUFFICIENTLY CHARGED AND PROV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED AGAINST MR. NICHOLSON.</p>

I need not take much trouble to prove, that there is no ground for the impeachment, unle≈øs an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence has been committed by Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> in his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial capacity. <hi>"The Governor,"</hi> ≈øays the Con≈øtitution, <hi>"and all other civil officers under this commonwealth, ≈øhall be liable to impeachment for any mi≈ødemeanor in office."</hi>

evidence in ≈øupport of it‚ÄîThe committee of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments knew, or might have known, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> did not certify in his <hi>official</hi> capacity;‚Äîthey al≈øo knew, or they might have known, that he did not certify to <hi>any officer</hi> whatever, that the ≈øaid certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable‚ÄîIf they did know the≈øe things, it is really too bad, to charge it to have been done <hi>under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office;</hi> and if they did not know the≈øe things, they were guilty of a culpable neglect of duty, when the means of information were at hand by enquiring of Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The≈øe, Sir, are not objections to mere form, but they go to the very e≈ø≈øence of the fir≈øt article. If they are ≈øolid, that article is in≈øufficient, and no weight of evidence could authori≈øe a conviction;‚Äîor if it could, it will be found, that the evidence brought to ≈øupport it, cannot po≈ø≈øibly affect the defendant.</p>
                        <p>It appears in evidence, to be an <hi>uniform practice</hi> with Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> to authenticate his <hi>official</hi> acts, by ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribing his name at length, where he tran≈øacted bu≈øine≈øs with any other officers. It appears that in all the ca≈øes which this article ≈øtates to have been done by him, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of his office,</hi> he did no more than write on the back of the New-Loan certificates, the≈øe words <hi>"Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable,"</hi> with the initial letters of his name ≈øub≈øcribed, and without adding the words "Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General's office." This ≈øufficiently ≈øhews, that he did not con≈øider the≈øe acts as being <hi>official,</hi> and it will next appear, that no body el≈øe con≈øidered them ≈øo.</p>
                        <p>But why, it is a≈øked, did Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> certify at all, if it was not in his official capacity, and intended as an authentic document in the proper offices, to ≈øhew that the New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States? The gentlemen who have a≈øked the que≈øtion, have heard the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and cannot I am ≈øure be at any lo≈øs for the proper an≈øwer. This young gentleman is the ≈øon of the late Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, and his evidence is ≈øo clear and ≈øatisfactory, that if all prejudices, either in

favour of or again≈øt Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> are laid a≈øide, as I tru≈øt they are, it will appear, that the evidence adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if any there is, again≈øt Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> under this charge, is no le≈øs in≈øufficient, than the charge it≈øelf. He ≈øwears, that "it was thought for the benefit and ≈øafety of individuals, that, they ≈øhould fir≈øt apply to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> for their certificates, le≈øt they might be locked up until the end of the loan in 1793, when the Secretary of the Trea≈øury was to decide, and if any ≈øhould be rejected, as not being ≈øub≈øcribable, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might have lain out of the intere≈øt in the mean time; and for this rea≈øon if they brought their certificates to the Commi≈ø≈øioner, without being fir≈øt ≈øhewn to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> they were ≈øent to him for examination, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his certification was of no con≈øequence to the Commi≈ø≈øioner; the receipts given by him for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates being purpo≈øely ≈øo worded, as that the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the State offices might be examined at the end of the loan, and that from them he might learn whether the certificates were <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> or not;"‚Äî but he expre≈øsly declares, "That <hi>his father took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Mr.</hi> Nichol≈øon<hi>'s certification, as to what re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him≈øelf."</hi>‚ÄîWe have here, Sir, a full and complete ≈øtatement of this <hi>"certifying, recogni≈øing and declaring"</hi> by Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon, "under colour of his office, and to promote and procure his own emolument,"</hi> and I now a≈øk, if ever a charge was more groundle≈øs! an imputation more ≈øcandalous! If the honourable accu≈øers voted this article of impeachment without enquiring into its truth or fal≈øity, <hi>their</hi> criminality is not le≈øs than <hi>that</hi> which they are plea≈øed to impute to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon!</hi> And if they voted it after enquiring, and knowing that it was not true, they have ≈øinned in a ≈øtill greater degree. In the one ca≈øe, ignorance is no excu≈øe; in the other, knowledge aggravates the crime. What can be more clear than that the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, neither wi≈øhed for any information from Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon that which he gave to the certificate hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? What can be more clear than that it was re≈øerved
<pb n="617" facs="unknown:027132_0625_0FD353CEF6EB6708"/>
for the Secretary of the Trea≈øury to determine, at the clo≈øe of the loan, in the year 1793, whether the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were ≈øub≈øcribable or not; and this too, not from Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi>'s certification, but from authentic documents in the proper offices? and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner of Loans purpo≈øely gave his receipts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly? What can be more clear, than that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner of Loans ≈øent the certificate holders to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> for no other purpo≈øe, than that he, being an experienced and well informed per≈øon, ≈øhould examine their certificates, left at the clo≈øe of the loan in the year 1793 they might ≈øu≈øtain a lo≈øs by lying out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in the mean time, if the certificates ≈øhould then be rejected? <hi>Nothing, I apprehend;</hi> and yet for the≈øe manifold, but di≈øintere≈øted acts of <hi>kindne≈øs</hi> and <hi>benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> flowing from a heart of benevolence, and a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to oblige, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> is impeached for a <hi>high crime and mi≈ødemeanor!</hi> On the ≈øame principles might the charitable man, who≈øe good deeds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>holy writ,</hi> be impeached for helping the claud! directing the blind! comforting the widow! cheri≈øhing the fatherle≈øs! or relieving the beggar at his door! The motives of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> appear to have been equally free from ≈øordid views or private gain.</p>
                        <p>I have not approved of his politics, Sir, but his well known kindne≈øs and benevolence of di≈øpo≈øition are virtues which command my re≈øpect, and I cannot but feel for the degraded honour of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> when I find the≈øe <hi>amiable virtues converted into a crime!</hi> If this has ari≈øen from a di≈øregard or culpable neglect of duty, by an omi≈ø≈øion of proper enquiry, it merits ≈øevere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madver≈øion;‚Äîif from the more ignoble cau≈øe of an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party purpo≈øes, that animadver≈øion ≈øhould be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by no re≈øtraint.</p>
                        <p>If Sir, the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ≈øtood in need of ≈øupport, which will not be alledged, it is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the form of receipts con≈øtantly given by his late father, the former commi≈ø≈øioner of loans‚Äî"RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION."

been u≈øed to ≈øhew more clearly than the≈øe do, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi>'s certificate was not con≈øidered as an <hi>official</hi> act or regarded as ≈øuch by Mr. <hi>Smith? ≈øurely none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again; That the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, who at the clo≈øe of the loan, was finally to decide on the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribability of all certificates that might be offered, had no idea of taking the lea≈øt notice of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi>'s little memorandum, given for the ≈øatisfaction of individuals, appears from his letter of the 8th of June, 1791, to the Commi≈ø≈øioner of loans. (See page 273) In it he ≈øays, "It will not be proper that you commit the examination, and checking of the certificates of the a≈ø≈øumed debt, to any per≈øon, who does not actually belong to your office. It cannot be deemed a legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of your duty, to rely upon any per≈øon not duly authori≈øed. You will receive the≈øe certificates, and give on the delivery of them to you, and before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon with the checks, a de≈øcriptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment that ≈øuch certificates are placed in your hands, with a view to the loan. The ≈øub≈øcribers will be ≈øen≈øible, that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becau≈øe the ≈øub≈øcriptions may exceed the a≈ø≈øumption, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates may prove counterfeit or forged," After hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, will any man ≈øuppo≈øe that the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, was ≈øo little mindful of the tru≈øt repo≈øed in him, as to commit it to others, or to have a ≈øingle thought about Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi>'s memorandum? After hearing the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> will any man ≈øuppo≈øe, that his father did not act in exact conformity with tho≈øe directions; or that the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ever imagined, that he was doing any more than <hi>obliging individuals in his private capacity?</hi> and not <hi>under colour of office and with a view to his own emolument, endeavouring to defraud the public?</hi> That he did not act with a view to his own emolument, will if po≈ø≈øible, appear ≈øtill more clearly when we con≈øider</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. That he <hi>did not in a ≈øingle in≈øtance of his own, certify at all;</hi>‚Äîand</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="619" facs="unknown:027132_0627_0FD328380BB4BFF8"/>2d. That he certified <hi>in like manner under the fir≈øt loan, when no body ≈øub≈øcribed the New-Loan certificates, becau≈øe it was not their intere≈øt ≈øo to do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I conclude that the fir≈øt article contains no criminal charge, and if it did, yet that it is not ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a ≈øhadow of evidence.</p>
                        <p>But, Mr. Speaker, I have ≈øtrong grounds of defence again≈øt this article, ≈øtill to bring forward, and which would be abundantly ≈øufficient to en≈øure an acquittal, even if the fir≈øt charge were admitted to be ≈øufficient in point of law, and if it ≈øhould be further admitted, that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had in his <hi>official</hi> character, certified the New-Loan certificates to be ≈øub≈øcribable, when they <hi>were not ≈øo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The article under con≈øideration charges that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>recogni≈øed, certified</hi> and <hi>declared,</hi> &amp;c. corruptly, and illegally, <hi>"as he the ≈øaid</hi> John Nichol≈øon <hi>well knew."</hi> His accu≈øers knew this to be e≈ø≈øential, to the con≈øtituting of the offence, and it has been admitted that proof of it is equally e≈ø≈øential.</p>
                        <p>Guilt can only flow from the corruptions of the heart, not from the errors or mi≈øtaken opinions of the head. The former are e≈ø≈øential to guilt; the latter never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitute it where the intention is pure. It it incident to man to err, and therefore the law makes allowance for the frailty of human nature. The honorable accu≈øers may in <hi>≈øome things</hi> have mi≈øtaken the law, and this rule might perhaps be very applicable in their ca≈øe. The learned judges upon the bench frequently differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion‚ÄîThe mo≈øt upright and the mo≈øt enlightened of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of government may mi≈øtake the true con≈øtruction of confu≈øed, cla≈øhing, contradictory and ill penned laws, which in the bu≈øine≈øs of his office he may have occa≈øion to act upon‚ÄîIf however be acts hone≈øtly and uprightly ‚Äîif he acts according to what he really believes the law to be, he at mo≈øt commits an error not a crime<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Did Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> then really believe the New-Loan debt to be ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States? If he did, an acquittal mu≈øt be the con≈øequence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that opinion was <hi>right or wrong.</hi> We undertake
<pb n="620" facs="unknown:027132_0628_0FD353EB87147448"/>
to prove, not only that he was of this opinion at the time of his certifying, &amp;c. but that it was uniformly held and avowed by him from the commencement of the fir≈øt loan in September 1790, up to the clo≈øe of the ≈øub≈øcription to the ≈øecond loan in July 1792, and that it is not changed.</p>
                        <p>It has appeared in evidence, Sir, that on the 30th of April 1790 the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans wrote a letter to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> de≈øiring to be informed of the ≈øeveral kinds of State certificates then in circulation, as books were about to be opened for the receiving of ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the loan, and al≈øo de≈øiring to be furni≈øhed with ≈øuch checks as would enable him to do the bu≈øine≈øs with ≈øafety to the United States (≈øee page 271.) It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> made this application to Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon,</hi> as being the per≈øon mo≈øt capable of furni≈øhing the nece≈ø≈øary information, and not as a per≈øon, who in his official capacity, was to give directions to be followed by Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ≈øays, <hi>"Such checks as will enable me to do that bu≈øine≈øs with ≈øafety to the United States."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it has further appeared, that on the ≈øame day, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in an≈øwer, "Until I can give you a complete check, have enclo≈øed herewith a blank form of a depreciation certificate, and one of funded debt, the only two kinds receivable by you, under the funding law of the United States granted by this State, <hi>as it is not pre≈øumable the New-Loans will be offered, ≈øubjected to the re≈øtrictions in that law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed"</hi>‚ÄîYou will be able to check tho≈øe left with you more particularly hereafter."</p>
                        <p>This letter fully proves, that he had no idea of the right of checking or determining on the a≈ø≈øumability of the certificates him≈øelf, ≈øince he ≈øpeaks in unequivocal terms, of that being done hereafter by others, and it al≈øo proves the opinion of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> at that early period to have been, that the New-Loan debts were ≈øo far <hi>from being aboli≈øhed by the Act of</hi> 1789, <hi>as that they were ≈øub≈øcribable to the fir≈øt loan of the United States;</hi>
                           <pb n="621" facs="unknown:027132_0629_0FD353B2874B5328"/>
which differs not in this particular from the ≈øecond one ‚ÄîIt was not at that time the intere≈øt of the holders of New-Loan certificates to ≈øub≈øcribe them, ≈øince <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> had not pa≈ø≈øed, nor was it known that ≈øhe would pa≈øs the law for making up the lo≈øs on the three per cent. and deferred ≈øtock. Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> a≈ø≈øigned this as his rea≈øon for not ≈øending to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the blank form of a New-Loan certificate, and he al≈øo a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned this as a rea≈øon for its "not being pre≈øumable that the New-Loans would be offered, ≈øubjected to the re≈øtrictions in the Act of Congre≈øs pre≈øcribed."‚ÄîThis ≈øhews his opinion of the exi≈øtence of the New-Loan debt notwith≈øtanding the Act of 1789; it ≈øhews his opinion that, the New-Loan debt, though at that time <hi>unfunded,</hi> to be of greater value than an equal ≈øum in ≈øix per cent. three per cent. and deferred ≈øtock would be; and from his thinking it <hi>not pre≈øumable that the New-Loans would be offered, ≈øubjected to the re≈øtrictions pre≈øcribed;</hi> and it is evident, that he believed other people judged of the exi≈øtence of the New-Loan debt, and of its being ≈øub≈øcribable, as he him≈øelf did:‚ÄîIf the≈øe were his ≈øentiments, as they unque≈øtionably were, he cannot, whether they were right or wrong, have committed any offence, by acting conformably to them.</p>
                        <p>But, ≈øay the gentlemen, "This was mere pretence, a copy of his countenance only, and intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive." But why mere pretence; why a copy of his countenance? Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> offered none of the New-Loans for ≈øub≈øcription under the fir≈øt loan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conduct accorded with his language expre≈ø≈øed in his letter, and this ≈øurely ≈øhews that he expre≈ø≈øed his real ≈øentiments‚ÄîNor could he po≈ø≈øibly have any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for deception‚ÄîHe could not po≈ø≈øibly know in September 1790 that <hi>another</hi> Legi≈ølature would in the year 1791 make up the lo≈øs on the three per cent. and deferred ≈øtock; nor that the loan of the United States would be extended or again opened in the year 1791; ‚Äînor that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> would in the year 1792 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the redemption at her Trea≈øury of the New-Loan

debt, which ≈øhould at a future period be ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and transferred‚ÄîAnd yet without his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing the power of looking into futurity, and having a pre-≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all the≈øe things, there is no room for talking of a mere pretence in the year 1790, or ≈øuppo≈øing that he had any intention to deceive!</p>
                        <p>The gentlemen finding the opinion of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> at a time when he could have no inducement for di≈øgui≈øing his real ≈øentiments to be, that the New-Loan debt was not aboli≈øhed by the Act of 1789, and that it was ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States.‚Äî Exclaim what have we to do with his private opinions! If this exclamation has not received a ≈øufficient an≈øwer already, it is certainly afforded by the fir≈øt article, which charges, that the New-Loan debt was aboli≈øhed and that it was not ≈øub≈øcribable as he <hi>the ≈øaid John Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hol≈øon well knew;</hi> and yet when we prove that he was ≈øo far from knowing or believing this to be the ca≈øe, that he was really of a contrary opinion they exclaim;‚Äî what have we to do with his opinions! If this an≈øwer will not ≈øatisfy the managers and the learned coun≈øel, they them≈øelves have afforded, one, which they cannot, without the mo≈øt palpable incon≈øi≈øtency now controvert. It mu≈øt be fre≈øh in the recollection of the honourable Senate, that it has been fully admitted, that if Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> has acted <hi>conformably to his opinion of the law, he cannot be guilty, even though that opinion may be wrong;</hi>‚Äîand yet, when we prove what his opinion really was and that he has acted in conformity with it, the ≈øame gentlemen exclaim;‚Äîwhat have be to do with his opinions!</p>

≈øtate,</hi> as well the <hi>unfunded</hi> as the funded ones; as well tho≈øe which were <hi>redeemable</hi> by the then laws, as tho≈øe which had been excluded from redemption, and of cour≈øe would not be redeemable, until they ≈øhould be made ≈øo. He ≈øhews what funds were then provided, and what further ones would be nece≈ø≈øary to defray the expences of government and di≈øcharge ≈øuch debts as were <hi>then</hi> redeemable at the Trea≈øury‚ÄîIn doing this, he makes a deduction of the old unfunded depreciation certificates, becau≈øe they were not then <hi>redeemable,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have ≈øince been made ≈øo, and al≈øo, of the remainder of the New-Loan debt, becau≈øe that al≈øo was not <hi>redeemable.</hi> He of cour≈øe did not propo≈øe providing funds for the payment of either of them; and it would have appeared ≈øtrange indeed if he had, ≈øince neither of them was at that time payable at all. To di≈øtingui≈øh them however and to point out ≈øuch as were then redeemable, and as it would require funds to be provided by the Legi≈ølature, he mentioned the ≈øituation of the old depreciation certificates, and he then mentioned the amount of the New-Loan debt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on hand, and <hi>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789;"</hi> and the≈øe words we are told contain <hi>his ≈øentence of condemnation.</hi> If they do, it is expre≈ø≈øed in language which looks more like a decree of acquittal. The New-Loan debt had by the Act of 1786 been made <hi>redeemable</hi> at the Trea≈øury and at the Land-office. By the Act of 1789 it was no <hi>longer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable at either of the≈øe offices, or at any other office, and of cour≈øe was in the Comptroller-General's own words, <hi>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789."</hi> This being the ca≈øe, no provi≈øion was then nece≈ø≈øary for the payment of that, which was not then payable at all, and the defendant, therefore, with great propriety brought into one view, all the debts of the State, but at the ≈øame time, with equal propriety di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed between their various ≈øituations.</p>
                        <p>His conduct upon this occa≈øion therefore, in≈øtead of affording his condemnation, affords the mo≈øt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

grounds for his acquittal, ≈øince the <hi>bringing of the New-Loan debt into his report and ranking it among the debts of the State,</hi> clearly ≈øhews, that he con≈øidered it as a ≈øtill exi≈øting debt. If he did not; why would he have brought it into view at all, and been ≈øo particular as he was, in ≈øhewing by calculations the amount of it, which ≈øtill remained on hand? Why ≈øhould he, an any other principles than tho≈øe which I have ≈øtated, have taken any more notice of it, than of any of the former debts of the State which had been aboli≈øhed or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged? Or if he con≈øidered this debt as aboli≈øhed, why did he not ≈øay <hi>aboli≈øhed,</hi> by the Act of 1789, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtead of EXCLUDED FROM REDEMPTION by it?</p>
                        <p>The next piece of evidence to which I ≈øhall advert is, the letter of the 6th of June 1791 (page 272) from the Secretary of the Trea≈øury to the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, in which, he ≈øays, <hi>"In con≈øequence of an enquiry made of me,</hi> I think nece≈ø≈øary to inform you, that I con≈øider the <hi>holders of certificates, received from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any State, in lieu of certificates of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral debt, as having a right to ≈øub≈øcribe tho≈øe certificates to the loan of the a≈ø≈øumed debt,</hi> and I con≈øider the State, as having a right to ≈øub≈øcribe the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which, they have obtained by the exchange, to the loan propo≈øed by the Act of the 4th of Augu≈øt, 1790; but no intere≈øt is to be paid on the a≈ø≈øumed debt of the State, either to the State, or <hi>to individuals,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you ≈øhall be informed that I am ≈øatisfied, that all the certificates ≈øo i≈ø≈øued by the State, have been <hi>re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed</hi> or redeemed, or that all tho≈øe, which which ≈øhall not be <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or <hi>redeemed, have been ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the U.

L. certificates,</hi> from all others, I have determined to have a hole, of about one fifth of an inch, cut through a part, near the centre." He then directs, that when the ≈øtock <hi>repre≈øented in the≈øe certificates, ≈øhould be transferred from and to the Loan-office or the Trea≈øury,</hi> the transfer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates ≈øhould have this central hole, cut or punched
<pb n="625" facs="unknown:027132_0633_0FD35420F7DCA4D8"/>
through them in like manner." And he concludes with ≈øaying, that "in order to full information on this ≈øubject, I reque≈øt you to tran≈ømit to me a copy, or ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient extracts from any laws pa≈ø≈øed by the Legi≈ølature of the ≈øtate in which you re≈øide, relative to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of Federal certificates, for tho≈øe of the ≈øtate, and to <hi>the re-exchange of tho≈øe of the ≈øtate for federal certificates;</hi> in doing which, you will be careful to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whatever there may be."</p>
                        <p>The words in the beginning of this letter, <hi>"In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of an enquiry made of me,"</hi> ≈øufficiently ≈øhews, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had applied to the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury for information, re≈øpecting the ≈øub≈øcribability of the New-Loan debt, and it can hardly be pre≈øumed, that ≈øo indu≈øtrious and well informed an officer, as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary is, in all things relating to the duties of his office, was not at this time in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Act of March 1789. That he was in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, is more than probable, from what he ≈øays in this letter re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of certificates‚ÄîAn <hi>exchange</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates took place under the law of March 1786, but there could be no <hi>re-exchange</hi> of them, but under the Act of March 1789. The Secretary could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have known, nor would he have talked of the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of certificates, had he not known of a law for that purpo≈øe; but he did ≈øpeak of a <hi>re-exchange,</hi> and therefore he mu≈øt have known of the law of 1789‚Äî But he went further, Sir, and ventured to act upon that law, for he tells the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans that <hi>no intere≈øt was to be</hi> paid on the New-Loan certificates until he ≈øhould be ≈øatisfied, that all of them had been <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or redeemed, or that all ≈øuch as were not <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or redeemed, had been ≈øurrendered to the United States." and as they could only be ≈øurrendered to the United States, by being ≈øub≈øcribed, the≈øe la≈øt words ≈øhew, <hi>as clearly as he had before expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in the ≈øome letter, that</hi> HE THOUGHT THEM SUBSCRIBABLE.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, in the latter part of this letter, he calls upon the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, to tran≈ømit to him,
<pb n="626" facs="unknown:027132_0634_0FD353D1FA673F88"/>
a copy, or ≈øufficient extracts, from all the laws of the State relative to the <hi>exchange</hi> of Federal certificates for tho≈øe of the State, and to the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of tho≈øe of the State, for Federal ones. This call would hardly have been made, had he not known that there was a law for <hi>re-exchange;</hi> which law he was probably po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed of, but as there might po≈ø≈øibly be further laws on the ≈øame ≈øubject, containing alterations or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he very prudently called for copies or extracts of <hi>all laws relative thereto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If however it ≈øhould be thought, that there is not ≈øufficient proof of his knowing at this time, of the law of 1789, it mu≈øt I think be admitted, that before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his next letter, he had received it from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner of Loans‚ÄîWe find him by the la≈øt letter, calling upon that officer, for all laws on the ≈øubject;‚Äî <hi>in order to full information thereon.</hi> The great accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy and unwearied attention of that officer, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever related to the duties of his office, are ≈øo well known, as to forbid the idea, of his not having ≈øhewn the mo≈øt prompt compliance with this call from the head of the department.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th of the ≈øame month, the Secretary again wrote to the Commi≈ø≈øioner as follows;‚Äî(page 274) "I do not con≈øider you as ju≈øtifiable, in refu≈øing the certificates of the State of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> which are in all other re≈øpects a≈ø≈øumable, becau≈øe they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the State, in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper, to u≈øe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to per≈øuade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they per≈øi≈øt to offer, refu≈øe to receive them." In addition to the rea≈øons already given for believing, that the Commi≈ø≈øioner as early as po≈ø≈øible furni≈øhed the laws which had been called for, permit me to remark, that after Secretary <hi>Hamilton,</hi> had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for all the laws, &amp;c. "in order to full information on the ≈øubject," the ≈øuppo≈øition, that he decided in the very po≈øitive manner, which appears from this letter, without having received the law, and all the nece≈ø≈øary
<pb n="627" facs="unknown:027132_0635_0FD353A1F333FC88"/>
information for forming a deci≈øion, is too improbable, to be admi≈ø≈øible. That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had written or ≈øent to Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> in an≈øwer to the fir≈øt of the≈øe letters, before the ≈øecond was written, appears from a clau≈øe in the letter, approving of Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> propo≈øal, of ≈øtamping the certificates, in≈øtead of <hi>punching a hole near the centre,</hi> as Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> had propo≈øed. If ≈øo, can it be imagined, that the laws which had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, did not accompany the me≈ø≈øage? or that, as the opinion now given, does not vary from the former one, it was not given on the ≈øame law?</p>
                        <p>But we are told that "The≈øe letters were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the defendant, and as it is not in proof that he knew of them, they furni≈øh him with no apology." By the death of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> we are deprived of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or this objection would not have been made.‚Äî It may neverthele≈øs be an≈øwered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. That the habits of intimacy, which prevailed between the Comptroller-General of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans of the United States, as well as their daily intercour≈øe in bu≈øine≈øs, between <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> and the U.

                        <p>The Secretary of the T. it is true, tells us, that he cannot now ≈øay, whether at the time of writing the≈øe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he did or did not know of the Act of 1789; but as he al≈øo tells us, that he has not an accurate recollection of what pa≈ø≈øed in the early ≈øtages of the bu≈øine≈øs, his want of recollection does not weaken the force of the ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intended to ≈øhew, that he mu≈øt have then known of that Act.

the≈øe letters, without knowing that they had been written, without a knowledge of that law, the ca≈øe is not altered.</p>
                        <p>I believe, Sir, that I omitted to an≈øwer in its proper place, an objection which has been made; "That if in June 1791, the Secretary of the Trea≈øury did know of the Act of 1789, yet that the que≈øtion did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent it≈øelf to him, in "a prominent point of view."‚Äî This I can readily believe, ≈øince I can hardly conceive, that he ≈øaw much difficulty ari≈øing from it; or if he did, how could the defendant, or any body el≈øe know, of the degree of <hi>prominency,</hi> in which the que≈øtion had pre≈øented it≈øelf to the Secretary, but from his letters, in which he expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf with great clearne≈øs and deci≈øion?</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øeriou≈øly contended, Sir, "That the defendant, in <hi>violation of his duty,</hi> and in <hi>violation of his oath,</hi> neglected to inform Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of the Act of March 1789."</p>

                        <p>It is further objected "That if the Secretary of the Trea≈øury was once of the opinion, that the New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States, yet that he afterwards altered his mind."‚ÄîI ≈øhall in the ≈øequel have occa≈øion to examine into the truth of this objection, and I will therefore only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve at pre≈øent, that were this the ca≈øe, it militates, naught again≈øt the defendant, who could not po≈ø≈øibly know, that ≈øuch a change would ever take place.</p>
                        <p>By an≈øwering the≈øe objections, I have in ≈øome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure been diverted from my regular chain of ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intended to ≈øhew, that the defendant really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and that many others, mo≈øt likely to know, al≈øo believed, the New-Loan certificates to be ≈øub≈øcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the loan of the United States; and of cour≈øe, that no criminality is fairly imputable to him, even if that opinion were wrong. This chain of argument ≈øhall now be re≈øumed and in tracing it I hope to prove, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> opinion was as already mentioned, upon all occa≈øions candidly, openly and uniformly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed; that it was recogni≈øed by others, who≈øe acquie≈øc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or explicit approbation confirmed him in it, and that if there has been any omi≈ø≈øion, in not giving the nece≈ø≈øary information to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, it is not imputable to the defendant, but to a man much higher in office.</p>
                        <p>It is in evidence; that on the 27th of June, 1791, the Secretary of the Trea≈øury wrote to the Governor, (page 275-6) that "The United States had directed, that the payment of intere≈øt ≈øhould be ≈øu≈øpended, in re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the debt of any ≈øtate, which might have i≈ø≈øued its own certificates for tho≈øe of the United States, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it ≈øhould appear to the ≈øatisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury that certificates i≈ø≈øued for that purpo≈øe by ≈øuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and reque≈øting his attention to the ≈øubject;" concluding by ≈øaying, that "It would give certainty to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Trea≈øury, and might prevent delays inconvenient to the public creditors, if the Governor would direct the proper officers, to cau≈øe the ≈øtate of the fact as it regarded <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> to be made appear to the Secretary."‚ÄîThis is the fir≈øt call that appears to have been made by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any officer of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> for information re≈øpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øtate of her New-Loan certificates, and if the Governor believed, that ≈øuch of them as had not been <hi>re-exchanged</hi> were aboli≈øhed by the Act of 1789, he had nothing to do, but <hi>at once to ≈øay ≈øo,</hi> to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, unle≈øs by his high office, he was exempt from an obligation, to be acquainted with tho≈øe laws which he was ≈øwore to execute.

Did the Governor at all contradict this idea, ≈øo clearly expre≈ø≈øed by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury? certainly not; but rather gave countenance to it, as appears by a letter written on the 1≈øt of July, in the ≈øame year, by Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> to the defendant (page 276)‚Äî"It is written," ≈øays Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> "In obedience to in≈øtructions from the Governor,"‚Äîa "Copy of the letter from the Secretary of the Trea≈øury was tran≈ømit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it," and it reque≈øted, that the defendant would "with all convenient ≈øpeed, make a report upon the ≈øubject to the Governor, accompanied with ≈øuch ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he ≈øhould deem nece≈ø≈øary, to ≈øatisfy the enquiry of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, and the object of the law to which he referred."</p>

On the contrary, as the Secretary's letter admitted the New-Loan debt to be ≈øub≈øcribable, and as that written by Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> in obedience to the Governor's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ≈øo far from contradicting this idea, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire a report, as to what part of the New-Loan debt had not <hi>been re-exchanged,</hi> and might therefore be ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the United States, it was ≈øurely confirmatory of the defendant's opinion. What did the defendant do in con≈øequence of the≈øe two letters? why he on the next day reported to the Governor, that he had "Through the Secretary of the commonwealth, received a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, on the ≈øubject of certificates of ≈øtate debt, i≈ø≈øued in lieu of Continental ones, and relative to the a≈ø≈øumption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;" and the report then proceeds as follows, "As the regulations and provi≈øions of this ≈øtate, enable <hi>≈øuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> to re-po≈ø≈øe≈øs them≈øelves of continental certificates, received for them by the United States, I apprehend, the <hi>ca≈øe of ≈øuch certificates of</hi> Penn≈øylvania <hi>are fully provided for.</hi> However, if the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury wi≈øhes to be informed of the quantity i≈ø≈øued by <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> and now out, of this kind, and your excellency <hi>≈øhould chu≈øe to lay the ≈øame before him,</hi> I beg leave to repre≈øent, that the whole quantity ≈øo i≈ø≈øued was 5,167,695 33/99 dollars, of which 316,864 30/90 were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ≈øtate, and upwards of two thirds of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder have been returned in exchange for the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates, and that the <hi>re≈øiduary ≈øum is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing daily by further applications and exchanges."</hi> Here we find the defendant in his report made in his <hi>official capacity</hi> to the Governor, declaring in the mo≈øt explicit terms, as he had before done, that the New-Loan debt ≈øtill exi≈øted, as a debt of the commonwealth.

                        <p>What is it natural to ≈øuppo≈øe, the conduct, of the Governor on receiving this report would have been, if he was not clearly ≈øatisfied that the defendant's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was right?

(Page 277.) Why do this, if he thought <hi>that</hi> balance no longer a debt? Or why keep back the re≈øt of the report, if he thought it at all que≈øtionable, whether <hi>that</hi> balance was a debt or not?

<pb n="639" facs="unknown:027132_0647_0FD35422363B29D8"/>
the exi≈øtence of the debt. That he really did think ≈øo, appears from his "giving in≈øtructions to the defendant on the 27th of the ≈øame month (page 277) to confer with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, in hopes that the difficulty ≈øugge≈øted might be removed, without claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interpo≈øition of the Legi≈ølature." The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ≈øugge≈øted aro≈øe from the danger of intere≈øt being twice payable by the U.

The Governor knew, that if the <hi>New-Loan debt did not exi≈øt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ≈øugge≈øted could not exi≈øt,</hi> and therefore, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructing the defendant to confer with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, in hopes that <hi>that</hi> difficulty might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, he certainly expre≈ø≈øed the ≈øame opinion, to the defendant, which the defendant had expre≈ø≈øed to him.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with tho≈øe in≈øtructions from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the defendant, on the 29th of the ≈øame month, wrote to the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, propo≈øing a conference with him on the ≈øubject contained in his letter to the Governor. A conference took place, and the defendant in a letter to the Governor of February 29th, 1792, after informing him that all ob≈øtacles were removed, expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf as follows;‚Äî(page 223) "The ≈øubject was an important one, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Continental certificates from <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> while the New-Loans for which they were given, <hi>were out,</hi> and the State <hi>re≈øpon≈øible for,</hi> without the≈øe means of redemption, would have placed her in an unplea≈øant ≈øituation.

                        </p>
                        <p>Here then, Sir, we have the fulle≈øt evidence, of an opinion, uniformly held and openly avowed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, on all occa≈øions, in his public and private capacity, from the commencement of the bu≈øine≈øs, up to the period at which I have arrived; and at times too, when it was impo≈ø≈øible for him to be intere≈øted either way, or to have the lea≈øt inducement to expre≈øs ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were not his own. We find this opinion, not only acquie≈øced in by the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, but we find him during all this period, countenanced and confirmed in it by repeated acts, both of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<pb n="641" facs="unknown:027132_0649_0FD3544C731EAF68"/>
of the Trea≈øury and the Governor of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                        <p>I will now go further and ≈øhew, that he not only continued to be of the ≈øame opinion, but that he was candid, open, and even <hi>a≈ø≈øiduous</hi> in making it known to the Governor, and to the members of both branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Legi≈ølature, while the law of April 1792, for the redemption of the ≈øtate debts was under con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. In doing this, I ≈øhall al≈øo ≈øhew, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

If I do this, I may add, that it is almo≈øt a crime, to impute criminality to him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>"The New-Loan certificates and arrearages of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt, about, ≈øay</hi> ¬£. 20,000</p>
                        <p>It is propo≈øed that the≈øe certificates ≈øhould be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the arrears of their intere≈øt, on the ≈øame terms on the other preceding debts of the ≈øtate.

But it would ≈øeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that after due notice, ≈øo as not to extend to the period of the next loan by Congre≈øs, a limitation ≈øhould by law be put to ≈øuch power of exchanging, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, the Continental certificates ≈øhould be ≈øub≈øcribed for the u≈øe of the ≈øtate, and that the ≈øtate, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

for the redemption of ≈øuch as might remain un-exchanged, un≈øub≈øcribed to the loan herein propo≈øed, or <hi>un≈øub≈øcribed to the a≈ø≈øumption of the ≈øtate debts,</hi> ≈øhould declare, that intere≈øt ≈øhould thenceforth cea≈øe thereon, unle≈øs payment were demanded. No ≈øum is extended in this ca≈øe, as the Continental certificates will be in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the ≈øtate, to be appropriated to this debt, as far the ≈øame may be ≈øub≈øcribed as herein propo≈øed."‚ÄîThat this propo≈øed plan of finance was laid before the Governor, appears by a letter to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant from Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> of the 21≈øt of March 1792, (page 286) in which, after mentioning the plan, he ≈øays; "The Governor has con≈øidered the ≈øubject, and will probably determine to-morrow, how far it would be proper, to tran≈ømit the plan to the Legi≈ølature." At this time another plan of finance was before the Hou≈øe, it was ≈øo far advanced, and ≈øo nearly matured, and the end of the ≈øe≈ø≈øion was ≈øo near at hand, as to account for no interference, for we do not find that any took place, on the part of the Governor; but however this may be, it certainly appears, that at this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant cri≈øis, the defendant <hi>again avowed</hi> the opinion which he had uniformly held, and the propriety of which the Governor did not upon this, any more than upon any former occa≈øion, think proper to controvert.‚ÄîMr. <hi>Dallas</hi> indeed tells us, that he never had an idea, or heard an idea, for I do not recollect which was his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, of the New-Loan debt being ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States, until June 1792, when he learned that it had been ≈øub≈øcribed by the defendant. This may be true for ought that I know, and yet if he had any ideas at all I can hardly conceive it po≈ø≈øible, ≈øince it has appeared, that he was privy to the corre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence between the defendant, the Governor and the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, in which this opinion was clearly expre≈ø≈øed and openly avowed without the lea≈øt contradiction. He wrote and he tran≈ømitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant the Governor's directions on that ≈øubject; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the letters of Secretary <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and I
<pb n="643" facs="unknown:027132_0651_0FD354271EDE67A0"/>
≈øuppo≈øe him to have had the copying, and recording of all the corre≈øpondence on that occa≈øion‚ÄîIf other proof be nece≈ø≈øary, it is amply afforded by his letter to the defendant of the 21≈øt March 1792 (page 286) in which he ≈øays, "I find from con≈øulting <hi>Mr. Gallatin,</hi> and ≈øeveral other gentlemen, that your plan would not at this time, meet with any chance of ≈øucce≈øs, <hi>though its principles appear to me to be good."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> in who≈øe hands this plan of finance was, never read it, how could "its principles appear to him to be good!" If he did read it, how is it po≈ø≈øible, that until he heard of the New-Loan debt being ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by the defendant in June 1792, he never had an idea, or heard of an idea of its being ≈øub≈øcribable! This is not however worth dwelling upon, and I ≈øhall therefore proceed to what is much more material.‚ÄîIt is in evidence Sir, that copies of this plan of finance were, at about the ≈øame time communicated to ≈øeveral active and intelligent members of each branch of the Legi≈ølature. The evidence has been heard, and I will not wa≈øte time in an u≈øele≈øs enumeration of a long ≈øtring of names, but I mu≈øt remark, that not <hi>one,</hi> of them, ever ≈øignified the ≈ømalle≈øt <hi>di≈øapprobation of that part of it, which propo≈øed a provi≈øion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt.</hi> Hence the conclu≈øion was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable on the part of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> that <hi>they too,</hi> as well as the Governor, had no doubt of the exi≈øtence of the New-Loan debt, and of the obligation of the ≈øtate to redeem it.</p>
                        <p>I am now arrived Sir, at a mo≈øt important ≈øtage of the bu≈øine≈øs;‚ÄîAt the time when the bill for, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption law, as it is called, was pending before the Hou≈øe, and we find at this time the defendant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to each branch of the Legi≈ølature as he had upon all former occa≈øions done, the exi≈øtence of the New-Loan debt, that it ought to be redeemed, and ≈øo far are we from finding any di≈øapprobation of this ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from any one of them, that we find it <hi>acquie≈øced in by all, and condemned by none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="644" facs="unknown:027132_0652_0FD353BE8553B560"/>Their evidence is before you, Sir, and without ≈øpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time in repeating it, permit me to remind the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Senate, that, it is as full as evidence can po≈ø≈øibly be, not only to ≈øhew the real opinion of the defendant, but the pains taken by him to make that opinion fully known, and that wherever it was known it was approved of, ≈øince we do not find it contradicted by any one of tho≈øe, who≈øe peculiar province it was to do ≈øo, if its propriety was at all que≈øtioned.‚ÄîNay the honorable Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the Senate tells us, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> in a conver≈øation with him, objected to the plan of finance then before the Hou≈øe, becau≈øe it would injure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by opening a door for ≈øpeculation at her expence, and we find him at the ≈øame time offering another which was ≈øo plain; ≈øo ≈øimple and ≈øo ea≈øy to be under≈øtood, as to preclude every thing of this kind.‚Äî Was this al≈øo cant and hypocri≈øy too? was it al≈øo a mere copy of his countenance, and intended to deceive, when it is well known, that the law for extending the loan, did not pa≈øs until the 8th of May following! And yet Sir, the defendant is again charged with ≈øecrecy and covert views! But upon what grounds is he ≈øo charged? why ≈øay the gentlemen; we do not know what deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns of ≈øpeculation, at the expence of the public, were concealed under this plan of finance!" And if after ≈øo may months of laborious indu≈øtry, they have not been able to find them out, will they ≈øeriou≈øly ≈øay, that the honorable Senate are to pre≈øume them, and on pre≈øumption only, without either a charge, or evidence, to condemn the defendant! Forbid it virtue! forbid it ju≈øtice! forbid it patrioti≈øm! or to include them all, forbid it law!</p>
                        <p>But ≈øay Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> accu≈øers; "he never thought of the New-Loan debt being ≈øub≈øcribable, until after the pa≈ø≈øing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792."</p>
                        <p>Need I after all which has been ≈øhewn, an≈øwer this objection? Certainly not; unle≈øs it be to ob≈øerve, that of it≈øelf, <hi>if true,</hi> it does away all his former <hi>imputed</hi> ≈øins
<pb n="645" facs="unknown:027132_0653_0FD353B1347F1A28"/>
and iniquities, ≈øince in that ca≈øe every thing which had been imputed to him before, mu≈øt be groundle≈øs.</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir, we are told, "That while the bill for the redemption law of April 1792 was depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legi≈ølature, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øatisfied him≈øelf with mentioning <hi>little, trifling objections,</hi> but that he never told any body that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it."‚ÄîTo this I could, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, give many an≈øwers; but I ≈øhall ≈øatisfy my≈øelf with ob≈øerving,</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. That had he made no objections whatever, he would not have been liable to impeachment on that account, any more than tho≈øe who ≈øtate this objection are, and that if this is a criminal omi≈ø≈øion, <hi>they</hi> are no le≈øs liable to puni≈øhment for it, than he is, ≈øince they were under no le≈øs obligation than he was.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. That at the time of the objections, which are now called trifling, being made by the defendant, a report of a committee (≈øee Journals of Congre≈øs of the 2d April 1792) was under con≈øideration, which if it had been adopted by Congre≈øs, would have rendered the old unfunded bills of credit ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States. When the bill for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion law was before the Hou≈øe, the defendant very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly objected, that ≈øhould that report be adopted in its full extent, and ≈øhould the bill then pa≈øs in its then form, the≈øe bills would be redeemable at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> However trifling this objection may now be thought, it was con≈øidered as of ≈øo much weight at that time, that this part of the report was rejected, and if it had not, the law of April 1792 was ≈øo framed as in its then form to admit of their redemption. And,</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. That if the defendant did not ≈øtate as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the propo≈øed law of April 1792, that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it, it was becau≈øe he then did, and always had believed in the exi≈øtence of that debt; becau≈øe his own plan of finance propo≈øed its redemption;‚Äîbecau≈øe he had every rea≈øon for believing that the Governor and each branch of the
<pb n="646" facs="unknown:027132_0654_0FD35393604ACCC8"/>
Legi≈ølature thought as he did in this re≈øpect; and that therefore, it would have been madne≈øs in the extreme for him, to object to what he him≈øelf propo≈øed in his own plan of finance, and which he not only highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, but had every rea≈øon for ≈øuppo≈øing to be equally approved of by others.</p>
                        <p>I will not, Sir, attempt any further an≈øwer to this objection, le≈øt in combating ≈øuch ground, I may be led into an intemperate warmth.</p>
                        <p>It is ≈øaid, Sir, that "The Governor could not have been of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> or that it exi≈øted at all, ≈øince in none of his addre≈ø≈øes to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈ølature, one or more of which have been read, has he mentioned this debt to be provided for, although he has particularly enumerated all that were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for." This argument, though much relied on, will be found to be altogether fallacious. The New-Loan debt was not redeemable at all, until the pa≈ø≈øing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, nor then, unle≈øs the loan of the United States ≈øhould be again opened‚ÄîIt was not again opened until the 8th of May 1792, and of cour≈øe no provi≈øion for its redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could be required before that time. The addre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes which have been read, were all anterior to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod‚ÄîTheir object was to enumerate the amount of the <hi>debts which were redeemable,</hi> and of cour≈øe demandable at the Trea≈øury, and to call upon the Legi≈ølature, to <hi>furni≈øh the nece≈ø≈øary means;</hi> but as the New-Loan debt was not <hi>then redeemable nor demandable,</hi> at the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury, it would have been ≈øtrange indeed, if our <hi>vigilant</hi> Governor, had ≈øo far forgotten him≈øelf, as to call for <hi>means to be provided, for redeeming a debt,</hi> which <hi>at that time was not redeemable at all!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of a ≈øimilar nature is another objection which has been made; "That in no in≈øtance have the committee of ways and means propo≈øed any provi≈øion for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the New-Loan debt," from which it is inferred, that it had been aboli≈øhed, or if not aboli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="647" facs="unknown:027132_0655_0FD353D4F7452B80"/>
that it was not redeemable." To this the an≈øwer mu≈øt certainly be ≈øatisfactory, that the reports of this committee were, like the addre≈ø≈øes of the Governor, made <hi>before the New-Loan debt was redeemable,</hi> and of cour≈øe the propo≈øing of <hi>ways and means</hi> for its <hi>redemption</hi> would have been folly in the extreme‚ÄîIt is the bu≈øine≈øs of that committee, as appears from its very name, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe <hi>ways and means,</hi> for di≈øcharging ≈øuch debts as are <hi>redeemable,</hi> but it would be a great departure from its duty, to propo≈øe a law for any other purpo≈øe, unle≈øs under a particular reference from the Hou≈øe. It is the bu≈øine≈øs of that committee, to find out <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>ways for the redemption of funded debts,</hi> not <hi>unfunded ones!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Equally un≈øub≈øtantial is another objection, which has been made; namely, "That the defendant could not believe the New-Loan debt to be redeemable, becau≈øe his own ≈øtatement, made at, or ≈øoon after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, mentioned ≈øo ≈ømall a ≈øum, as a propo≈øed e≈øtimate, of what would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for the redemption of the public debts, as ≈øhews that it was not intended to provide for the di≈øcharge of the New-Loan debts." <hi>Nor was it;</hi> and this I freely admit, without allowing that there is any weight in the objection. The≈øe e≈øtimates bear date the 28th and 30th of April 1792 (page 224-5) and mention a "≈øum e≈øtimated to be nece≈ø≈øary for the redemption of the State <hi>debt, according to law."</hi> But the New-Loan debt was not redeemable until the 8th of May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Act of Congre≈øs for opening the ≈øecond loan was pa≈øt, and therefore, when the≈øe e≈øtimates were made, the New-Loan debt was not payable <hi>"accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law,"</hi> nor would it ever have been payable under the then exi≈øting laws, had that loan not again been opened. If this is not a complete an≈øwer to the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I hope the following one will be‚ÄîIt will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that the ≈øecond ≈øection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792 provided for the payment of certain debts therein enumerated, and we have admitted that the New-Loan debt was not one of them, although it
<pb n="648" facs="unknown:027132_0656_0FD353D81F411558"/>
was, as we ≈øay, within the provi≈øion of the ≈øixth ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eventually became payable under the 12th ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of the Act of April 1791. The 2d ≈øection of the Act of April 1792 provided funds for the debts enumerated in that ≈øection, and in order thereto, it enabled "The Comptroller-General and Regi≈øter-General, under the direction of the Governor, to fell ≈øo much of the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øtock as ≈øhould be nece≈ø≈øary to pay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the debt in that ≈øection mentioned." On the 13th of April 1792 (page 232) Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> by order of the Governor, wrote to the Comptroller-General and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter-General as follows‚Äî"The Legi≈ølature contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the payment of <hi>certain</hi> debts on <hi>the fir≈øt of July next,</hi> by the ≈øale of <hi>three</hi> per cent. <hi>≈øtock,</hi> at a certain rate, with a power however, to ≈øu≈øpend the ≈øale until the ≈øtipulated price can be obtained, you will be plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore, to take that Act into immediate con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and report what arrangements will be nece≈ø≈øary in your opinion, for carrying the redemption of the debt into effect."</p>
                        <p>The three <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øtock was not directed to be ≈øold for the payment of the New-Loan debt, nor was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion made for the payment of that debt <hi>on the fir≈øt of July next, nor at all,</hi> unle≈øs the loan ≈øhould be again opened; the Governor could only call for an e≈øtimate of what would be nece≈ø≈øary to di≈øcharge the debts, which were payable on the fir≈øt of July; the e≈øtimate furni≈øhed was confined to that object, and could not be extended to any other; the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øtock could not be ≈øold to ≈øatisfy any other object. When gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are driven to ≈øuch objections as this, their ≈øituation mu≈øt be de≈øperate indeed!</p>
                        <p>Oh! but ≈øay the gentlemen, "The defendant did not inform Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> as he ought to have done, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable under the Act of April 1792." If I admit for a moment, that there was ≈øomething ≈øo peculiar in the character of Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> as to entitle him to more information than
<pb n="649" facs="unknown:027132_0657_0FD3544DCF056DB0"/>

                        <p>We find Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi>'s letter to the defendant of the 21≈øt of March 1792, that he found on con≈øulting <hi>Mr. Gallatin,</hi> and ≈øome other gentlemen on the <hi>defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's plan,</hi> that it would not at that time meet with any chance of ≈øucce≈øs, "though its <hi>principles appeared to be good,"</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> was therefore informed of the defendant's opinion while the bill for the redemption law was pending, and if he thought it wrong, he ought to have ≈øaid ≈øo, and guarded again≈øt it.‚ÄîLet us now ≈øee what took place after the law was pa≈ø≈øed?‚ÄîIt was pa≈ø≈øed as we have ≈øeen on the 10th of April 1792 ‚Äîthe Hou≈øe probably ro≈øe on that or the next day, as no law was pa≈ø≈øed after that day, in the ≈øame ≈øe≈ø≈øion; and as Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells us, that he remained in town but about eight or ten days after the ri≈øing of the Hou≈øe, the conver≈øation which I am about to mention, mu≈øt have taken place within that time‚ÄîIt is related by Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon,</hi> who ≈øwears "That ≈øhortly after the Hou≈øe ro≈øe, Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> the defendant and him≈øelf, had conver≈øation together, in which <hi>they all agreed,</hi> that the Act of the 10th of April 1792, embraced the <hi>Unfunded Depreciation debt,</hi> and the defendant then ≈øaid, it would extend to the old bills of credit if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs ≈øhould a≈ø≈øume them, upon which Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ≈øaid the 6th ≈øection was more exten≈øive than he had intended. And Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells us, that on reading the 6th ≈øection he agreed with the defendant in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of it as to its including the Unfunded De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation debt‚ÄîIf this was ≈øo, it could not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øo to the ≈øecond ≈øection, ≈øince it is admitted on both ≈øides, that <hi>that</hi> ≈øection does not include that debt; of cour≈øe we have here the opinion of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> in our favour, be it of the importance or not, which upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occa≈øion has been contended for. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> does not at pre≈øent recollect any thing having been ≈øaid about the old bills of credit being redeemable, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs ≈øhould a≈ø≈øume them, but Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon,</hi> who
<pb n="650" facs="unknown:027132_0658_0FD353A376DF8FC8"/>
≈øpeaks affirmatively, ≈øwears that the defendant did ≈øay, that they would be within the ≈øixth ≈øection if Congre≈øs ≈øhould a≈ø≈øume them, and that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> then ≈øaid, the ≈øixth ≈øection was more exten≈øive than he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which certainly looks very much like a≈ø≈øenting to what the defendant had ≈øaid‚ÄîMr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> does not, it is true, remember, that the New-Loan debt was ≈øpoken of, and the defendant has been pretty ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely handled for not mentioning that al≈øo; but to this it may be an≈øwered, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> having heard of ≈øome objections to the Act, went to learn what they were, and to endeavour to obviate them‚ÄîThis being the ca≈øe, the defendant mentioned only ≈øuch things as he deemed exceptionable, and it would have been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful indeed, if he had mentioned as an objection to the Act, that it might <hi>eventually</hi> provide for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the New-Loan debt, when <hi>he him≈øelf</hi> had ju≈øt before propo≈øed a plan, which provided for its <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> redemption, and which he had every rea≈øon for believing, was approved of by the Governor and the members of both branches of the Legi≈ølature. To ≈øhew that he has been candid and uniform in every thing relative to this bu≈øine≈øs, it is but ju≈øtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that while the Act of April 1792 was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before the Legi≈ølature, he thought it his duty to give it every decent oppo≈øition, and that he did ≈øo, by mentioning his objections in the fulle≈øt manner to many members of each branch of the Legi≈ølature, and more e≈øpecially as it would in its then form, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutions then under the con≈øideration of Congre≈øs had been adopted in their full extent, have put the ≈øtate in the power of the United States, by making her liable to redeem whatever Congre≈øs might chu≈øe to a≈ø≈øume. To prevent this, his plan enumerated the ≈øpecific articles of redemption, and ≈øurely nothing could be better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated than this, to pre≈øerve the rights of the State, and to preclude all opportunity for ≈øpeculation‚ÄîTo the honorable Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> be objected "to the bill as it ≈øtood, (page 287) becau≈øe it would admit of con≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="651" facs="unknown:027132_0659_0FD353C0DA758770"/>
that would open a door for ≈øpeculation, and for ≈øpeculations injurious to the State." To the honorable Mr. <hi>Montgomery</hi> he mentioned nearly the ≈øame thing; (page 290) and if after this, the Legi≈ølature cho≈øe to leave the door open, every man had a right to enter at it, and none more ≈øo than he, who had advi≈øed that it ≈øhould be ≈øhut.</p>
                        <p>If the law left it open, the law gave a free pa≈ø≈øport of entrance to every man, and it is an affront to common ≈øen≈øe to ≈øuppo≈øe that for availing him≈øelf of it, any man can be puni≈øhable!</p>
                        <p>We are told, Sir, "That at all events the defendant was highly culpable for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certificates, becau≈øe Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> had told him that it was not <hi>his</hi> intention when the law of April 1792 pa≈ø≈øed, that they ≈øhould be redeemable." Be it ≈øo; but if it is, what is the con≈øequence? Was the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to con≈øtrue the law agreeably to what a <hi>≈øingle member</hi> of a <hi>≈øingle branch</hi> told him was <hi>his meaning</hi> at the time, or according to what appeared on a <hi>view of the law,</hi> to have been the <hi>meaning of all the members of both bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and of the Governor!</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> conduct, and where he happens to be right, I have no objection to quoting him, forms a ≈øufficient an≈øwer to this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion‚ÄîIt is in evidence, that he ≈øaid, he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the ≈øixth ≈øection of the Act of April 1792 ≈øhould be more exten≈øive than the ≈øecond ≈øection; but that on peru≈øing it, he found that it was, and that it included the Unfunded Depreciation certificates.‚ÄîHe al≈øo tells us, that finding this to be the ca≈øe, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the redemption of one for his friend <hi>Ephraim Dougla≈øs</hi>‚ÄîHe adds with much good ≈øen≈øe, that if he had known that agreeably to the true con≈øtruction of the law, the New-Loan debt was redeemable, he ≈øhould, let the intention of the Legi≈ølature be what it might, have done the be≈øt that he could for his friend‚ÄîAll this is pa≈øt over as perfectly innocent, ≈øo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

who is the author, and the fautor of this pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and yet, the defendant is held up as a great criminal, for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Depreciation certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, although that member, and the Regi≈øter-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal had agreed that it was right! although that member had procured a certificate of this kind in favour of his friend; and although it was <hi>fir≈øt done,</hi> in favour of the Speaker of the Senate at the time of pa≈ø≈øing the law, and afterwards in favour of able law judges!</p>
                        <p>But, ≈øay the gentlemen, "Let the defendant's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have been one way or the other, it was <hi>imprudent</hi> in him to ≈øub≈øcribe the New-Loan debt, without fir≈øt informing the Governor of his intentions." The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor may perhaps be a very proper per≈øon to con≈øult in a ca≈øe of prudence, but if he is ≈øo, and if, which I am far from admitting, prudence required that he ≈øhould have been con≈øulted; is a mere act of imprudence a ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for an impeachment? If it is, I am afraid that a thou≈øand articles would be maintainable again≈øt the be≈øt man among us, and that even ≈øome of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers might ≈øtand high on the li≈øt of criminals! If the accu≈øers are obliged to have recour≈øe to this ground, the defendant ≈øhould not have been impeached for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the laws of the State, but for tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing the rules of prudence!</p>
                        <p>But, ≈øay the pro≈øecutors, "Whatever may have been the defendant's opinion, the commonwealth has ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained much damage by the ≈øub≈øcription of the New-Loan debt, and that he is therefore re≈øpon≈øible." Even if this po≈øition were true, it could at mo≈øt but apply in a civil action and not in a criminal pro≈øecution, where the rule is, <hi>actus non ≈øit reus ni≈øi mens ≈øit rea.</hi> But I deny the truth of the a≈ø≈øertion altogether.

                     <p>In order ≈øtill further to ≈øhew, that the defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his con≈øtruction of the law to be right, and that he believed other gentlemen to be of the ≈øame opinion, permit me now to remind the honorable Senate, of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury. He ≈øwears that <hi>"all the difficulties on which he ≈øo often wrote to the Governor;</hi> on <hi>which the Governor ordered the conference,</hi> and on <hi>which the conference was held and conducted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aro≈øe on the ≈øuppo≈øition, of the New-Loan debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øub≈øcribable,</hi> and that they <hi>could not have exi≈øted, but on this point being acceded to."</hi> That in the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> appeared to be of this opinion, and the Governor afforded abundant rea≈øon to ≈øuppo≈øe that he was of the ≈øame opinion.</p>
                     <p>After hearing this evidence, no man can doubt of what the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury was; ‚Äîno man can doubt what the opinion of the Governor was, no man can doubt what the opinion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was, nor, but that he believed the≈øe gentlemen to be of the ≈øame opinion, ≈øince if they had not, as the Secretary tells you, the difficulties could not have ari≈øen, nor could the conference have been nece≈ø≈øary. The defendant mu≈øt have perceived this as clearly as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary did, and unle≈øs, which is not pre≈øumable, he ≈øuppo≈øed the Governor to be de≈øtitute of common ≈øen≈øe, or totally regardle≈øs of all ≈øen≈øe of duty, he could not imagine that he would <hi>have called for reports, talked of calling the Legi≈ølature, or directed a conference without being of the ≈øame opinion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, again, Sir, it appears, that Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> had applied to have a New-Loan certificate ≈øub≈øcribed and redeemed, and that the defendant from mere kindne≈øs undertook to get it done for him‚ÄîThat while that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was depending, Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> objected to the defendant, that it was not authori≈øed by law, and this was the fir≈øt time of ≈øuch an idea being ≈øugge≈øted by any one.

<pb n="655" facs="unknown:027132_0663_0FD35429E9CF9148"/>
thought ≈øo is, that as Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> was going out of town, the defendant, after <hi>this objection had been made,</hi> paid him the full amount of his certificate, as if it had been actually redeemed, and this too, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction for his trouble, or <hi>a≈øking for an indemnity.</hi> Can there be a ≈øtronger proof than this of con≈øcious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity? Or can it believed, that if he thought the matter at all doubtful, he would have voluntarily taken the ri≈øk upon him≈øelf? This ≈øurely ≈øhews, that he con≈øidered Mr. <hi>Dallas's pre≈øent</hi> opinion, ≈øo contrary to what it had <hi>formerly</hi> appeared to be, as not worthy of the lea≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, when oppo≈øed by a conviction in his own mind of the propriety of a contrary one, and that too, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by opinions entitled to much more re≈øpect.</p>
                     <p>I have already given an an≈øwer ≈øo much at length, to the objection "That the defendant did not, as he ought to have done, con≈øult the Regi≈øter-General or the Governor," that I ≈øhall only take notice of it at pre≈øent, for the ≈øake of drawing a well warranted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion in favour of the defendant. The active, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and di≈øcerning mind of the Regi≈øter-General is too well known to be que≈øtioned, and it is al≈øo well known, that circum≈øtances have occurred, which leave no room for the ≈øuppo≈øition, that he has much partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for the defendant; or if he had, it will not be in≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, that he would be ≈øwayed by it on the pre≈øent occa≈øion. He tells you, Sir, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, that the defendant did tell him and Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin,</hi> that the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, were redeemable under the Act of April 1792, and that on peru≈øing it they were both of them of that opinion ‚ÄîHe tells you, that from the certifications made to the Governor, and which pa≈ø≈øed through <hi>his</hi> office, in the ca≈øes of the old Unfunded Depreciation debt, it might, both from the amount of the intere≈øt, and the time of its commencement, be ea≈øily known, that the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations related to that debt, and could not po≈ø≈øibly relate to any other. Thus far then, there was no want of due communication, both to the Regi≈øter General and
<pb n="656" facs="unknown:027132_0664_0FD353FA8B4C8078"/>
to the Governor. It al≈øo appears, that the defendant had in his letters and reports repeatedly informed the Governor, that the New-Loan debt was ≈øub≈øcribable, and if it was ≈øub≈øcribable, no man can doubt of its being redeemable. Here then the objection again fails ‚ÄîBut in addition to all this, the Regi≈øter-General tells you, that <hi>after knowing of the objection made by Mr.</hi> Dallas, and after <hi>con≈øidering the law,</hi> he was of the ≈øame opinion with the defendant, and joined with him, in making ≈øeveral certificates to the Governor, in ca≈øes of the <hi>New-Loan debt,</hi> in order that warrants might i≈ø≈øue for its redemption at the Trea≈øury, and that as he had no doubt at all about the law, he did not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to ≈øpeak to the Governor on the ≈øubject‚ÄîHence it appears, that there is not the lea≈øt ground for any part of the objection‚ÄîOh! but ≈øay the gentlemen, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> defendant did not in his certifications to the Governor, in ca≈øes of the New-Loan debt, de≈øcribe it in ≈øuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it could be known, that the certifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to that debt." To this I an≈øwer, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications were exactly, as appears in evidence, agreeably to the form ≈øettled and e≈øtabli≈øhed by the different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as proper to be ob≈øerved under the Act of April 1792, and that they did not differ, from the form made u≈øe of on other occa≈øions; and further, that the Regi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-General u≈øed the ≈øame form in ca≈øes of the New-Loan debt which the defendant did.</p>
                     <p>But we are told that "That this bu≈øine≈øs <hi>originated</hi> with the defendant; that he tran≈øacted it <hi>privately,</hi> and that it was unfair in him, not to inform others of the ≈øame ≈øpeculation!" This objection puts me in mind of a ≈øtory, which I have heard related by my friend Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Wayne.</hi> Early in life, he was engaged in ≈øurveying lands in <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> On one Sunday morning, he ≈øaw a large flock of wild ducks in a pond near to his cabbin, and immediately took up his gun, in order to get a ≈øhot at them.‚ÄîAn Indian who ≈øaw the ducks, and wi≈øhed to have the <hi>≈øpeculation</hi> to him≈øelf, came running to the General, and a≈øked him, what he was going to
<pb n="657" facs="unknown:027132_0665_0FD35396009673A0"/>
do?‚ÄîUpon the General telling him, that he intended to have a ≈øhot at tho≈øe ducks, the Indian exclaimed with uplifted hands;‚Äî≈øhame! ≈øhame! for you white men, to ≈øhoot on the Sabbath;‚Äîwe poor ignorant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are not ≈øo bad as you, for we would not do ≈øo.‚Äî Struck with this ≈øeemingly ≈øerious admonition from a ≈øavage, the General almo≈øt concluded to return back and lay a≈øide his gun‚ÄîWhile the Indian was detaining him, and endeavouring to prevail upon him to do ≈øo, he heard the report of a gun, and ≈øaw ≈øeveral of the ducks knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over; upon which the Indian, leaping from the ground, and laughing very heartily, exclaimed again; ‚Äîyou white people think we ≈øavages are fools, but you are not ≈øo cunning as we are‚ÄîThat is my ≈øquaw, who has ≈øhot the ducks, and I came to keep you back, till ≈øhe ≈øhould get the fir≈øt ≈øhot!‚ÄîI believe, Sir, that this is pretty much the ca≈øe with mo≈øt people, who ≈øee an opportunity for a fair ≈øpeculation, and that but few are ≈øo ≈øilly, as to cry roa≈øt beef, until they them≈øelves are ≈øatisfied.‚Äî We find that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> objected to the bill, becau≈øe it would afford an opportunity for ≈øpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It did not enumerate all the articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>as his plan of finance did;</hi> ≈øeveral of the≈øe articles, might be unknown to the people at large, while they would be well known to ≈øome. This would give to a few, advantages for ≈øpeculation, which many would not have. This the defendant had endeavoured to prevent, but could not; and if the law left a door open for ≈øpeculating in the New-Loan debt, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ≈øhould at mo≈øt have been impeached for ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating <hi>according to law!</hi> not <hi>again≈øt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a further an≈øwer to this objection, we have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many other people knew the ≈øame thing, and ≈øpeculated in the ≈øame way, and that among them, were men of unblemi≈øhed character. Upon hearing this, the gentlemen immediately ≈øhift their ground and ≈øay, that "The bu≈øine≈øs originated with the defendant, <hi>and that be led others into it,</hi> to the great injury of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth."

If he <hi>did the bu≈øine≈øs privately, and did not inform others of it,</hi> how could <hi>he lead others into it?</hi> Or if he <hi>led others into it,</hi> how is it po≈ø≈øible, that he did <hi>not inform others of it?</hi>‚ÄîIn ≈øhort, the accu≈øers advance <hi>contrary</hi> po≈øitions, <hi>either</hi> of which if true, is a <hi>refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other,</hi> and yet they contend, that he is guilty on <hi>both</hi> grounds!</p>
                     <p>But it is not true, that the bu≈øine≈øs originated with him, or that he led others into it. Every man who thought of the matter, judged for him≈øelf, and acted accordingly‚ÄîBy the evidence of Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> it appears, that he found, upon reading the law, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable. By the evidence of Mr. <hi>Boggs</hi> it appears, that he di≈øcovered it in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Mr. <hi>Rittenhou≈øe</hi> and others al≈øo ≈øub≈øcribed the New-Loan debt and had it redeemed. They derived no information from the defendant, nor did he take a ≈øingle ≈øtep to conceal any thing from them‚ÄîSo far was he from intending to conceal any thing, that he did the whole of the bu≈øine≈øs <hi>in his own name,</hi> although he well knew, that at the end of the ≈øecond loan, a ≈øcrutiny would take place, as there had at the end of the fir≈øt, and that if he had acted wrong, he would be detected, and compelled to refund. If his views were improper, how ea≈øily might detection have been prevented, by making u≈øe of the names of others? Criminality has been imputed to him, but a deficiency of intellectual faculty has not, and yet without ≈øuch deficiency, it is impo≈ø≈øible to account for his not making u≈øe of a cloak for his views, if any he had, which would have afforded ample ≈øecurity, without co≈øting him any thing. The charge in one of the articles, <hi>that the defendant acted in the ≈øecret manner therein mentioned, in order to avoid di≈øcovery and detection, until he ≈øhould get the money into his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> mu≈øt excite our indignation;‚Äînot again≈øt the accu≈øed, but at the accu≈øation. To avoid detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>until he ≈øhould get the money into his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion!</hi> He knew that at the end of the ≈øecond loan a ≈øcrutiny
<pb n="659" facs="unknown:027132_0667_0FD353FC17CDC3E8"/>
would take place, as there did at the clo≈øe of the fir≈øt; he knew that on that ≈øcrutiny, all certificates which were not by law ≈øub≈øcribable would be rejected; he knew that if he was acting illegally, he would on that ≈øcrutiny be detected, and compelled to refund with di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace what he had wrongfully received. Let me a≈øk then, Sir, if it was po≈ø≈øible for any one of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's accu≈øers to believe, that the paltry con≈øideration of a temporary po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the money, could have prevented him, as the article charges, from con≈øulting the Regi≈øter-General or communicating to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>until he ≈øhould get the money into his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion?</hi> It is impo≈ø≈øible for them to have believed this, unle≈øs they al≈øo believed, that he intended to run away with the money, before the ≈øcrutiny ≈øhould take place, at the end of the loan! His ≈øituation and circum≈øtances in life ≈øufficiently prove, that a mere temporary po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the money could be no object with him, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the di≈øgrace attending the detection, which he knew mu≈øt await him, and yet as if guilt mu≈øt always be proportionate to the colouring, or the want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be ≈øupplied by a wanton exaggeration of the charge, we find this paltry motive gravely imputed to the defendant! If I expre≈øs my≈øelf with ≈øome warmth, the occa≈øion demands it, and I cannot be ≈øo ob≈øequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the honorable accu≈øers, as to ≈øuppre≈øs my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on con≈øidering this charge.</p>
                     <p>But further, Sir; it is impo≈ø≈øible that when the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant certified the New-Loan certificates to be genuine and a≈ø≈øumable, he could have been influenced by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives imputed to him. The United States had taken no ri≈øk upon them≈øelves. A ≈øcrutiny was to take place at the end of the loan, when all certificates not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribable would be rejected. Nor did <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> run any ri≈øk under the law of April 1792‚ÄîThat law only provided for the redemption at the Trea≈øury, upon transfers being made to the State-Trea≈øurer for the u≈øe of the commonwealth, of the <hi>certificates which the ≈øub≈øcribers ≈øhould receive from the United States, in con≈øequence of
<pb n="660" facs="unknown:027132_0688_0FD3282391A1AFE8"/>
≈øuch ≈øub≈øcriptions.</hi> Had this law been ob≈øerved, no ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed debt could have been redeemed at the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> until the ≈øub≈øcription had been approved of by the United States, and of cour≈øe, no improper redemption could have happened‚ÄîSome difficulties attended the execution of this law, and the Governor made an arrangement (page 97-98) for <hi>the redemption before the i≈ø≈øuing of certificates,</hi> in con≈øequence of the ≈øub≈øcription, and of cour≈øe ≈øubjected the ≈øtate to all lo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes ari≈øing from any of the certificates which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øited with the Commi≈ø≈øioner of Loans, being forged, counterfeited or not ≈øub≈øcribable from any other cau≈øe. Although there is no rea≈øon to ≈øuppo≈øe, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor did not intend well, yet it mu≈øt be admitted, that this arrangement was unauthori≈øed by law. When the defendant certified the certificates to be genuine and a≈ø≈øumable, he could not know, that any ≈øuch arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be made. Without it, no payment could have been made at the Trea≈øury, until the Secretary of the Trea≈øury ≈øhould have decided on the ≈øub≈øcribability of the certificates, and it is therefore impo≈ø≈øible, for any rational mind to ≈øuppo≈øe, that the defendant could have had the motives for concealment which have been imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>But ≈øays the ≈øame article, "The defendant did not con≈øult the Regi≈øter-General touching the above tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, nor communicate the ≈øame to the Governor, nor di≈øcriminate," &amp;c. "and thereby all the checks of office, provided by law were de≈øtroyed." What were the≈øe checks of office? They were the Regi≈øter-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and the Governor, and no other checks were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by law.</p>
                     <p>If he has de≈øtroyed them, he ≈øhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for murder;‚Äînot impeached for a mi≈ødemeanor.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman tell us, that "The Secretary of the Trea≈øury, on ≈øeeing the law of 1789, altered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and determined, that the New-Loan debt was not ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan of the United States, and that he rejected it accordingly."</p>

                        <pb n="661" facs="unknown:027132_0669_0FD353FD8F6106E8"/>If this were really ≈øo, I do not ≈øee how it could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the que≈øtion at pre≈øent, but the fact is otherwi≈øe. When an objection was made on the part of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> the Secretary of the Trea≈øury con≈øidered the que≈øtion on its true ground, to wit‚ÄîIs the New-Loan debt a ≈øtill exi≈øting debt?

This appears partly from his letter of the 8th of February and 21≈øt of Augu≈øt 1793 (page 76-7-8, and 218) but more fully from the evidence given by him in the cour≈øe of the trial.</p>

                        <p>The≈øe two articles appear to me to depend on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ≈øolution of the following que≈øtions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1≈øt. Was it criminal in the defendant to buy New-Loan certificates out of his office, in like manner as other per≈øons might? and,</p>

                        <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe que≈øtions has been very properly given up by the worthy gentleman who ≈øpoke la≈øt, but as his colleagues have been ≈øo far from ≈øhewing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree of candour, as to warmly contend, for the affirmative of the que≈øtion, I am obliged to enter upon its di≈øcu≈ø≈øion.</p>
                        <p>The ground which has been taken in order to ≈øhew, that it was criminal in the defendant to purcha≈øe New-Loan certificates, at <hi>any place</hi> or from <hi>any per≈øon</hi> is this ‚Äîalthough ≈øay the gentlemen, the holders of ≈øuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates had not brought them to be exchanged, they might perhaps have done ≈øo, if the defendant had not bought them, and as his buying them, may po≈ø≈øibly have prevented their being offered for exchange, it mu≈øt be criminal‚Äîand one of the gentlemen has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed‚ÄîWhat! will the defendant's coun≈øel contend, that what is lawful for other per≈øons is al≈øo lawful for public officers? and they have concluded by amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much at large, on the duties of public offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in order to ≈øhew that there is one law for them, and another for other people.</p>
                        <p>"There are," ≈øays Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> "≈øome po≈øitions ≈øo plain and clear in them≈øelves that nothing can make them more ≈øo, and therefore one is greatly at a lo≈øs how to rea≈øon upon them." The truth of this ob≈øervation will be admitted by every man who attempts to rea≈øon in ≈øupport of a ≈øelf evident propo≈øition, ≈øince he can make u≈øe of no arguments more clear, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition

is, which they are intended to maintain. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely in this ≈øituation do I find my≈øelf when called upon to ≈øhew, that it was no le≈øs lawful for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant than for any other per≈øon, to purcha≈øe the New-Loan certificates. They were by the law of 1786 made payable to bearer, and there is no exception in that law, or in any ≈øub≈øequent law, to prevent the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant or any other per≈øon from becoming the bearer. If the clau≈øe is general, no per≈øon is excepted, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily follows, that it extends to all per≈øons. It at all times re≈øts with the Legi≈ølature to ≈øay, whether any particular officer ≈øhall or ≈øhall not bargain or deal in commodities, which may have ≈øome kind of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his office‚ÄîIn ≈øome in≈øtances it is prohibited by expre≈øs provi≈øion made for that purpo≈øe, but the≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances are but few, and until now, no man ever dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that without ≈øuch prohibition the dealing was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                        <p>In order however to prove it to be unlawful, without any ≈øuch expre≈øs prohibition, the gentlemen have ≈øaid that there are ca≈øes of ≈øuch prohibition and exclu≈øion being ≈øpecially made, both by the laws of <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and of the United States, and under the former, they have in≈øtanced vendue ma≈øters;‚Äîunder the latter, the Secretary of the Trea≈øury.‚ÄîBut to me it appears, that the≈øe in≈øtances of expre≈øs prohibition, afford the fulle≈øt refutation of the doctrine, which they are quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain; ≈øince a ≈øpecial provi≈øion mu≈øt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely u≈øele≈øs, if without ≈øuch ≈øpecial prohibition on particular officers, there is by law <hi>a general prohibition on all officers.</hi> The Legi≈ølature of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> has not thought fit to prohibit the officers of the Land-office from dealing in land, and they have done ≈øo as freely as other people without any body ≈øuppo≈øing it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. What the law <hi>does not forbid,</hi> it <hi>permits,</hi> and where the law has not di≈øtingui≈øhed, the judges have no right to do ≈øo.

up in a few words to be;‚Äî<hi>to di≈øcharge with fidelity, whatever the law enjoins;‚Äîto ab≈øtain from whatever it forbids.</hi> A public officer mu≈øt learn his duties from the laws of his country, and where he can find no prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in them, he has a right to ≈øay that none exi≈øts. I have ≈øaid, Sir, that one of the gentlemen has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, What! will the defendant's coun≈øel pretend, that what is law for other per≈øons, is al≈øo law for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers? To this I an≈øwer, that they certainly will and boldly too, <hi>in all things</hi> where the law does not <hi>impo≈øe certain re≈øtrictions,</hi> or enjoin <hi>certain duties upon them.</hi> In all other ca≈øes, the public officer and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate citizen are alike; their rights and their obligations are the ≈øame, and there is not <hi>one law for the one and another law for the other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh! but we are told, "It was indelicate in Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> to be concerned in the purcha≈øing of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates," and on this ground too, has his conviction been warmly urged.

                        <p>The next que≈øtion is;‚ÄîWas it criminal in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to purcha≈øe certificates brought to his office to be exchanged, but which the holders of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concluded to ≈øell.</p>
                        <p>The ≈øixth article ≈øtates, that "The New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates by being brought to the office to be exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by virtue of the Act of March 1789, became the property of the commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Regi≈øter-General to be cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led," yet that the defendant ≈øub≈øcribed the ≈øame in his own name and to his own u≈øe, to the injury and lo≈øs of the commonwealth." If the≈øe certificates upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the office to be exchanged, became the property of the commonwealth, <hi>without any exchange being made,</hi> the defendant has acted again≈øt law, but if they did not ≈øo become the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, this objection does not differ from the one la≈øt mentioned‚ÄîBefore adverting to the evidence, it will be proper to con≈øider the law, ≈øince if it has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely mi≈øtaken by the honorable accu≈øers, this charge al≈øo, mu≈øt lo≈øe its ≈øting.</p>
                        <p>They ≈øay that the certificates, immediately upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the officer, became the property of the commonwealth, and we ≈øay, they did not until the New-Loan certificates were delivered to the ≈øtate by the holder, the balance of intere≈øt ≈øettled, that balance paid and the old Continental certificates delivered up by the ≈øtate, and that until all the≈øe things were done, it was but a propo≈øal, not an exchange, and of cour≈øe there could be no change of property. That it may be ≈øeen which of us is right, I mu≈øt turn to the law of the 27th March 1789.</p>

Although this is a material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration at pre≈øent, I will not at this time make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations to prove it.

The third ≈øection of the Act, after mentioning that "difficulties might ari≈øe in equalizing the intere≈øt paid by this ≈øtate, to the holders of the New-Loan certificates, with the intere≈øt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ≈øtate from the United States, authori≈øed the Pre≈øident or Vice-Pre≈øident in Council, to cau≈øe the New-Loan certificates, on the holders thereof apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefor, to be returned through the office of the Comptroller-General, provided that no certificates ≈øhould be ≈øo returned, until the intere≈øt paid by this ≈øtate on the New-Loan certificates, ≈øhould be equalized, and the overplus or balance, beyond what had been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ≈øtate from the United States, ≈øhould be repaid in indents of the United States, to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, for the u≈øe of this ≈øtate, and in every ca≈øe, where this ≈øtate ≈øhould have received more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt from the United States, than ≈øhould have been paid on the New-Loan certificates, the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ≈øhould pay ≈øuch overplus in indents to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ≈øuch certificates.‚ÄîAfter attending to this part, and on this que≈øtion it is the only material part, of the law of March 1789, it is difficult to conceive, on what principles the honorable accu≈øers, in all their laudable zeal for accu≈øation, could have imagined, that the New-Loan certificates became the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth immediately on their being offered for re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and without any of tho≈øe requi≈øites being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; and what mu≈øt greatly increa≈øe our wonder is, that we ≈øee their honorable managers and learned coun≈øel throwing down the gauntlet, and appearing as

He believed ≈øo and carried it to the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for that purpo≈øe‚ÄîThe Comptroller-General tells him, it ≈øhall be exchanged, but as you have received one, two or three year's intere≈øt from the ≈øtate, more than the ≈øtate has received from the United States, you mu≈øt pay the difference before an exchange can take place‚ÄîThe individual replies, I have no property in the world ≈øave this certificate, and I therefore cannot

do it; give me my certificate that I may do with it, as well as I can; no, replies the Comptroller-General, by offering your certificate for exchange, your property in it is dive≈øted, and it now belongs to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Give me then ≈øays the other my old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental one in lieu of it.‚ÄîNo replies the Comptroller-General I cannot do that, until the balance of intere≈øt is equalized and paid‚ÄîThis ≈øays the individual I ≈øhall never be able to do, becau≈øe I have no other property, and if you keep both certificates, I am reduced to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.‚ÄîIt is ≈øo, mu≈øt the defendant, on his accu≈øer's principles, reply, but I cannot help it; your property in one certificate is dive≈øted by your offering it for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, while you are property in the other is not reve≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becau≈øe you are not able to comply with the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary terms!‚ÄîI now a≈øk, Mr. Speaker, if any thing can be more true, than that the≈øe con≈øequences re≈øult from the doctrine contended for? I further a≈øk, if the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contended for is not a very high <hi>article of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> on the honour and integrity of <hi>Penn≈øylvania?</hi> If an an≈øwer to both the≈øe que≈øtions mu≈øt be given in the affirmative, it will be an ample refutation of the objection. Exchange is the act of giving and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reciprocally; it is traffic by permutation; it is the giving of one thing for the ≈øake of another, and to talk of an exchange without a mutual transfer of property, is to mi≈øcon≈øtrue the meaning of a word, which no ≈øchool-boy is at a lo≈øs to comprehend‚ÄîIn a good old book of the law, in which nothing but truth is to be found, it is recorded that "In every exchange there are two grants, for that each party granteth to the other in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;" and yet the defendant's accu≈øers have di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that there may be an exchange, although one party parts with nothing, and although the other, does not comply with the terms on which ≈øuch exchange had been propo≈øed! I might dilate on this ≈øubject, as I might at the meridian hour of a clear day, to prove to a man of perfect vi≈øion, that the ≈øun ≈øhines, but le≈øt I might become the object of ridicule, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.

So much for the law, and now for the evidence relating to this que≈øtion.</p>
                        <p>It appears that ≈øeveral per≈øons, who≈øe names or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it would be u≈øele≈øs to mention, withdrew their New-Loan certificates, after carrying them to the defendant's office to be exchanged. A change of mind in the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them, was occa≈øioned by various circum≈øtances, which have been given in evidence, and which it is needle≈øs to relate. The acquie≈øcence of the defendant in that change of mind, neverthele≈øs proves, that he thought the right of re-exchanging or not, re≈øted with the party, until the re-exchange was completed‚Äînor was this the opinion of him, only, but of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor al≈øo. It is neither ≈øtated in the charge nor proved by the evidence, that the holders of the certificates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be exchanged, tendered the balance of intere≈øt due from them. It is neither ≈øtated nor proved that they were prepared with indents for that purpo≈øe. If this was not the ca≈øe, an exchange could not be made agreeably to the terms of the law, nor was the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant authori≈øed to make ≈øuch exchange.‚ÄîBut ≈øay the gentlemen, when terms offered by one party, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to by the other, the bargain is compleat, and that, as the ≈øtate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones, a change of property took place, the moment the latter were brought to the office for that purpo≈øe. I may admit the fir≈øt part of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ju≈øt, without conceding the latter, ≈øince it is not true, that the ≈øtate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones; but for the <hi>new ones and the balance of intere≈øt due from the holders of them.</hi> By a letter of the 24th of December 1791, (page 221) the defendant informed the Governor, that a number of exchanges to the amount of forty or fifty pre≈øented, were pending for want of the parties paying the indents due, and by the ≈øame letter he mentioned, that the holders of the new certificates were, on pre≈øenting them, and liquidating the intere≈øt received thereon, entitled to receive back their former ones or an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent;

                        <p>It is peculiarly worthy of con≈øideration, Sir, that the certificate mentioned in this charge, was ≈øub≈øcribed in

                        <p>If my recollection is right, Sir, the evidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords another ground of defence, which mu≈øt, I think conclu≈øively ≈øhew the defendant's innocence, and the inaccuracy of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> recollection‚ÄîThere does not I think appear, to be any deficiency in the amount of New-Loan certificates, received by the ≈øtate, in exchange for Continental ones.

                        <p>When a man of integrity ≈øpeaks affirmatively, we are induced to believe him, however bad his memory may be, although we mu≈øt ≈øu≈øpect his relation to be inaccurate; when negatively, his evidence can amount to but little, either way.</p>
                        <p>That the≈øe ob≈øervations apply with great force to the evidence of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> will appear, when it is con≈øidered, that he dealt very largely in certificates of various kinds, for a number of years, but never kept any account or memorandum of them, becau≈øe, as he him≈øelf tells you, it was of no con≈øequence of whom he bought them, nor to whom he ≈øold them‚ÄîIf then
<pb n="677" facs="unknown:027132_0685_0FD354092E85ED68"/>
he con≈øidered it as of no con≈øequence from whom they were bought, nor to whom they were ≈øold; if he never kept any account or memorandum of their quantity or amount, nor of the names of the per≈øons with whom he exchanged; from whom he bought, nor to whom he ≈øold; and if he dealt in them for a number of years and to a prodigious amount, does it follow, that he did not part with this certificate to the defendant, becau≈øe he cannot recollect it? And is it not more probable, that he has forgotten, than that a man of fair character, has committed the <hi>black crime imputed to him?</hi>‚ÄîHe is not able to tell from whom he bought, nor to whom he ≈øold other certificates, and why may not his memory have failed him with re≈øpect to this as well as to others? He does not remember from whom he bought this certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and why ≈øhould he remember to whom he fold it? He does not remember that he ever had it, and why ≈øhould he remember any thing about it? He does not remember any thing about it, and how can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect exchanging it with, or ≈øelling it to the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant! The honorable managers and learned coun≈øel very well know, that the pro≈øecution mu≈øt fail, unle≈øs they prove, that this certificate became the property of the ≈øtate, by being received in exchange from Mr. <hi>M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan;</hi> but his memory is ≈øo treacherous, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the nece≈ø≈øity of calling upon Major <hi>M'Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> and the State-Trea≈øurer to prove that it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him;‚Äîthey prove this, but they prove no more, and is it to be expected, that the≈øe gentlemen ≈øhould be able to prove all the tran≈øactions which ever took place between Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> and the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant? <hi>It is not;</hi> and if there ever was cruelty in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution, it certainly exi≈øts, where tho≈øe who conduct it, on finding that he who mu≈øt ones have known every thing re≈øpecting its grounds, has now forgotten them altogether, endeavour to ≈øupply his defect of memory by witne≈ø≈øes, who cannot be ≈øuppo≈øed to know any thing which might operate in favour of the defendant. That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> once owned this certificate is in full
<pb n="678" facs="unknown:027132_0686_0FD3540C6BA1AD80"/>
evidence from two gentlemen of re≈øpectable character; from him the honorable Senate can learn nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting it. Is it then extraordinary, that he who once owned this certificate, but does not recollect it; nor is able to tell from whom he received it; nor to ≈øay one word about it; ≈øhould forget parting with it to the defendant? Nay, would it not be more extraordinary, if a man who does not recollect to have ever had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, ≈øhould tell you, that he recollects parting with it to the defendant!</p>
                        <p>Innocence of conduct, Mr. Speaker, I have always been taught to believe, afforded ample ≈øecurity, but on the principles contended I find, if they are found, that <hi>that</hi> ≈øecurity does not depend on innocence, but on the ≈øcanty portion of the faculty of memory, which may have been be≈øtowed on an individual.‚ÄîAgain, Sir, what a≈øpect will this bu≈øine≈øs wear, if I make the extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> is remarkable for his retentive memory, and accuracy of relation; and if I go further and admit, that he never did ≈øell this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to the defendant, nor exchange it with him in his private capacity? Not any a≈øpect unfavorable to the defendant, becau≈øe all ≈øuch certificates were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bearer and transferrable by delivery. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs dealt largely in them, but does not know from whom he bought nor to whom he ≈øold.‚ÄîAlthough he does not recollect it, he received this certificate from Major <hi>M'Connel,</hi> as appears by the evidence of that gentleman. That Mr. <hi>M'Clenathan</hi> not only bought, but ≈øold certificates, appears from his own te≈øtimony. Whether he ≈øold this certificate to ≈øome other per≈øon or not, he cannot tell, ≈øince he has forgot that he ever had it. May it not then be, that if he did not ≈øell it to the defendant, yet that he ≈øold it to ≈øome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon? And if ≈øo, may it not have come fairly into the defendant's hands in the cour≈øe of his exten≈øive deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in certificates? It ≈øurely may, nor can any thing be more likely. Mr. <hi>M'Clenathan</hi> was we find, in the habit of ≈øelling certificates, but he cannot ≈øay to whom,
<pb n="679" facs="unknown:027132_0687_0FD354553664E570"/>
or this certificate might perhaps be ea≈øily traced to the defendant's hands. If he cannot ≈øay to whom he ≈øold, why are we to expect that the defendant can prove, from whom he bought? Becau≈øe ≈øay his accu≈øers, "He is an accurate man."‚ÄîThat he is an accurate man, in matters wherein accuracy is required, or can be u≈øeful, is admitted; but what occa≈øion could there be for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy in keeping an account of the names of per≈øons, from whom he bought, or to whom he ≈øold certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates? Or how could it be u≈øeful? Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ≈øays, he kept no ≈øuch account, becau≈øe it was of no con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Mo≈øt other people rea≈øoned I believe in the ≈øame way, and I very much doubt, if many in≈øtances can be ≈øhewn, of ≈øuch accounts being kept by dealers in certificates. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> was a≈øked if he could tell the names of all the per≈øons from whom he bought, and to whom he ≈øold certificates, but he deemed the que≈øtion ≈øo unrea≈øonable, that he refu≈øed to an≈øwer it, and yet the guilt of the defendant is ≈øtrongly urged, becau≈øe he cannot prove from whom he got this certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate. On the ≈øame principles might he be called on to prove, from whom he received every certificate, of every kind and de≈øcription which he ever owned; on the ≈øame principle it might be concluded, that where-ever he could not furni≈øh ≈øuch proof, he had ≈øtolen them; and on the ≈øame principle, might the ≈øame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion be made again≈øt every other man under the like circum≈øtances! But ≈øay the gentlemen, the defendant kept a diary of all his tran≈øactions, and if he had bought this certificate, an account of it would appear in that diary. Sir that diary lies on the table, and if the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will permit it to be read, it will be found, that it does not contain an account <hi>of all his tran≈øactions,</hi> nor of any ≈øingle tran≈øaction of any kind whatever, except of the public bu≈øine≈øs of his office, tran≈øacted by him for other people as Comptroller-General. If the gentlemen will permit the diary to be read, they will find this to be the ca≈øe, and if they will not, its contents ≈øhould not be mi≈ørepre≈øented. The defendant thought it of no
<pb n="680" facs="unknown:027132_0688_0FD3282391A1AFE8"/>
more con≈øequence than Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> did from whom he bought, nor to whom he ≈øold certificates, nor <hi>did he ever keep any accounts thereof</hi>‚ÄîOn the ≈øame ground, then, might he be impeached on account of every other certificate ≈øub≈øcribed by him, and which had been i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued in any other name than his own; on the ≈øame ground, might all other per≈øons, under the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances be impeached; on the ≈øame principles might their guilt be pre≈øumed. This doctrine would al≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Continental certificates, ≈øub≈øcribed under the fir≈øt loan, ≈øince with equal propriety it might be urged, that the ≈øtate had received them in exchange for New-Loan certificates, as it is now urged that this New-Loan certificate was received in exchange for a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental one.

                        <p>When called on to give an account of his tran≈øacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> he ≈øays, that he never, to the be≈øt of his knowledge, either ≈øold or lent to, or depo≈øited with <hi>Matthew M'Connell</hi> a certificate to the amount of ¬£. 3275:19:4 and that as he did not lend him ≈øuch a certificate he could not receive it from him in return.</p>

1788 is proved by that gentleman and by his books. Here then is full evidence of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory failing him, as to the buying of this very certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate from one gentleman, and is it more extraordinary for him to forget the ≈øelling of it to another?</p>
                        <p>He ≈øays Sir, that he lent Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> a number of <hi>≈ømall</hi> certificates, amounting in the whole to upwards of ¬£. 3000‚Äîand that he made a memorandum of them in a book. This entry of them in the book was, becau≈øe they were to be returned‚ÄîIt has ≈øince been produced, and among the≈øe <hi>≈ømall</hi> certificates we find, be≈øides ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to a larger amount than ¬£. 200 each, one to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of ¬£. 328:9:9 another to the amount of ¬£. 398:8:9 and another to the amount of ¬£ 1350:0:0‚ÄîSure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the witne≈øs would not have called the la≈øt one, a <hi>≈ømall</hi> certificate, if he had recollected it. He mu≈øt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have forgotten, notwith≈øtanding the entry made in his book. Had it not been for that entry, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the whole tran≈øaction would have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that his memory, though aided by it before giving his evidence, was ≈øo extremely treacherous as to fail him, when giving it without having the books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes at the very moment of doing ≈øo. Here he ≈øpeaks <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that they were all ≈ømall. He is mi≈øtaken, and why not ≈øo, when ≈øpeaking negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without the help of a memorandum to refre≈øh his memory? Another very extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance attending the evidence of this gentleman is, that although from the help of his memorandum, he is enabled to recollect, lending to Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> on the 30th of March 1789, certificates amounting in the whole to upwards of ¬£. 3000‚Äîyet when called upon to give an account of all their dealings in certificates, he mentions no others (page 251) although Major <hi>M'Connell,</hi> when a≈øked whether, the certificates for ¬£. 3275:19:4 was paid or ≈øold to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan;</hi> tells you, "That it was delivered to him agreeably to an engagement or contract. That Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> delivered him ≈øome certificates, for which he was
<pb n="683" facs="unknown:027132_0691_0FD3540EB8372CA0"/>
to deliver him a certain quantity of another kind, and that he delivered him more certificates be≈øides this at the time alluded to, and afterwards." This tran≈øaction happened in April 1788, (page 250) and it cannot therefore be the ≈øame with that which Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> entry enables him to recollect having happened (page 254) in March 1789. It proves that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> parted with certificates to Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> be≈øides the≈øe mentioned by him to more than the amount of ¬£. 3275:19:4 and that in April 1788, he was partly repaid by one certificate to that amount, and partly by more certificates at the ≈øame time, and fully by more certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates afterwards‚Äîyet every trace of this tran≈øaction is entirely era≈øed from the memory of the witne≈øs‚ÄîIm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions made on his mind by objects of di≈øtre≈øs, or a ≈øen≈øe of religious or moral duty are la≈øting; all others are but momentary, and like a bird in the air leave not a trace behind.</p>
                        <p>If this is not ≈øufficient to prove, that no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion is to be drawn from Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to recollect a fact, than that he has forgotten it; demon≈øtration of its truth will afforded by that which is to follow‚ÄîThe whole amount of certificates which he mentions, as having been receive by him from Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> is upwards of ¬£. 3000, which was returned to him in con≈øequence of the loan of March 1789‚ÄîI have already ≈øhewed, that be≈øides that ≈øum, he received from him to more than the amount of ¬£. 3275:19:4.

                        <p>In ≈øhort, Sir. notwith≈øtanding the large dealings in the certificate bu≈øine≈øs, which took place between the witne≈øs and Major <hi>M'Connell,</hi> the mind of the former is a mere blank, except where his memorandum made an impre≈ø≈øion, but even that impre≈ø≈øion was ≈øo fugitive, as to be gone, the moment the book was out of his hands!</p>
                        <p>I have ≈øaid, Sir, that he expre≈ø≈øes him≈øelf on many occa≈øions, as to be ≈øure an hone≈øt man who doubts would do, with ≈øo much he≈øitation as to ≈øhew, that he is certain of nothing. His an≈øwers afford ample te≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of this, and I need not go through them to prove it. It has been objected, that as Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> tells you, "He took all the New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates that he po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, and which were to a very con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable amount, to be exchanged." This mu≈øt have been among≈øt them. To this I an≈øwer, that this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can only apply to the certificates which he then had, not tho≈øe which he had parted with, and of cour≈øe it proves nothing at all, ≈øince it does not appear that he then had the certificate in que≈øtion.</p>
                        <p>"I took no account," ≈øays Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> "of either the number or value of the certificates, nor of the rime of delivering them to be exchanged." How little mu≈øt he then know re≈øpecting them!</p>
                        <p>Whether the certificate in que≈øtion was exchanged or not, or whether the witne≈øs received Continental ones in lieu thereof, he cannot tell (page 255-6.)</p>
                        <p>Whether he received Continental certificates in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his New-Loan ones altogether and at one time, or at different times he does not remember (page 256)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> obliged Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt at different times with indents, but to what amount the witne≈øs cannot ≈øay (page 257.)</p>

                        <p>I might perhaps Mr. Speaker, with great ≈øafety to my client, clo≈øe my ob≈øervations here, but I ≈øtill re≈øt on one ≈øtrong ground of defence, ≈øurrounded by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable ramparts of truth and ≈øafety, from which it will never be in the power of the well organized and arranged, the well trained and di≈øciplined band of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran a≈ø≈øailants to di≈øplace me. The charge is, that this certificate had been received in exchange for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other one, and it thereby became the property of the ≈øtate‚ÄîIf this is not proved, there is no evidence of the defendant's guilt and he mu≈øt be acquitted. It is not incumbent on him to prove, than it was not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ≈øtate, but on the ≈øtate it is incumbent to prove, that it was. What is the proof which the ≈øtate afford of this? Why that in March 1790 it was owned by Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> and that at a ≈øub≈øequent period, he cannot tell us when, he delivered all the certificates which he then had, without being able to mention their amount or number to the defendant to be exchanged; that he received in exchange, certain others, the amount or number of which he cannot tell; nor did he ever know, whether the certificate in que≈øtion was among them or not;‚Äîhe cannot ≈øay nor does be know that he ever ≈øaw it. Although we cannot learn it from him, we learn from others, that he owned it in March 1790, but as he was in the practice of buying and ≈øelling cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, upon a very large and exten≈øive ≈øcale, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping any accounts whatever re≈øpecting them, he may have parted with this certificate, in April, May or June of the ≈øame year. Upon whom then does the burthen of the proof lie? The pro≈øecutors tell us that when ≈øtolen goods are found upon a man, he can only be acquitted, by proving that he came hone≈øtly by them, and they have endeavoured to apply that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nciple to the pre≈øent ca≈øe. The principle is certainly a
<pb n="686" facs="unknown:027132_0694_0FD35458799DA628"/>
good one, but before it can be applied, it mu≈øt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the goods were ≈øtolen‚ÄîBefore an enquiry re≈øpecting the thief can take place, it is nece≈ø≈øary to prove that a felony was committed, and until that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the party accu≈øed may ≈øafely remain ≈øilent‚ÄîSo here; until it is proved that this certificate became the property of the ≈øtate by being received in exchange, the defendant is under no nece≈ø≈øity of proving that he did not purloin it from the ≈øtate. If it never belonged to the ≈øtate, it is impo≈ø≈øible for the ≈øtate to be defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its ab≈øtraction. It is therefore incumbent on the ≈øtate before this charge can be maintained, to e≈øtabli≈øh a property in this certificate. Of this, though e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a conviction, and without which it is impo≈ø≈øible where truth and law prevail, for a conviction to take place, not a particle of proof has been offered‚ÄîIt has only been ≈øhewn that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> owned it in March 1790, and that more than two years afterwards he delivered all the certificates which he then had, to the defendant to be exchanged;‚Äîbut as he had been in the habit of ≈øelling certificates, and knows nothing at all about this, there is no more evidence, of his having parted with it to the ≈øtate, than to any private individual whatever. Unle≈øs this ground is ≈øupported by evidence, the pro≈øecution mu≈øt fail, but in ≈øupport of this ground there is no evidence.‚ÄîEvidence in ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of its truth mu≈øt be home again≈øt the defendant, or he has a right to demand an acquittal‚ÄîThe evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence adduced for that purpo≈øe, is in the language of an antient orator, no le≈øs feeble than would be an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to put but the ≈øun, by fanning in his face with a peacock's feather.‚ÄîHere then, Sir, permit me to pau≈øe and to make a ≈øerious and determined ≈øtand;‚Äîa ≈øtand on ground ≈øo ≈øure and ≈øolid as to afford perfect ≈øafety wherever evidence is attended to;‚Äîtruth re≈øpected; law regarded or innocence pre≈øumed until guilt appears.</p>
                        <p>I ≈øaid, Sir, in an early ≈øtage of my remarks, that to a conviction on a charge of perjury, the evidence of two witne≈ø≈øes is required. The law is the ≈øame on a
<pb n="687" facs="unknown:027132_0695_0FD3545A81868890"/>
charge of high trea≈øon, becau≈øe an oath of fealty is ≈øuppo≈øed to have been taken, even though owing to age or ≈øex it was not by law required. Having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my rea≈øons and quoted my authorities then, they ≈øhall not be repeated now. I only reque≈øt that they may be remembered, and that it may be ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øidered, whether the ≈øame principle is not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the pre≈øent occa≈øion.‚ÄîThe con≈øequence of a conviction will be a removal from office;‚Äîit may be a "di≈øqualification to hold any office of honour, tru≈øt or profit under this commonwealth." Of this I ≈øhould not have taken any notice, had not the ≈øuppo≈øed mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the puni≈øhment, been ≈øtrongly urged as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon for conviction.‚ÄîLet your men of <hi>delicacy,</hi> who urge a conviction, becau≈øe to their <hi>delicate</hi> feelings it appears, that the defendant has not acted delicately ≈øay whether to a man of honour ≈øuch a puni≈øhment is not wor≈øe than death!</p>

                           <hi>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable Senate,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Circum≈øtances, of which my pre≈øent appearance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords too ample a proof, have entitled me to ≈øome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, but I have received it in ≈øuch a degree, that I will not abu≈øe it by taking up time in a recapitulation.</p>
                        <p>Before you, appears a man in the open and erect form of innocence;‚Äîa man who≈øe integrity was till now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver que≈øtioned;‚Äîa man in whom <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> for a ≈øeries of years, repo≈øed more confidence than ≈øhe ever did in any one of his accu≈øers;‚Äînot le≈øs than in any one of his honorable judges;‚Äîa man who≈øe benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and kindne≈øs of di≈øpo≈øition are converted into crimes! And you ≈øee him charged with not only the ≈øummit of human, but the depth of infernal wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs! and this too upon the evidence of a man, who is not able to relate with accuracy to day what happened ye≈øterday.</p>
                        <p>To what or to whom ≈øhall the defendant under the≈øe circum≈øtances appeal, in vindication of his abu≈øed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence?
<pb n="688" facs="unknown:027132_0696_0FD3549215C808D8"/>
Not to his honorable judges, <hi>as benign di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øers of mercy;</hi>‚Äîfor her favours he di≈ødains. The feelings of con≈øcious integrity, will not permit a man, who has not ≈øinned; to accept ≈øo degrading a boon.‚Äî But his appeal is to ju≈øtice, and he is too proud to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any thing el≈øe;‚Äîto ju≈øtice not in the haggard form, in which ≈øhe appeared in another place; where upon a <hi>≈øale</hi> related by one man, of what had been told him by another, a very high charge was made and vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be true! Where this was deemed ≈øufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the information was ≈øaid to have come from one of the officers of government; where it was not thought worth while to ≈øend for that per≈øon before the Hou≈øe, and to examine into the truth of fal≈øity of the charge? But the ju≈øtice to which he appeals, is that which reigns ≈øupreme within the≈øe walls;‚Äîin form cele≈øtial;‚Äî in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture divine.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE honorable but arduous ta≈øk of concluding the arguments falls to my lot. I have to lament the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between my abilities and the magnitude of this bu≈øine≈øs; the latter circum≈øtance I doubt not however will ≈øecure me your be≈øt attention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="689" facs="unknown:027132_0697_0FD354C2CA7AE450"/>There are circum≈øtances in this <hi>cau≈øe</hi> ≈øufficient to excite the curio≈øity of the mo≈øt dull, and to affect the feelings of tho≈øe lea≈øt attentive to the intere≈øt of the community.</p>
                     <p>More than 60,000 dollars have been i≈ø≈øued from your Trea≈øury, in ≈øtock of the United States. The expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compen≈øation cannot be obtained; and if it could, it would be on terms that would render the acqui≈øition, no gain; and the Comptroller-General, your confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial agent, has gained more than ¬£. 5000 by the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
                     <p>A tran≈øaction ≈øo injurious to the commonwealth and derogatory to the character of the defendant, requires a di≈øcu≈ø≈øion. The reputation of the ≈øtate, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the defendant, are implicated in this inve≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; the enquiry is of great importance, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects the defendant, or the conduct of the A≈ø≈øembly. If the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives made u≈øe of expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons authori≈øing what has been done, let their intention have been what it might, the fault is imputable to them <hi>alone.</hi> It is nece≈ø≈øary, the import of their language ≈øhould known; or, if the Comptroller-General ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his official duty with art and de≈øign, and mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øtrued laws to ≈øerve his private emolument, he ought to be the object of public di≈øapprobation.</p>
                     <p>Whether, therefore, you con≈øider the defendant, or the nature of the ≈øubject, no place can be ≈øo proper for the inve≈øtigation as the Senate, ina≈ømuch as character and ≈øtation can have no weight before this high tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The re≈øult of experience induced our ance≈øtors, in another country, to prefer trials by impeachments to the ordinary tribunals, to prevent a defect of ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as the influence of the accu≈øed often bias and ≈øway the minds of a jury. Some pains have been taken by the coun≈øel for the defendant to prejudice the Senate again≈øt this mode of proceeding. They ≈øay this ought to be referred to courts of ju≈øtice! One gentleman ≈øaid, "popular bodies are ea≈øily warped by an artful indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour."
<pb n="690" facs="unknown:027132_0698_0FD3545BFAFC6B08"/>
And the gentleman who ≈øpoke la≈øt attributes it to a gratification of humour.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect in <hi>England</hi> any abu≈øe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs; a ≈øalutary u≈øe hath been made of it in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the United States, and in the different ≈øtates, we find, when they reject bills of attainder, they adopt the mode of trials by impeachment.</p>
                     <p>I pre≈øume every Senator hearing me perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands the different kinds of debts.</p>
                     <p>Funded debt includes certificates i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies on Continental account, not including De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates i≈ø≈øued for the depreciation of the pay of the <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> line. The Act of the 21≈øt of March 1783 makes the di≈øtinction between <hi>funded</hi> and <hi>unfunded</hi> depreciation certificates. When the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation certificates were originally i≈ø≈øued, they were only funded in the Land-office, and on forfeited e≈øtates; the≈øe funds were found in≈øufficient to keep them from depreciating; the exci≈øe was therefore per Act la≈øt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, appropriated to tho≈øe not alienated. Hence the di≈øtinction. Now, the unfunded debt is an object of our enquiry. This debt, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking, originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lately, had been i≈ø≈øued on Continental account, and unconnected with this cau≈øe, being contracted between the individuals and the ≈øtate; and although contracted on Continental account, they were ≈øtate debts; the creditors had no other debtor but the ≈øtate, and being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of 3 per cent. ≈øtock of the United States ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redeem and pay off this debt, the law of the 10th of April 1792, who≈øe meaning we are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a≈øcertain, was pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
                     <p>It may al≈øo be proper here to mention that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the New-Loans was about five millions of dollars, that ¬£. 118,470:6:6 had been redeemed, and that the remainder had been reduced by exchanges to the ≈øum of ¬£. 50,000. and no doubt had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but that the whole would be exchanged without the expence of a ≈øingle farthing to the ≈øtate.</p>
                     <p>The fir≈øt great que≈øtion of the cau≈øe now offered for
<pb n="691" facs="unknown:027132_0699_0FD354C140488A50"/>
con≈øideration: What debts were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792?</p>
                     <p>I an≈øwer in the words of the law, 1≈øt. Certificates on which an intere≈øt of 6 per cent. was payable annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: 2d. 6 per cent. purparts. 3d. 3 per cent. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; and, 4th. Dollar-money. As matter of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I mu≈øt here imitate the example of the coun≈øel for the defendant, by referring to the Journals to a≈øcertain the law. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the report of the committee of ways and means of the 22d of February 1792, page 157, in which the debts to be redeemed are ≈øtated; and that tho≈øe under the ≈øixth ≈øection were only to be redeemed on condition Congre≈øs ≈øhould again open the loan. Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> al≈øo enumerated the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates on which the ≈øtate were paying intere≈øt; that New-Loans were none of tho≈øe mentioned in that ≈øec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was contrary to the defendant's po≈øition, page 161. The committee contemplate the event of opening the loan, and declare on what grounds they will place unfunded depreciation. In page 160 the amount of the debt ≈øub≈øcribable is carried out ¬£.73,935 3:2. Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the report of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General of the 30th November 1791; in which he mentioned the debt which was entitled to purparts, and which excludes Unfunded Depreciation and New-Loan certificates; and ob≈øerved that it was clear that the committee of ways and means did not con≈øider the New-Loans as a ≈øtate debt, and they did not forget all the debts, for they enumerated the ≈øeveral kinds.)</p>
                     <p>In page 188 of the ≈øame minutes the report was read the ≈øecond time, and no alteration was made. The ≈øame idea is pre≈øerved in the Act as it is in the report. It is apparent the Legi≈ølature did not contemplate New-Loans as a ≈øub≈øi≈øting debt. I will only refer to the rules for con≈øtruing and expounding ≈øtatutes. It is a maxim in the con≈øtruction, <hi>haeret in litera, haeret in cortice,</hi> that the life of a ≈øtatute does not con≈øi≈øt in the words but in the ≈øen≈øe and meaning of it; that general words of ≈øtatutes ≈øhall receive a particular interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="692" facs="unknown:027132_0700_0FD354D7D62A60A0"/>
when the intent of the maker is particular; that things out of the letter may be within the intent, and things within the letter may be without the intent; that the intent is to be collected ≈øometimes; by con≈øidering the cau≈øe of making the Act, ≈øometimes by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one part of the Act with the other, and ≈øometimes by foreign circum≈øtances. General words in an Act are not to be, con≈øtrued to extend to what is repealed or annulled by previous Acts, ≈øuch con≈øtructions ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be made, that one part of the Act may agree with another: Finally, an Act of Parliament as a la≈øt will is to be con≈øtrued by the intention of the maker, that one part of it is to expound and explain the other.</p>
                     <p>I will ≈øhew that all their arguments refer back to a literal meaning, and that it is, as improbable that the ≈øick ≈øailor mentioned in 1≈øt volume of <hi>Black≈øtone,</hi> (page 61) ≈øhould be entitled to the property as that the New-Loan certificates ≈øhould be within the provi≈øion of the law of the 10th April 1792. It is univer≈øally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the ≈øhip and lading did not in the la≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance belong to the ≈øick pa≈ø≈øenger, nor could it be within the meaning of the ≈øtatute. So we ≈øay in this ca≈øe, the New-Loans could not be within the purview of the Act, ≈øo that they mu≈øt be eventually paid. The idea was never ≈øugge≈øted that intere≈øt mu≈øt have been paid at the Trea≈øury on five millions of dollars, of which there remained about fifty thou≈øand pounds unexchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No man entertained a doubt but that the whole ≈øum ≈øhould have been exchanged in a ≈øhort time. Why then ≈øhould an expence of 20 or 25 per cent. be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, when the whole might be exchanged and in a very little time no New-Loans would be remaining?</p>
                     <p>It hath been ≈øtated by Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> that if the Act was to have been con≈øtrued literally, <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> would have to redeem all the debts of the ≈øeveral States in the Union. True; but does not this ≈øhew that a literal con≈øtruction is inadmi≈ø≈øible, for then the debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> not owing on continental account would
<pb n="693" facs="unknown:027132_0701_0FD354A590796C28"/>
be al≈øo redeemable. This ≈øhews the words <hi>State debt</hi> were u≈øed in an appropriate, &amp; not a general ≈øen≈øe. How then are the New-Loan certificates noticed? Is there a law or re≈øolution of the General A≈ø≈øembly? Is there a report of the Committees of ways or means? Is there an addre≈øs from the Governor to the Legi≈ølature? Is there a report from the Comptroller-General him≈øelf, recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a debt or giving any intimation that the State meant to redeem them, from the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 1789 to the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 10th April 1792? If therefore the Legi≈ølature had received no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for three years of the ≈øtate of the exchanges on what proportion of them were out: When, then, the whole ≈øy≈øtem is changed, without a line written or a word ≈øpoken on the ≈øubject by the Comptroller or Regi≈øter-General, the whole bu≈øine≈øs being unknown to the A≈ø≈øembly, what have they done?</p>
                     <p>Thus far we agree, that on the 27th of March 1789 the Legi≈ølature declared, ≈øaying, we will not pay the New-Loan certificates, we will return the continental ones, you mu≈øt look to Congre≈øs for your pay. The Legi≈ølature of 1789 made this declaration, when did they declare a different ≈øentiment? Why, Sir, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel for the defendant allege, that all on a ≈øudden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ≈øingle word ≈øaid or written about it, on the 10th of April 1792, the Legi≈ølature provided a fund commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurate with the objects to be redeemed? Is it to be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed that they would extend the redemption without <hi>enlarging</hi> the fund? Would they abandon their prudent plan to open their arms ≈øo wide as to embrace even old Continental bills of credit, and this even without being furni≈øhed with an e≈øtimate of the co≈øt?‚Äî(Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the 2d ≈øection of the Act of 10th of April.)</p>
                     <p>As it appears the fir≈øt leading motive with the Legi≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to get rid of their debts, what rea≈øon can be given why we ≈øhould not pur≈øue the ≈øame idea thro', and apply the ≈øame motives? The Legi≈ølature did not undertake to redeem all that are ≈øub≈øcribable‚ÄîIn the law of the 9th April 1791 the State debts are a≈ø≈øumable, altho' not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable,
<pb n="694" facs="unknown:027132_0702_0FD354D9363ADFA0"/>
the unfunded debt is mentioned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee on ways and means as ≈øub≈øcribable, altho' not redeemable, and it is payable at 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. in the pound, while its only receivable at 16<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>.;‚ÄîTheir only intent was to compel a ≈øub≈øcription of the debt they meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, and therefore they impo≈øed it on the holders as a con≈øideration, that they ≈øhould ≈øub≈øcribe. Therefore if our con≈øtruction is adopted, the ≈øy≈øtem is complete and con≈øi≈øtent; if on the other hand the defendant's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction ≈øhould prevail, there is a fund in one, and none in the other. Here was a condition impo≈øed as nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a redemption, you ≈øhall ≈øub≈øcribe to the loan, and a≈ø≈øign to the ≈øtate trea≈øurer for the u≈øe of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; the legi≈ølature pre≈øuming that they had provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fund, directed an order to be drawn by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor on the Trea≈øurer who ≈øhall immediately pay, &amp;c.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>Con≈øider for a moment the con≈øequences. If the New-Loans were included, the amount indefinite, what a predicament would the Legi≈ølature be involved in. Their plea is extravagant, their only re≈øource is the fund for claims and improvements, this fund was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtricted to ¬£. 10,000 and ¬£. 5000 of that were annually appropriated for the improvement of roads. They have therefore put a con≈øtruction on this act that would di≈øhonor the State, di≈øhonor the fir≈øt Magi≈øtrate; the con≈øequences of redeeming the New-Loans without providing funds would manife≈øt the extreme ignorance and incon≈øideration of the Legi≈ølature‚ÄîWhy adopt a con≈øtruction who≈øe con≈øequences are ≈øo ab≈øurd, ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant? They ≈øay, the State ≈øhall redeem whatever Congre≈øs will a≈ø≈øume, ≈øhall Congre≈øs a≈ø≈øume, becau≈øe the ≈øtate will redeem? Does Congre≈øs a≈ø≈øume the debts, which the ≈øtate will not pay? <hi>They will not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot be pretended that the redemption law of the 10th of April, 1792, created a debt; the New-Loans were excluded from redemption by the Act of 27th March 1789, there the Legi≈ølature declare the New-Loans ≈øhall never be redeemed by us; we will not redeem them otherwi≈øe than by an exchange; does
<pb n="695" facs="unknown:027132_0703_0FD354DB9FF993D0"/>
Congre≈øs ≈øay, they will a≈ø≈øume, what <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> ≈øays, ≈øhe will not redeem. If the New-Loans are not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the State, they are not a≈ø≈øumable by Congre≈øs. Their con≈øtruction will not do, except they can ≈øhew the will of the Legi≈ølature fully expre≈ø≈øed ≈øince the 27th of March 1789; at that time no divi≈øions of parties prevailed, as they did when the Act of the 10th April, 1792, was pa≈ø≈øed. Is it to be imagined, that they would leave it to Congre≈øs to ≈øay, what debts <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> was to pay?</p>
                     <p>No, Mr. Speaker, we are to take it upon the exi≈øting acts; from the complexion of the hou≈øe at that time, it is pre≈øumed that they would not throw them≈øelves into the power of Congre≈øs. In the official ≈øtatements of the Comptroller-General to the Legi≈ølature, in which he included all the debts of the commonwealth, he expre≈øsly ≈øtates the≈øe New-Loans as excluded by law from redemption. I confe≈øs, I thought the≈øe few ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations would have been ≈øufficient for minds open to conviction, in as much as all parties acquie≈øced in the Act of 1789, no objections were made to it, nor were any difficulties ≈øtarted; all parties concurred, when the ≈øtate had declared her will, and none referred to the New-Loans‚Äî≈øtrange, to hear curious di≈øputes about the con≈øtitution,‚Äîfor in Augu≈øt the ≈øame year the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors applied to Congre≈øs as to their only hope. As much pains have been taken to ob≈øcure what is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf plain and ≈øelf-evident, and left I ≈øhould be thought to have neglected my duty, I am obliged to be more particular, I will therefore proceed to ≈øhew‚Äî</p>

                     <p>Mr. INGERSOLL, in continuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MY <hi>fir≈øt po≈øition is, that the New-Loan certificates were not a≈ø≈øumable;</hi> and it is worthy of attention to con≈øider the manner in which it hath been brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senate. The Comptroller-General, a principal officer of government is endeavouring to bring forward a law con≈øigned to everla≈øting oblivion; to a≈ø≈øi≈øt his views, he is trying to give a con≈øtruction to the Act of 10th of April, 1792, a con≈øtruction which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail at that time, and it is but of late that the di≈øcovery was made.</p>
                     <p>If laws are to be con≈øtrued in this manner the be≈øt plan may be rendered abortive; but it hath been ≈øhewn that the Legi≈ølature have left on their records an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable evidence that they con≈øidered the Act of 1789 as perfectly annihilating the certificates in que≈øtion. They bore an intere≈øt of 6 per cent. for four years, if they were State debts they mu≈øt have borne intere≈øt until paid off; why then were they omitted in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the debts of the ≈øtate? Why were they omitted in the ≈øixth ≈øection if they were ≈øub≈øcribable as a debt of <hi>Penn≈øylvania?</hi> Would it then be contended as an operation of the law, or was this inferrable from the Comptroller-General's report of December 1790‚Äî Wherein he adds that he was then ≈øtating all the debts of the commonwealth on which intere≈øt was payable by the ≈øtate, and adds 600l. intere≈øt on the New-Loans being a part of the four year's intere≈øt‚ÄîThat the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General is wrong, it is ≈øufficient to ≈øay, that if
<pb n="698" facs="unknown:027132_0706_0FD354C5CBA8D148"/>
they are a≈ø≈øumable they mu≈øt be within the a≈ø≈øumption of Congre≈øs. If I can ≈øatisfy the Senate that the≈øe debts are not within the a≈ø≈øumption of Congre≈øs, if ≈øo, and the Comptroller is defeated, is it a ≈øufficient apology for him to ≈øay? <hi>"Such was my opinion. I was mi≈øtaken."</hi> A public officer ought to tread on ≈øure ground; gro≈øs negligence and inattention is fraud; extravagant ra≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ought to be checked in any well regulated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                     <p>Although it is his fault then if it ≈øhall pa≈øs unnoticed now, the blame will re≈øt el≈øewhere. How does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; is it not clear proof that they are not a≈ø≈øumable? The Secretary of the Trea≈øury hath declared to the world they are not a≈ø≈øumable, the commi≈ø≈øioners for ≈øettling the accounts of the United States with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual States, have declared the ≈øame opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the New-Loans are not charged to Congre≈øs in the account of this State, therefore not con≈øidered as certificates i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies, <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> cannot obtain certificates from Congre≈øs, if ≈øhe could, ≈øhe mu≈øt refund the amount in continental certificates, and pay the ≈øame in addition; the United States do not undertake to a≈ø≈øume and charge the ≈øtate with debts, which they have refu≈øed to pay. The Attorney-General of the United States declared them not a≈ø≈øumable, but that firm texture of mind which one of the coun≈øel for the defendant hath attributed to him is hardly a ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient apology. If this had taken place, the whole ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription would have been lo≈øt to the ≈øtate, I will ≈øhew this to mathematical demon≈øtration. The amount of the ≈øub≈øcription of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was 2,200,000 dollars, when the ≈øtate had ≈øub≈øcribed her quota 65,000 dollars, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> ≈øub≈øcription would have been charged to her until ≈øhe had delivered continental certificates to that amount, be≈øides the difference between 16 and 20 ≈øhillings in the pound. But it will be a≈øked, why does not this mi≈øtake happen in all the other ≈øub≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becau≈øe <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> previou≈øly charged the ≈øame amount to Congre≈øs, and the only difference to <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi>
                        <pb n="699" facs="unknown:027132_0707_0FD354C8013FB7A8"/>
is the difference between the balance of ca≈øh and ≈øtock; but we are told that we can charge Congre≈øs with every thing of this kind, I an≈øwer, let any gentleman look at the books, and there is not a ≈øingle New-Loan certificate charged to them, but the whole is ≈øunk at the lo≈øs of this ≈øtate. Either the Comptroller-General knew this would not be received, or what is mo≈øt probable that he knew it was not payable out of the public Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury, or if payable, it mu≈øt have been ≈øunk as before.</p>
                     <p>But, again, it may be ≈øaid that all the≈øe mi≈øtakes might be rectified, and the time for the ≈øettlement might be extended by Congre≈øs, I an≈øwer, that it is not expectable that ≈øuch an indulgence could be granted, ≈øuch a privilege might be obtained by an humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Congre≈øs. In this critical ≈øituation ≈øhe could not obtain a ≈øingle farthing of ≈øtock until ≈øhe lodged her continental certificates for it.</p>
                     <p>But if it is nece≈ø≈øary to recur to the words of the law, we will ≈øee if Congre≈øs had countenanced this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant idea, we will ≈øee that Congre≈øs did not a≈ø≈øume the debts of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> which ≈øhe did not determine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, they ≈øay, they will a≈ø≈øume the debts of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ≈øtates, but will they determine for the ≈øtates their debts, or ≈øay, they'll pay what the ≈øtates ≈øay <hi>they'll</hi> not pay, (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the 13th ≈øection of the law of Congre≈øs, of Augu≈øt 4,1790.) Here, ≈øir, is certainly no intimation that Congre≈øs meant to determine what that debt was. (The letter page 81-2 was then read and commented on.) This is perfectly con≈øi≈øtent with the law, and the Attorney-General of the United States con≈øtrues the Act exactly as I do. If any di≈øpute ≈øhould ari≈øe between an individual and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> Congre≈øs will not undertake to determine. <hi>"It is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, ≈øettle it among your≈øelves, we will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle."</hi> From the character and ≈øituation of the writer of this letter we mu≈øt acknowledge that he determines the que≈øtion of a≈ø≈øumability, not redeemability. Now, Sir, we have the opinion of the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, and the declaration of the Attorney-General, the fir≈øt
<pb n="700" facs="unknown:027132_0708_0FD354DD95BE7B88"/>
law-officer and the United States, that if there be an Act <hi>in form of a law,</hi> declaring them not payable, they are not a≈ø≈øumable. Have any di≈øpute ari≈øen that there is ≈øuch a law? The law is dated 1 April 1790, page 790, this ≈øhews the Legi≈ølature did not con≈øider the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentale certificates the property of the ≈øtate, until the New-Loans were redeemed. But again, we are told that Congre≈øs ≈øpeaks of the New-Loans as a≈ø≈øumable; this is ≈øtrange, is it improper that Congre≈øs ≈øhould provide not to a≈ø≈øume twice the ≈øame debt? therefore they have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a clau≈øe which the Secretary by his con≈øtruction hath rendered intelligible. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the 18th ≈øection of the Act of Congre≈øs of Augu≈øt 4, 1790.)</p>
                     <p>Now, Sir, there is not a ≈øyllable in this ≈øection about ≈øurrendering up the counterparts to the United States; therefore agreeably to the literal common con≈øtruction, had a New-Loan holder ≈øub≈øcribed 6d. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> mu≈øt re≈øtore the ≈øame, or the ≈øub≈øcription on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count mu≈øt be ≈øu≈øpended; it is however true, that the Secretary of the Trea≈øury hath put a much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional con≈øtruction on the Act. If you ≈øub≈øcribe ¬£.100 of New-Loans to the loan, an hundred pounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates mu≈øt be ≈øurrendered to the United States, both certificates being evidences of one debt. But is that determining what are ≈øtate debts, and what not? that would be to encourage the New-Loan hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to controvert the Secretary's con≈øtruction. If there are New Loans i≈ø≈øued and are ≈øub≈øcribed, then you mu≈øt deliver up an equal amount of Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates. The Secretary of the Trea≈øury tells you in his letter (page 76-7-8-9, which Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> read and commented upon.) It was pre≈øented to the Secretary as if the Act of 1786 had not been repealed. No doubts were ever ≈øugge≈øted <hi>to him</hi> that there had been any law declaring them no debt.</p>
                     <p>The bu≈øine≈øs lay in this manner until Augu≈øt 21, 1793, when the Secretary wrote to the Governor (page 218-9, which was likewi≈øe read and commented upon by him.) Here were ≈øix months at lea≈øt, from Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="701" facs="unknown:027132_0709_0FD354DE80FD4FA8"/>
to Augu≈øt, a ≈øufficient time to make up their mind, and then the New-Loans were rejected totally as not ≈øub≈øcribable. It was the clo≈øing of the account with the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> which excluded them, and not the lap≈øe of time. Now, what doubt remains? It ≈øaid, that it was not ≈øtated to Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent point of view, that the law of 1789 was pa≈ø≈øed after the Federal Con≈øtitution was adopted. I a≈øk, would it affect the bu≈øine≈øs if it had? O heavens! had we no principles of legi≈ølation until 1788 and 1789? Were we born ye≈øterday? Were we novices? Let us not entertain an idea ≈øo degrading. If we entered into a contract before that period, could we abrogate that contract? It is true the United States in this as well as in other re≈øpects decline to meddle with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; but, Sir, were not the ≈øame principles held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time? Yes; they were argued at the bar, and in the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives; and the Hou≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided they might con≈øtitutionally repeal the law of 1786. The Secretary of the Trea≈øury ≈øays, if you have a difference, ≈øettle it between your≈øelves. The Judiciary of the United States have no right to decide between <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and her own citizens; I cannot ≈øee with what good rea≈øons they adduce a compari≈øon re≈øpecting the ≈øuability of ≈øtates but in regard of their being exi≈øting debts. Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> tells us, it is enough that your laws do not recognize them as debts. But to put this in a more prominent point of view, the Secretary of the Trea≈øury, a member of the Grand Convention, a gentleman ≈øo acute and enlightened, can it be ≈øuppo≈øed that it e≈øcaped <hi>him?</hi> Nay, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-General and the Commi≈ø≈øioners of accounts!</p>
                     <p>Does not the hi≈øtory of the a≈ø≈øumption ≈øhew their ≈øen≈øe? The rea≈øons no more apply to the New-Loan certificates than the mo≈øt remote ≈øubject which the mind of man can contemplate. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read 3d vol. debates of Congre≈øs, page 41, 485.) Were the New-Loan holders clamorous at the door of Congre≈øs? What was it to the New-Loan creditors in <hi>Penn≈øylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
                        <pb n="702" facs="unknown:027132_0710_0FD354C9912D7218"/>
that <hi>Shays</hi> made his appearance in <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts?</hi> Were not the five millions exchanging without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and reduced to fifty thou≈øand pounds? Was the principal or intere≈øt then payable? We have it from our learned opponents them≈øelves that the funds were withdrawn. We will by and by con≈øider that that debt was never to be paid by this ≈øtate, and unle≈øs they ≈øhould be lo≈øt or by ≈øome other ca≈øualty, not a New-Loan would have been out in the cour≈øe of time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for exchanging them. There is no rea≈øon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Congre≈øs ≈øhould be induced to pay the New-Loans, for the United States do not any where ≈øay, we will pay that debt whether <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> will redeem it or not; but in ca≈øes where the creditor could call on the ≈øtate, it never entered into their contemplation to a≈ø≈øume ≈øuch debts. No idea is ≈øugge≈øted that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs would pay le≈øs than that mentioned on the face of their contract, and of cour≈øe no rea≈øon to believe Congre≈øs would a≈ø≈øume them. But we have it in proof that all the confidential officers of the United States were directed to keep clear of them, if they wanted the due recognition of the ≈øtate as exi≈øting debts.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, the laws of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> are the te≈øt to determine whether they were or were not ≈øub≈øcribable. I will therefore a≈øk, whether the New-Loans are recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized as an exi≈øting debt on or about the 10th of April 1792, and whether they were payable at that pre≈øent, or at a future period, or at an indefinite time? This brings me to the laborious ta≈øk of ≈øhewing by tracing through the laws, what I think the Senate have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øeen, that the law of 1789 rendered them no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ≈øaid, and I ≈øub≈øcribe to it, that ≈øtatutes mu≈øt not be judged of by the opinions of members, but mu≈øt be expounded by the common and u≈øual rules. Adhering then to this principle, it will not be difficult to demon≈øtrate, that after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 27, 1789, they were no longer a debt or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a debt due by the ≈øtate. In the fir≈øt place it
<pb n="703" facs="unknown:027132_0711_0FD354E0AE349148"/>
is nece≈ø≈øary to know what the law meant; then let us try it by the Con≈øtitution, and ≈øee whether it will abide that te≈øt. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the title.) The title of this law is prepared, and affixed after the whole ≈øcope is gone through, and the law is for repealing a former one, and by that, to repeal the payment of principal and intere≈øt. Pa≈ø≈øing on then, in order to know the rea≈øons, and of con≈øequence the extent of the repeal, we mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe the law con≈øonant with the intention and declared views of the Legi≈ølature without examining them. If the law of 1786 was not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and this law ≈øays ≈øo, it is a coincident circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, and mu≈øt be ≈øo taken. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the preamble.)</p>
                     <p>The aggregate fund was the foundation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and the leading circum≈øtance; now the motive comes‚Äî"It is rea≈øonable and ju≈øt;" this is putting the Acts of 1785 and 1786 on the ≈øame footing, and all agree that the former provi≈øion was temporary. Having a≈ø≈øigned the≈øe rea≈øons they proceed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting clau≈øe (fir≈øt ≈øection then read.) This, it is ≈øaid was only withdrawing the funds. Were there any funds by the Act of 1786? The funds were created by the Act of 1785: No. Therefore, there is ≈øomething more; they ≈øpeak of more Acts than one. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon a≈ø≈øigned by the coun≈øel for the defendant, the mo≈øt inapplicable of all others, that is, ≈øu≈øpence and delay. Was this a time to ≈øeek for ≈øu≈øpen≈øion, when the ≈øtate was receiving the ≈øums due her from the Continent? She then had the immen≈øe fund of a Land-office, the arts, manufactures and agriculture flouri≈øhing, this fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

If ≈øhe was impre≈ø≈øed with an idea ≈øo ba≈øe as to have no other motive for ≈øubtracting the funds, which we mu≈øt never ≈øuppo≈øe, and unle≈øs ≈øhe was infatuated, ≈øhe mu≈øt in≈øtantly have ≈øub≈øtituted other funds in lieu of them taken away. I have ≈øaid that the recital if true, was in fact what repealed this law. It is ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="704" facs="unknown:027132_0712_0FD354937665DB88"/>
for my purpo≈øe, if in their under≈øtanding they entertained the ≈øame view, it had the ≈øame effect on them, whether well or ill founded. When they ≈øpeak of repealing the law of 1785 as well as the law of 1786, they apply it to the principal and intere≈øt; when they make the provi≈øion temporary, they apply that to the intere≈øt only, but it is not ≈øo; there is not a ≈øingle let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the law which makes the di≈øtinction. I think it ≈øafer to take their view from the Acts them≈øelves, than at ≈øecond hand. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the ≈øection.) As the funds were temporary the provi≈øion cea≈øed al≈øo. If the provi≈øion will cea≈øe, will not the funds al≈øo cea≈øe? Is it po≈ø≈øible to wink ≈øo hard as not to ≈øee? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is to remain if the funds e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Acts of 1785 and 1786 are to cea≈øe? If the tedious road ≈øo often trod mu≈øt again be travelled over, although I do not think it nece≈ø≈øary, I think the≈øe plau≈øible rea≈øons for withdrawing the funds; foreign as well as dome≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic creditors were to be paid. This Hou≈øe cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the difference between that and the pre≈øent day. A di≈ø≈øolution of the Confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be di≈øcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at lea≈øt not until a very di≈øtant period, each ≈øtate to take care of its own people. Under this a≈øpect of public affairs, the Act of 16th of March 1785, the fir≈øt law on this ≈øubject, was pa≈ø≈øed, to continue until Congre≈øs ≈øhould provide; notwith≈øtanding the≈øe a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øions, it reflect eternal honour on the authors of it. She u≈øed the funds which were not applied to the creditors generally. This was not her fault‚Äî it was attributable to ≈øome of the ea≈øtern ≈øtates, but <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was never the original debtor; ≈øhe was only ≈øurety for the United States. Why not hunt the lion more generou≈øly? Why ≈øearch up the≈øe ≈øleeping Acts?</p>
                     <p>The Legi≈ølature of 1785 in≈øtead of ≈øeeking an excu≈øe to evade the requi≈øitions of Congre≈øs, contributed every farthing required of them. It can be ≈øhewn by the ≈øtatements of the defendant him≈øelf, that there was a

The manner how this payment was made thro' the agency of the continental officers hath been already ≈øufficiently explained. Congre≈øs was afraid le≈øt the exci≈øe would be ≈øu≈øpended, and for fear of offending foreign ≈øtates or foreign creditors in Sept. 1785, for the rea≈øons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, pa≈ø≈øed their re≈øolution, 11 Volume, page 328-9, to defeat the operation of that law, it will appear that it was not a complaint that the requi≈øitions were not complied with; but that notwith≈øtanding they ≈øhould not pay the citizen creditors of any State in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the foreign creditors: The honorable Senate, no doubt, recollect the difference between that time and the pre≈øent day.</p>
                     <p>I ≈øhall endeavour to ≈øhew, altho' I do not think it nece≈ø≈øary, that the Act of 1786 was intended as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief only. To under≈øtand the≈øe laws, it is nece≈ø≈øary to be reminded of the ≈øituation of the United States, the debilitated State of the confederacy, and the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed ≈øituation of the public creditors. A di≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be di≈øcharged, or, at lea≈øt until a very di≈øtant period.</p>
                     <p>Under this a≈øpect of public affairs the fir≈øt law of this ≈øubject was pa≈ø≈øed on the 16th March 1785, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until Congre≈øs ≈øhould provide; this Act provides for the annual requi≈øitions of Congre≈øs, be≈øides taking care of its own people, the creditor citizens of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania.</hi> Notwith≈øtanding the reflections again≈øt this law, it reflects eternal honor on the authors of it, ≈øhe u≈øed the funds which went not to the creditors generally, the delinquency was not attributed to her, but to the Ea≈øtern States; ≈øhe never was the original debtor, ≈øhe was only ≈øurety, and not the principal; it was her duty to bring it forward in ≈øome manner to make it a charge again≈øt the United States, the object was con≈øidered

the ≈øame, altho' the mode of obtaining it was different, then when the principal had been ready to pay why ≈øhould we hunt up the≈øe ≈øleeping Acts with a view to embarra≈øs this bu≈øine≈øs? Altho' Congre≈øs admitted the purity of the motives which actuated <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> ≈øhe neverthele≈øs re≈øolved that any intere≈øt which ≈øhould be paid after the fir≈øt of January, 1786, ≈øhould not be allowed.</p>
                     <p>But as Congre≈øs defeated the operations of the Act of 1785, it became nece≈ø≈øary to carry that law into effect, in ≈øuch a manner, as to make it a charge again≈øt the United States; this, Sir, was the whole motive, altho' the mode of doing the bu≈øine≈øs was different, the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance was the ≈øame; and the better to ≈øave appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the certificates purported to be for ≈øo much money received on loan; did this bring the New-Loans within the term of State debts? <hi>State debt</hi> has a definite meaning, including debts on a continental account, and debts contracted on her own proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Yet, as every per≈øon well knew, a definite meaning, when the creditor had only recour≈øe to the ≈øtate, and not to Congre≈øs. The defendant's coun≈øel have been diametrically oppo≈øite on this ≈øubject; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs would never have complained of the law of 1786 had the Legi≈ølature confined them≈øelves to the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their proper ≈øtate debt, and yet we find them deputing a committee from their body to endeavour to effect the de≈øtruction of the law of 1786, (≈øee report, page 319, 320 of this.) What was the rea≈øoning of the ≈øtate on that occa≈øion? The Legi≈ølature had no de≈øign to ≈øeparate the contract from the fund, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered the fund as the e≈ø≈øence of the contract, they ≈øay, we are ready to pay our quota, and to comply with our requi≈øitions, and until that is done we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the funds, the law of 1786 mu≈øt remain until a general provi≈øion is made by Congre≈øs‚ÄîWhen the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod had arrived, mentioned in the Act of 1785, ≈øo far as it re≈øpects the payment of principal or intere≈øt of the New-Loan debt, a repeal took place; this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

had extingui≈øhed the debt, our opponents in≈øi≈øt it only withdrew the funds.</p>
                     <p>This ≈øhews the compact was not to be final and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete until all the ≈øtates ≈øhould agree. Here are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in which we and our opponents agree; let us ≈øee how far. Can't you, ≈øays Congre≈øs, withdraw the funds? <hi>"Withdraw the funds,"</hi> ≈øays the A≈ø≈øembly ≈øpurning at the idea, and leave our contract a <hi>caput mortuum;</hi> at pre≈øent we cannot withdraw the≈øe funds without ≈øub≈øtituting others in their place, but when halcyon days will come, then we will withdraw them; you will know that taking the≈øe funds would be leaving our own creditors di≈øappointed; this is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtent, and agreeable to our con≈øtruction, the mea≈øure is not precipitate; (other paragraphs of the report was then read.) I will not pro≈øtitute the dignity of my profe≈ø≈øion by eva≈øion, had I under≈øtood it as the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's coun≈øel, I would not have attempted to reconcile it with the con≈øtitution, or the eternal rules of ju≈øtice. I admit the intention of the ≈øtate was to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion commen≈øurate with the funds.‚ÄîBut I contend here as I did el≈øewhere, that they did not ≈øeparate the contract from the fund, nor did the ≈øtate continue to owe after they were di≈øcharged from the payment.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I contend, that when the period had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and Congre≈øs were under an efficient government, it then became nece≈ø≈øary for <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> to "modify the payment." Grant me this and it leads to all that I contend for; for it is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øhew that the funds made u≈øe of on this occa≈øion were not taken after they had been given up to Congre≈øs. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages from the 8th volume or the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Congre≈øs, page 187, to ≈øhew that the execution of the re≈øolutions were expre≈øsly ≈øu≈øpended until they ≈øhould be acceded to by every ≈øtate in the Union.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> in September 23, 1783, complied with the requi≈øition, with a provi≈øo that the Act was not to take effect until each ≈øtate in the Union had pa≈ø≈øed ≈øimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws. In page 194, <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by a long addre≈øs
<pb n="708" facs="unknown:027132_0716_0FD354E17990C930"/>
≈øympathized with Congre≈øs, and as Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øhe copied the re≈øolution into her Act, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it ≈øhould be ≈øu≈øpended until the twelve other ≈øtates ≈øhould comply with the ≈øame. Now where is the foundation for reproach? How did the ≈øtate by the Act of 1786 pa≈øs an Act which was void? No funds were taken away from Congre≈øs; no requi≈øitions were neglected; but they were anticipated. The Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's own ≈øtatements for December 6, 1786‚ÄîNo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 3, 1787, and November 4, 1788, ≈øhew that the ≈øtate complied punctually with all the requi≈øitions of Congre≈øs.</p>
                     <p>On the 27th July 1786 there remained a balance in the Trea≈øury of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> of above ≈øixty thou≈øand dollars, and the Comptroller adds, that a balance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 30,000 dollars remained due to her in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1787; not to mention the amount of indents, of which I need not take up your time to ≈øhew it; for ≈øhe always had indents enough. It is however true, there was another requi≈øition then made, but never complied with, that is, two year's intere≈øt to the foreign credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and one year's ditto to dome≈øtic creditors, who were citizens. This I will di≈ømi≈øs, as no other ≈øtate complied, the requi≈øition being unrea≈øonable.</p>
                     <p>Is <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> then criminal? ≈øhe was eminently in advance before 1786. Surely there is no rea≈øon for ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øting that the law of 1786 was void with re≈øpect to the funds. (Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> the Speaker of the Senate, interrupted Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll,</hi> and ≈øugge≈øted, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was, whether "the form of the certificates binds the ≈øtate, and if it is admitted a debt by the Act of 1786, whether it makes the obligation permanent, this ≈øtate con≈øenting by that Act to be a creditor of the Union, no doubts could preclude the creditors from their rights." Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> replied, My an≈øwer to that will be this, If I receive an obligation payable to bearer, I agree, that I am not to look farther than the face of the writing, but the≈øe certificates refer to the Act, and it is as much an intimation to the holders of the
<pb n="709" facs="unknown:027132_0717_0FD35498CEA65208"/>
nature of the contract, as if the whole Act had been tran≈øcribed and embodied into them, becau≈øe they are referred to the Act. Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate, ≈øee page 317.)</p>
                     <p>As to the ob≈øervations made re≈øpecting the minutes of Council of Feb. 3, 1785, the≈øe refer to the law of 1785, which is clearly of a temporary nature, and the law it≈øelf expre≈ø≈øes it ≈øo. It contradicts the defendant's leading principles and contends that unfunding the debt is a violation of the contract; the one cannot cea≈øe, unle≈øs the other cea≈øes; the fund and obligation mu≈øt go together; the≈øe, Sir, are ≈øome of the arguments appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Act of 1785, and yet that law ≈øpeaks a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which no ≈øophi≈øtry can confound. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the 18th ≈øection of that law, page 467.) Now, Sir, the≈øe rea≈øonings of the Supreme Executive Council de≈øtroy the idea, that contracts may exi≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out funds. I do not know why the≈øe were read unle≈øs to pa≈øs cen≈øure on the A≈ø≈øembly of 1785.</p>
                     <p>How does this agree with the rea≈øoning imputed to the A≈ø≈øembly of 1789? The funds are withdrawn, and no others are ≈øub≈øtituted; but I have ≈øaid, and it mu≈øt be again noticed, altho' they have given a rea≈øon for withdrawing the funds at March 1789, yet no rea≈øons are given for cancelling the debt, was it not for <hi>not paying</hi> the debt? A CURIOUS DEBT INDEED! It is agreed, that the funds were withdrawn, no other funds were ≈øub≈øtituted or promi≈øed, and the ≈øtate were not compellable to give any, depending altogether on will and plea≈øure, not obligatory in con≈øcience, neither moral nor political obligation, <hi>a ≈øtrange debt!</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract never to be executed cannot be a debt. This puts me in mind of <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Crambe;‚ÄîCrambe</hi> ≈øwore that he could frame a conception of a Lord-Mayor not only without his hor≈øe, gown and gold chain, but even without ≈øtatute, feature, colour, hands, head, feet, or any body, which he ≈øuppo≈øed was the <hi>ab≈øtract</hi> of a Lord-Mayor.</p>
                     <p>A certificate remains as blank paper, is it obligatory
<pb n="710" facs="unknown:027132_0718_0FD3548253EC6338"/>
becau≈øe it enables the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor to come to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General and to get back his continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? Is it a debt payable at the pre≈øent time, or at any future period? Does not a debt exi≈øt <hi>ex vi termini?</hi> Does it not imply an obligation? True it does, if "de≈øirous" or optional, a choice; yes, the law gives a choice, but it is <hi>Hob≈øon's</hi> choice, that or none, and when one ≈øays, it is not to be paid, it is in other words, ≈øaying <hi>"I am not indebted;"</hi> in name, optional; in effect, obligatory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Directs</hi> and <hi>≈øecures,"</hi>‚Äîdirecting and ≈øecuring were included in the a≈ø≈øumption, it was that and more too, the certificate it≈øelf ≈øecured the debt, as they allege, but the debt was not ≈øecured, there exi≈øted no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to provide a fund, what a≈ø≈øume a debt not paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? that is, in other words to ≈øay, that the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is not in debt.</p>
                     <p>It was attempted to di≈øtingui≈øh between princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intere≈øt, and that temporary funds only apply to intere≈øt. Does the Act ≈øhew it in this manner? Do the re≈øolutions point it out thus? hath this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance e≈øcaped the notice of the A≈ø≈øembly?‚Äî No‚ÄîBut the minutes ≈øhew that the bu≈øine≈øs was pointedly brought before them; fir≈øt, the intere≈øt was only attended to, then it was po≈øtponed, and the clau≈øe was added, every Act or Acts directing or ≈øecuring the payment of principal and intere≈øt. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the motion, page 184.) Here then the A≈ø≈øembly have brought the principal and intere≈øt fully into view, this ≈øhews the Legi≈ølature meant the principal al≈øo, as they did not de≈øign to di≈øtingui≈øh. Now as to the intere≈øt not to be perpetual, it was to be temporary, if Congre≈øs ≈øhould provide; if not, it was to be final. Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> ob≈øerved that <hi>temporary</hi> was meant to be <hi>partial;</hi> but no words are le≈øs ≈øynonymous than <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> and <hi>partial.</hi> They meant the payment of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intere≈øt until Congre≈øs ≈øhould provide.</p>
                     <p>Much reliance hath been placed on the word <hi>"many,"</hi> this word was introduced without any pointed attention,
<pb n="711" facs="unknown:027132_0719_0FD35483EA1F4B70"/>
there was no u≈øe for it, the clau≈øe fir≈øt ≈øtood without it, and regarded only the intere≈øt. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the minutes to the Act of 10th April 1792.) This was only nece≈ø≈øary as it regarded the equalizing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt and the exchange. Another rea≈øon offers for con≈øideration, this funding ≈øy≈øtem in <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> was the ≈øymbol of party, and was looked upon by ≈øome as ≈øound policy, by others it was looked upon the very rever≈øe. At the time this law pa≈ø≈øed, Congre≈øs had not begun to pa≈øs their laws, many ≈øuppo≈øed the Act of 1789 might be repealed, and of con≈øequence the law of 1785 might be revived with all the debt, of cour≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> they provided for the exchange, and with a view to get rid of the que≈øtion left the choice with the party, it being then not known what provi≈øion Congre≈øs would make.</p>
                     <p>But, the≈øe things, like general rules, have their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: Bills of credit are barred by particular Acts to come forward as contracts, which the ≈øtate cannot controul. Contracts are de≈øtroyed when the party is excu≈øed from carrying it into effect; therefore the New-Loan holders on agreeing to the Con≈øtitution of the United States, and withdrawing the funds, di≈øcharges the ≈øtate from the performance of the contract. There is no analogy between the≈øe and the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates; there they were i≈ø≈øued in collu≈øion, and not for Continental certificates; there they are not binding on that ≈øtate; rea≈øons of that kind may occur here, where the certificates are only temporary in their duration. How will the contracts of the United States ≈øtand this te≈øt? Are not the continental bills contracts? Are New-Loans contracts? Are they not continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing by exchanges? Are the bills of credit of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> to revive as contracts? The≈øe particulars ≈øhew that the principle was e≈øtabli≈øhed, and as old as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that contracts mu≈øt be abided by, and held ≈øacred, and that ≈øome of them can be controuled?</p>
                     <p>If I enter into a contract with my neighbour, and he prevents me from doing part, ≈øhall I by that be compelled to do another part? Was there ever a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance
<pb n="712" facs="unknown:027132_0720_0FD354E2F71C8540"/>
where the party is excu≈øed from carrying it into effect, if the contract remained irrevocable? The contract cea≈øes wholly, or remains altogether to be carried into effect. How were we circum≈øtanced in 1789? Why, the ≈øocial compact takes out of the hands of the ≈øtate certain funds. The New-Loan holders repre≈øented in Convention, and acquie≈øcing to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Federal Con≈øtitution, agreed to the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and excu≈øed the A≈ø≈øembly from a performance of their former agreement; and it is conceded that <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> by good faith might ≈øurrender the≈øe funds, and were under no obligation to ≈øub≈øtitute others. Is this faith? Is this ju≈øtice? Is this a good principle? Where is the ≈øub≈øtance or rea≈øon for this procedure? Why! either the funds are pledged for ever, or the contract is temporary. I mean by this, either the≈øe funds mu≈øt remain or others mu≈øt be ≈øub≈øtituted in their room.</p>
                     <p>If I had under≈øtood the Act of 1789 as contended for by the defendant, I would never have appeared here. To ≈øay that the Act of 1786 was perpetual and not temporary, and yet to ≈øay <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> may take away tho≈øe and not ≈øub≈øtitute others, is imputing to her ≈øuch fraudulent incon≈øi≈øtency, that I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
                     <p>Either the debt cea≈øed to be ≈øuch by the Act of March 1789, or the A≈ø≈øembly was bound by every principle of honour and ju≈øtice to ≈øub≈øtitute other funds immediately.</p>
                     <p>There is a ≈øhort te≈øt to try this. If the funds are taken away, the intere≈øt at your Trea≈øury is not paid half yearly. If the contract is not affected, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may always draw the intere≈øt. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate.) But they ≈øay the obligation remains; then let them turn to page 63, Act April, 1791, where they will find that the certificates come within the purpart law of that date. (Part of the law then read, and a repetition of the calculation of the parts of ≈øtock as in page 329 of this.)
<pb n="713" facs="unknown:027132_0721_0FD3545E49CCA6D8"/>
If they were evidences of debt, they were payable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Act of April 9, 1791) although it was never attempted to introduce them thereunder as redeemable. The Act for the relief of <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> only autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øes a ≈øub≈øcription of the Continental certificates in tru≈øt, in the dome≈øtic loan of Congre≈øs; and only amounts to putting her in the ≈øame ≈øituation as if ≈øhe had New-Loans. There is no analogy between this ca≈øe and that of the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina.</hi> Re-i≈ø≈øuing the paper money was for the purpo≈øe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the exchange. It is di≈øagreeable to have an obligation abroad, though it be paid. The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of New-Loan certificates naturally wi≈øhed not to exchange, as this was their intere≈øt; for ¬£. 100 in New-Loans produced 6 per cent. intere≈øt; but if exchanged it only produced 3 per cent. This of cour≈øe introduced the practice of encouraging the New-Loan holders to exchange their New-Loans for the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the preamble and ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry pa≈ø≈øages of the law of the 7th of April 1791, to enforce his arguments, that the obligation was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged although out≈øtanding, and although it was not obligatory, the ≈øtate wanted it to cea≈øe being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence, in order to have the care and cu≈øtody of her own property.)</p>
                     <p>It hath been ≈øugge≈øted, that the ≈øtate paid intere≈øt on certificates between September 1777 and March 1778, calculated on a reduced value, and charged Congre≈øs at the ≈øpecie value. Trace the circum≈øtances of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, and you will find the repealing law was founded not on affected, but real nece≈ø≈øity, and ≈øee if the period had not arrived, when the law of 1786 cea≈øed.</p>
                     <p>The grand convention ended the 17th September 1787. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> adopted the con≈øtitution the 13th December ≈øame year. The ninth ≈øtate adopted it on the 21≈øt of June 1789, and in July 1789 Congre≈øs pa≈ø≈øed a law impo≈øing duties to operate the 1≈øt of Augu≈øt; of con≈øequence, they might well ≈øay, it <hi>"would ≈øoon cea≈øe."</hi>

funds were actually taken out of their hands by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, that they did not, was the principal cau≈øe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint with the New-Loan holders.

                     <p>But, let us turn to the Act of 1786, and ≈øee what part of it will remain after the repeal.

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In addition to the ob≈øervations made by me this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, by which I have ≈øhewn that the debt was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed, a debt never to be paid principal or intere≈øt, and that this debt was not a≈ø≈øumable, nor ≈øub≈øcribable to the loan, after the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of March 27, 1789, it will be recollected that the que≈øtion for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral enquiry and con≈øideration, will be, whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the≈øe circum≈øtances was or was not this law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutional? Congre≈øs will not con≈øider the con≈øtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the law; it is a di≈øpute between the holder and the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi> She neither could nor will determine ≈øuch di≈øputes; it is ≈øufficient that they cea≈øed to be a debt; they are not a≈ø≈øumable; the defendant is unwilling to meet the que≈øtion; his coun≈øel now urge that the law is uncon≈øtitutional: It is agreed the ≈øtate might ≈øu≈øpend the payment of intere≈øt, withdraw the funds and modify the payment of the principal.</p>
                     <p>The funds were a part of the contract, they acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the credit, <hi>they induced the loan.</hi> The coun≈øel for the defendant have conceded a principle which leads to all the con≈øequences we deduce. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> can alter the terms of her contract; the principles are e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed from which they can never retrieve them≈øelves. The ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> has the ≈øame rights as a private per≈øon. My creditor pre≈øcribes an alteration on agreement; I cannot do it nor can he do it ≈øingly. If the ≈øtate authori≈øes to alter the contract, ≈øhe may
<pb n="716" facs="unknown:027132_0724_0FD354E6D6036040"/>
authori≈øe the abolition of it. Will the gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that a conference had been held between the ≈øtate of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and the holders of New-Loan certificates? The ≈øtate ≈øpeaks only by her laws, where the contract might be altered. The degree and extent of alteration mu≈øt be left at di≈øcretion, ≈øubject only to a ≈øen≈øe of right and wrong, and is therefore not a ca≈øe within the Con≈øtitution. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> read the 10th ≈øection of the fir≈øt article of the Con≈øtitution.) The New-Loans are out of the ≈øpirit and letter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of the United States; the law of 1789 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs no contract. If it is but of the reach of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it cannot be in the ≈øpirit.</p>
                     <p>Let us recollect the comments of my learned col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league from <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts</hi> (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> on the eternal principles of right and wrong obviou≈øly oppo≈øed to the principles of "perfidy," fraud and chicane, and I will not pretend to ≈øay how far it might ≈øtand in a court of judicature.</p>
                     <p>The limitation and di≈øcretion relative of ≈øuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are never to be a≈øcertained by the con≈øtitution. The Comptroller-General's own plan of finance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes a limitation that would not be con≈øonant to the con≈øtitution. Shall my creditor ≈øay, unle≈øs I call at a certain time I cannot have payment at all, this is ≈øurely more repugnant to the con≈øtitution than any thing in the Act of 1789. Congre≈øs is al≈øo re≈øtricted in the exerci≈øe of their legi≈ølative power, a variation from the original contract is propo≈øed by the Secretary of the Trea≈øury in his plan for the redemption and fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public debt, in≈øtead of whole 6 per cents. ≈øome are at 3 per cent. The ≈øame ≈øpirit of variation has induced the ≈øtrained con≈øtruction of the Act of the 10th of April 1792. The New-Loan creditors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruing the Act as we do, had applied to Congre≈øs and remon≈øtrated again≈øt the conduct of the Secretary, I do not de≈øign to ca≈øt any reflections on the Secretary, I am ≈øatisfied, he was impelled by the pure≈øt motives for the public good. To excu≈øe therefore the conduct of
<pb n="717" facs="unknown:027132_0725_0FD354B5F725B8B8"/>
an individual, which is at lea≈øt excu≈øable, ought to be our duty; but I expect to be able to ≈øhew that the New-Loan holders remon≈øtrated to Congre≈øs again≈øt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the original contract.</p>
                     <p>But it ≈øhould be remembered that the Comptroller as a member of the community, a holder of New-Loan debt, and a creditor of the United States di≈ø≈øolved in part the contract between <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> and her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors by acceding to the adoption of the con≈øtitution of the United States; he has al≈øo acted for years as a ≈øervant of the public in the execution of this very act ‚Äîno matter whether a man ≈øhews his mind from words or actions.</p>
                     <p>Augu≈øt 2, 1789, (≈øee debates of Congre≈øs, 2 vol. page 280) the New-Loan holders applied to Congre≈øs, and in ≈øtrong language they call them <hi>"our only hope."</hi> Here, Mr. Speaker, you may preceive their ≈øilence, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie≈øcence, O charming infancy! their ≈øilence fir≈øt, then their application to Congre≈øs, and all this corre≈øpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be no proof of their acquie≈øcence! Five mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars were all exchanged except fifty thou≈øand pounds. The defendant purcha≈øed of per≈øons who had waved their claims as they had acquie≈øced in the law; witne≈øs <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Oldden;</hi> by their conduct they waved it; it is therefore po≈ø≈øible they transferred their rights to the defendant, or that he derived it from them. The meaning of the law of 1789 cannot be doubted, but at any rate it is unrea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe that tho≈øe who have acted under a title for a cour≈øe of years in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity can impeach it. Is the agent at liberty to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the commi≈ø≈øion under which he had acted ≈øo long?</p>
                     <p>If, therefore, the New-Loans cea≈øed to be a debt, they were not a≈ø≈øumable, and there was no nece≈ø≈øity for the certification of the defendant. Why then did the Comptroller-General certify them <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and then recognize them as debts, and pa≈øs them as a≈ø≈øumable and redeemable? It is denied that the Comptroller-General certified New-Loans to be a≈ø≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or if he did, it was but in a few in≈øtances, not
<pb n="718" facs="unknown:027132_0726_0FD3546441CB6D48"/>
in his own ca≈øe, and not in his character as Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General. It is al≈øo ≈øaid, that it is not alleged, he certified them <hi>≈øo;</hi> that therefore the proof is in≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and the charge un≈øupported. I will ≈øhew that the articles of impeachment are ≈øufficient in ≈øub≈øtance and form, and ≈øupported by the evidence. (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the fir≈øt article.) I have given notice to the defendant's coun≈øel, that I would refer to ob≈øervations well expre≈ø≈øed by <hi>Federali≈øt,</hi> 2d vol. page 210, on the propriety of impeachments‚ÄîWhat is not criminal on an indictment is not ≈øo on an impeachment; the le≈øs certainty is requi≈øite in the latter than in the former. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying in a few in≈øtances is as really criminal as in many, although not injurious in the ≈øame degree. If he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to any, he is criminal. It hath been ≈øaid, that he is not charged in the articles, to whom he certified, whether to the Loan-officer, to a private per≈øon, or to a man in the country; he is excu≈øed by not ≈øigning officially! If the Comptroller-General, not <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon</hi> acting as ≈øuch, certified New-Loans to be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and a≈ø≈øumable, he well knew it was to the lo≈øs and ri≈øque of the commonwealth. It is ≈øaid, that he did not add the title of his office, but only the initials of his name. I am ≈øorry to find the defence of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller General re≈øting on ≈øuch flim≈øy ≈øubterfuges. Has not the ≈øub≈øcribing the initials the ≈øame effect? is not the object the ≈øame? If ≈øo, is it different whether the initials are written or the whole name? Are not the reports to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> A≈ø≈øembly ≈øigned in the ≈øame manner? And if he ≈øhould have mi≈øled them he would be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>But it hath been ≈øaid, that the evidence do not ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge, and that he did not ≈øign his own ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtract <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable:</hi> If he certified for any one it is ≈øufficiently proved. Let us examine how his own bu≈øine≈øs was managed, a long roll in his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and intended to make the ≈øame impre≈ø≈øion as if he had certified it <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable;</hi> How would Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> rea≈øon on this? Would he ≈øeparate tho≈øe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracts
<pb n="719" facs="unknown:027132_0727_0FD35465B65FD878"/>
which were certified <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable</hi> from that in the Comptroller's own hand-writing? We find ≈øome circum≈øtances in his ≈øub≈øcription of a bad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, which do not alleviate the charges, he ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed in blank in the month of June, how was this filled up? Is he to ≈øit on the watch in his office, that this blank ≈øub≈øcription continues open to the 7th or 8th of July, then the blank is filled up and the receipt anti-dated to the 30th of June? Is not this conduct mo≈øt exceptionable? Was not this done in his official capacity? If this is denied his corre≈øpondence on this ≈øubject mu≈øt be forgotten! (Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then read the letter, page 215-6; ditto page 217; ditto page 96-7; ditto page 97-8 of this work, commenting as he went along, to prove that the defendant acted in his official capacity when he certified the ab≈øtracts <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> and <hi>a≈ø≈øumable.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>It can therefore admit of no controver≈øy that the Comptroller-General acted in his official capacity, we have proved he violated the law, the excu≈øe mu≈øt come from him, if no other excu≈øe comes from them, but an error of judgment, <hi>Humanum e≈øt errare,</hi> an error of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is certainly no ground for an impeachment; but if facts are ≈øtrong, and evidence conclu≈øive, however painful it is to pronounce the ≈øentence, it is inevitable; he mu≈øt be declared guilty. We con≈øider him as acting from improper motives, and it ≈øhould be remembered that when we probe the ≈øecret motives, and fathom the ≈øentiments of the heart, truth does not appear in matters of evidence which mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily end in probability only, with that re≈øi≈øtle≈øs conviction with which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides in the mathematical ≈øciences, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it ≈øhould operate with re≈øi≈øtle≈øs force.</p>
                     <p>But if after 1789 he ≈øtates nothing of the New-Loan certificates as being a <hi>State debt,</hi> which before the pa≈ø≈øing of the Act of 1789 he uniformly and repeatedly did; if to go farther, from motives of private intere≈øt he has endeavoured to defeat the operations of a law, has taken money out of the trea≈øury upon a pretended
<pb n="720" facs="unknown:027132_0728_0FD354674FE588C8"/>
con≈øideration, then no one can he≈øitate and his guilt cannot be denied.</p>
                     <p>Did not the Comptroller-General know, that the ≈øtock of the U. S. could not i≈ø≈øue, unle≈øs the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates the counterparts of the New-Loans or an equal value was previou≈øly ≈øurrendered to the United States; Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon,</hi> the Regi≈øter-General you find, thought ≈øo. In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he repeats the ≈øame idea. I have but little to ≈øay on this point; Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> fir≈øt heard of this out of doors, and concurred in opinion with the defendant, he was never con≈øulted; he pa≈ø≈øed ≈øome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracts after he knew them to contain New-Loans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pre≈ø≈øed further, he acknowledged that he delivered one to Judge <hi>Addi≈øon</hi> in a mi≈øtake; there is no law of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> authori≈øing the ≈øurrender of the continental certificates, the whole amount would be lo≈øt as the New-Loans could not be charged again≈øt the United States.</p>
                     <p>I a≈øk how will <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> get the ≈øtock back, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume it will not be ≈øaid that the Comptroller will give it up. Suppo≈øe now an Act was to pa≈øs this ≈øe≈ø≈øion, it is too late. The accounts between the United States and the individual ≈øtates are now ≈øettled, they cannot be again opened; but it was hinted and but hinted by the Comptroller to the Regi≈øter that he had or would ≈øettle that bu≈øine≈øs with the Secretary of the Trea≈øury of the United States. What! and no law on the ≈øubject! The ≈øub≈øcription was prevented by the interpo≈øition of the Governor. Had the ≈øub≈øcription of the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates been received, not only the difference between the ≈øtock and 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. in the pound would have been a gain to the Comptroller-General, but the whole ≈øum of 65,000 dollars ≈øub≈øcribed, would be a lo≈øs to the commonwealth; and this was well known to the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>But it is a≈øked, why not pay 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. in the pound? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer for many rea≈øons‚Äî1. the New-Loans were not a ≈øtate debt. 2. It was a debt of Congre≈øs. 3. If Congre≈øs deviated from their contract, we ought not to ≈øuffer, nor
<pb n="721" facs="unknown:027132_0729_0FD3282CCB755D68"/>
ought their creditors to trouble us, when Congre≈øs was ready to pay them? there was a time when they might have had more than 20<g ref="char:shilling"> É</g>. in the pound from Congre≈øs. 4. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> had ≈øaid ≈øhe would not pay them, and it is hard and humiliating that the Comptroller ≈øhould controul the A≈ø≈øembly. And 5. Becau≈øe Congre≈øs did not intend to a≈ø≈øume any certificates but what had i≈ø≈øued for ≈øervices or ≈øupplies towards the pro≈øecution of the late war, and the defence of the United States; and the New-Loan certificates are not charged by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller in the account.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid, the A≈ø≈øembly is not to deal in ≈øtock‚Äî This is a mi≈øtaken idea of the dignity of government; I conceive that even the difference between the value of ≈øtock is not unworthy of Legi≈ølative interpo≈øition; that Legi≈ølature which di≈øpo≈øes of a ≈øingle dollar but to what it thinks to the be≈øt advantage of the public weal, betrays the tru≈øt of its con≈øtituents, whether it be ≈øtock or ca≈øh, property of one ≈øpecies or another. We are now on ≈øure ground, our Trea≈øury is full and overflowing, but there are difficult times in view, and probably the time is not far di≈øtant when we may want every ≈øhilling, and all our re≈øources may be required to ≈øave the ≈øtate from further taxes.</p>
                     <p>I will take the liberty to draw the attention of the Senate to the ≈øtatement made by the defendant in 1788, this mentions the New-Loan debt. <hi>That</hi> being the year preceding the annihilating Act; but from the year 1789 the Legi≈ølature and Comptroller concur that the New-Loans were no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt; whereas they were a part of the ≈øtate debt the year before. Whatever may be ≈øaid of the views or the objects of the committee on ways and means, the duty of the Comptroller-General was as much to lay the ≈øame ≈øtatements before the A≈ø≈øembly after the Act of 1789 as it was before, except ≈øo far as the ≈øame was varied by the repeal. On the 4th of November 1788, in the Comptroller's ≈øtatement, page 7, we have the following entry:‚Äî</p>

                        <p>In his ≈øtatement, November 4, 1787, he mentions the New-Loan debt, but we find no charge of this debt in the ≈øtatement of the finances from this officer to the year 1790‚ÄîThen the Governor in his ≈øpeech to the Legi≈ølature, page 43, December 28, gives a ≈øtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is not confined to demands requiring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment, but for all the debts for which the ≈øtate ≈øtands pledged, and mentions <hi>"balance of intere≈øt on the New-Loan certificates."</hi> Here can be no pretence, the whole aggregate of the debts of the commonwealth and only the <hi>balance of intere≈øt on the New-Loan debt.</hi> Where is the defendant's letter to the Governor inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his mi≈øtake? This ≈øuppo≈øes his acquie≈øcence as he did not contradict it; but in a few days after the Comptroller made his report to the A≈ø≈øembly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fir≈øt A≈ø≈øembly under the con≈øtitution, he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated all the debts and gave a hi≈øtory of the finances; if the Governor had made a mi≈øtake was it not the Comptroller-General's duty to rectify it? In page 389 of the minutes, the New-Loans are ≈øtated expre≈øsly as excluded from redemption, except for the purpo≈øe of being re-exchanged; the Comptroller does not think it of importance to ≈øtate what quantity had been re-exchanged, becau≈øe he did not con≈øider the ≈øtate as liable for them.</p>
                        <p>The Legi≈ølature could not ≈øuppo≈øe that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller thought the law of 1789 to be void, or the law

of 1786 to be in force, except as to the funds, as he mentions all the items, funded, unfunded, &amp;c.‚Äîand yet with regard to the New-Loan certificates, he ≈øtates them as excluded from redemption, except the arrears of intere≈øt.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th of February 1791 the committee on ways and means reported a ≈øtatement of all the debts of the commonwealth, in which they mention all the <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>demands,</hi> an univer≈øal expre≈ø≈øion embracing every ≈øpecies of debt; yet where that is expre≈ø≈øed, neither the committee nor the Legi≈ølature con≈øider the New-Loans as included. The Comptroller-General mu≈øt have been acquainted with the Governor's ≈øtatement in December 1790; and with the report abovementioned in February 1791; and if he differs in his ≈øtatement therefrom, it is a proof that we are right. On the 30th of November 1791 there was a joint report of Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Donnald≈øon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Febiger,</hi> upon a reference to which <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> proceeded when ≈øhe prepared the law of the 10th of April 1792. (See appendix to the minutes of that year, the la≈øt page but one.) Here all the claims again≈øt the commonwealth are enumerated, and only the balance of intere≈øt on the New-Loan debt. If we are not determined again≈øt conviction, we mu≈øt believe this to be the true ≈øtate of the ca≈øe.</p>
                        <p>I confe≈øs for my own part I am at a lo≈øs to think how language could be le≈øs doubtful and more plain or explicit. A very long cour≈øe of corre≈øpondence was brought forward to ≈øhew, that whether ill or well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Comptroller thought them ≈øub≈øcribable in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1791; what circum≈øtances might have induced a change, I cannot tell, ≈øufficient it is that they were not mentioned the 30th November 1790.

                        <p>I will di≈ømi≈øs this ≈øubject with a few remarks on the conference. Perhaps the attention of the Governor and fi≈øcal officers were never called to the point becau≈øe
<pb n="724" facs="unknown:027132_0732_0FD3282E34413E38"/>
no New-Loans were ≈øub≈øcribed under the fir≈øt loan; under this Act then, the que≈øtion was not fairly litigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as none were ≈øub≈øcribed. True it is, that the Comptroller in ≈øome conver≈øations ≈øpoke of them as being a≈ø≈øumable, but it is ≈øufficient to ob≈øerve that had he communicated the Act of 1789 to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his mind would have been clear, and all his doubts would be ≈øolved. He never ≈øugge≈øted to any body, neither in writing nor conver≈øation, that the New-Loans were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                        <p>He had ≈øome conver≈øation with Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> in which he ≈øtated that the ≈øtock was to be ≈øold; but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him that the New-Loans were redeemable. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ≈øays he went no farther than to ≈øay the Act included unfunded depreciation, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they were ≈øub≈øcribed, he was ≈øurpri≈øed. This ≈øhews he de≈øigned to ≈øhelter him≈øelf under the letter of the law, contrary to what he knew to be the de≈øign of the Legi≈ølature.</p>
                        <p>Surprizing, that when he he≈øitated about the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaton certificates, he did not he≈øitate about the New-Loans! I will di≈ømi≈øs this point, and proceed to the charge which concerns‚ÄîWITHDRAWING MONEY FROM THE TREASURY WITHOUT A PREVIOUS APPROPRIATION, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This is proved beyond all po≈ø≈øibility of controver≈øy, the corre≈øpondence between the Comptroller-General and the Governor re≈øpecting the debt to be redeemed, and the ≈øtock to be ≈øold prove this, for he furni≈øhes an e≈øtimate of the whole; here he prevaricates, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called upon in a general manner he an≈øwers in a re≈øtricted ≈øen≈øe, ≈øurely it was his duty to render a ju≈øt ≈øtatement, but that rendered by him was covert and deceitful, the Governor's proclamation of the 16th of May 1792, which had been ≈øhewn to the Comptroller-General, founded on his e≈øtimate which enumerated the debts to be redeemed by the Act of 1792, and his not mentioning the error, is a proof that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ≈øtatement to be right.</p>

(Mr. <hi>Inger≈øoll</hi> then turned to the Act page 219) when there are ≈øeveral funds in the ≈øame Act, it is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øpecify the fund, but when there is but one fund, the practice is only to certify payable under ≈øuch or ≈øuch an Act.

                        <p>Here, Sir, as in the con≈øideration of the article ju≈øt pa≈øt, are no circum≈øtances to rai≈øe a doubt, no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to uncon≈øtitutionality under the ma≈øk of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm.

Whenever the holder was willing to ≈øurrender to the commonwealth, the Comptroller-General could not deem it improper. When he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the tru≈øt he knew the terms of it; he was bound to do it under all the ties and ≈øolemnities of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. What are the facts?

                        <p>Purcha≈øes in the market would in a degree interfere with the ultimate de≈øign of his agency. This perhaps would be carrying the rule too far.

The property was ve≈øted in the ≈øtate on its delivery to the Comptroller-General; neither party could be off, the indents being tendered or not could make no odds, while the price was uncertain no per≈øon could tell what he had to tender, until the Continental were brought out and the intere≈øt calculated, when they were returned, they were to be cancelled. It was not nece≈ø≈øary to pay the indents to complete the exchange and to ve≈øt the property in the commonwealth.

It claims peculiar attention, as it confirms one of the mo≈øt ≈øerious charges, in which the official delinquency is aggravated by the extreme confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence repo≈øed by the ≈øtate in the defendant.</p>
                     <p>I mu≈øt recal the attention of the Senate to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the preliminary introduction of this bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs by the learned manager, in which it had been ≈øtated from the New-Loan book A, (page 129,) that three certificates, No. 4,151, for ¬£. 11:16:0; No. 4,152, for ¬£. 268:0:0; and No. 4,153, for ¬£. 242:7:6, were i≈ø≈øued by the Comptroller-General under the Act of March 1786, in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the book of Continental certificates received in exchange for New-Loans (page 230) it appears that ≈øundry Continental certificates were received in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for them, agreeing exactly with the total amount of the three former certificates.</p>
                     <p>It appears by the certificate of the Regi≈øter of the Trea≈øury of the United States, dated March 4, 1794, that the Comptroller-General ≈øub≈øcribed each of tho≈øe identical certificates and individual numbers for, and in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> It likewi≈øe appears from the large ab≈øtract, No. 262, that the≈øe identical New-Loan certificates were ≈øub≈øcribed by Mr. <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> for his own u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>It therefore followed from the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øion, that the property of the ≈øtate had been violated, that as ≈øhe mu≈øt have a property either in the New-Loans emitted, or in the Continental certificates received, as it never could be in <hi>abeyance,</hi> but if it cea≈øes in the one, it mu≈øt at the ≈øame time commence in the other. Either her New-Loans or her Continental certificates had been converted to private purpo≈øes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="731" facs="unknown:027132_0739_0FD35470820E0FE0"/>Time has been applied for and granted, and I tru≈øt the Senate will ≈øee, that the depo≈øition of <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> will be found to clear up the depo≈øition, and to prove not how far the defendant is innocent, but in what manner he is guilty. It will be proved beyond a controver≈øy, not that neither of them were the property of the commonwealth, but that the New-Loans were. That they were ≈øo rendered by an Act which he could only have performed by being Comptroller-General; it will be ≈øhewn, that preci≈øely in the terms of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth article of impeachment, her New-Loans have been fraudulently converted by the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to his own private u≈øe and emolument.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt, By depo≈øiting Continental certificates under the Act of March 1786, the ≈øtate acquired a qualified property in them‚Äî1. For ≈øafe-keeping. 2. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive indents, this property might become ab≈øolute by the holders of New-Loans purcha≈øing lands.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, After the 27th of March 1789 the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of New-Loans had a right to, and acquired a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the identical Continental certificates depo≈øited by them. But this was not always practicable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the practice of exchanging, con≈øolidating or cutting up certificates. To remedy, therefore, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, other certificates, as the ≈øtate had a large ≈øhare of her own, were allowed to be returned in ≈øuch ca≈øes. This was implied by the Act of March 27, 1789. Like optional powers were given in the in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Supreme Executive Council, (≈øee page 267) and by an Act of the fir≈øt of April 1790. But where the New-Loans originally i≈ø≈øued, and continued the ≈øame, where the Continental certificates originally depo≈øited had not been delivered out to others, and where one remained to meet the other, the law and the in≈øtructions required the exchange to be ≈øpecific; and it will not be di≈øputed that where there exi≈øted no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of giving others, the Comptroller-General was to give the ≈øame, and no fair purpo≈øe could be an≈øwered by making it otherwi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="732" facs="unknown:027132_0740_0FD354D0993D9FC8"/>In the pre≈øent in≈øtance they corre≈øpond preci≈øely; the original certificates i≈ø≈øued by the United States were depo≈øited by <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> He <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had received New-Loan certificates in lieu of them. I tru≈øt then, there can be no doubt under this point of view, but the New-Loan certificates became the property of the commonwealth. (The an≈øwers to the 1≈øt and 2d interrogatories were then read.) If a commutation had been meditated it could be done immediately; How then is this commutation effected? <hi>An≈ø.</hi> The Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General takes the identical continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which were depo≈øited with the ≈øtate, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her coffers, and ≈øub≈øcribed them in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> Then, Sir, this was an <hi>unlawful</hi> or a <hi>lawful</hi> act. If it was intended to be ≈øub≈øcribed for his own u≈øe, and not with a view to effectuate the re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which <hi>Hamilton</hi> de≈øired, it was an unlawful and attrocious depredation of public property.</p>
                     <p>His coun≈øel deny this.‚Äî</p>
                     <p>Then it was lawful; it was done as Comptroller-General, regularly, officially and con≈øi≈øtently with his duty, to effectuate the exchange, as the obliging friend of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> and the public ≈øervant of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then what was the legal re≈øult? <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> The New-Loans being thus ≈øatisfied by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                        </gap> parties receiving the original continental certificates in the form of funded debt, became again the <hi>property</hi> of <hi>Penn≈øylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This would have been the re≈øult if only the value or amount in other certificates had been ≈øub≈øcribed, but when the ≈øame continental certificates originally loaned are ≈øub≈øcribed, and that too, after the holders come down to exchange them, and when the Comptroller-General was in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the New-Loans. (The an≈øwer to the 1≈øt interrogatory then read.) This an≈øwer ≈øhews that tran≈øaction was ≈øo viewed by <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> him≈øelf, he viewed no private bargain to ve≈øt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his New-Loans in <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> and not in the commonwealth. He con≈øidered it as the effectuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="733" facs="unknown:027132_0741_0FD3547277424938"/>
the exchange, under the law of 1789, which he had not time to carry thro' him≈øelf, and little did he, or would any other plain and un≈økilful man conceive the mon≈øtrous idea that by delivering up the property of the ≈øtate, a property in the New-Loans could be acquired by the officer.</p>
                     <p>This appears not to have occured to the Comptroller-General until April 1792. If then the property depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øited by <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> actually belongs to the ≈øtate, it cannot be the property of <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi>‚ÄîWhat! my ≈øervant to take my property for the purpo≈øe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of my engagements, and then allege it belongs to him? Notwith≈øtanding all the technical difficulties of the ≈øtatute of frauds, if my money is employed to buy a hou≈øe it belongs to me altho' the deed may be in my agent's name; then mo≈øt a≈ø≈øuredly the property in the certificates in que≈øtion is in the ≈øtate. As an agent he received them from <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> but as Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, as depo≈øitory of the commonwealth he ≈øub≈øcribed them; or if it is admitted that his ≈øub≈øcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Comptroller-General was illegal, he exchanged them as Comptroller-General, and ≈øub≈øcribed them as the friendly agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> We are not to be entangled by the acts of the Comptroller-General, he is not to be the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> whil≈øt he is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Comptroller-General of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> this double a≈ø≈øumption of qualities is improper, but it was only as Comptroller-General he had acce≈øs to the certificates, and the Comptroller-General was very remi≈øs indeed, if he permitted the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> to put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the public coffers of the ≈øtate; in relation to the New-Loans he cea≈øed to be the private agent as ≈øoon as the continental certificates were ≈øub≈øcribed, for if <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had no more right, his agent had not, he had no other duties to perform in regard to them than as Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>What are his duties and powers? They are defined in the Act of the 1≈øt April 1790. It was his duty to deliver them over to the Trea≈øurer to be cancelled; as
<pb n="734" facs="unknown:027132_0742_0FD354D1D23C3A68"/>
Comptroller-General, he had no power but to deliver them over for the above purpo≈øe; what has he done? They remain with him till, April 1792, when <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> came to town and applied to his agent for the funded debt. (The defendant's 3d interrogatory and an≈øwer then read) I will not a≈øk, Sir, why during this interval, the New-Loans were depo≈øited with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, after the continental certificates had been funded and were not delivered to be cancelled, why the indents were not adju≈øted, nor in ≈øhort, why he did not perform his official duty in re≈øpect to them. The New-Loans, as well as the funded ≈øtock remained in his hands during this period; he confirms the tran≈øac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by receiving the intere≈øt; the continental certificates had been taken out of the trunk of the Comptroller-General‚Äîtwo things were then done.‚Äî1. <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> lo≈øt his right to the New-Loans.‚Äî2. <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> lo≈øt her continental certificates.‚ÄîWhat did <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> receive? Funded ≈øtock. What did the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth receive? A blank.</p>
                     <p>(Seventh article then read.) I ≈øay, this te≈øtimony is fuller than that of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan. Hans Hamilton</hi> is an hone≈øt man; but we find the depo≈øition turns out different from what they expected. I do not find that they prevailed in obtaining an expo≈øition to their mind. An≈øwers come out which the defendant did not expect. In all his interrogatories to the deponent, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing of <hi>an agent</hi>‚Äîhe mentioned an <hi>obligation</hi>‚Äî and what became of it? Yet we find that <hi>Hamilton</hi> calls it an agency. <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had an≈øwered hone≈øtly. The <hi>exparte</hi> depo≈øition did not corrupt him. All his an≈øwers fully confirm the charge, and come literally within the ≈øeventh article. I will add no more; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doubts may be entertained el≈øewhere, here are no judicial ≈øpeculations;‚ÄîActs of A≈ø≈øembly have been violated‚Äîthe law is clear‚Äîand the facts are well ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ro≈øe in reply, and ≈øaid,</p>
                     <p>I AM glad the coun≈øel who ≈øpoke la≈øt hath not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barra≈ø≈øed
<pb n="735" facs="unknown:027132_0743_0FD354ECC2F0A7B0"/>
the que≈øtion to bring us to an≈øwer a charge brought again≈øt us by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives. There is a way of attempting a thing, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it in a gentle manner, when a man is willing to ≈øtrike. I will leave it to the Senate whether the hint that is intended for the defendant, is worthy of tho≈øe who brought it forward. Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon's</hi> conduct has ever been open and manly, and he mu≈øt be acquitted of any de≈øign derogatory of that character.</p>
                     <p>Then I take the que≈øtion ≈øolemnly to be, whether Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> acted in the line of his official duty, and whether he received tho≈øe certificates from <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> for the purpo≈øe of being exchanged? I take this to be a naked que≈øtion of fact. I agree that a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may act in two capacities. It hath been ≈øaid that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> acted in two capacities. Was he le≈øs ≈øedulous for acting in the two-fold capacity of <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol≈øon,</hi> and Comptroller-General? That he acted for <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> as <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> and not as Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, and his doing or acting as agent for <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> could not become a crime as <hi>Comptroller-General;</hi> no man could be prevented from acting as an agent for another unle≈øs re≈øtrained by po≈øitive laws. While he acted as Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> he is not liable to impeachment, I call upon the gentlemen to ≈øtate where he acted as Comptroller-General in this affair? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider it was lawful for him to act as a private citizen, without being impeachable before this honorable tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. I will not take the time to run over the an≈øwers of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> he did not act in his official capacity, but he had been friendly, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> ≈øaid, "all I want is ≈øtock of the United States, I leave the≈øe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates with you for that purpo≈øe," while he acted as Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> he is not liable to impeachment, I will take it for granted that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> was the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> even, I will take it for granted, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> was mi≈øtaken‚Äî≈øo far I take it for granted, that he has paid <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> what <hi>Hamilton</hi> wi≈øhed to have; by lodging tho≈øe very certificates with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                        <pb n="736" facs="unknown:027132_0744_0FD354EEE8489770"/>
the continental Loan-officer, which <hi>Hamilton</hi> afterwards received. Here then is the candor of the defendant. Nay more, he received double the amount; and, here is venality charged again≈øt him in profu≈øion! This does not favour their arguments, that he u≈øed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates improperly, but it is what the logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians call a <hi>non ≈øequitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He applied to Mr. Nichol≈øon as a friend not as an officer; does he come to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> and ≈øay, I wi≈øh to unite the characters of Agent and Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral? No, Sir, he negatives all official communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.‚ÄîBut again the gentlemen ≈øay, how could the Comptroller be in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion?</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen them≈øelves have ≈øtated, that it was not e≈ø≈øential to have the very identical ones, and the laws and in≈øtructions point out that their co-relatives could not always be at hand, that the practice was otherwi≈øe, at which many were much agitated, nay, offended, becau≈øe they could not have their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to them.</p>
                     <p>I mu≈øt beg the indulgence of the Senate, whil≈øt I'll ob≈øerve, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> was a holder of New-Loans to a con≈øiderable amount, why then as it is agreed that it is a ≈øpecies of criminality, if a doubt remains re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the≈øe certificates, Why does not the doubt operate in favour of the defendant? Why not pre≈øume him innocent in ≈øome of the≈øe in≈øtances? Why not pre≈øume, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> obtained them ≈øome other way, by ≈øome exchange, or purcha≈øe of ≈øome other per≈øon? In either ca≈øe Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> is far from guilt. Does <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> ≈øay his continental certificates were returned? No.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen have a≈ø≈øumed the ba≈øis and rea≈øoned ingenuou≈øly and ≈øubtilly that the≈øe continental certificates were in the coffers of the ≈øtate, they have not trod ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly on the Act of 1786; but let them not collect cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality from ≈øurmi≈øes, let them prove it, if the fact is capable of proof; that it was the property of <hi>Penn≈øyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> at that time, then one of two things mu≈øt be the
<pb n="737" facs="unknown:027132_0745_0FD328300EF49530"/>
con≈øequence, either it follows that the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was exce≈ø≈øively blameable by affecting to act as Comptroller-General; but in the mean time made u≈øe of his official advantages, and acted ≈øo as to be highly criminal.‚ÄîOr that di≈ørobing him≈øelf of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, intruded his ra≈øh and ≈øacrilegious hands into the coffers of the ≈øtate! One or the other of the≈øe mu≈øt be the ca≈øe!</p>
                     <p>Has the pro≈øecution altogether re≈øted with the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller-General? Have they a right to impeach the Comptroller and not to arraign <hi>Hans Hamilton?</hi> Do they not con≈øider him charged? The evidence being that the tran≈øaction was of a private nature, and that he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> Where the Senate can make a favourable con≈øtruction it is their duty nay it is not only their duty, but it is agreeable to their ≈øen≈øations. But when it appears from <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> depo≈øitions, that no continental certificates were ever delivered to him, how is the inference to be drawn without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes to ≈øupport it? But the ca≈øe ≈øtands ≈øimply thus, We are charged with taking the New-Loan certificates of the ≈øtate which had been exchanged by the ≈øtate and applying them to our u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>What is the proof? Is there a particle of evidence in <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> depo≈øition to ≈øhew that the≈øe were ever exchanged? <hi>No.</hi> Is there even a ≈øhadow of proof to ≈øhew that they had ever been pre≈øented for ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to the ≈øtate? <hi>No. Hans Hamilton</hi> did not do it as he tells you upon oath, nor did he direct it to be done, and <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> te≈øtimony is full and clear in our favour: Here we might re≈øt the cau≈øe without replying to any charges not in the impeachment.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid, if this was not done, we mu≈øt have taken the continental certificates, for which the≈øe had originally been loaned, for that, on turning to the book of continental certificates loaned which we have kept, and the ab≈øtract of continental certificates in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øury office of the United States and comparing the one with the other, they agree in dates and ≈øums, altho'
<pb n="738" facs="unknown:027132_0746_0FD354F1D49D11B0"/>
we are not bound to reply to this a≈øper≈øion until we are charged by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives with <hi>≈øeque≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring continental certificates the property of the ≈øtate,</hi> yet I will ob≈øerve, 1. That to this compari≈øon of dates and ≈øums ≈øhould be added another book, that of their re-exchange, whereby the ≈øtate became dive≈øted of the≈øe continental certificates; here, you will find exchanges entered which were made for Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øponding in dates and intere≈øt as ≈øufficient to identify the re-exchange, as the former doth the exchange; for the dates of intere≈øt, their amounts, and numbers are all that were recorded in either ca≈øe, in the≈øe books which were directed in their form, by, and occa≈øionally ≈øubmitted to the Supreme Executive Council. Nor is this all, there are other exchanges the ≈øums and dates of intere≈øt of which would apply to the≈øe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> might have bought them of others, who had previou≈øly exchanged them, but it is difficult to account for any tran≈øaction without a motive, and here there was no motive of intere≈øt to urge the Comptroller to lay his hands on the≈øe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, the property of the ≈øtate, they were no better than a like amount of any other ≈øuch continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, and yet he was obliged to account for every dollar of the≈øe certificates in his hands, and pay over to the State-Trea≈øurer ≈øuch amounts as were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, ≈øo that, as the ≈øtate could not lo≈øe on the one hand he being re≈øpon≈øible, ≈øo neither could he have gained on the other.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly. If it ≈øhould be imputed to us that we have dealt unfairly by <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> for our conduct will bear the te≈øt in every view, either as an officer, or as an individual, we ≈øhew clearly from his te≈øtimony, that he was fully ≈øatisfied and hath got what he a≈øked for, the certificates he thus wanted and received from Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> were not granted by the Comptroller-General, but by the United States. In this tran≈øaction therefore, we not only did not act officially, but the bu≈øine≈øs was not
<pb n="739" facs="unknown:027132_0747_0FD3549A383A5920"/>
to be tran≈øacted at all in the office where the mal-practice is charged.</p>
                     <p>In conclu≈øion I be≈øeech the Senate to con≈øider, that mi≈øerable and wretched indeed mu≈øt be the condition of officers it impeachments can be found where there is no offence again≈øt the law. A book of high e≈øtimation ≈øays, NO LAW, NO TRANSGRESSION.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> ro≈øe, and replied‚Äî</p>
                     <p>I DO not wonder that the Comptroller-General ≈øhould be defended with ≈øo much ingenuity, and I am willing to ju≈øtify his coun≈øel for combining every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary qualification and in ≈øelecting all the pathetic pa≈ø≈øages; and am al≈øo willing to do ju≈øtice to my own feelings at the expence of my judgment; for I think we have nothing to do with the la≈øt, but I will leave him to that ≈øingle plank oh which he is to be ≈øaved from total ruin. There is but one main argument, and that is, Who is impeached? and whether the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller is of a moral or a civil ≈øpecies of exi≈øtence? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ≈øpecies of offence is committed by the man; yes, by the man who holds the office. How then is a line to be drawn, between the man and the officer? The man has offended, and the officer is innocent! One of tho≈øe offences come in virtue of his holding the office, therefore it did not become him to purcha≈øe. If he had been a private individual, another tribunal would be the proper one, and as ≈øuch he could not be entitled to ≈øuch a ≈øolemn trial as the pre≈øent. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then

read ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages from 2 <hi>Woodi≈øon,</hi> page 602.) Here the Lord-Chancellor of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was found guilty of bribery, one of the mo≈øt exalted judges; agreeably to the arguments of the learned coun≈øel for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, he ≈øhould not be impeached as Lord-Chancellor, but as a man. If Judges, if Privy-Coun≈øellors and a Lord-Chancellor‚Äîand he too, a confidential advi≈øer of his ≈øovereign, is impeached, and the≈øe circum≈øtances are not unlike the pre≈øent, how much more proper it mu≈øt be here, where trials by impeachment are embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died into our Con≈øtitution. When Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> was applied to officially, he an≈øwered, that he applied pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to be his agent. Had he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> to make the exchange, he would no doubt have done it; there is no law on this ≈øubject, it would be a whole≈øome thing to make a law for ≈øuch a purpo≈øe. It would ea≈øe a great deal of this embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra≈ø≈øment.</p>
                     <p>But it is ≈øaid that as a private man, Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> is not liable to impeachment. That remains unproved. It is not to be pre≈øumed that he acquired a right by any ≈øub≈øequent tran≈øaction;‚Äîwe have no light to guide us in the≈øe particulars, but <hi>Hamilton</hi> employed <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> his agent‚Äîit was for his u≈øe and for his benefit;‚ÄîMr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> made u≈øe of his naked authority as an agent. Hence the offence of acting as Comptroller-General for the commonwealth, and acting as agent for <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is inferred.</p>
                     <p>Let us now put this in the mo≈øt favorable point of view, and admit, that Mr. <hi>Nichol≈øon</hi> owned the≈øe New-Loan certificates, or that he purcha≈øed them before they had been owned by <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> If he tran≈øacted the bu≈øine≈øs which he afterwards did, laying <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> entirely out of the que≈øtion, ≈øtill the heavy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges remain. Let us then hear no more of <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> let us infer from no pre≈øumption; we will take <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> te≈øtimony and the official tran≈øaction. The gentleman hath ≈øugge≈øted nothing to prove that
<pb n="743" facs="unknown:027132_0751_0FD354F80605AFE0"/>
the Continental certificates were out and cea≈øed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the property of the ≈øtate in September 1791.</p>
                     <p>A ≈øingular and romantic co-incidence of ≈øums and dates, that it ≈øhould again have come round, the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Continental certificates were the property of the commonwealth in 1786, and of <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> in 1791. We have proved that they were depo≈øited in 1786; then if once in the cu≈øtody of the ≈øtate, on whom is it incumbent to ≈øhew, that they did not remain ≈øo? From whom is the information to come? From none, but from him≈øelf!</p>
                     <p>Are we then under all the≈øe circum≈øtances to prove that they remained in the cu≈øtody of the ≈øtate? It is not by the aid of pre≈øumption, not by getting a ≈øtride of probability and galloping off, that we prove this. But we are told by <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> that they were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. But it is ≈øaid, that exchange may inadvertently be taken for commutation, that in any dictionary you would find them convertible terms, and that their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is the ≈øame. Take it either way it is ≈øub≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the ≈øame: By that exchange it was to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Comptroller-General into debt of the United States. Let us ≈øuppo≈øe it either way, let us ≈øuppo≈øe it to be converted to ≈øtock of the United States pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viou≈øly ≈øub≈øcribed. Then the charge remains, the form is only altered, the offence is the ≈øame, the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates are purcha≈øed of <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> but to have it as the te≈øtimony runs, there is an exchange in view, this gentleman is the agent, and agreeably to the exi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws he tran≈øacts the bu≈øine≈øs which no man in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øylvania</hi> could do but the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>One more word about pre≈øumption, and that is, in favour of innocence. They ≈øay, <hi>"Why do you not prove him criminal?"</hi> We deem it fully ≈øo. Here is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ngful depredation of property. He is not to ≈øay, the charge is not ≈øupported by pre≈øumption without te≈øtimony, as pre≈øumption is di≈øregarded in dealings. There is no circum≈øtances in this tran≈øaction which I do not conceive of importance. Whether the
<pb n="744" facs="unknown:027132_0752_0FD354A790B65200"/>
certificates with which he is charged were more or le≈øs than tho≈øe brought to him for the purpo≈øe of being exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is ≈øufficient for us that he is charged with tho≈øe, the tran≈øactions are traced and the accu≈øation is proved, the≈øe bloody and my≈øterious volumes of arbitrary and let our proof be oppo≈øed to his matter of defence. It is not to be con≈øidered that he did ≈øo with all others.</p>
                     <p>I will detain the Senate no longer, I have concluded my arguments‚Äîthe gentleman has advanced the ca≈øe of lord <hi>Strafford</hi>‚ÄîHow is that like the pre≈øent ca≈øe? What analogy? He was one of the mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhed and amiable of men without an imputation of vice; Is it upon con≈øtruction of municipal laws which are not generally known that the pre≈øent impeachment is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is this a law concealed, is it a law unknown, as <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> trea≈øons? No, we have this law in our nature, it is a monitor, which no man can e≈øcape, as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it, <hi>Lex.non ≈øcripta, ≈øed nata, quam non didicimus, ≈øed accepimus</hi>‚Äînot received at ≈øchool, but grew with life, again≈øt that law there is no ≈øtatute. It is in po≈øitive te≈øtimony that the Comptroller-General had offended, and I appeal to this honorable court, that were there no other charge again≈øt him, and all other accu≈øations for the injured intere≈øt of the commonwealth done away, he ought to be held up as a public example, that no ≈øtation in life ≈øhall deter the hands of ju≈øtice, nor no labours will be ≈øpared, that others may be deterred from violating her tru≈øts in ≈øimilar ≈øtations, and that the virtue and integrity of this republic will not bear official treachery.</p>

                     <p>"AT the time of the ≈øaid re≈øolution being agreed to, the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> ≈øtood impeached by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, <hi>in their name, and in that of all the People of Penn≈øylvania,</hi> of certain high crimes and mi≈ødemeanors in the di≈øcharge of his official duties; and as no judgment had been rendered, the ≈øaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was ≈øtill depending, and within the power of the Senate: We therefore con≈øider the adoption of the re≈øolution at that time as an infraction of the law, no le≈øs oppre≈ø≈øive to the defendant than dangerous to the ≈øecurity of individuals; as derogatory to the ju≈øtice and dignity of this Hou≈øe, and as highly di≈øre≈øpectful to the Senate and Governor of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"As an infraction of the law, no le≈øs oppre≈ø≈øive to the defendant than dangerous to the ≈øecurity of individuals,</hi> becau≈øe their ≈øafety and ≈øecurity depend on the pure and impartial admini≈øtration of ju≈øtice; and every thing which has a tendency to prejudice the public mind or to bias the Judges while a cau≈øe is depending, poi≈øons the ≈øprings of ju≈øtice, warps their ≈øteady and even cour≈øe, and undermines the mo≈øt valuable bulwark of ≈øecurity, which innocence can have. Hence it is that all publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, touching a cau≈øe depending, which are calculated to give a bias either way, are highly criminal.</p>
                     <p>"If anonymous publications are con≈øidered as of this dangerous tendency, we conceive that a ≈øolemn vote by the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, <hi>"in their name, and in that of all the people of Penn≈øyvania,"</hi> mu≈øt be of a tendency equally dangerous. It is true, it may not have all the intended effect, yet ≈øince that is owing to the virtue and firmne≈øs of others, it affords no apology for the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ≈øuch a mea≈øure. Whatever might be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, its tendency certainly was to prejudice the public mind while a pro≈øecution was depending, and to bear down and oppre≈øs the accu≈øed, by a≈ø≈øailing the minds of his judges with all the weight and influence of the mo≈øt numerous branch of the Legi≈ølature; and, as if this was really intended, care was taken to introduce

the re≈øolution, with a declaration that <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> had, by conduct unworthy of his tru≈øt, forfeited and lo≈øt the confidence of the citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania;</hi> thereby rendering it highly improper that he ≈øhould any longer continue to enjoy any office of tru≈øt or profit in this commonwealth. As publications of this nature by an individual, while a pro≈øecution was depending, would be highly criminal; and as the Hou≈øe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives had fulfilled their con≈øtitutional duty by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching and pro≈øecuting the Comptroller; and as it remained for the ≈øenate to di≈øcharge their con≈øtitutional duty by determining on that impeachment, and for the Governor to di≈øcharge his con≈øtitutional duty by di≈øplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Comptroller, or continuing him in office, at lea≈øt till judgment ≈øhould be given by the Senate, we can conceive no apology for pa≈ø≈øing the re≈øolution at that time. For the≈øe rea≈øons we cannot but con≈øider the re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as an infraction of the law, no le≈øs oppre≈ø≈øive to the accu≈øed than danegerous to the ≈øecurity of others.</p>
                     <p>"We al≈øo con≈øider it as derogatory to the ju≈øtice and dignity of this Hou≈øe. Derogatory to its ju≈øtice for the rea≈øons already mentioned; and to its dignity, from the ardor and precipitancy with which it was hurried through the Hou≈øe. We ≈øay ardor and precepitancy, becau≈øe, during the debate, a communication was received by the Speaker, from the Clerk of the Senate, that on the next day judgment on the impeachment would be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet without waiting even till the me≈ø≈øage was read, or announced from the chair, the re≈øolution was by ≈øpecial order taken up, read a ≈øecond time, and pa≈ø≈øed in oppo≈øition to all endeavours for a ≈øhort delay. This we believe to be unexampled in Legi≈ølative bodies; and it appears to us to be the more exceptional, ≈øince a decent regard for the opinions of men ≈øeemed to require that the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, being the accu≈øers and pro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Comptroller, ≈øhould have manife≈øted their moderation and impartiality, by declining to u≈øurp the province of judging on their own charges, at lea≈øt until con≈øtitutional judges had determined on them. On the
<pb n="768" facs="unknown:027132_0776_0FD3547DAE41FAE0"/>
contrary, as no time for con≈øideration or enquiry was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, there is too much rea≈øon to believe that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding will be viewed by impartial men, as partaking more of ≈øudden or di≈øappointed re≈øentment, than of that ju≈øt and dignified di≈øplea≈øure which becomes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentatives of a great Republic.</p>
                     <p>"We have ≈øaid of judging on their own charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is rea≈øonable to ≈øuppo≈øe the an≈øwer, conveyed by the re≈øolution, is founded on the matters charged in the articles of impeachment. It is true it is expre≈ø≈øed in ≈øuch general and indefinite terms, as to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible to ≈øay whether it is grounded on them or indeed on any thing el≈øe, ≈øince it contains no ≈øpecification of facts, nor the lea≈øt hint of any particular matter to which it relates; but as the Comptroller has not been called upon to an≈øwer any other charges than tho≈øe which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the articles of impeachment, nor had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being heard in his defence, we are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ≈øuppo≈øe any member of this Hou≈øe capable of condemning him without a charge, and unheard on any other grounds.</p>
                     <p>"We have ≈øaid that we con≈øider the adoption of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution at that time as highly di≈øre≈øpectful to the Senate and to the Governor. As highly di≈øre≈øpectful to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ina≈ømuch as it relates to a pro≈øecution depending before them, and is expre≈ø≈øed in terms calculated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their deci≈øion. <hi>The time, the manner and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hurry with which it was ha≈øtened forward,</hi> mu≈øt carry to the minds of the Senate too ≈øtrong evidence of a ≈øuppo≈øition prevailing in this Hou≈øe, that the Senate or ≈øome of its members, were not to be tru≈øted with a deci≈øion, until they were influenced by a ≈øolemn re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>"John Nichol≈øon</hi> had, by conduct unworthy of his tru≈øt, forfeited and lo≈øt the confidence of the citizens of <hi>Penn≈øylvania,</hi> thereby rendering it highly improper that he ≈øhould any longer continue to enjoy any office of tru≈øt or profit in this commonwealth."</p>
                     <p>"And when we take into con≈øideration the time of pa≈ø≈øing the re≈øolution, we cannot but con≈øider it as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

While we admit the rights of the Hou≈øe to addre≈øs the Governor, to remove an unworthy officer, we are far from agreeing that the Governor was to blame in not removing the Comptroller after the charges were brought again≈øt him, and while they were depending; ≈øince this would have amounted to a declaration on his put, that the Comptroller was unworthy of tru≈øt and confidence, before either his innocence or guilt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on a fair trial. If after a deci≈øion by the Senate the Governor had continued the Comptroller in office, this I loo≈øe had thought him unworthy of it, there might have been a propriety in addre≈ø≈øing for his removal; but to do this at a time when the Governor could not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety di≈øplace him, when it was known that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would on the next day be removed, appears too much like converting the right of addre≈ø≈øing into a vehicle of general and unqualified cen≈øure, both upon the officer who may have incurred the di≈øplea≈øure of the Hou≈øe, and upon the Governor for not adding his weight to that di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure or cen≈øure, by di≈øplacing the accu≈øed before his modern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Mr. <hi>Benjamin Morgan,</hi> in behalf of him≈øelf and others, a≈øked and obtained leave to enter their Reply to the Prote≈øt of the minority of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives again≈øt taking up by ≈øpecial order for a ≈øecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a re≈øolution for the appointment of a committee to draft an Addre≈øs to the Governor for the removal of <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, on the Journal of the Hou≈øe; and pre≈øented the ≈øame to the chair, which is follows, viz.</p>
                     <p>"Reply to the Prote≈øt of the minority of the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives again≈øt taking up, by ≈øpecial order, for a ≈øecond reading, a Re≈øolution for the appointment of a committee to draught an addre≈øs to the Governor for the removal of <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>"THAT at the time of pa≈ø≈øing the ≈øaid re≈øolution, the Senate had decided on the Articles of Impeachment again≈øt the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this common wealth; and although they had neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced judgment nor convicted the ≈øaid <hi>John Nichol≈øon</hi> on any of the articles exhibited again≈øt him, yet ≈øo large a proportion as ten out of ≈øeventeen, (the whole number of Senators pre≈øent) having declared him guilty on two of the mo≈øt ≈øerious of the ≈øaid articles, it would have been highly improper in the Legi≈ølature not to have made u≈øe of every lawful means, to prevent him from continuing a moment longer in office. Had they acted otherwi≈øe, it would in their apprehen≈øion have been an unpardonable breach of the confidence repo≈øed in them by their con≈øtituents; nor could they have expected their vote on the ≈øaid re≈øolution would have any ≈øuch influence on the deci≈øion of the Senate, as is ≈øugge≈øted in the ≈øaid prote≈øt; the ≈øaid deci≈øion having previou≈øly taken place; and though not directly communicated to the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, mu≈øt have been as well known to the minority as it was to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Hou≈øe. On this ground alone, we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="771" facs="unknown:027132_0779_0FD354B301263080"/>
the ≈øaid vote and re≈øolution not only ju≈øtifiable but nece≈ø≈øary, even had there been no other cau≈øes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval than tho≈øe contained in the Articles of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>"Independently however of any thing contained in the ≈øaid articles, we con≈øider the Comptroller's refu≈øal to produce to the committee of inve≈øtigation, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the la≈øt Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives, any of the books, vouchers or papers relative to the certificates i≈ø≈øued to the <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> line for the arrears of their pay, a ≈øufficient cau≈øe of removal; and were any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aggravate his conduct in this in≈øtance, it was ≈øufficiently ≈øupplied by his ≈øub≈øequent refu≈øal to comply with the peremptory orders of the Governor on the ≈øame ≈øubject.</p>
                     <p>"There is ≈øome difficulty in reconciling the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent objections offered by the prote≈øting minority; the principal part of which re≈øt on the ≈øuppo≈øed influence the re≈øolution would produce in the deci≈øion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, when that minority ≈øtate in their prote≈øt it≈øelf, that before any vote had been taken on the ≈øaid re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, an official communication was received from the Senate, informing the Hou≈øe of Repre≈øentatives that on the next day judgment would be pronounced on the impeachment, which could only be the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a deci≈øion having previou≈øly taken place.</p>
