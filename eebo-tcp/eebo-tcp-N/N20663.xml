         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is commonly expected that the Author or Editor of every work would furniſh the public with ſome account of the performance in the Preface; this will not be done here at length, as the work is before you and will anſwer for itſelf. It may be remarked that the Preface would be a ſuitable place to give a ſketch of the lives of the two gentlemen, whoſe trials are here publiſhed, to this it can be anſwered that the Editor never ſaw Mr. <hi>Hopkinſon,</hi> now deceaſed; and it would be very improper to write any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the life of the other gentleman, who is yet on the ſtage: But the works of Mr. <hi>Hopkinſon</hi> are publiſhed, and his character is well known to be not inferior to any, and having very few of equal merit among the literati of the preſent century. By the preſent publication it will alſo appear, that <hi>he,</hi> like other people, had political enemies, who were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed at his acquittal in the year <hi>1780,</hi> as others have ſince been at the acquittal of Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> in the year <hi>1794.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The documents herein publiſhed have been regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared with authentic copies laid before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, whoſe permiſſion to copy them the Editor had obtained during the interval from the 23d of March to the adjournment in April.</p>
            <p>If any errors have crept into the work, let the reader be aſſured that great pains have been taken to prevent them, and that a work of this ſize and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027132_0006_0FD34E2DA2689418"/>
conſequence cannot fail of being attended with many difficulties; that this was a new field of argument, and that every error communicated to the Editor from any of the Speakers, or from thoſe concerned ſhall be duly attended to, and rectified in the next edition.</p>
            <p>From the difference in the length of the work in the two trials, the latter of which the Editor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout, and took down in ſhort hand; and the former be only collected and compiled from papers, ſome in the poſſeſſion of private gentlemen, and others with the public, the reader will judge how neceſſary this work is to the eſtabliſhment of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete hiſtory of the State-Trials of the Commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> before the period paſſes when it can only be gathered from partial writers on one ſide or the other: As an evidence of the importance of this work, the Editor will be excuſed for introducing the following judicious report to the Senate of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> by their committee a few days before the adjournment in April <hi>1794.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"The committee to whom was referred the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Edmund Hogan,</hi> report—</p>
            <p>"That in their opinion the work in which the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner is engaged is entitled to encouragement from the Legiſlature, to hand down to poſterity the doings of their forefathers, and to reſcue from oblivion the moſt important tranſactions of the day in which we live, unembarraſſed with quotations from obſolete, Britiſh or exotic ſtatutes and corrupt precedents, will certainly command the ſmiles of every enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Legiſlator, of every Patriot, and is worthy the efforts of genius.

            <p>It is aſſerted in a note, at the bottom of page <hi>209,</hi> that the oral teſtimony given in the houſe, when the articles of impeachment were brought forward againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> was not committed to writing; part of this teſtimony appearing in pages <hi>185</hi> and <hi>188,</hi> the Editor thinks it proper to ſtate, how that part of it had been preſerved, altho' unknown to the managers: —He was employed by the proprietor of the <hi>Mail,</hi> a daily paper then publiſhed in the city, to collect intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and for that purpoſe had been permitted, as many others had been before and ſince, to fit in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place inſide the bar of the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, where he collected the teſtimony alluded to in Sept. <hi>1793.</hi> About the ſame time he entertained ſome notions of publiſhing the following trial, in which he was encouraged by a number of reſpectable ſubſcribers. The managers, in their letter to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> muſt mean, what really was the caſe, that <hi>"the teſtimony was not committed to writing or preſerved" BY ORDER OE THE HOUSE.</hi>

                           <p>That ſome time in the month of May laſt, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> brought Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> to his houſe, to talk over certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that happened between him the ſaid <hi>M'C.</hi> and the officers of the Court of Admiralty. That we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred fully on the ſubject—and ſeveral explanations took place, concerning matters miſconceived between the ſaid <hi>B. M'C.</hi> and Dep. The event was a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation that appeared cordial—the Judge teſtified his aſſent to ſaid reconciliation, having been before offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> went away, and the Judge remained. A converſation commenced between Dep. and Judge; Dep. mentioned that a number of ſhares were unrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that the Judge by law might appoint agents for. That as Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> had made conſiderable advances to thoſe people whoſe ſhares were unrepreſented. Dep. ſaid it would be an act of kindneſs to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> ſuch agent, as it would put it in his power to ſave the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney advanced,—and thought it would be a good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the aforeſaid reconciliation being effected.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027132_0023_0FD34E74D16A9E40"/>
The Judge conſented, and ſaid he would appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> and gave me leave ſo to inform <hi>M'C.</hi> and added, that ſuch appointments were lucrative to the receivers—and many had been done by him (the Judge) to owners of privateers; for which he had received no recompenſe. That Judge apprehended that on this occaſion the profits to Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> would be a ſufficient reaſon for him the ſaid <hi>M'C.</hi> to make him the Judge, a preſent of a ſuit of cloaths, and Judge deſired Dep. would men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> Dep. <hi>afterwards ſaw M'C.</hi> and informed him, that the Judge had agreed to appoint him agent as aforeſaid. <hi>M'C.</hi> a few days after mentioned to Dep. that in conſequence of the promiſe of the Judge, he had paid ſome of <hi>the</hi> ſaid ſeamen, whoſe ſhares were unrepreſented, more money. Dep. made no mention of the Judge's expectations of a ſuit of cloaths, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too delicate a matter.</p>
                           <p>Judge frequently aſked deponent whether he ſaid any thing about ſaid cloaths. Dep. evaded the anſwer, by ſaying he had no convenient opportunity. Thus the matter reſted for two weeks or three, when being at the Coffee-houſe, I met the Judge there; he informed me that the letters of agency were made out—but that Meſſrs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> were appointed inſtead of <hi>M'C.</hi> Dep. felt ſurpriſed at the information, and remonſtrated with the Judge having deſired me, and mentioned the promiſe he (the Judge) had made of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>M'C.</hi>—and that Dep. ſaid, he had informed <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> of his intended appointment.</p>
                           <p>Judge ſaid he had a right to appoint whom he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and the matter had now reſted two or three weeks, and that he had never heard of the deponents applying for the ſuit of cloaths—and thought himſelf neglected. Dep. felt wounded at his (the Judge'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>) conduct, and told him (the J.) that he treated him ill, and left him.</p>
                           <p>A few days after, Judge came to Dep. houſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed on what had paſſed, and attempted to vindicate himſelf, and ſaid that one thing he was moſt ſorry for,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027132_0024_0FD34E789B6467C8"/>
viz. the requeſt to apply for the ſuit of cloaths, as by ſo doing he had put himſelf in his the Dep. power. Dep. told him that it depended on himſelf, that he was not diſpoſed to do any injury to him. Dep. and Judge then parted.</p>
                           <p>Croſs examined. Dep. rather thinks no perſon was preſent at the converſation about ſuit of cloaths.</p>
                           <p>Judge took the Dep. to one ſide on the converſation at the Coffee-houſe. Dep. never told <hi>M'C.</hi> of the Judge's requeſt. Dept. don't know that the Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any reward from <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Dept. told his brother of the Judge's requeſt ſame day and Mr. <hi>Hazard,</hi> and don't know that it is cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for the officers of the Court to receive preſents, as he never received any himſelf.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> ſworn,—doth depoſe and ſay, that he knows the Judge charged the Marſhal before Council for ſelling prizes before condemnation, and without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he (Dep.) had formerly frequently applied to have orders for the ſale of veſſels before condemnation and procured them—but under the preſent law, the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027132_0028_0FD34E7DC6E71318"/>
Judge refuſed to give any orders but referred him to the Marſhal, implying that he (Judge) would not take any notice thereof if made. That he (Dep.) did not think that ſuch application was wicked or unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledges the paper No. 11 to be his, and underſtands the ſale of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo was ſtopped on that account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>B. M'Clenachan</hi> being ſworn in ſupport of the firſt charge, depoſeth and ſaith, that he underſtood from Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> that he would be appointed an Agent for certain unrepreſented ſhares, but that he never ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the appointment and never heard any thing reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a preſent of a ſuit of cloaths. That he had advanced conſiderable ſums of money to perſons own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unrepreſented ſhares, and ſettled the accounts with <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> the agents appointed by the Judge.</p>
                     <p>In ſupport of the 2d.</p>
                     <p>That on the propoſal of Mr. <hi>Miller</hi> he conſented to make a preſent of a caſk of wine to the Judge afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                     <p>That the order for delivering the caſk muſt have come from <hi>M. C.</hi> Judge never applied for it. That he did not intend the ſaid wine as a bribe, or to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Judge in an undue manner. That the Judge ever conducted himſelf in an upright manner to the beſt of Dep. knowledge—always found Judge in his duty, and thought rather too ſevere—ſigned a paper requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indulgence of the ſale of the <hi>Charlotte</hi>—no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor bribe given for the indulgence.</p>
                     <p>In ſupport of the 3d.</p>
                     <p>That he with others petitioned as he thinks for the ſale of the <hi>Charlotte</hi> before condemnation, being ſuited for a privateer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andrew Robeſon</hi> ſworn ſaith, that he is Regiſter of the Court of Admiralty. That about the time that the Marſhal made return that certain ſhares of ſeamen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027132_0029_0FD34E16D1B274E0"/>
to the privateer <hi>Holker</hi> were unrepreſented, the Judge mentioned his deſign to appoint ſuch agents.</p>
                     <p>The Judge then informed the Dep. in the courſe of converſation, that the Marſhal ſhortly after applied to be agent—To which the Judge objected, as he (M.) was an officer of the Court, &amp;c.—Marſhal urged it on the ſcore of friendſhip, &amp;c. but the Judge ſtill reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his the M's application. The matter laid ſo ſome time, when Ma. told Judge that it would anſwer as well to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> ſuch agent. Judge conſented to appoint <hi>M'C.</hi> agent. That he the ſaid Judge, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeeing <hi>M'C.</hi> and he <hi>M'C.</hi> ſaying nothing on the ſubject, the Judge thought for ſeveral reaſons, it would be beſt to appoint ſome one elſe ſuch agent—for if ſuch things were not worth aſking for, they were not receiving.</p>
                     <p>On queſtion.</p>
                     <p>Dept. in courſe of converſation heard the Judge ſay that <hi>Gover. Morris</hi> had declared that his <hi>(G. M.)</hi> father uſed to receive preſents, and refuſed to proceed againſt Act of Parliament without; this was introduced as mere matter of chit-chat. After above converſation ſome time, Judge informed Dep. that <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> were appointed the agents aforeſaid, and deſired him to prepare bonds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>Dep. heard no more till the M's hearing before Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, when Marſhal mentioned the ſubſtance of the firſt charge. Judge told Dep. on converſing with him on the ſubject, that M. agreed with him that there would be no impropriety in receiving a ſuit of cloaths for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a diſcretionary, and not a judicial power, &amp;c.— But that afterwards the Judge told the M. that <hi>M'C's</hi> deportment and ſituation was ſuch that we would not appoint him the agent aforeſaid. And he the Judge directed the M. not to mention the ſuit of cloaths, as he now viewed it rather in a different light. The Judge told him that <hi>M'C.</hi> and <hi>Miller</hi> had in his abſence had ſent him (the Judge) a caſk of wine, and never knew any thing of it until Mrs. <hi>Hopkinſon</hi> had informed him.</p>

2d charge.</p>
                     <p>M. told Dep. that Judge had received a preſent as ſtated in 2d charge—that Judge knew nothing of it till delivery, and then imagined it was a miſtake. <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter's</hi> trial was tried after 14 days notice, the cargo was wine, he ſhewed from his minutes that the practice in this inſtance is not unuſual, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>3d charge.</p>
                     <p>That in ſome caſes of armed veſſels, orders iſſued for appraiſement, &amp;c. that in the caſe of the <hi>Charlotte,</hi> the Marſhal advertiſed for ſale and ſold previous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but on the day the trial was to have been, which was deferred by the neglect of the owners to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure proper teſtimony, the Judge attended to forbid the ſale, but too late.</p>
                     <p>She was condemned 27th October, and ſold 2d Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember before.</p>
                     <p>4th charge.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of the <hi>Albion,</hi> a writ of ap— iſſued previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the order of ſale, under a perſuaſion that the cargo was periſhable in its nature and much wanted. But the ſaid order for ſale was contradicted on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of certain inſpectors that it was not in danger, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thinks the Judge to <hi>be</hi> a perſon of great integrity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Miles Filborne</hi> being duly affirmed, ſaid, that he was one of the inſpectors of the cargo of the <hi>Charlotte;</hi> and when they made their report, that the cargo was in a periſhing condition, ſome of the inſpectors obſerved that it was a pity the ſhip ſhould be detained with forms, as ſhe would be a good privateer, &amp;c.—The Judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that ſhe was ſo clearly a prize, that ſome of the forms might be diſpenſed with to expedite her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and ſale.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the inſpectors of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Heyſham</hi> being ſworn, depoſeth and ſaith, that he was one of three to inſpect the cargo of the ſhip <hi>Charlotte</hi>—they (the inſpectors) waited on the Judge to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027132_0031_0FD34E85D1D49EF8"/>
report, one of them obſerved to the Judge that the ſhip was a good faſt failing veſſel, and that ſeveral of the owners had expreſſed their deſire that ſhe might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſoon as poſſible, and that they intended to buy and fit her out as a privateer.</p>
                     <p>The Judge anſwered it was a pity that ſuch a ſhip <hi>ſhould</hi> be delayed. It would be ſerving the public to indulge them the owners, and that ſhe ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſoon as poſſible—but it could not be done without public advertiſement, and this is Saturday and it cannot be done till Tueſday, but I will grant every indulgence in my power, where the matter is clear.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the inſpectors of the cargo of the <hi>Albion,</hi> and they reported it well conditioned and in good order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William Budden</hi> being ſworn, ſaith, that he was one of three, that inſpected the cargo of the <hi>Charlotte</hi> and reported it in a periſhing condition—that ſome of the inſpectors obſerved that the ſhip was a faſt ſailing veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and that the Judge ſaid the condemnation and ſale ſhould be expedited as ſoon as poſſible, but it could not be done without public notice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Dep. was one of the inſpectors of the <hi>Albion's</hi> cargo, and reported it in good order.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Charles Miller</hi> being ſworn, acknowledges the papers No. 4 and 5, to be his hand writing—Deponent —acknowledges to have ſent the caſk of wine mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond charge, as a preſent to the Judge on account of former friendſhip, and not for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any ſpecial purpoſe. Dep. never mentioned to any perſon his deſign of ſending the above preſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Judge could not know it, until the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>☞ On the files of the General Aſſembly there are two ſets of depoſitions, given in by the witneſſes; the ſecond copies have been omitted by the editor as imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,

                     <p>Progreſs being made in the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was, on motion,</p>

                           <p>THAT finding an enquiry inſtituted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the honorable <hi>Francis Hopkinſon,</hi> 
                              <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Judge of the Court of Admiralty, and your memorialiſt being of opinion, that the ſaid Judge has been guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and exacting fees beyond what are warranted by law, from the ſuitors in his court, he begs leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the ſame with all humility to this honorable Houſe. That the Act of Aſſembly of the twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of November, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-nine, provides "That the fees of the Judge of Admiralty, including his fee for a final decree, in the caſe of a ſhip or veſſel under the burthen of one hundred tons, ſhall be twenty-five buſhels of wheat, and in the caſe of a ſhip or veſſel above the burthen of one hundred tons, ſhall be forty buſhels of ſuch wheat, payable however in money, as in the caſe of the officers aforenamed." That your memorialiſt believes it will appear, that by law no more than five hundred pounds are due to the Judge in the caſe of a veſſel under one hundred tons, but that nevertheleſs more than double that ſum are continually charged and received, as the Judge's ſee in ſuch caſes. That your memorialiſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with tranſmits an authentic copy of a bill of coſts, which has been ſome time ſince paid, as he is informed, and believes, in the caſe of the <hi>Recovery,</hi> a ſmall prize taken by <hi>Job Pray,</hi> in the employ of <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Hugh Hodge,</hi> which was of the burthen of only eighty tons, and which was libelled by your memorialiſt. That the charge of <hi>thirteen hundred pounds</hi> in this caſe has been complained of by your memorialiſt's clients, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves to be extortionate; yet the like charges will be found in a variety of other inſtances, if recourſe be had
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027132_0039_0FD34E6C0DC8C348"/>
to the bills of coſts on the files of the Regiſter, or in the hands of the late Marſhal. That your memorialiſt begs leave to inſtance particularly in the caſe or the <hi>Fame,</hi> which was alſo libelled by your memorialiſt, and lately condemned, being a ſmall veſſel owned by <hi>Joſeph Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and others, re-taken by the <hi>Fair American</hi> priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer. That if this honorable Houſe ſhould find upon enquiry, as your memorialiſt is induced to believe they will find, that the ſaid Judge has been guilty of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than his due, in theſe and other inſtances, he humbly hopes the ſaid Judge will be called upon to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the ſame along with the other charges exhibited againſt him.

                     <p>TO the firſt article the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Matthew Clarkſon,</hi> Eſquire, late Marſhal, made a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027132_0044_0FD34E645CA22F58"/>
return to him the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon,</hi> as Judge of the Court of Admiralty; of certain unrepreſented ſhares in prizes taken by the privateer called the <hi>Holker,</hi> ſoon after which the ſaid <hi>Matthew Clarkſon</hi> came to him the ſaid Judge, and deſired he might be appointed agent for the ſaid unrepreſented ſhares (the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> then being in intimate friendſhip with the ſaid <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Clarkſon)</hi> but the ſaid Judge cautiouſly declined giving him the ſaid <hi>Clarkſon</hi> the agency requeſted; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to him that the offices of agent and marſhal appeared to be incompatible, and requeſting the ſaid Marſhal not to urge a compliance with his deſire, as ſuch an appointment would probably bring cenſure on both.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs the ſaid <hi>Matthew Clarkſon</hi> continued to urge the appointment for two or three days, pleading the poverty of his office, declaring the profits thereof did not pay his Clerk, and alledging that the Judge ought from motives of friendſhip to throw any little advantage in his way that might occur from the rights of his office.</p>
                     <p>But the Judge ſtill declined the requeſt from a ſenſe of impropriety and apprehenſion of cenſure. At length the ſaid Marſhal told the Judge that finding him ſo very nice and difficult, he had been with Mr. <hi>Blair M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan,</hi> and made up matters with him; ſo that if the Judge would give the agency to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> of the ſhares in queſtion, it would anſwer his (the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal's) purpoſe and intereſt juſt as well.</p>
                     <p>The Judge, happy to be rid of the embarraſſments he was under on the ſcore of friendſhip, gave the ſaid <hi>Matthew,</hi> then Marſhal, reaſon to believe (but no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe) that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed agent.</p>
                     <p>Thus matters reſted for ſome days, after which the Judge being at the Marſhal's, and they alone in friendly conference; the Judge informed the Marſhal, that a thought had juſt occurred which he would in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence mention, requeſting his opinion thereupon, and declaring he would be bound by it. And then obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027132_0045_0FD34EA884465858"/>
to the Marſhal that he was about to throw into Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> hands, many thouſand pounds, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the agency.</p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had wrought him much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his office, had never ſhewn civility of any kind, and even neglected the common compliment of his hat, when they met. That he heard much of Mr. <hi>M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan's</hi> politeneſs and generoſity to other perſons and ſubmitted it, whether it would not be as proper, if Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſhould make him a preſent of a ſuit of cloaths, as well as to other perſons who had not been as beneficent to him or done him ſuch ſubſtantial favours, and finally obſerved that this was a matter of delicacy and doubt. To which the Marſhal replied, that in common juſtice Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ought to make ſome acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for ſo conſiderable a favour—that there was no impropriety or indelicacy in the Judge's receiving ſuch a preſent, ſhould it be offered; the appointment to an agency not being a judicial act, but a voluntary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court; no more converſation of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance paſſed at that time on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Some days after, the Judge aſked the Marſhal whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had ever mentioned any thing of this affair to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> who replied that he had not had a favorable opportunity, and theſe were the only times in which the matter was touched upon; excepting that ſome ſhort time after the Judge thinking on further conſideration that the thing was improper, declared his better ſentiments to the Marſhal, and abſolutely forbid him proceeding in it. But told the Marſhal he ſhould expect Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> would at leaſt aſk the Judge for the agency, a ceremony he never diſpenſed with—as he thought the favour worth aſking for, if worth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing; and declared he would never make the favours of his office ſo cheap as to force them on perſons who would not condeſcend to requeſt them.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> however neglecting to aſk for the agency in queſtion, the Judge frequently urged this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent to the Marſhal, which circumſtance the ſaid
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027132_0046_0FD34E03E5793F18"/>
Marſhal hath in his depoſition falſely and maliciouſly applied to the ſuit of cloaths, all ideas of which had long ſince been totally diſcarded by the Judge. After this, above a fortnight paſſed, in all which time Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never called upon the Judge, or gave the leaſt intimation that the agency would be acceptable to him. The matter was alſo dropped by the Marſhal, who ſeemed rather to avoid any converſation on the ſubject. In the interim, other reaſons occurred to the Judge for not appointing Mr. <hi>M'Clenochan</hi> agent, one of which was, that he was a principal owner of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> and another, becauſe the Marſhal having had great good fortune in the arrival of a valuable prize (the <hi>Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi> taken by one of his privateers, the Judge thought the agency was no longer an object with him: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Judge on reflection thought himſelf right in refuſing to make the Marſhal agent, but found it would be continuing the ſubſtance, only altering the form, in appointing Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> agent, knowing that it was to ſerve the purpoſe and intereſt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal.</p>
                     <p>For all theſe reaſons, and to relieve himſelf at once from ſurrounding difficulties, he finally gave the agency to Meſſrs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not to be wondered at that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> did not apply for the agency. As it appears ſince, that he was totally ignorant of the whole affair; Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> having never mentioned the matter to him at all, till after the appointment of Meſſrs. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> having impoſed a falſhood on the Judge to ſerve his own avaricious purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond charge, the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon</hi> ſaith, that the ſhip <hi>Albion</hi> was captured in the North ſeas by two veſſels belonging to <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſent into this port and libelled here. It appeared from her papers exhibited to the Judge that her cargo was altogether ſalt, being eight or nine thouſand bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhels. A claim was alſo filed on behalf of her Majeſty the Empreſs of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> as ſalt was ſcarce at that time,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027132_0047_0FD34E79723FB178"/>
the Judge hoping to do a public ſervice without injury to any individual, waited on Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> and obſerved to him, that as a claim was filed, the deciſion might be dilatory, that if the cargo waited till condemnation, it would be diſtributed in kind, and ſo fall into the hands of a few. That he thought ſalt water-born, and after ſo long a voyage might properly be conſidered as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable article, and ſold by vendue before condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Act of Aſſembly; and that it would be very popular and a public good, if this ſalt ſhould be ſold in ſmall lots, ſo that the houſe-keepers might have an opportunity of ſupplying themſelves reaſonably.</p>
                     <p>To this Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> after a day's interval conſented, and a writ of ſale in the common form was iſſued, and the ſalt advertiſed to be ſold. His Excellency the Preſident ſeeing the advertiſment, took offence and wrote to the Marſhal on the ſubject. The Judge on ſeeing this letter waited on the Preſident and declared his motives.</p>
                     <p>The Preſident obſerved that if the law was inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, methods might be taken to have it amended; but that whilſt it was the law, it ought to be held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; and that ſalt could not be conſidered as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable article within the meaning of the Act. The Judge, in deference to the Preſident's opinion, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered a ſurvey; and on the report of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, that the cargo was not in a periſhable condition, countermanded the ſale, and the cargo remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched 'till after condemnation.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon,</hi> by and under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, that the ſaid articles, and the matter in the ſame contained are not ſufficient in law to maintain the aforeſaid impeachment againſt him; and ſaving to himſelf (and which he prayeth may be ſaved to him) both now and at all times hereafter, all and all manner of benefit and advantage of exception to the inſufficiency of the ſaid articles in point of law: Nevertheleſs for plea thereto he ſaith, that he is in no wiſe guilty of all or any the crimes, offences or miſdemeanors, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                     <p>A letter from <hi>Francis Hopkinſon,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Judge of the Court of Admiralty ſtiled, An Anſwer to the third article of impeachment exhibited againſt him by the Houſe of General Aſſembly, was read, as follows, viz.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon</hi> in anſwer to the third article of impeachment brought againſt him, ſaith:—</p>
                     <p>That it hath been the ſtated cuſtom for the Regiſter of the Court of Admiralty to draw out and deliver to the Marſhal, the bills of coſts, in every cauſe, and for the Marſhal to collect and account with the Judge for the ſum total of his the Judge's fees. That during his being in office he hath never ſeen a bill of coſts in any cauſe whatever, or ever heard any complaints made of his fees being illegal or oppreſſive.</p>
                     <p>That he hath never converſed on the ſubject with any perſon whatever, one inſtance only excepted, viz. When early in office a cauſe of a perſonal nature, where no veſſel was concerned, coming before him, he aſked the Regiſter, How the fees were to be adjuſted in ſuch a caſe, as the Act of Aſſembly ſeemed to refer to veſſels of certain tons burthen. To which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter replied, That for ſervices not referred to in the Act, the cuſtom was to charge the fees according to the ancient rates, allowing 40 for one for depreciation. To which ſyſtem the Judge gave his aſſent, and acquieſcence as reaſonable and right: That the Judge never undertook to determine, what might be ſervices included in the Act, and what not. That as no comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laints were ever made, he thought all was right and no injury done. That in the caſe exhibited by the honorable Houſe of Aſſembly of the brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> neither the captors or any perſon concerned, ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Judge to have the bill of coſts ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027132_0050_0FD34EAA171D7330"/>
or ſuggeſted to the Judge, or to any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his knowledge, that they thought themſelves ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved. That in the caſe of the ſaid brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> many courts were held by adjournment, and arguments had of a complex and difficult nature; that beſides the proſecution of the libel by the captors, a claim was filed by <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on principles entirely new, and which had nothing to do with the ſimple capture and condemnation of the prize; and that in the ſaid cauſe alſo two or more courts were held and depoſitions taken, &amp;c. on the trial of two negroes for freedom or ſlavery, and alſo on agency appointed, for all which ſervices, the Regiſter hath, as the Judge is informed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, charged the former cuſtomary fees and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exchange of 40 for one. That the Judge can and will produce undoubted teſtimony that he hath never been covetous of his fees, or made any efforts to enlarge and encreaſe them beyond the bounds of juſtice and moderation: On the contrary hath always ſhewn a ready diſpoſition to ſave expence to parties by ſhortening the time for condemnation in clear caſes; by remitting his fees in caſes of poverty and ſmall property, and in one inſtance by ſuffering eight veſſels (of ſmall value) to be included in one libel; for the avoiding of expence; where he might legally and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have inſiſted on eight ſeparate libels, to his great emolument.</p>
                     <p>And finally that this third article of impeachment is grounded on an opinion as to the conſtruction of an Act of Aſſembly; for which the Judge is not impeachable; and that the Judge hath all probable reaſon to ſuppoſe that his opinion was right; as no p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rſon, during the whole of his buſineſs in office hath ever made any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint on this head.</p>
                     <p>And the ſaid <hi>Francis Hopkinſon</hi> prays that this his anſwer to the third article of impeachment, may be annexed to, and incorporated with his anſwer to the two former articles, and to have reference to his former
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027132_0051_0FD34E7B51E2D798"/>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Robeſon</hi> (ſworn.)</p>
                     <p>Some time early in laſt May, the Marſhal, Mr. <hi>Clarkſon,</hi> made a return that there were certain ſhares for whom there were no agents, of ſome of the <hi>Holker's</hi> crew. Within a few days after I ſaw the Judge, who told me the Marſhal had applied to him for the agency of theſe ſhares. He had told Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> he thought ſuch appointment would be improper, as he was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officer of the Court, in caſe of any improper conduct there was no officer to ſerve proceſs, that he ſaw the Judge again who told him that <hi>Clarkſon</hi> had again applied to him, and urged the requeſt on the ſcore of friendſhip, that he had repeated his objections, to which <hi>Clarkſon</hi> replied, that the ſituation of his accounts with <hi>B. M'C.</hi> rendered it very convenient— that the Judge declined it. That ſome time after he <hi>Cl:</hi> propoſed to the Judge to appoint Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> that that perhaps would anſwer as well. The Judge men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned he had given him <hi>(Clarkſon)</hi> great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that <hi>B. M'C.</hi> ſhould be appointed. He afterwards mentioned that he had thought further on the queſtion.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027132_0056_0FD34EB7244DBB50"/>
That he had met <hi>B. M'C.</hi> frequently, that he <hi>(B. M'C.)</hi> had not mentioned the ſubject to him, and that Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> had never aſked the appointment, that when he met him in the ſtreet, he had taken no notice of him, not paying him the ceremony of the hat, that if the favour was worth his receiving it was worth aſking. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it appeared to him to be improper, that an owner ſhould be appointed, that it appeared to be the deſign of the law thoſe agencies ſhould be thrown into other hands. Thoſe converſations happened within about a fortnight. That about the 20th May Mr. <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> applied for the neceſſary papers. <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> being appointed to the agency. That the Judge ſoon after informed him, that he had now relieved his mind from the embarraſment reſpecting the agency by having given it to unexceptionable perſons. That altho' <hi>M'C.</hi> was offended.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> ſaid,</p>
                     <p>That he had given to Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> expectations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed agent, that he had taken ſteps according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and had been made to appear little by it, that he thought it a very extra ſtep.</p>
                     <p>Nothing paſſed between <hi>M'C.</hi> and him reſpecting <hi>C's</hi> applications but on <hi>B.

                     <p>In the beginning of the privateering my agency was verbal, but after ſome inconveniency ariſing, written ones were taken—ſome were omitted, it was referred to the Judge.—Some time after the Marſhal told me he thought the Judge would appoint me, and I advanced money to the people to keep them quiet—he was howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver informed that <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it made no difference to him, he therefore made up his accounts and ſent them the balance— That as to the ſuit of cloaths he had never at that time heard of any thing of the kind from any one.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> admitted that the tonnage of the brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is 80 tons.</p>
                     <p>Attorney for the defendant obſerved that the tonnage of the brig was not material in this defence, but that as a Britiſh regiſter had been brought to ſhew that ſhe was a ſmall trifling veſſel, it became a duty to remove the impreſſions made by it;—That the caſe of the brig was unprovided for by the law which refers to the tonnage and reſts on the former law, and will be defended on that ground.</p>
                     <p>Anſwered by Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>—Who read the 26th article of the Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Robeſon</hi> was adduced to prove the former cuſtom of fees in like caſes.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027132_0061_0FD34EBF61F30A40"/>
to produce proof of former cuſtoms in oppoſition to a law.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll.</hi> The witneſs is produced to ſhew upon what principles the bill was made out; and the queſtion of the propriety or legality of thoſe principles is to be argued, and to be judged of by the Preſident and Council.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> read the 26th ſection of the Conſtitution, and claimed moderate and adequate fees. (See page 60.)</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> replied, but his objections were overruled as being out of time.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Robeſon,</hi> ſome ſhort time after the Act of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly now read, was paſſed, Mr. <hi>Hopkinſon,</hi> the Judge, mentioned, that there were many caſes not mentioned in the Act and deſired to know how the fees ought to be made out. I told him that in ſuch caſes, I ſuppoſed, they muſt be made out according to the old Act and uſage, and deſired to know whether it would be reaſonable to allow for extra ſervices, and that it would not be objected to.</p>
                     <p>That in caſe of parties not attending at the day, or by repeated delays, that in ſuch caſe the former ſees might lawfully be charged.</p>
                     <p>In the preſent caſe of the brig <hi>Recovery,</hi> there was a claim put in, that there were adjournments in this caſe, that the determination of the caſe of the negroes was not determined 'till within a few days—That the fees were made out with a view to the final deciſion of the caſe, which would have made but little alteration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould be condemned or acquitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſ.</hi> Were the charges for appointing of agents for unrepreſented ſhares, charged in the accounts of the veſſels?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ought not to be; but whether it was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the bill delivered to Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> or not, I cannot aſcertain.</p>

                        <p>In June laſt Mr. <hi>Hopkinſon</hi> called at our counting-houſe, and offered the houſe of <hi>Meade</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons</hi> the agency of the unrepreſented ſhares, which they agreed to accept and entered on the buſineſs. Afterwards applied to the Marſhal for the monies due them, and had a liſt amounting to 26½ on one veſſel, and 23½ on another. On applying to the Marſhal he ſeemed diſſatisfied, ſaid the agency had been diſpoſed of or promiſed, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurs taken in conſequence of that promiſe and money paid thereupon. Upon receiving this anſwer I informed the Judge, he ſaid there had been ſome ſuch promiſe, but that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never had applied regularly for an appointment, and on further conſideration he did not think it proper to appoint one who was ſo largely concerned in privateers, that witneſs offered to reſign the agency, if the Judge, Marſhal &amp;c. could agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. The Judge declined this propoſition, that Mr. <hi>M'C.</hi> was improper and could not have it, that if they decline ſome other perſons muſt have it, they might therefore as well keep it. We wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Marſhal, informing him that the appointment was unſolicited, but as it was given they would wiſh to proceed in the buſineſs. The Marſhal ſtill objected— many converſations enſued on the ſubject.</p>
                        <p>They afterwards met at the Judge's houſe on the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when a compromiſe was agreed to, which was, that all the monies <hi>M'C.</hi> could ſhew he had paid on the unrepreſented ſhares ſhould be paid to him, and the balances to be paid to Meſſrs. <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>Fitzſimons.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Council having met agreeable to adjournment. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of the committee of the General Aſſembly attending, and <hi>Francis Hopkinſon,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> alſo attending, the Preſident read the following DECREE.</p>
                     <p>IT is not uſual to enter into the reaſons of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon occaſions of this kind, but the importance of the preſent proſecution makes it neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place it is obſervable, that the commiſſion of the Judge is during good behaviour; crimes only are cauſes of removal—the cauſe is of great importance as it reſpects the officer, and as it comes from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the people.</p>
                     <p>It certainly is of the greateſt conſequence, that the ſtreams of juſtice be kept pure—We act in the double capacity of Judges and Jury—It therefore became our duty, and we have examined minutely into the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—It is immaterial from what motives the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution has originated, any farther than to determine how far it may affect the credibility of the witneſſes— perhaps few public proſecutions have taken their riſe from pure regard to the public good, nor is it of any conſequence with what views the Aſſembly forwarded the impeachment—Whether it is ſupported, is the only object of our enquiry—The cauſe has been ably argued on both ſides.—</p>
                     <p>The Preſident then read the firſt article.</p>
                     <p>The late Marſhal, Mr. <hi>Clarkſon,</hi> ſwears, that in a converſation he had with Mr. <hi>Hopkinſon,</hi> (teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> read) the ſtreſs of the proſecution muſt depend on this teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Clarkſon,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027132_0068_0FD34E4BA6433A20"/>
does not ſtate the ſuit of cloaths as a condition, or <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> without which Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> was not to have the agency; ſeveral circumſtances ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what the Judge ſays, that he mentioned this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a thought that had occurred to him, and by way of taking the opinion of his friend upon it—The Judge and Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> were at that time intimate friends— he took no notice of it, until after the Judge had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againſt him. He was exceedingly diſguſted at the agency not being given to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi>—it ſeems ſtrange if he thought this had been made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he made no mention of it in his complaints. Either the Marſhal approved the proſecution or he did not—if he did not, why not ſay ſo. If he did, why not mention it to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> if he thought it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition not countermanded—the ſtory of want of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity could not have been the reaſon, for he mentioned the agency—it would have required but a few words more to have mentioned the condition had there been one.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, tho' Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect any countermand, yet as the Judge gave the agency to Meſſrs. <hi>Meade</hi> &amp; <hi>Fitzſimons,</hi> not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any compliment, but as no hint or ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion was made that any ſuch was expected, this looks like confirmatory of the repreſentation made by the Judge. Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> in one part of his teſtimony is very poſitive, in another very cautious, ſo far as reſpects the mention of the ſuit of cloaths, he is entirely clear— as to any explanatory circumſtances he does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber—He is aſked, did the Judge requeſt your opinion and advice upon the point? he does not recollect—If he is cautious in determining the complexion of the buſineſs, ſurely we ought to be in founding our opinion. —Indeed we ſhould have had very little difficulty had it not been for the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>—but the converſation between him and the Judge happened a good while ago—a few words make a great difference— a gentleman cannot be ſuppoſed to recollect with an entire exactneſs—we cannot but conſider Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> as
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027132_0069_0FD34ECF2F037620"/>
a ſecondary witneſs, and therefore cannot overrule the preſumption ariſing in favour of the Judge upon Mr. <hi>Clarkſon's</hi> teſtimony from the circumſtances that have been mentioned—but here another queſtion ariſes, <hi>quo animo?</hi> with what mind was this done—for a great deal depends upon the intent—every killing is not murder —on a diſpaſſionate conſideration of the character of the Judge, his general conduct in office, and all the circumſtances we do not think there is any proof of corruption—we could have left this charge without any further animadverſion had it not been for ſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines advanced by the counſel for the Judge, which we think proper to make ſome obſervations upon.—In an inſtant State it is of the higheſt importance, as we ſaid before, that the ſtreams of juſtice ſhould be kept pure, and that the people ſhould have a confidence in the integrity of the Judges.—Not only the taking a bribe, but even ſoliciting it, tho' not falling perhaps ſtrictly within the definition of bribery would draw down the vengeance of the State—Whether for a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial officer or one that did not concern the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice, whether by a Judge ſitting on the ſeat of Juſtice or this Council in their capacity as ſuch; the office of a Vendue-Maſter is not a judicial office, but we ſhould eſteem it criminal for any member of this Council to accept a compenſation for his vote to an appointment in that office.—The man who can beſt ſerve the public is the proper object of choice, it is enough that the office is an office of truſt, whether judicial or not makes no difference—and we think the obſervation of the Attorney-General that the appointment of an agent is done by the Judge, as ſuch, is well founded, and if we had been ſatisfied of the fact, that the Judge had either received or ſolicited a compenſation in this conſideration we ſhould have been at no loſs to have declared him guilty—and we take this opportunity to mention that we conceive it indelicate for a Judge to accept preſents from perſons who frequently have buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027132_0070_0FD34ED216937310"/>
before him, tho' no cauſe be then depending, ſuch as owners of privateers.—In ſhort the <hi>preſent</hi> ſhould appear to be made to the MAN, and not to the OFFICER.</p>
                     <p>The Preſident then read the ſecond article.</p>
                     <p>The Judge acknowledges that he did make a miſtake in the iſſuing the writ, and upon being informed of the error rectified it—to make a Judge anſwerable for the veracity of every aſſertion contained in the forms of proceſs would be very unreaſonable—I will not ſay how far a Judge may be anſwerable in a criminal proſecution for giving a judgment contrary to a plain law; but then it muſt appear that he acted wilfully wrong, and not from honeſt, tho' ill judged deſigns—but here was a point of ſome doubt.—The Judge ſuppoſed, and there was ſome colour for the idea that the law was merely <hi>directory;</hi> that he was to have recourſe to the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſurvey only in caſe of uncertainty, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his conſcience—but that where he was at no loſs for the very nature of the article to determine it periſhable, of courſe, that the ſtep was unneceſſary.—Salt is thus conſidered ſometimes.—If for inſtance, inſurance is made on it at ſea, it is treated as a periſhable article.— If a mere error of judgment was to be turned into a ſubject for criminal proſecution, we muſt, as was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by one of the learned counſel for the Judge, get infallible Judges. We are therefore at no loſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an acquittal upon this article, more eſpecially as the miſtake was rectified as ſoon as diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>The Preſident then read the third article.</p>
                     <p>This charge has been conſidered by many to be more likely to endanger the Judge, and to occaſion a ſentence to his diſadvantage, than the others.</p>
                     <p>The Judge anſwers that he took fees according to the former tables, and the practice eſtabliſhed at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into office. Now, altho' the degree of puniſhment ought not to make any difference, nor enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration where the matter is plainly proved, yet more caution becomes neceſſary in proportion to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences

of conviction—in this caſe the penalty by the Conſtitution is very great.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>26th ſection of the Conſtitution of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1776.</p>
                           <p>Court of Seſſions, Common-pleas and Orphans' Courts ſhall be held quarterly in each city and county; and the Legiſlature ſhall have power to eſtabliſh all ſuch other courts as they may judge for the good of the inhabitants of the State. All courts ſhall be open, and juſtice ſhall be impartially adminiſtered without corruption, or unneceſſary delay: All their officers ſhall be paid an adequate but moderate compenſation for their ſervices: And if any officer ſhall take greater or other fees than the laws allow him, either directly or indirectly, it ſhall ever after diſqualify him from holding any office in this State.</p>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are in almoſt all offices compenſatory as well as ſpecific fees.—In fee laws, laws made for the regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fees of officers, it is very difficult to enumerate all the ſervices. In ſuch caſes compenſatory fees muſt be allowed, or the neceſſary buſineſs will not be done. There is a great difference between exacting more than the ſpecific fees, and aſking fees for ſervices where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is provided.—But it is ſaid that the law on which this charge is founded, intended to have excluded all other fees except the wheat. But every part of this law was not attended to. In a preceding paragraph it is ſaid, that the fees of the ſaid officers ſhall be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated and paid according to the price of good mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable wheat in the manner following, that is to ſay, the ſaid fees as they were regulated by law or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice under the late government of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> before the firſt day of July one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-ſix, ſhall from and after the publication of this Act be ſatisfied in good merchantable wheat; accounting and allowing that a buſhel of ſuch wheat, weighing at leaſt ſixty pounds, ſold formerly in times of war and difficulty for ten Shillings. The fifth paragraph menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that this former one ſhall extend to the Judge, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter and Marſhal of the Court of Admiralty.</p>
                     <p>It appears therefore in this very law, the principle of making a difference between ſpecific and compenſatory fees was adopted—formerly by an Act of Parliament, the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027132_0072_0FD34ED4D99D5F80"/>
Judges of the court of Admiralty in the then province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> were allowed £. 15 ſterling for every veſſel above 100 tons, and £ 10 for every veſſel below that burthen—as the ſame number of tons is mentioned in this Act of Aſſembly, as applied to the twenty-five buſhels of wheat and the forty, it ſeems probable that this was intended in lieu of thoſe ſums. On this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the law is conſiſtent and complete, and the law and practice agree, and it muſt appear that the £ 1300 taken by the Judge exceeds what he was entitled to by this mode of computation—here were three cauſes; the firſt, libel to decide prize or no prize—that is the object of the law—then the claim by Mr. <hi>Morris</hi>—then the negroes; theſe are three as diſtinct cauſes as if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to different veſſels. At this rate the fees would have amounted to £ 1320—but ſuppoſe the matter had not ſtood entirely on this ground, and that it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the £ 1300 was a ſum beyond what the Judge was entitled to, ſtill the charge is not, that he <hi>received</hi> too much, but that he <hi>exacted</hi> too much. We do not ſay, that the Judge ought not to take care of his officers —But an inadvertence of this kind would not be a ground for rendering a man infamous for life. On looking into the authorities we found they all run in this ſtile— that the Judges exacted—that buſineſs was kept back and delays affected until the money was paid—ſuppoſe the court wrong, they ought not to be immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in a criminal way, but complaint ſhould be made, and if they will not rectify the miſtake, then it will be proper to purſue in a courſe of juſtice—at the ſame time we take this opportunity to ſay, that the fees of the court of Admiralty have increaſed lately extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not in the time of the preſent Judge; indeed, he took things as he found them; as to the agency I do not conceive it to be the ſpirit and meaning of the act of Aſſembly, that one ſhould be appointed to every veſſel where there are unrepreſented ſhares—the holding of courts for miniſterial purpoſes is wrong alſo—this practice has taken riſe within four or five years—it's
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027132_0073_0FD34ED6E9D6C120"/>
diſtreſſing to trade—all the miniſterial buſineſs ſhould be done at the holding of ſome court, or at chambers— the other mode is a ſtrained conſtruction of the meaning of holding a court—it is a matter that I am deſired to mention, that the Judge direct the Regiſter to prepare a book in which he is to enter all the items of the bills of coſts—that people may always know whether they pay unreaſonably—the Judge it ſeems truſted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, and the bill muſt have been made out in the lump, as it agrees exactly with no rule. When this is done, if on complaint made, errors are not rectified, there will be a proper ground for criminal proſecution. UPON THE WHOLE, WE ARE UNANIMOUSLY OF OPINION THAT THE JUDGE OUGHT TO BE ACQUITTED UPON ALL THE THREE CHARGES.</p>

                           <p>"I UNDERSTAND a communication from <hi>Chriſtian Febiger,</hi> 
                              <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Treaſurer, was yeſterday read in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, containing reflections againſt me; knowing my own conduct, I feel myſelf perfectly ſecure from injury by any aſſault he may make, and I defy and deſpiſe the attempts, he or any other enemy I have, may make againſt me.</p>
                           <p>"But without regarding the character of the man, it is proper that I ſhould take ſome notice thereof, I do not wiſh that the motives of malice which actuate him, may operate to relax from the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny into my conduct. I have this morning applied for and juſt now obtained
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027132_0078_0FD34EDFEEA865A0"/>
from the aſſiſtant clerk of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, a copy of the repreſentation alluded to, and was referred to the Printer, where I ſaw the ſtatement therein refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to.</p>
                           <p>"On examination I find nothing therein but what hath already been ſtated in the joint report of the Regiſter-General and myſelf on the revenues to the Governor, and which hath been heretofore laid before you, except the poſitive opinion (for they merit not the name of reaſons) of Mr. <hi>Febiger,</hi> and ſome deductions therefrom which are worthy of himſelf.</p>
                           <p>"The facts being ſtated and before the Legiſlature, I ſhould ſuppoſe they needed not the aid of Mr. <hi>Febiger's</hi> opinion on the ſubject: If any members of the preſent Houſe regret the parting with the ſtock in the manner which was done, or the mode of the redemption of the debt, whether that, on which an intereſt had been pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able half yearly, the unfunded depreciation debt, or the New-Loan debt (the two latter of which were only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable through the intervention of the Loan of the United States). They will find the cauſes thereof in the Redemption Act of laſt year; and while they lament the adoption of ſuch a ſyſtem, when a more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one was within their reach, they have alſo to be thankful to Congreſs that it was no worſe, for had the Legiſlature of the United States thought proper to have adopted the ſyſtem of loaning State debts in the extent and manner in which it was firſt brought before Congreſs, this law would alſo have obligated the ſtate to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately paid for all the old Bills of Credit emitted by the ſtate to carry on the war, and which might have been ſubſcribed to the Loan of the Union.</p>
                           <p>"I foreſaw, the effects that bill if paſſed, would have when it was before the Legiſlature, and did not fail, to members of both Houſes, to deprecate the conſequences of enacting it, both as it regarded the parting with ſtock and the redemption of the debt, and alſo mentioned its operation with reſpect to the ſeveral claſſes of debt aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="71" facs="unknown:027132_0079_0FD34EE260567528"/>"When it became a law, I availed myſelf of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it preſented as well as others, the proceedings are regular, the invitation for ſtock was public, all might apply, and the propoſals by Mr. <hi>Febiger,</hi> either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his "confidential Clerk" were as welcome as any other. With reſpect to the debt redeemed and for whom, it alſo ſtands on record, and hath been already laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and in my purchaſes or application for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, I never uſed the name of another, not even a "confidential Clerk," had I thought it wrong I ſhould not have done it, and it generally argues a conviction of impropriety to uſe the cover of another name, but this will be remembered that <hi>my</hi> purchaſes were not with the public money.</p>
                           <p>"As to the rates at which I purchaſed, they were ſuch as afforded a profit, or I would not have made them, although as he obſerves, and I ſuppoſe found, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of prices, ſoon brought up their value in the market, but it is none of his buſineſs what theſe profits were.</p>
                           <p>"There are I ſuppoſe miſtakes in the copy given me, where it reads, 365,000; 863,093 55/100 and 84,621 60/100 ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his mode of prefixing his figures, the firſt 8 in the three caſes I preſume were not originally ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, taking this to be the caſe, or otherwiſe I can't ſee what he hath to do with the buſineſs; whether pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my warrant was made to Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> myſelf, or any other perſon, to whom I choſe to give an order, nor do I ſee why he ſhould trouble the Legiſlature with the ſtory of my giving Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> an order for the principal and intereſt of the Dollar-money alſo redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                           <p>"The Dollar-money however was not mine, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a perſon who I believe thought himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded in finding Mr. <hi>Febiger</hi> appointed to ſucceed him in an office he reſigned and had once filled.</p>
                           <p>"From the ſtile of his letter one would think he had the merit, if there were any merit in it, of effecting every thing as well in the department of the Governor,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027132_0080_0FD34E5196895538"/>
as in that of the Regiſter-General and Secretary of the commonwealth, and that he had put a ſtop to it; the fact is the limited period put a ſtop to further ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but thoſe few ſubſcribed, aſſigned and not paid, will yet be done, the parties are legally entitled thereto, but as a doubt aroſe with the Governor, I paid Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> the caſh for the amount of his ſecond ſubſcription for which he was waiting that he might not he delayed as he was from a remote part of the State; the others were of this city and they have not ſince been brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till every objection be removed, but then the parties claim payment as their legal right. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but one thing more in Mr. <hi>Febiger's</hi> letter to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and that is the information from Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> office by his confidential Clerk and himſelf. They are both miſtaken or worſe, I never delayed an account at that office for ſubſcription till more ſhould be added. The firſt I took with the certificates, I made two copies of, to expedite my buſineſs, I left one of them with the Loan-officer, the other I got him to certify immediately, and it was transferred before I left the office, the next was a few days after and contained what I had purchaſed in the interim, I ſent them down by a meſſenger, and by him alſo they were brought back without remaining for any additional certificates to be added.</p>
                           <p>"On enquiry of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> I find (as I expected) that Mr. <hi>Febiger</hi> got no ſuch information from him.</p>

                              <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer hath been laid before you with his late repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and they alſo come under my conſideration, it may be proper to remark thereon, that the payments
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027132_0081_0FD34EE400B029A8"/>
of intereſt of the New-Loan debt in bills of credit as appears in ſaid accounts is in violation of the Act of the Legiſlature of the 7th April, 1791, which excepted thoſe bills from re-iſſue or payment, and I was aſtoniſhed on the exchange of the New-Loan certificates lately for <hi>Joſeph Pennel,</hi> 
                              <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to be informed by him that he had juſt been paid in thoſe bills and was unable to get any other, and wanted to know what he could do to get the money, I obſerve it is only to ſome perſons this intereſt hath been ſo paid therein.</p>
                           <p>"In his letter and in his accounts, he expreſſes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the Legiſlature would direct what is to be done with the old continental money and equivalents in his hands, they have already directed them to lie in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, which in my opinion is the beſt thing that could yet be done with them. But hath he obſerved theſe directions? no; if you look at his accounts No. 13, you will find that he hath been diſpoſing thereof of his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in a former account he hath diſpoſed of far the greater part of the whole continental money on like authority, and he had even the confidence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to me that he knew, at the time he did it that it was not authorized by the Legiſlature. The Aſſembly will pleaſe to obſerve that at the ſame time an offer was made the Legiſlature of ten per cent. advance upon what they would get if they choſe to loan it to the United States. As I will never paſs theſe ſums to his credit in violation of law and as in my eſtimation, they will be of more value than he ever will be able to pay, I think it neceſſary alſo to inform the Legiſlature that he hath neglected to give and record the ſurety required of him in the manner directed by law. The Houſe need not be informed that his former ſureties will not be bound for him under another appointment. There is one thing more which hath in ſome meaſure delayed the ſettlement of his accounts, notwithſtanding the Clerk of the late Treaſurer (who was at firſt employed by him, and ſo cruelly treated afterwards) muſt have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him as well of the buſineſs generally, as that
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027132_0082_0FD34E66A1B768A0"/>
receipts had always been taken for the intereſt paid or allowed on the redemption of the dollar-money, yet he neglected to do it, or if he did, to exhibit them as vouchers for the money ſo paid, this was the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as by an interpretation of law acted on, a great difference was made in the allowance between that emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion coming in by taxes and by other means; it is true he hath at laſt adopted that meaſure but is was towards the cloſe of the time.</p>

                           <p>"I HAVE read with attention the letter of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury of the U. S. dated 21 Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1791, and the two letters of the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dated 24th December, 1791, and 29th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1792, relative to the conſtruction of the 18th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act of Congreſs making proviſion for the debt of the U. S. It appears to me that the word <hi>"thoſe"</hi> in the enacting part of the clauſe can only apply to the certificates iſſued by the State, but as that never could be the meaning of the Act of Congreſs, I agree that the conſtruction given by the Secretary is the only rational one. Be that as it may, it is very certain that neither the New-Loan certificates of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> remaining in circulation, nor the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in exchange for which theſe New-Loans had been iſſued, have been ſurrendered to the U. S.—It is not leſs certain that the payment of intereſt, whether to the ſtate or to individuals has not been ſuſpended, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027132_0083_0FD34E5842A59CC0"/>
ſuſpenſion to the ſtate is but temporary, and ariſes merely from the extenſion of the former law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by their Act of laſt May, and will of courſe ceaſe on the firſt of March next, (if the former objections are not revived) and of courſe it muſt have appeared to the ſatisfaction of the Secretary of the Treaſury that all the New-Loan certificates have been re-exchanged or redeemed. To have conſidered them as ſuch is I ſuppoſe, what the Comptroller means by the "equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deciſion" of the Secretary. It is however of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us to know what were the real grounds of that deciſion, as it is poſſible that the ſubſcription made lately in New-Loan certificates to the loan of the U. S. may affect it materially. For if the Secretary conſidered the whole of the New-Loan certificates as actually re-exchanged or redeemed, it muſt have been, becauſe the ſtate law which entitled the holders to ſuch an exchange might been ſuppoſed to have been altogether carried into effect, ſince not a ſingle of thoſe certificates had been offered for ſubſcription to the loan of the U. S. But as ſome have been offered ſince the extenſion of the loan took place, that circumſtance may induce him to alter his opinion, and indeed I cannot well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how he may ſuppoſe himſelf juſtifiable in looking upon the whole amount as being actually re-exchanged, whilſt he has got it in proof, that ſome of them are not ſo. Upon the firſt impreſſion I ſhould be led to think that the Secretary having once declared (by his allowing the intereſt not to be ſuſpended) that the whole amount was re-exchanged (and that upon the information of the ſtate officer) will now look upon them in the ſame light and return them as not aſſumable, an opinion which I think, may alſo be ſupported on different ground both from the nature of the certificates themſelves and from the ſtate law of 1789, which declared the ſtate not to be liable for the payment of the principal.</p>
                           <p>"However as the whole of this reaſoning is moſtly conjectural, as the deciſion of the Secretary may, under the preſent circumſtances, lead him to ſuſpend the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027132_0084_0FD34E5A4F3D6DA0"/>
of intereſt to the ſubſcribers to the loan (ſince it was extended at leaſt) unleſs ſome legiſlative meaſures can prevent that inconvenience, permit me to ſuggeſt to you the propriety of procuring as ſoon as poſſible the neceſſary information on that ſubject, as I have no doubt the Houſe or the committee of ways and means will ſoon apply to you in an official manner for the ſame. The queſtions which appear to me the moſt neceſſary to be ſolved are the following—</p>
                           <p n="1">"1ſt. What were the grounds of the deciſion of the Secretary of the Treaſury relative to the intended ſuſpenſion of intereſt in Feb. 1791, and what conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did he give to the 18th ſection of the funding Act of Congreſs?</p>
                           <p n="2">"2d. Does he look now on the New-Loan certificates offered for ſubſcription to the loan of the U. S. as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable, if ſo, upon what ground? if not, upon what grounds alſo? and will he return them ſoon to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers?</p>
                           <p n="3">"3d. Will his deciſion relative to the ſuſpenſion of intereſt be the ſame now as laſt winter, and if it is not, what meaſures on the ſide of the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> will remove the difficulties that may in his opinion now prevent the payment of intereſt?</p>
                           <p>"I have choſen to communicate to you my ideas on that ſubject as an individual, rather than to wait for the formalities of official application taking place, in order to prevent delays; which I hope will be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient apology for this letter.</p>

                           <p>"It has been the uniform conſtruction of the Act making proviſion for the debt of the United States, that to render any certificates receivable on the loan it was not only neceſſary that they ſhould have been iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies towards the proſecution of the late war, but alſo that they ſhould at the time of being ſubſcribed be recognized by the exiſting laws of the States as <hi>evidences of debts</hi> by them reſpectively owing.</p>
                           <p>"It was not, till lately underſtood, that any doubts were entertained whether the New-Loan certificates were in fact debts due by the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> in every ſenſe neceſſary to bring them within the meaning of the Act of Congreſs; it is certain, that no ſuch doubts were ſuggeſted to the Treaſury.</p>
                           <p>"The commiſſioner of loans was accordingly adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in June 1791 that the certificates which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the State in lieu of certificates of the U. S. were receivable on loan, though at the ſame time he was inſtructed with a view to future convenience to uſe his endeavours with the holders to exchange them with the State.</p>
                           <p>"In conſequence of an explanation which was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered neceſſary by the proviſions contained in the 18th ſection of the Act making proviſion for the debt of the U. S. it appeared that none of the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had been ſubſcribed to the loan of the U. S. That only the ſum of about forty thouſand pounds of ſaid certificates remained to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, and that adequate and final arrangements had been made for exchanging the remainder by the State.</p>
                           <p>"This being the ſtate of the caſe it became neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to determine whether the payment of intereſt on the aſſumed debt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was to remain ſuſpended until a ſum in certificates of the United States, equal to the amount of New-Loan Certificates remaining un-exchanged, was ſurrendered to the Treaſury.</p>

to prevent intereſt from being twice paid on what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally conſtituted one debt; an event which could not in this caſe happen; as it appeared inconſiſtent with equity, that the ſtate ſhould be required to ſurrender the certificates which were the ſole conſideration for which they had become indebted to their citizens when no equivalent had been ſtipulated therefor by the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States; as ſuch a ſurrender would defeat the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by the ſtate for effecting a re-exchange of the outſtanding certificates, and a juſt ſettlement with their creditors, as a ſuſpenſion of the payment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on the aſſumed debt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> would prove highly injurious to the rights of individuals; and laſtly, as it appeared to me that the terms and intent of the law could be ſatisfied without aſſuming a conſtruction liable to the ſtrong objections before ſtated, I could not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to determine, that a ſurrender on the part of the ſtate was not neceſſary.</p>
                           <p>"I have been the more explicit in my reply to the firſt queſtion propoſed by Mr. <hi>Gallalin,</hi> as it appears to be the moſt important, and for the purpoſe of evincing that as the caſe was then preſented, no doubt was or could be entertained, that the New-Loan certificates might have been ſubſcribed to the loan of the United States. If however the New-Loan certificates are not by the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> conſidered as <hi>debts,</hi> but merely as receipts for certificates of the United States, which may be demanded at pleaſure—then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the general rule of conſtruction, the New-Loan certificates of the ſtate will not be conſidered as receivable on loan to the United States, and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the ſubſcribers.</p>

                           <p>"AGREEABLY to the deſire of the Committee of Ways and Means, I ſubmit the following ſtate of facts, relative to the redeeming certain abſtracts of New-Loan Certificates, as ſtated in my report to the Honorable Legiſlature on the 14th January laſt, and contained in Book A, Article No. 3.</p>
                           <p>"It having been previouſly arranged with the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury, that the abſtracts with receipts aſſigned to the Commonwealth, ſhould be ſufficient to authoriſe the proper officers of the United States to iſſue the certificates to be granted thereon, direct to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027132_0088_0FD34E5E920A06D8"/>
The ſubſcribing ſtate creditors preſented a liſt, together with the certificates, to the Comptroller-General, who examined and certified their aſſumable and genuine quality, without deſcribing the kind of debt; on which certificate the officer of loans granted the party a receipt on an abſtract, which abſtract and receipt were generally preſented to this office, and aſſigned to the commonwealth. An examination with reſpect to the caſting and intereſt took place, and ſubmitted to the Comptroller for his examination and approbation, when, if approved by him, a certificate to the Governor from his office, was ſent to this office, of the amount of the redeemable debt and intereſt, which was counterſigned by the Regiſter, and ſent to the Secretary, on which a warrant iſſued on the Treaſury.</p>
                           <p>"Of the abſtracts in queſtion, No. 264-5-6-8, and one in favour of <hi>David Rittenhouſe,</hi> 
                              <abbr>Eſq</abbr> were aſſigned, and ſent from the Comptroller-General to this office, examined and entered as before ſtated, and returned to the Comptroller-General on the 7th July, and warrants iſſued the 9th, and were entered in this office on the 10th.</p>
                           <p>Abſtract, No. 262, was ſent in the ſame manner from the Comptroller's office, entered in this the 9th July, and a warrant iſſued on the 12th, and was entered the 14th in this office.</p>
                           <p>"Abſtract, No. 272, was preſented by Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> on the 17th July, which was the firſt time I knew of any New-Loans being ſubſcribed to the Loan of the United States, and not before. A conference took place between Comptroller and Regiſter, in which it was ſtated by the Comptroller, that they were within the Act of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and were certainly redeemable. In this I concurred, provided the conditions ſtipulated by the Act of the United States, could be complied with: This he obſerved was a matter of the United States, and that he had or would conſult the Secretary of the Treaſury on the buſineſs.</p>
                           <p>"About this time, I had a conference with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> who informed me that he had heard
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027132_0089_0FD34EE5A705B730"/>
much of this buſineſs, and that it was wrong, in which the Attorney-General agreed with him—That he would put the queſtion in writing to him, and tranſmit official directions for my government.</p>
                           <p>"In conſequence of the communications with Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> and the Treaſurer, there was a ſtop put to the buſineſs until the Attorney-General's opinion ſhould be obtained in writing, which the Secretary applied for on the 23d July, and received an anſwer the 28th, and tranſmitted the ſame to this office on the 31ſt July.</p>
                           <p>"No payments were made for any abſtracts contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing New-Loan Certificates, after the communications with the Secretary, Treaſurer and Comptroller, ſave the one in favor of Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> No. 272, for 217 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and 69 cents.</p>

                     <p>That by a law paſſed on the 10th day of April 1792, amongſt other proviſion made for the redemption and final diſcharge of ſundry debts due by the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; in the ſixth ſection, it is enacted, That if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall on or before the firſt day of July next, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and again open the ſubſcription to the loan hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſed to the ſtate creditors, or ſhall in any other manner or upon any other terms, provide for the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the non-ſubſcribed debts owing to ſuch ſtate cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, the holder or holders of any certificate or certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, ſubſcribable to the ſubſcription ſo renewed, or entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the benefit of ſuch other proviſion, ſhall be entitled to have and receive the nominal value of the ſaid certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate or certificates from the State-Treaſurer, upon this condition and not otherwiſe: that they ſhall and do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the loan ſo renewed, or acquieſce in the terms of ſuch other proviſion, and thereupon, on or before the firſt day of July next, transfer to the State-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, for the uſe of the commonwealth, each and every
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027132_0092_0FD327D99F904AB0"/>
the certificate and certificates which they ſhall receive from the United States, in conſequence of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, or all and ſingular the intereſts and benefits to be derived from ſuch other proviſion, together with the proper evidences thereof.</p>
                     <p>That by the arrangements taken in conſequence of the law of Congreſs, extending the terms of their former loan, no certificates could iſſue in favor of the ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, prior to the 1ſt day of May 1793; whereupon, it having been agreed that the receipts given by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of loan, to the ſubſcribing ſtate creditors, ſhould be aſſigned to the commonwealth, and that the certificates from the Loan-office, ſhould iſſue directly to the commonwealth; the buſineſs was conducted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the following regulations: When the holder of any ſtate-certificate or certificates, wiſhed to ſubſcribe the ſame to the loan propoſed by Congreſs, and to avail himſelf of the benefit of the above-mentioned law of the commonwealth, paſſed in April 1792, he preſented ſuch certificate or certificates, with an abſtract of the ſame, ſpecifying the number, date, by whom and to whom iſſued, and the amount of the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to the Comptroller- General, who after examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation certified on the face of the abſtract, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were genuine and aſſumable. The abſtract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then preſented to the commiſſioner of loan, and the certificates themſelves depoſited with him, the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner gave to the party a receitps for the ſame on the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract. The abſtract and receipt were then aſſigned to the commonwealth, and preſented to the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Comptroller-General for examination, and if approved, a certificate ſigned by the two officers, was ſent to the Governor, ſtating the amount due to the party, and a warrant for the ſame, thereupon iſſued according to law.</p>
                     <p>That amongſt other abſtracts thus declared to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable by the Comptroller, which paſſed the ſeveral offices, and the nominal amount of which (including both principal and intereſt,) was conſequently paid to the reſpective holders out of the State-Treaſury, there
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027132_0093_0FD34EEC16A82008"/>
were ſundry certificates of that deſcription commonly called New-Loan, and which were iſſued by virtue of an Act, entitled <q>An Act for the further relief of the public creditors, who are citizens of this ſtate, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving on loan certain debts of the United States of <hi>America,</hi> and for funding the ſame, and for paying the annual intereſt of ſuch loans, and the intereſt of certain debts of this ſtate, every ſix months,</q> paſſed on the firſt day of March 1786; part of which Act was repealed by the Act, entitled <q>An Act to repeal ſo much of any Act or Acts of Aſſembly of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the intereſt thereof, beyond the 1ſt day of April next, and for other purpoſes therein mentioned,</q> paſſed on the 27th day of March 1789, wherein it is enacted that the continental certificates received by the ſtate by virtue of the former Act, ſhall be returned to the holders of New-Loan certificates, upon their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſame, and that "ſo much of every Act or Acts of General Aſſembly as directs or ſecures the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal ſum or ſums, in the ſaid certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or any of them mentioned, or of the intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beyond the term of four years, ſhall be, and the ſame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</p>
                     <p>That the total amount of the New-Loan certificates thus redeemed by the ſtate, at their nominal value, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the intereſt, amounts to 63,075 dollars and 37 cents; 60,220 dollars and 41 cents of which, were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the name, and of courſe appear to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>John Nicholſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The committee are of opinion that the Comptroller-General, in the above-mentioned tranſactions, has been guilty of a high miſdemeanor:—</p>
                     <p>Firſt. By certifying the aſſumable quantity of the New-Loan certificates; the greater part of the ſame being his own property.</p>
                     <p>Second, By paſſing and certifying the ſame to the Executive in the uſual forms of office; thereby cauſing them to be redeemed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:027132_0094_0FD34EEE62042CF8"/>The opinion of the committee on the firſt point, is founded upon the following conſiderations—</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. They conceive, that ſince the Act of March 1789, above mentioned, the New-Loan certificates ceaſed to be a ſtate debt; were not, therefore, within the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and could not be ſubſcribed to the loan propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatever the deciſion of the officers of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the United States might be on the preceding poſition, as it was not, by law, the official duty of the Comptroller-General to decide on it, he ought not to have done ſo, when a deciſion given under the colour of office operated in his own favor, at the expence of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. In certifying the New-Loan certificates to be aſſumable, he neither conſulted the Regiſter-General, nor communicated the tranſaction to the Governor; and as neither the abſtracts on the face of which the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity was certified, nor the official certificates on which warrants were iſſued, did diſcriminate the kind of debt that was redeemed; the checks provided by law were thereby deſtroyed, and the other officers of the ſtate deluded into error.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. The Comptroller-General knew, by a former deciſion of the Secretary of the Treaſury of the United States, that at all events the New-Loan certificates could not be recognized as aſſumable, unleſs an equal amount of continental certificates was delivered to the Secretary aforeſaid; which no law authoriſed the Comptroller to do: and he was appriſed that the payment of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the ſubſcribing ſtate creditors and to the ſtate, on account of the aſſumption, would have been ſuſpended, when the time limited for receiving ſubſcriptions to the former loan of Congreſs expired, had it not, upon inveſtigation, appeared that no New-Loan certificates had been ſubſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of the committee on the ſecond point, ariſes from conſidering that, independent of the qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Whether the New-Loan certificates were within
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027132_0095_0FD34EF2C80F9D28"/>
the aſſumption of the United States, they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable by the Act of April 1792? and this appears from the following conſiderations—</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. No funds were provided by the Act for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of thoſe certificates.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The ſixth ſection of the Act can only be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a proviſo and exception to the preceding ſections by which the redemption of certain deſcriptions of debts, which do not include the New-Loan certificates, were excluſively and ſolely contemplated.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. Even the ſixth ſection, ſuppoſing it to ſtand alone, cannot admit of the conſtruction given by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, as it deſignates only ſtate-creditors, and by the exiſting laws of the commonwealth, the holders of New-Loan certificates are declared not to be ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Having ſtated this ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ral view of the ſubject, the committee deem it their duty to preſent the following reſolutions to the conſideration of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of this commonwealth, be impeached for a high miſdemeanor in his office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That the Attorney-General be directed to inſtitute a ſuit againſt the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> to recover, for the uſe of the commonwealth, the amount of the New-Loan certificates, which have been redeemed and paid at the Treaſury of this ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The committee in the courſe of their enquiries upon this occaſion, have found reaſon to lament, that in the execution of the various, important and confidential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (embracing the emiſſion of certificates and the care and management of other public property to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe amount) which have from time to time been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Comptroller-General, an adequate check has in few caſes been provided, and, in fewer ſtill, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced. They conceive, therefore, that the honor and intereſt of the ſtate, require an early and effectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the Comptroller's official tranſactions; and they would be wanting in their duty to the public and to themſelves, were they not to offer an earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027132_0096_0FD34FD35404ADF8"/>
that the following reſolution ſhould be adopted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That a committee be appointed to examine, during the receſs of the Houſe, all the accounts and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial tranſactions of the Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, and to report thereon at the next ſeſſion of the Legiſlature.</p>

                           <p>"The 18th ſection of the Act, making proviſion for the debt of the United States, ſuſpends the payment of intereſt in reſpect to the debt of any ſtate which ſhall have iſſued its own certificates in exchange for thoſe of the United States, until it ſhall be ſatisfactorily made to appear, that the certificates iſſued for that purpoſe by ſuch ſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have been <hi>re-exchanged,</hi> or <hi>redeemed,</hi> or until thoſe which ſhall not have been re-exchanged or redeemed, ſhall be ſurrendered to the United States.</p>
                           <p>"It is underſtood that the meaſure contemplated in this ſection, was adopted by the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> that is, that a ſum of ſtate certificates was iſſued in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for an equal ſum of certificates of the federal debt, and that although a part of thoſe certificates has been redeemed, others to a conſiderable amount, have not been re-exchanged or redeemed, it will conduce as well to the order of the finances, as to the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the public creditors, the payment of intereſt to whom muſt be otherwiſe ſuſpended, if meaſures can be taken by the government of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to make the balance unredeemed and unexchanged to appear, and if they ſhould direct the ſurrender of the amount of ſuch ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in certificates of federal debt in their old form, ſhould the ſurrender of them in that form be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the circumſtance of the ſubſcription of federal debt, which was directed by the Legiſlature, an equal ſum, of ſix per cent. deferred, and three per cent. ſtock, in ſuch

proportions as the balance or deficiency would produce on ſubſcription, may be paid in lieu of certificates in their old form. This will be at the election of the ſtate, and can be affected by no circumſtance but their own convenience, as there can be no pecuniary advantage or diſadvantage in either mode. I have, &amp;c.</p>

It is cuſtomary for letters and docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, preſented to the Speaker, to be noted on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, ſo as to inform the reader of the purport and contents of ſuch letters or documents, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances here alluded to, no intimation is given of their contents, purport, requeſt or any of the uſual formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, but, <hi>"A letter from</hi> John Nicholſon <hi>was read, and ordered to lie on the table."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A motion was made by Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> ſeconded by Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> and agreed to, That the committee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 5th to examine the accounts and official tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Comptroller-General, or any member of the ſaid committee that ſhall have power to examine, at all ſeaſonable hours, all the books, accounts, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, certificates and official documents whatſoever, which may be in the cuſtody of either the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Regiſter-General or the State-Treaſurer, to take

                     <p>The committee of accounts reported eight hundred dollars in favor of the Chairman, Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the expences attending the inveſtigation of the official tranſactions of the Comptroller-General during the receſs, he to be accountable.</p>
                     <p>Meſſrs. <hi>Swanwick</hi> and <hi>Gallatin</hi> were appointed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Senate that the Houſe of Repreſentatives were ready to cloſe the preſent ſeſſion.

                        <p>"Two enquiries might be neceſſary on the preceding tranſactions—Firſt, <hi>Whether no continental certificates were received on loan, except ſuch as were admiſſable by law?</hi> As almoſt the total amount of thoſe certificates have been returned to the parties, or ſubſcribed to the loan of the United States, it is not poſſible at preſent to inveſtigate that point; but as the committee of Council examined all thoſe certificates, it amounts nearly to a proof that they were within the deſcription authoriſed by law to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.—Second, <hi>Whether no New-Loan certificates have been iſſued, except for the continental certificates received on loan?</hi> From the examination of the committee of Council, it is known that the regiſtry of certificates correſponded with the certificates themſelves that were received on loan, therefore by comparing the New-Loan certificates, cancelled and delivered to the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, with the regiſtry of certificates iſſued, it will be eaſy to ſee whether they agree; ſhould there appear any certificates which are not entered in the regiſtry, the Comptroller muſt be accountable for them; but as the delivery of thoſe certificates has but juſt now been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, it is neceſſary in order to have complete ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on that head, to wait until the Regiſter-General ſhall have arranged them in numerical order.</p>

By that book it ſhould appear, that the number of renewed certificates, iſſued for continental certificates, other than thoſe dated between the 1ſt day of September, 1777, and the 1ſt day of March, 1778, was £. 460,035:7:2; this amount is the one adopted by the committee, as the certificates themſelves to that amount have been delivered to the Regiſter. The difference is £. 1,118:0:9.</note> amounting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to £. 477,231:15:2. That cuſtom, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all the different deſcriptions of certificates, though publicly known, does not appear to have been authoriſed by law. The reaſons alledged to juſtify it, are, that the intereſt of the ſtate was promoted thereby, inaſmuch as it facilitated the payments in the Land-Office; and that it accommodated individuals very much, not only on account of ſuch payments, but alſo in order to enable original or other holders, who were obliged to ſell a part of their certificates, to diſpoſe of only a part, and to keep what they did not wiſh to ſell. It produced, however, at laſt, one very great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which was taking up too great a proportion of the time of an officer, whoſe duties were, perhaps, already too numerous. At all events it would have been better to have applied to the Legiſlature, in order to receive their ſanction. It muſt alſo be obſerved, that that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice had taken place in ſome inſtances, before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Comptroller; the Auditors appointed to ſettle the accounts, and iſſue the certificates for the depreciation of pay, having renewed ſome of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates they had granted.</p>

                        <p>"In order fully to underſtand how they were kept, it is neceſſary firſt to know in what manner the exchange was proceeded upon. An account of the New-Loan certificates he offered to be exchanged, was prepared, including the numbers of the ſame, and names of the grantees; the principal ſum of each certificate, the number of years, intereſt paid by the ſtate, and the date from which each began to bear intereſt, together with the amount of intereſt, either due on the face of the certificates upon the 31ſt day of December, 1787, or paid by the ſtate beyond the ſame date. To thoſe calculations were added, on the ſame account, the numbers and amount of the continental certificates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by him in exchange, together with the date of intereſt commencing, and the amount of intereſt due on each, reſpectively, on the 31ſt day of December, 1787. This laſt amount, together with the amount of intereſt paid by the ſtate, upon the New-Loan certificates offered to be exchanged beyond the 31ſt day of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1787, was charged to the party applying for the exchange; and the amount of intereſt due on the face of the New-Loan certificate thus offered for exchange on the ſaid 31ſt day of December, 1787, was carried to the credit of the ſaid party; and the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two amounts, was the ſum to be paid in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or 3 per cent, ſtock, either by, or to the party, in order to equalize the intereſt. All the accounts were numbered and filed; at the ſame time were entered, in diſtinct columns, in the book of continental certificates returned, the number of continental certificates returned to, and of New-Loan certificates received from each party; the amount of principal in ſpecie dollars of the continental certificates: the date of intereſt commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each; the amount of intereſt due on each on the 31ſt day of December, 1787; and the amount of

                        <p>In the book of New-Loan certificates received on exchange, which was filed afterwards by the help of the numbered accounts, were entered the number of each certificate received; the names of the grantees; the ſums of principal of each certificate; the years of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt paid by the ſtate as endorſed on the back of each certificate; the date at which intereſt commenced on the face of each certificate; and the amount of intereſt either due on the certificate on the 31ſt of December, 1787, or overpaid by the ſtate beyond the ſame date. In diſtinct columns were entered the numbers and amount of the New-Loan certificates, called <hi>Surplus Certificates,</hi> which were at firſt iſſued by virtue of the reſolutions of Council above-mentioned, in thoſe caſes where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act amount of the New-Loan offered for exchange, could not be paid in Continental certificates. After the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offices of the United States had been removed to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> that mode was no longer purſued, but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which might be due to the parties, was, by the Comptroller, aſſigned to them in 6 per cent. and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtock, or regiſtered debt upon the books of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the United States. It is alſo proper here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that although the above-deſcribed mode of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was the common one, yet in ſome inſtances it was not followed, but the Comptroller aſſigned on the ſaid books of the Treaſury, to the parties, an amount of 6 per cent. deferred, and 3 per cent. ſtock. equal to the amount of New-Loans offered by them for exchange. Whether this was done by the Comptroller's going and ſubſcribing himſelf for the parties, the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates due to them, or whether he had previouſly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for that purpoſe a number of Continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates depoſited with him, your committee cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend poſitively to decide.

it might be, it was altogether unauthoriſed, either by law, or by any reſolutions of Council that have come to the knowledge of the committee. The books of Continental certificates delivered ſo far as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipted, are a complete proof of their being delivered, and at all events, that tranſaction will be checked by the examination of the New-Loan certificates delivered to the Regiſter.</p>

                        <p>The bulk of thoſe certificates were received from the Receiver-General of the Land-Office, and ſets of books were opened by the Comptroller, formed from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts delivered by the Receiver-General, containing the principal ſums of the certificates, the date to which intereſt had been paid upon each certificate, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt calculated upon each from that date to the 1ſt of January, 1791. The amount of the New-Loan certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates thus redeemed, is £.118,470:6:6 <note n="(h)" place="margin">Thoſe books do not contain the numbers of the certificates; but ſo far as relates to the New-Loan certificates there is another auxiliary book containing the numbers of the certificates; the names of the grantees, the amount of principal, and the number of years; of intereſt paid at the time the Comptroller received the certificates. That book was formed by the Comptroller, from the certificates themſelves; but as the amount of thoſe books, to wit, £. 118,179:10:6, did not agree with the amount of the other book, the committee adopted the reſult of this, it being checked by the Receiver-General's accounts, and having been compared therewith by the Regiſter-General.</note>.</p>

                        <p>"The account A, is introductory to the others, and exhibits the general account of the New-Loan debt. By that account it appears that the amount of New-Loan certificates yet in circulation, is £. 33,722:3, which amount includes thoſe offered for ſubſcription to the loan of the United States. The Comptroller has prepared from his books a liſt of the identical certificates thus outſtanding; but it is not perfectly checked; as ſoon as the Regiſter-General ſhall have arranged the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates delivered to him in numerical order, he will be able to form an accurate liſt of the ſame.</p>

By an Act paſſed on the 10th of April, 1781, Council were empowered to appoint additional Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the purpoſe of carrying into operation the laſt mentioned Act; they were alſo directed to draw upon the State-Treaſurer for ſuch ſums of ſtate-money as they thought convenient, and to place the ſame in the hands of commiſſioners to be appointed for that purpoſe, who ſhould, before the firſt day of May following, repair to the ſeveral rendezvous of the regiments, and pay to ſuch of the officers and ſoldiers who ſhould apply for the ſame, one third part of the ſums ſpecified in the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation certificates, iſſued to them by the Auditors; and after receiving the old certificates, ſhould tranſmit them to the Treaſurer, and iſſue new ones for the balance. By the ſame Act it was provided that ſuch perſons as ſhould not apply to the commiſſioners, might at any time afterwards apply to the Treaſurer, who was directed likewiſe to pay one third of the original certificates in ſtate-money, and to iſſue new ones for the balance. In conformity to thoſe two laws, <hi>James Stevenſon</hi> and <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> were appointed auditors and commiſſioners, together with ſeveral other perſons, but the preſence of one of them was declared to be neceſſary in tranſacting the buſineſs of commiſſioners, and they were directed to collect all the papers and vouchers relative to thoſe tranſactions.

                        <p>"Previous to the appointment of the Comptroller-General, the Auditors and Commiſſioners veſted with the power of iſſuing depreciation certificates, went, according to the orders of Council, to ſeveral poſts, and there ſettled the accounts; iſſued the certificates, and made the payments in ſhilling money. The Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller is in poſſeſſion of the books they kept of their tranſactions; of the counter parts of the certificates iſſued by them, and other vouchers.

the other third having been paid in ſhilling-money. Thoſe books, therefore, are not, alone, ſufficient to ſettle either the general account of depreciation debt, or the account of the Comptroller with the depreciation certificates by him received. For in order to know the total amount of the depreciation debt paid by the ſtate, it is neceſſary to add to the amount of the original certificates iſſued, the amount of ſhilling-money paid upon ſettlement, excluſively of thoſe certificates; and the Comptroller, excluſively of all the certificates he may ſtand charged with for renewals, muſt alſo he charged with the whole amount of the ſhilling-money paid in part of original certificates, as the amount of thoſe original certificates delivered by the parties, upon receiving one-third thereof in ſaid money, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in new certificates, exceeds the amount of thoſe renewed certificates exactly by the amount of ſhilling-money, thus paid the parties in part.</p>
                        <p>"The Comptroller, at the requeſt of the committee, furniſhed them with copies of the accounts of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Commiſſioners appointed to pay that ſhilling-money, as ſettled by the former Auditors of accounts, and as thoſe accounts did not in all caſes diſtinguiſh between the money paid upon ſettlement, and the money paid in part of certificates, he, by ſundry letters and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randums, informed the committee of the ſums reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively paid.

It appears, however, by the letter of the Comptroller to the Governor, dated the 22d day of June 1792, that he made out the certificates only upon the application of the parties, and of courſe that the claims, and not the certificates unapplied for, eſcheated to the commonwealth by virtue of the Act above-mentioned.

                        <p>"Three enquiries ariſe on the ſubject of the iſſuing depreciation certificates—1ſt. Have no other certificates been iſſued than thoſe entered upon the books of iſſue? 2d.

Have the certificates always been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the perſons in whoſe name they had iſſued, or to their legal repreſentatives? The anſwer to the firſt query may be obtained, from a compariſon of the books, with the certificates delivered to the Regiſter, after the ſame ſhall have been numerically arranged, and with the liſt of thoſe ſubſcribed to the loan of the United States. Should any certificates appear, upon ſuch examination,

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond enquiry will require a minute compariſon of every certificate, with the number, rolls and other vouchers upon which the certificates iſſued. As to the third, it will be very difficult fully to aſcertain it, becauſe prior to the law of the 25th March, 1786, no receipts were taken for certificates either iſſued by the Auditors or the Comptroller. There is however a kind of indirect proof, by which a great part of thoſe certificates are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to have been iſſued to the parties themſelves. Many of the certificates were aſſigned, and receipts were taken on the back of thoſe which were diſcharged in part, in ſhilling money for the ſame. The commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee were furniſhed by the Regiſter-General with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates delivered to him by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller; they examined them, ſet aſide all thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them, upon the face of the ſame, to bear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their having been delivered to the parties; and formed a liſt of the others, a copy of which they are to tranſmit to the Comptroller, as he thinks he may collect ſome other indirect proofs reſpecting many certificates upon which no receipt nor aſſignment appear <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Moſt of the receipts and aſſignments are irregular for want of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</note>.</p>
                        <p>—A ſimilar examination ſhould take place in regard to the certificates delivered by the Treaſurer to the Regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to thoſe ſubſcribed to the loan of the United States, if they can be obtained for that purpoſe.

The committee were anxious to inveſtigate whether thoſe certificates had always iſſued upon proper principles, and for debts juſtly due, and whether they had always been granted to the parties thereto entitled. But as all the vouchers and receipts relative thereto, were, (as the Comptroller informed the committee) lodged with the commiſſioners appointed to ſettle the accounts of the individual ſtates with the United States, it was thought better to defer the inveſtigation, till after the 1ſt day of July, at which time the appointment of the commiſſioners expired. When that day came, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Comptroller informed the committee, that thoſe papers were kept in the poſſeſſion of the United States, both as vouchers of the claims of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and as checks againſt future demands that might hereafter be made by individuals. The committee applied a few days after to the Secretary of the Treaſury of the United States, for leave of having acceſs to thoſe vouchers— This was granted by the Secretary, (as will appear by his letter of the 17th of July) provided the examination was confined to the papers of the commonwealth, and not extended to any ſtatements or remarks of the late commiſſioners; but it was at the ſame time requeſted that the inſpection ſhould be deferred till the return of Mr. <hi>Farrel,</hi> late clerk of the commiſſioners, who alone knew the diſpoſition of the papers, and was then abſent. Upon being informed of the return of Mr. <hi>Farrel,</hi> the committee wrote a ſecond letter to the Secretary on the 5th of Auguſt. Orders were accordingly given to Mr. <hi>Farrel</hi> to attend the committee at any hour they thought convenient, and from the 13th of Auguſt, they had free acceſs to all the papers they wanted; but the time being

This laſt mode (to wit, to deliver certificates to ſome perſons who gave receipts for the ſame, and promiſed to diſtribute them to the parties) was adopted chiefly to facilitate the payment of militia companies. The total amount thus delivered is as per an annexed liſt £.91,987:8:2 ¼; books have been kept of the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates delivered in that manner, in which each individual ſtands charged with the certificates by him received, and he is to be credited either by producing the receipt of the party, or by returning the certificates.

                        <p>—Finding in this anſwer that <hi>Samuel Baird,</hi> 
                           <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was the perſon alluded to, I think it proper firſt to declare that this gentleman is one for whom I have long had a friendſhip, and of whoſe integrity I have an high eſtimation; ſome things are alledged againſt him in ſome of theſe purchaſes, and a ſuit is depending in which I ſhall be ſorry if I ſhall be found to have been miſtaken in his character.—After this I proceed to take a view of the ſituation of his purchaſes, and of this ſubject gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, firſt, I find that the number of claims of this claſs rendered amount to 366.</p>
                        <p>"Second, I find that of theſe, 66 were rendered by ſaid <hi>Baird,</hi> of which two were for General and <hi>D. St. Clair,</hi> and were not claimed by him, but received by themſelves reſpectively.</p>
                        <p>"Third, Although it required no official information to diſtinguiſh thoſe gentlemen in the country, who had ſerved as officers in the late army, ſo as to apply only to thoſe who were entitled; yet we find, and the committee,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027132_0153_0FD34FE1259AC520"/>
from the books laid before them, had an opportunity to obſerve that of the 64 claims rendered by <hi>Saml. Baird,</hi> there were two, <hi>Chriſtopher Gettig</hi> and <hi>Caſper Wetzel's</hi> eſtate, who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>"Fourth. Another queſtion whether he obtained previous information from me of the clothing received by the different officers, ſo as to aſcertain the balances due, can beſt be refuted by a view of the facts. Of the 62 claims remaining as aforeſaid, preſented by him, the following perſons had received ſuch a quantity of cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to leave a balance due by them to the State on ſaid account, viz.

Indeed, I cannot conceive of his commanding a company in this regiment, to which he was attached, and being muſtered at all, without being muſtered where he ſerved; theſe muſters do not ſpecify the ſtate to which the officers reſpectively belonged. He was not commiſſioned as an officer of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> line, by his being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> line; the Act of Congreſs aforeſaid, (not of the ſtate) allowed him to be treated in the ſame manner, &amp;c.—to be like another, and to be that other, are different.</p>

officers; but you will alſo obſerve, that although all this was done at the time to procure theſe ſtores for him, yet they could not be obtained, Why! he was not a <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> officer; and they were delivered only, as appears by the receipt on the back, to the other officers.</p>
                                          <p>"And further, he did not receive his depreciation of pay from this ſtate, but that to which he belonged.</p>
                                          <p>"Moreover, when, according to the very act on which arrearages are now claimed, clothing was provided at the time, by the Council, for each perſon entitled, they directed a ſuit for each of the other officers of this company, and none for captain <hi>Simonds.</hi> If he was not entitled to clothing then, he could not be entitled to arrears therefor afterwards.</p>

                        <p n="1">"1ſt. That the claim for clothing would range under none of the heads which the law gives thoſe officers power to adjuſt. Whoever reads the law inſtituting the Comptroller-General's office, will need no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this reaſon.</p>

                        <p>—It is true that with moſt of the accounts and vouchers filed in the office, there is an abſtract of the account digeſted in debit and credit, which is by itſelf a kind of waſte book, and may be copied by any Clerk. From what has been

ſaid, it follows that none of thoſe general books are kept in regard to time; but the accounts are numbered, filed, and entered, generally according to their number in the books.</p>
                        <p>"In many inſtances, the committee conceived the books of the office might have been kept in better order, and that a clearer general mode might have been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> line, an acceſs to which the committee were refuſed by the Comptroller.</p>
                        <p>"By a reſolution of Congreſs paſſed the 3d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1783, it was, Reſolved, That the Paymaſter-General depoſit in the hands of regimental Agents, the certificates for the arrears of pay due to the officers and ſoldiers of the reſpective lines, to be by them delivered to the individuals to whom they belong, or depoſited for their benefit as the ſupreme executive of the ſtate to which the reſpective Agents belong ſhall direct.</p>
                        <p>"By an arrangement which was rendered neceſſary on account of the diſperſed ſituation of the <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> line, two agents for the whole line, (inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental agents) to wit, Meſſrs. <hi>Bowen</hi> and <hi>Beatty</hi> were recommended by the officers of the line, approved of by Council, and their appointment confirmed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. Thoſe two agents proceeded to diſtribute the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates according to the directions and under the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Council, as by the annexed correſpondence will appear. They, upon an occaſion, ſent their reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Council, and always conceived themſelves to be officers reſponſible to the executive, and received £. 280:3:5 from the ſtate for their expences.</p>
                        <p>"On the 8th of April, 1785, they wrote to Council, that having nearly completed that buſineſs they were ready to depoſit the remaining certificates (together with their books and vouchers) as the ſupreme executive might direct, agreeable to the Reſolve of Congreſs of November 3, 1783; Whereupon Council, on the ſame day ordered that they ſhould be inſtructed to deliver the ſame to the Comptroller-General of the accounts of this commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>"The committee, by letter dated 24th June, 1793, requeſted the Comptroller to examine the books of the agents depoſited with him, alſo the certificates ſtill in his poſſeſſion and to have an account of the amount delivered by him—To this the Comptroller anſwered on the 27th of the ſame month, that he conſidered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as being accountable only to the United States, from

                        <p>"The ſuppoſition of the Comptroller-General being at the ſame time an officer of the United States and of the State, was too abſurd and unconſtitutional to be admitted, and the committee reſted ſatisfied with laying the fact before the Governor, mentioning at the ſame time that as the papers had been delivered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reſolutions of Congreſs, to ſuch officer as the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive of the State might direct, and without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Legiſlature, it might be perhaps ſuggeſted that the officer then choſen was accountable only to the Executive and not to the Legiſlature; they concluded by ſaying that they had no doubt of the Governor taking effectual meaſures to compel the officer to render a full account of that tranſaction—But although the Governor gave him peremptory orders to ſubmit thoſe books, vouchers and certificates to the committee, and tranſmitted to him a copy of the opinion of the Attorney-General dated June 20th, 1793, (in which he gives his official opinion, that thoſe books, certificates and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were ſubject to the direction and controul of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and that he had a competent power to order the Comptroller to deliver them to whoever he pleaſed, and of courſe to direct that they ſhould be ſubmitted to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the committee) the Comptroller has perſiſted in his refuſal—As it muſt be evident that the officers of the United States have no controul or power whatever over our own officers, and that theſe of courſe muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only to our own Executive who then will render an account of the ſame to the proper officers of the United States whenever required; no proper motive can be ſuggeſted that can juſtify the refuſal of the Comptroller; and if every thing has been fairly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by him in that buſineſs, obſtinacy muſt with him, on that occaſion, have prevailed over a ſenſe of his own intereſt and <hi>reputation.</hi> 25.</p>

                        <p>"Second, My reaſons for not exhibiting them to the ſaid committee, were, 1ſt, That they had nothing to do with them. 2d. That although the contrary was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, I deſigned, and I think I have not been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the examination even of that committee, ſhould operate to my public advantage. To do this it was neceſſary that all the time remaining (for I did not ſee them until a good deal of it had elapſed) ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the objects of their appointment. 3d. I was then in hopes to have been able to have thoſe accounts examined and fully ſettled, before the time of my trial, ſo as to have been able, publicly, to exhibit my <hi>quietus</hi> on thoſe accounts, from thoſe authoriſed to give it—to have ſubmitted them elſewhere, would have interfered therewith, and put it out of my power. True it is, that although they were principally prepared, and a part rendered to and examined, and paſſed by the United States, yet the diſeaſe that put many of us to flight, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and prevented the buſineſs. 4th. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I had another motive for refuſal, which was this, I found in ſome of theſe men a diſpoſition to convert to the uſes of this ſtate, at the expence of the United States, property which did not belong to them: before the loan of the United States for ſtate debt, cloſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretence of examining certain certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, to find whether all was right, thoſe who were moſt forward in this buſineſs, were in that, and cloaked under that reſolution, from the view of the Legiſlature of this ſtate, who, I think, would have ſpurned the idea, as well as from the knowledge of the United States, who would, if expoſed, have, as they did in the inſtance of a ſimilar attempt in another ſtate, prevented it— actually ſubſcribed to that loan open to individual cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors

Theſe I conceive to be the proper officers of the United States; and as the officers of the Treaſury of the United States are now as convenient, the party may as well apply there in future, with all their claims, as with a part: and I therefore determined to deliver over to the United States, to whom they belong all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining property as aforeſaid, not delivered out, on which I conſulted and had the approbation of the Governor, and am now making up theſe accounts, and preparing accordingly, and they will be completed as ſoon as I can.</p>

                                       <p>"ON the 3d inſt. I received your excellency's letter of the 1ſt, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the opinion of the Attorney-General of the 25th of June laſt; on this I have to obſerve,</p>
                                       <p n="1">"1ſt That this opinion is founded much on matters ſtated as a fact, which are not ſo, and which I ſhould have been able to prove, had the matter been put on the iſſue I propoſed.</p>
                                       <p n="2">"2d. That admitting the certificates depoſited with <hi>Bowen</hi> and <hi>Beatty,</hi> or with <hi>Bowen</hi> and <hi>Ruſh,</hi> who acted for <hi>Beatty;</hi> or with myſelf who acted for them both, were to be conſidered in the ſame view as thoſe depoſited with regimental agents, and therefore within the Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Nov. 3d, 1783, ſubjecting them to the order of the Supreme Executive of the ſtate, that power extends only to enable the Supreme Executive to order them out of the hands of one perſon or perſons, to be depoſited in the hands of another perſon or perſons, and declares for what purpoſe they ſhall be ſo depoſited, that is to be delivered out by them to the party. But as to the ſettlement of the accounts, the thing I am anxious to have done, it gives no ſuch power to the executives of the ſtate.</p>
                                       <p n="3">"3d. All the books I received from major <hi>Bowen</hi> in behalf of the agents, together with the papers other than the certificates, conſiſt of two large receipt books, orders and vouchers for the delivery of certificates. Theſe are yet unſettled, and will until adjuſted by the United States, to whom in their behalf I render them for that purpoſe, as they have deſired, whereby the ſaid account will be cloſed; the papers I have in this buſineſs are alſo vouchers, ſuch as orders, and receipts for delivery of certificates, which receipts I have generally taken in the ſaid agent's name, and which muſt (unleſs I ſettle with the agents) be adjuſted alſo with the United States, before the ſame accounts can be cloſed, the latter I intend to have done; the other papers reſpecting the delivery of certificates received from Mr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> are of the ſame kind, and to be ſettled in the ſame way with the United States.</p>
                                       <p n="4">"4th. I have been deſired by the United States ſo to ſettle, and a

part of theſe accounts, with the certificates were rendered, and are now under the examination in the offices, and I preſume my duty and honor both will be better purſued and preſerved in this way, than in ſubmitting them to thoſe who have nothing to do with them, more than other perſons, and by that means be prevented from obtaining a ſettlement in due time from thoſe legally authorized to do it.</p>

I do not wiſh that the ſtate ſhould be at unneceſſary expence in maintaining one, eſpecially as the cauſe hath been decided already, in the ſame court where this cauſe was propoſed by the committee of the late Houſe of Repreſentatives to be brought—For as to juriſdiction, the Supreme Court have, as already mentioned, allowed it to have been in me, by aſſuming it themſelves, in the caſes of appeal which have been cited; and as to principles adopted at ſettlement, they have, at leaſt, ſanctioned mine, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the ſtate, by themſelves, allowing more. One obſervation it is natural to make here: Theſe accounts were acted on, and approved both by the Governor and Regiſter-General.

                     <p>THE additional articles of impeachment were read the ſecond time—Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> appeared at the bar of the Houſe, and being duly ſworn, anſwered the following interrogatories.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> Have you been poſſeſſed of any New-Loan certificates in the year 1788?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I had a quantity of New-Loan certificates about that time, but at preſent cannot aſcertain their amount or numbers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By the ſame.</hi> Did you ſell a certificate of that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription amounting to £. 3275:19:4 to <hi>Blair M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> if yea, pleaſe to tell at what time?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It appears from my book, that I delivered ſuch a certificate to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> the 23d day April, 1788, which had been iſſued in my own name. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him many New-Loan certificates about that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſ. by Do.</hi> Do you know what he did with that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate whoſe amount was £. 3275:19; 4, did he ſell it, or did he exchange it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Impoſſible for me to tell what Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had done with it, the certificate was his own after he got it from me. I believe an exchange took place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Comptroller-General, but in this I am not poſitive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi> Have you a liſt of the names of the perſons to whom the certificates which you then had, were originally granted?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have a book at home, in which I have entered their amounts, &amp;c. but at this time I cannot be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> Had you any other New-Loan certificate of the ſame amount iſſued in your name, about that time, before that time, or ſince that period?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:027132_0194_0FD34FBA4D081EE0"/>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not likely that I ſhould have another of the ſame amount in my own name, it is impoſſible for me to aſcertain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſtion by</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi> Can you tell the number of that certificate, for £. 3275:19:4?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I cannot aſcertain it, not having the No. of that one in my book.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> Can you aſcertain the time when this certificate was iſſued, and whether it was an original one, or iſſued for a number of certificates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>conſolidating?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am inclined to think it had been iſſued in exchange for others by the means laſt mentioned: but I am not certain as to that, nor to the time when iſſued.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> obſerved he had no more queſtions to aſk, and that the witneſs might retire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans.</hi> Can you furniſh us with a liſt of the names of the perſons to whom iſſued, numbers, dates and amounts of the certificates which you deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> about the time alluded to?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have a book, from which I will extract ſuch dates, numbers, and amount as far as I have entered them, and will tranſmit a liſt to the Houſe as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>After which the witneſs retired.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon it was reſolved that the further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid additional articles of impeachment be poſtponed till the next day.</p>
                     <p>And the Speaker iſſued his ſummons to accelerate the attendance of <hi>Blair M,Clenachan</hi> to give teſtimony on theſe articles againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was on motion, Ordered that Meſſrs. <hi>Morgan, Evans</hi> and <hi>Gallatin,</hi> the three managers, ſhould procure atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed documents from Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Commiſſioner of Loans, to anſwer the purpoſes of evidence on theſe articles againſt the Comptroller.</p>
                     <p>The committee got no documents from him, at that time, he was in the country for fear of the yellow fever

which then raged in the city, and carried off about 18 perſons per day.</p>
                     <p>Three gentlemen, were appointed a committee by the Senate on the 2d to confer with a committee from the Houſe of Repreſentatives on the expediency of an adjournment of the Legiſlature.</p>

                     <p>THE committee appointed to confer with a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Senate on the expediency of an adjournment of the Legiſlature, made report; which was read, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz.</p>
                     <p>That in the conference held by your committee with the committee of the Senate, they declared that they did not conceive that the Houſe of Repreſentatives would be ready to take a queſtion upon the expediency of an adjournment until they knew what time was fixed by the Senate for the trial of the charges brought by the Houſe againſt <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General—Your committee thought it their duty alſo to mention, that although the Houſe could not controul the deciſion of the Senate on that point, yet, they knew, they were ready at any time to ſupport the charges and deſirous that the trial ſhould come on immediately, to which they added ſeveral reaſons to urge the propriety of a deciſion on that buſineſs taking place at this ſeſſion of the Legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>Your committee ſubmit the following reſolution—</p>

                        <p>He read the preamble to the Act of the 16th March, 1786, explaining the views of the Legiſlature to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the payment of the debts due to the citizens of this commonwealth, as Congreſs could not; the 13th ſection was then read as being more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the preſent caſe; the 14th ſection deſcribes the claſs of creditors to be relieved, and gives a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the certificates which were entitled to intereſt.</p>
                        <p>He read a long report of a grand committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Sept. 24, 1785, Journals of Congreſs, volume 10, page 310, 311, 329, and conſequent reſolution, by which it appeared that Congreſs were diſſatisfied at the mode purſued by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and forbid their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of Loans to ſettle or iſſue, unleſs as therein provided, that is with theſe States who had complied with the requiſition of 1781.</p>
                        <p>This was diſagreeable to <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> who afterwards paſſed the Act of March 1, 1786, with a view to count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eract the meaſures contemplated in the reſolution of Congreſs, and to accommodate the citizens of this ſtate, who were creditors of the United States. And near two million pounds of New-Loans had been iſſued.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> gave the hiſtory of New-Loans, iſſued in conſequence of this Act of March 1, 1786—repealed by Act of March 27th, 1789, the intereſt paid for four years; the ſecond and third ſections are the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial parts of the repealing Act—the former principles are recognized in this Act, and after its paſſing no other
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:027132_0220_0FD350AA976C79A8"/>
uſe could be made of the New-Loans than to exchange them for Continental certificates.</p>
                        <p>They could no longer continue a claim, as the law was repealed which conſtituted them a claim: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came difficult from payments in the Land-Office to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn continental certificates, and the fund from the Land-Office was added in-conſequence of the practice of ſplitting certificates.</p>
                        <p>In the repealing Act of 1789 the Legiſlature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated to reſtore their debts to the parties—<hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> deſigned an exoneration on the return of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates, on one ſingle condition, to wit, the reſtoration of thoſe certificates to the parties.</p>
                        <p>The State has been injured, the criminality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons depends much upon circumſtances, ſhe is injured not by her own acts, but by the conduct of one of her officers, by a wrong conſtruction of law, whether wilful or miſtaken, the Senate will judge when the facts and evidence will be laid before them.</p>
                        <p>This conſtruction under the Act of the 10th April, 1792, has involved the State in a loſs of near 15000 dollars, and this immenſe loſs has been ſuſtained by this conſtruction of the preſent defendant.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read part of the 12th and 13th ſections of the Act of Congreſs of the 4th Auguſt, 1790, which contemplates only the aſſumption of certificates iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies, none excepted but "certificates iſſued by the commiſſioners of army accounts in the ſtate of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> in the year 1786."</p>
                        <p>The Act of 27th March, 1789, paſſed before the Act of the 4th of Auguſt, 1790; If the New-Loans are not ſubſcribable to the firſt loan, they cannot be to the ſecond of the 8th May, 1792. The idea of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them never entered the mind of any perſon during the continuance of the firſt loan.</p>
                        <p>He read the Act of Aſſembly of the 9th of April, 1791, reſpecting purparts, for making up the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of intereſt on continental loans, the Legiſlature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the perſons relieved here as their only creditors,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:027132_0221_0FD350899792D9E0"/>
whoſe debts were ſubſcribable, had New-Loans been conſidered as exiſting debts, equal proviſion would have been made for them in the ſaid Act.</p>
                        <p>In the next place he adverted to the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, in which Act the Legiſlature determined to pay off their proper debts with the purparts. The 2d ſection appropriates the ſtock to pay the debts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the firſt ſection, the ſection deſcribes, 1, the fund; 2, the debts, here he obſerved that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſee if New-Loans were included; the intereſt on New-Loans was not payable at this time. As it is under a conſtruction of this law the articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were brought forward, it was neceſſary to pay proper attention to it, and to weigh the particular ſtate of the affair with the eyes of ſcrutiny and candor.</p>
                        <p>This is the conſtruction put on it by us, we cannot tell what is the conſtruction of the Comptroller, or his counſel. Agreeably to the duties required of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for the purpoſe of carrying this Act into execution, it was neceſſary for him to have an account of the debts. —He therefore applied to the Comptroller and Regiſter-General, who eſtimated the debt to be redeemed, and the ſtock to be ſold; this eſtimate, Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> ſaid, did not include New-Loans, but thro' ſome fatality this document has been loſt.</p>
                        <p>Had the Legiſlature deſigned to redeem the New-Loan certificates it was neceſſary to appropriate larger funds—The ſtock which had been ordered to be ſold, was only adequate to the other debt.</p>
                        <p>The fifth ſection refers only to certificates mentioned in the ſecond ſection.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth ſection is apparently more indefinite and uncertain, and depended upon what proviſion Congreſs would make.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> then read the Act of Congreſs of the 8th of May, 1792, ſupplementary to the Act of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1790, which is extended on the ſame terms, ſame conſtruction muſt be attached to each Act, as both Acts are on the ſame principles. Here he referred to the 2d
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:027132_0222_0FD350D469E1C958"/>
ſection of the Act of Congreſs of the 8th May, 1792, relative to non-ſubſcribing creditors, to get the ſame intereſt which he ſaid, merited particular attention.</p>
                        <p>In the 6th ſection of the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, as it is confined to the aſſumption before the firſt of July, and nothing could ſtrictly be done conformably to it under the laſt Act of Congreſs, becauſe no certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates could iſſue under it until March the 1ſt, 1793: This compared with the 6th ſection of the Act of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the 10th April, 1792, it became impoſſible that both laws could be literally and expreſsly complied with; a correſpondence took place, between the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Secretary of the commonwealth, Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and the Secretary of the Treaſury of the United States, and arrangements were made accordingly—all the extracts which he read were repeated, reiterated, dilated and deſcanted upon, placing every ſubject in various points of view: remarked that he had gone through the different laws of the United States, and acts of this commonwealth, which were connected with this buſineſs, that he would then be under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of referring to written documents and oral teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that the letters were numerous and lengthy, and as it was then within a quarter of two he propoſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the reading of the letters until the next day.</p>
                        <p>The Speaker aſked Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> how long it would take to go through them, he anſwered, two or three hours, whereupon the Speaker adjourned the trial until 11 o'clock the next day.</p>
                        <p>In the minutes of the Houſe of Repreſentatives the following entry is recorded:</p>
                        <p>"In conformity to the reſolution adopted yeſterday, the Houſe reſolved itſelf into a committee of the whole, for the purpoſe of attending the trial of <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General.</p>
                        <p>"The Speaker quitted the chair and Mr. <hi>Wynkoop</hi> was placed therein.</p>
                        <p>"The committee then proceeded to the Senate cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the purpoſe aforeſaid,</p>

                     <p>He obſerved that the actions of the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral were contrary to his (the Comptroller's) own opinion reſpecting the redeemability of the certificates in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that this could be manifeſt from the letters to be produced, which were written by that officer, by the Regiſter-General and other public officers—for this purpoſe he began with the following letter.</p>

                           <p>"But having learnt that there was a probability of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial inveſtigation of the point, I forebore to give a final inſtruction concerning it and left the matter ſuſpended.</p>
                           <p>"When the commiſſioners were about to cloſe the ſettlement of accounts between the united and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual States it became neceſſary to certify to them the amount of the debt of this commonwealth which had been admitted upon loan. The courſe purſued was to certify abſolutely the ſum which had been ſubſcribed and finally admitted, and to ſtate in a note the amount and ſituation of the certificates in queſtion which had been offered to the loan and not admitted. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that this amount was not embraced in the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commiſſioners.</p>
                           <p>"There has been no ſuſpenſion of the intereſt on ſo much of the debt of the commonwealth as was ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admitted upon the loan.</p>
                           <p>"Theſe circumſtances amount to a virtual rejection of the certificates to which your enquiry is underſtood to have reference.</p>
                           <p>"I ſtate them particularly that the preciſe courſe of the buſineſs may be accurately ſeen.</p>

                           <p>By an Act paſſed in March, 1789, the holders of this balance are entitled on preſenting their certificates of this ſtate and liquidating the intereſt received thereon, to receive back their former ones or an equivalent; this hath taken place to a great amount, inſomuch that there does not at preſent remain much unexchanged on a compariſon of the whole, the exact amount at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unexchanged I cannot tell, a number of exchanges to the amount of 40 or 50 preſented are pending for want of the parties paying the indents due, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I eſtimate from 40 to 50 thouſand pounds, if abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute preciſion be neceſſary, I will have the additions and ſelections made ſo as to give the ſum exactly.</p>
                           <p>When I read the letter of the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury referred to aforeſaid, I was doubtful until I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted it again, whether it really imported that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt payable quarterly on the certificates granted on the Aſſumed debt of this ſtate, would be ſuſpended until the certificates of the Federal debt not yet exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the New-Loans as aforeſaid ſhould be ſurrendered or an equivalent in ſtock under the funding ſyſtem, as ſuch a caſe would proſtrate the faith of the United States to the will of the Legiſlature of this ſtate, if they ſhould refuſe to ſurrender them, then the United States (without any fault on the part of the original ſubſcribers or the preſent holders) would not pay the intereſt they had iſſued their obligation for, in which they promiſed payment. It appeared to me that if ſuch were the law
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:027132_0230_0FD350DACD8C6A10"/>
the public credit of the United States might be ſhaken by it and rendered precarious, but on turning to the law it will appear that the proviſion for returning the certificates of the United States, was to prevent the United States from paying the intereſt twice on the ſame debt, and that in conformity thereto, if any of the certificates of this ſtate commonly called New-Loan debt had been before the firſt of October laſt, when the loan cloſed, ſubſcribed to the ſaid loan, it would have been requiſite before the ſtock had iſſued therefor, that an equal ſum ſhould have been ſurrendered by the ſtate as aforeſaid. <hi>The ſtate would thus have redeemed her certificates through the United States in the ſame manner at preſent practiſed, for individuals,</hi> but no ſuch certificates of this ſtate were ſubſcribed—conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the United States are entitled to none of the continental certificates, which are demandable by the perſons holding the New-Loans. If they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the United States, this ſtate might have to pay the New-Loan certificates without having this reſource to do it with. I think too highly of the faith of the public to ſuppoſe, that the holders of New-Loan are compellable either to ſubſcribe them to the United States or to re-exchange them for the continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, or that to ſuch as do not, the ſtate are abſolved from payment both of principal and intereſt, but the market value and the irredeemable quality of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental ſtock and the preſent funds of the United States are generally ſufficient to induce the change, as is evinced from the great quantity already ſo exchanged, of the remainder ſome part is exchanged almoſt every day, and if the loan ſhould be opened by Congreſs the exchanges would be encreaſed thereby.</p>

                           <p>"THE ſubject committed to me by your excellency in December laſt, reſpecting the claim made by the Secretary of the Treaſury to a ſurrender on the part of the State, of the Continental certificates not exchanged, having been brought to a cloſe; and being this day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the Treaſury that all obſtacles were removed reſpecting the transfer and payment of intereſt quarterly on the aſſumed debt of this ſtate, or the payment quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to the ſtate of the reſiduum unſubſcribed of this ſtate's quota; and orders having gone out to the Loan-Office of the diſtrict of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> conſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, I haſten to inform you thereof.</p>
                           <p>"The ſubject was an important one, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Continental certificates from <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> while the New-Loans for which they were given were out, and the ſtate reſponſible for, without theſe means of redemption, could have placed her in an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſituation. To take off the appearance of this hardſhip, it was ſuggeſted, that in caſe the New-Loans not exchanged, would not be ſubſcribed to the United States by the holders (which on the propoſed terms of the loan might be done) yet ſtill that the ſtate would by the terms of the ſame loan, be in the receipt of a ſufficient ſum from the Union to meet the intereſt due to theſe creditors. But to this it was objected, that this receipt of intereſt by the ſtate would be temporary, and would ceaſe when the ſettlement of our accounts with the United States ſhould be effected, and the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances provided for agreeably to law, whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand againſt the ſtate would be perpetual, and could only be diſcharged by payment of the debt.</p>
                           <p>"On the whole after much attention to this buſineſs it hath been ſettled to our wiſh; and the good ſenſe of the Secretary of the Treaſury hath led him to a deciſion, under the Act of Congreſs of Auguſt 4th, 1790, which

                     <p>The Comptroller-General obtained the money before the Governor or Regiſter-General had any information of it: It was done in a way regardleſs of the checks of office.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſhut the ſecret in his own breaſt, the dates of intereſt on the face of the abſtracts were only inferences, and the Regiſter-General did not know they were New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read the warrant No. 462, by which Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> reduced the money into his poſſeſſion, the Regiſter-General was not to blame as he did not enter into the calculations of abſtracts.—Dates of intereſt and hurry of buſineſs might have induced him to overlook or not to have attended to this particular.</p>

                        <pb n="228" facs="unknown:027132_0236_0FD34FEB25658838"/>Here Mr. <hi>Morgan.</hi> remarked that the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were excluded.—If theſe two officers made a partial ſtatement, they did not comply with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, it muſt therefore be conceded that it included all: The act of the 10th of April, 1792, was their rule of conſtruction. He then read the 2d ſection of that act. Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> then held in his hand an abſtract which had been actually redeemed, which did not on the face of it ſhew the certification of the Comptroller for being <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,</hi> but it was in the hand writing of that officer, in the abſtracts of others, it was neceſſary, here it was not, the form is ſimilar to the others; it conſiſted of eight columns.—1. Date of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate. 2. Number of ditto. 3. By whom iſſued. 4. To whom iſſued. 5. Commencement of intereſt. 6. Amount of each certificate. 7. Intereſt computed to December 31, 1791. 8. Total amount.</p>
                     <p>In this abſtract it is neceſſary to obſerve that a certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate purchaſed from an irreproachable witneſs on the 7th of July, 1792 is contained in a receipt dated the 30th June, 1792, an erazure is made to cover purchaſes made after the firſt of July, to bring them within the time preſcribed by the act.</p>
                     <p>The foregoing were offered to ſupport the three firſt articles, the fourth is rather a deduction from them, he obſerved that the three firſt were conſidered together for they could not be ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>He read the fourth article.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> he obſerved, could not certify to the officers of the United States in his private capacity, he therefore did it under colour of his office, there was no ſpecification of New-Loans on the face of the abſtracts, and no fund provided to pay them, the money muſt therefore have been drawn from the Treaſury without any previous appropriation, or out of a fund otherwiſe appropriated, which is contrary to the conſtitution; he quoted the 21ſt ſection of the firſt article of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> It is apparent from theſe facts and circumſtances that the Comptroller General knew
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:027132_0237_0FD350C11DBB38A8"/>
when he made the certification, and unleſs an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation can be ſhewn, it will not be diſputed that the New-Loans could be redeemed out of any other than the fund contemplated in the Act of the 10th of April, 1792. He repeated the reading of the ſecond ſection, and ſaid, that unleſs ſome other law can be ſhewn, which he knew nothing of, there was no fund, the ſection men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nothing of New Loans, nay it appropriates the funds and excludes New-Loans; the ſale of the three per cent. ſtock was co-extenſive with its object. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 986,000 dollars were only ſufficient, and part direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for New-Loans, it would affect the other, and injure the proper ſtate creditors; the honor of the ſtate would be diſgraced, as ſhe promiſed payments and had not funds.</p>
                     <p>To prove that the money was reduced to Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> poſſeſſion, he read the Governor's warrants, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers 425, 451, and 462, July 9, 12, and 14, 1792.</p>
                     <p>The Treaſurer appeared with his books to ſhew that the money was paid the 14th July, 1792, before the Regiſter or the Governor knew any thing about the ſubſcribability of New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>The conſequences of this tranſaction aggravate the crime, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> gain on the whole was about 14 or 15,000 dollars, and the commonwealth loſt 25 per cent.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read the 5th article, obſerving that he would ſubſtantiate the charge contained in this by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable witneſſes, they did not appear, and he moved for an adjournment, which was granted, with directions from the Speaker to be punctual.—The members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives returned to their chamber, and repeated the ceremony, as in page 214 and 215.</p>
                     <p>The letter of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> read yeſterday in the Houſe of Repreſentatives (ſee page 200) was read the ſecond time; and referred to Meſſrs. <hi>B. Morgan, M'Lene, Evans,</hi> and <hi>Bowman.</hi> It does not appear that they reported on it.</p>

                     <p>At 10 minutes after eleven o'clock Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> roſe, having premiſed that his arguments the preceding days reſpected the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth articles of impeachment againſt the Comptroller-General, that he would then proceed in order to the fifth.</p>
                     <p>That he would ſhew by the different ſtatements of that officer to the Legiſlature in his official capacity, that he did not look upon New-Loan certificates as a State debt after the paſſing of the Act of March, 1789, as Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> made no mention of them in any of his communications.</p>
                     <p>That the Governor was of the ſame opinion.</p>
                     <p>The committees on Ways and Means of the ſame;</p>

                     <p>That after the printed documents would be brought forward, he ſhould then adduce oral teſtimony. He read part of the State of the Finances of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as reported by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> on the 7th November, 1787, in which Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> mentioned the New-Loans as an exiſting debt againſt the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>That in all his communications previous to March, 1789, the Comptroller mentioned the New-Loans as an exiſting debt; and a total change of ſentiment took place in him, in the Legiſlature, and Governor, after that period; becauſe they conceived the law of March, 1789, had done away the claim which exiſted by the law of 1786, and the New-Loans were omitted in all their ſubſequent ſtatements as no longer an object of Legiſlative conſideration.</p>

                        <pb n="231" facs="unknown:027132_0239_0FD350C6C9A39720"/>He obſerved that the Governor in his ſpeech to the Legiſlature on the 10th December, 1791, did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion New-Loans as a debt or claim on the ſtate, and that he did not forget them, as he made mention of the payment of the arrears of intereſt due on them, for which proviſion is made in the repealing act of March, 1789.</p>
                     <p>He read part of the Governor's ſpeech to both Houſes on the 28th December, 1790, being the firſt ſeſſion after the paſſing of the act of March, 1789, in which the Governor enumerated the aggregate of all the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the commonwealth, and mentioned only the balance of intereſt due on the New-Loan debt; if they had been debts, he would not have executed his duty in omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſame idea was purſued by the Governor in all his communications reſpecting the New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General himſelf, the committee on Ways and Means, and the other officers were of the ſame opinion. Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read part of the report of the committee on Ways and Means, Feb. 8th 1791, page 166 of the minutes, wherein the other debts of the commonwealth are mentioned and provided for, but not the New-Loans: Notwithſtanding this is called a ſtatement of all the debts of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and added that every body put the ſame conſtruction on that debt.</p>
                     <p>He read part of the ſtatement of the Comptroller and Regiſter-General of the 30th November, 1791, to the Governor, and obſerved that the Governor and the Secretary were betrayed into the part they had acted, and for proof of which he would call witneſſes.</p>

                        <p>After this certificate was obtained from the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller, they carried that abſtract and certificate to the Loan-officer of the United States, and there ſubſcribed it to the loan opened in a book for that purpoſe; after making this ſubſcription, the Loan-Officer gave them a duplicate of the abſtract, and a receipt, which were brought to my office, and examined there, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt calculated up to the time allowed by law, and an account was ſtated by me, State of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to — Dr., owing to the hurry of buſineſs it was divided between my Clerks and myſelf, they made the calculations of intereſt and additions, and I made the entries; or they made the entries, and I made the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and additions;—that calculation with the abſtract was ſent to the office of the Gomptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a correſponding entry being made in my books.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Being oftentimes much hurried, a perſon helped me in the calculations and caſtings; intereſts were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated ſometimes by myſelf, and ſometimes by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but the entries were for the moſt part made by me. I think it underwent an examination at the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's office, and in that caſe the abſtracts were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me becauſe I had not completed the returns of the particulars and different kinds of debt, but the groſs amount: the Comptroller ſigned it, the ſame was brought to me, which I counterſigned, and it was then ſent to the Governor, who granted a warrant on the Treaſury for the amount.</p>
                        <p>I recollect to have no converſation with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller reſpecting New-Loans, until after the date be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 14th and 17th July, 1792, when the abſtracts No. 264, 265 and 266, and warrants had paſſed my office.</p>
                        <p>On this converſation a conference took place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, wherein I agreed with him in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, and embraced under the act of the 10th April, 1792.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ.</hi> Was it Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> gave you the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> I received information out of doors, that New-Loans were contained in the abſtracts, and was ſo well convinced, altho' I went to Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> to ſee whether New-Loan certificates were included, that I afterwards paſſed ſeveral abſtracts knowing them to contain New-Loans, for which warrants iſſued and were ſtopped in my hands, except one from Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him by miſtake.</p>
                        <p>In my converſation with the Comptroller we referred to the ſeveral acts of the United States and laws of this commonwealth, the only difficulty which occurred was the delivery of the Continental certificates for which the New-Loans had iſſued—He anſwered it was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the United States, and that he either had, or would ſettle that buſineſs with the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:027132_0246_0FD3508E4882F480"/>
of the United States. He alſo avered that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as a creditor) holding the certificate, had it in his power to do it, knowing that the ſuſpenſion of intereſt was the only difficulty, and that that would only take place until certificates of the United States were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

I went down to Mr. <hi>Smith's,</hi> where I ſubſcribed in blank for their amount, the hurry was ſo great in his office that he could not count them, this was on the 30th of June, as ſoon as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had leiſure, ſome days after, he counted them, and found that they correſopnded with the abſtract, he gave his receipt, dated 30th of June, correſponding with the time I had ſubſcribed, which alſo appears in his report. I think, but will not be poſitive, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> name was there in blank on the books of ſubſcription.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> In June 1792 I bought for my father from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Raphael</hi> a New-Loan certificate ſigned by <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Rittenhouſe,</hi> being one of thoſe commonly called New-Loan, in the name of <hi>John Thompſon.</hi> Three year's intereſt had been paid by the ſtate on the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and it was one of thoſe endorſed between Sept. 1777 and March 1778—and bore intereſt on the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſum. The next day I ſent <hi>Jeſſe Morris,</hi> a young man who lived with my father, to the State-Treaſury, to receive the intereſt due thereon, he ſoon returned and informed me ſome difficuly occured reſpecting it, that Mr. <hi>Febiger</hi> had ſtopped the certificate, and had ſent Mr. <hi>Reilly</hi> his chief clerk to the Comptroller with it.</p>
                        <p>I therefore went to the Comptroller's office, met Mr. <hi>Reilly</hi> on the ſtairs, and he returned with me to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> room.</p>
                        <p>I was informed more fully of the circumſtances by the Comptroller-General. I then recollected to have ſeen this deſcribed in an advertiſement on a file of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and loſt certificates uſually hung up in Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's</hi> office; and likewiſe in the neſwpapers. I enquired of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> whether any loſs reſpecting this certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate would accrue to Mr. <hi>Biddle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> informed me that in a former caſe of the like nature, the perſon who held them, had amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſettled the matter, and letters were ſent to <hi>Thompſon</hi> reſpecting the certificates; likewiſe that he believed it would be no injury to Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> as it could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</p>
                        <p>Upon this I turned to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> deſk, took a blank exchange and filled it up, deſcribing this certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of <hi>Thompſon's,</hi> which I purchaſed of <hi>Raphael,</hi> the buſineſs reſted here, and I went home, and left both the certificate and exchange with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon.</hi>

                        <p>I had been in the habit of purchaſing New-Loan certificates and entruſted that buſineſs principally to my ſon, about the latter end of June, 1792, I ſaw by the bills of parcels, that my ſon had purchaſed a New-Loan certificate from <hi>S. Raphael,</hi> who frequently brought in certificates, which I purchaſed from him at their current value; ſame time I obſerved that one year's intereſt was due, not apprehending any difficulty, I ſent it to the Treaſury to draw the intereſt.</p>
                        <p>Either that day, or the next, I do not recollect which, my ſon mentioned the circumſtances, and the difficulty in the payment of intereſt, and exchange,—after which, on converſing with ſome friends, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, and knowing that it was payable to bearer; I was convinced that I could not ſuffer, the ſtate had indemnified the holder, it muſt be exchanged, the law was paſſed, the ſtate muſt make it good.</p>
                        <p>A few days after, not immediately, I came to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> and had, I believe, two opportunities, and ſpoke to him before the ſtate-houſe; and I urged the exchange as there could be no exception to my right, he ſeemed to admit my right, but mentioned that he

had or muſt firſt write on the occaſion, to Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> from whom it had been ſtolen.

After I mentioned that, he anſwered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give me the parts in ſtock, and to take it himſelf, which I conſidered as an accommodation, and by recurring to my letter book of the 5th or 6th July, I find that I wrote a letter or directed my ſon to do it, that I was obliged by his offer, and requeſted him to to take the certificate and to transfer the parts which the ſame would yield; by recurring I find the certificate was for 800 dollars nominal amount ſubject to depreciation between September 1777, and March 1778, and three year's intereſt paid. I ſent up that note: in a few days, and in the courſe of buſineſs I received the ſtock agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the amount, I do not recollect the parts in ſtock.

Thompſon,</hi> which Mr.<hi>Nicholſon</hi> alſo recognized; he told me that he would take the Attorney-General's opinion, and if that young man would call in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon he would let him know about the intereſt.</p>

                        <head>Mr. <hi>John Oldden,</hi> affirmed.</head>
                        <p>Being then deſired to proceed, he ſaid, as it is a good while ſince theſe tranſactions had happened, and as my memory may fail, I had rather anſwer queſtions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> was then deſired to inform the Senate what he knew about this buſineſs, or had you any New-Loan certificates in the year 1792?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; on or about the 4th of July, 1792, I had a number, ſuppoſe about ſeven or eight hundred odd pounds in New-Loan certificates, I, according to the uſual practice made up an abſtract, and took them to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the abſtract and certificates in due form, and left them with the Comptroller as it was uſual on ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Lewis.</hi> For what purpoſe?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> After preſenting them, I expected the original Continental certificates in lieu of them, I aſked when I might get the Continental certificates, the anſwer, as well as I can recollect, was, that I ſhould have them the next day about the ſame hour, it was then about 12 o'clock. I went up the next day—(Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> was
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:027132_0252_0FD35091E683C1A8"/>
deſired by Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> to tell what paſſed in the mean time.) On the evening of the ſame day, I received a letter or note from the Comptroller, which note is loſt, the purport of which was, that he would pay me an equal proportion and quantity of 6, 3, and deferred ſtock, and arrearages of intereſt for them, take the certificates himſelf, and ſave me the trouble of funding the Continental ones.</p>
                        <p>To this note I returned no written anſwer, but told the bearer that I would ſee the Comptroller the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and would complete and finiſh that buſineſs, and ſo the matter reſted.</p>
                        <p>I ſaw the Comptroller the next day, I fancy, it muſt have been in the mean time, an idea ſtruck me, that he could pay them into the Land-Office, and intended to aſk him ſomething more, don't know whether I went up twice or thrice, ſtill not ready; and when I did the laſt time, I told him, if he would give me thirty dollars beyond what their value was, as I ſuppoſed they would be of more uſe to him, he ſhould have them. To this propoſal the Comptroller agreed, transferred the ſtock to me at Mr. <hi>Smith's,</hi> and gave me a check on the Bank of the United States for 155 dollars and 85 cents, and 30 dollars for my good will of the certificates, being in the whole one hundred and eighty-five dollars and eighty-five cents.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ.</hi> When you offered the certificates to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller for 30 dollars, did the Comptroller tell you it was too late?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> I do not recollect, not certain, that any ſuch thing was mentioned, it is a long time ago, the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of intereſt and thirty dollars conſtituted the ſum for which he gave me a check, and that was on the 7th of July, 1792, this I know from an entry in my memorandum book, the only written account, which I have of this tranſaction.</p>
                        <p>The abſtract No. 262, was looked for, found, and ſhewed to Mr. <hi>Oldden,</hi> and he was deſired to inform the Senate whether his certificates were in it; he directly
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:027132_0253_0FD350CBE5EDF9E8"/>
pointed to the eleven laſt certificates and ſaid theſe are the certificates to which I referred in my teſtimony.</p>

                           <hi>Queſ.</hi> Did you ſee the abſtract No. 262, in Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> office or elſewhere?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> No—I never ſaw that abſtract until I had been called before the Houſe of Repreſentatives laſt year.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Having gone through the five firſt articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment againſt the Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, it now remains for me to go on to the 6th and 7th articles, to underſtand theſe two, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſcale of important facts and corroborating teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony muſt firſt be attended to—If I have ſhewn that the Comptroller's opinion was, long before the paſſage of the Act of March 1789, that the New-Loans ceaſed to be a State debt, it will render his conduct more criminal, a retroſpective view of a paſt tranſaction will add ſome information to what has been already advanced: in one of his reports on the ſtate of the finances, dated October 1, and December 11, 1790; he had ſtated what debts were valid againſt the commonwealth and what were not.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> read the report page 385, in the appendix to the minutes of 1790, containing what debts were to be diſcharged, and what were valid, agreeably to the report of the proper officers; that the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution allowed of no draughts from the Treaſury ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by previous appropriations made by law. But in page 389 in the 7th article of the finances are ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions, wherein the amount of the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the New-Loans are defined, and excluded from redemption in the Land-office, whereby they ceaſe to be and are no longer a debt of the ſtate. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in expreſs terms, page 395 that New-Loans were then excluded. Here then we reſt our teſtimony
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:027132_0256_0FD350DBF3B7E9F8"/>
of the five firſt articles, theſe are objects of our accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for plain and obvious reaſons.</p>
                     <p>We now come to objects of greater moment, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments of a deeper dye, as the articles are of greater magnitude the puniſhment is to be ſeverer, inaſmuch as the Comptroller as a faithful guardian to preſerve the property of the public, did not lay his hands on the treaſures of the commonwealth, for the purpoſe of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, but made his official duty ſubſervient to ſpeculation. If the teſtimony already exhibited and arguments adduced, has made equal impreſſion on the Senate as on the managers and on the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, who are his accuſers, the articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment will have the effect which the law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution require. <hi>(Here</hi> Mr. <hi>Evans aſſiſted</hi> Mr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in arranging the papers and preparing the parts to be read.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among the various perſons who came to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's office to loan their certificates, we find the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> in different progreſſions, and if I am RIGHTLY INSTRUCTED it will be proved that Loan-office certificates of the United States and New-Loan certificates were depoſited with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> and both ultimately ſubſcribed to the Loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p>It remains with the Comptroller-General to account for that procedure, if the Act had required the ſame Continental certificates to be returned, the caſe would be plain, and owing to the circumſtances of both, the New-Loans and the other certificates having been ſubſcribed by the ſame perſon a preſumption is raiſed; and he ſhould ſhew why they had not taken different courſes. The moment that they ceaſed to be private property, they immediately became the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for the New-Loans and the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates could not be public and private property at one and the ſame point of time, yet both have been ſubſcribed.</p>
                     <p>In the liſt of New-Loans certificates originally iſſued, book A, page 129—a certificate of £. 11:16, No. 4051,

                     <p>To prove that the Continental certificates thus depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited exactly correſponded with the New-Loans, I have in my hand a certificate from the Regiſter of the Treaſury ſigned by <hi>Joſeph Nourſe,</hi> March 4th, 1794, by which it appears that the Comptroller-General had ſubſcribed by the Act of Auguſt 4, 1790, the certificates iſſued as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>It thus appears, that the firſt therein, correſponds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the ſecond in the other, in numbers, names, dates, commencement of intereſt, and total amount; the correſpondence between them is beſt aſcertained by going over the abſtract, and examining the ſame, and, by comparing it with the Comptroller's books. I will now proceed to ſhew the New-Loans were alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed—

                        <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> came forward and had New-Loans iſſued for his Continental ones, two evidences of the ſame debt—this inconvenience would not have happened if the intention of the Legiſlature had been purſued. After the law of 1789 the New-Loans were only a receipt or claim to get back the Continental certificates; by this means a duplication of debt had been brought againſt the United States, contrary to what the Union and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had contemplated. This is the only teſtimony now in our power, it remains with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General to ſhew and explain; it is manifeſt that we had two debts inſtead of one, the certificates of the United States and thoſe of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> it is in his power to ſatisfy the Senate if his books were kept in the manner in which they ought to have been—if this tranſaction is not cleared up, the preſumption is that ſomething is unfair and unworthy of this officer.</p>
                     <p>To ſhew however by as direct teſtimony as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of this caſe will admit that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General has made uſe of certificates brought to, and depoſited with him for re-exchange which he afterwards ſubſcribed to the Loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p>The circumſtances which both points are briefly to prove, are theſe; that <hi>Matthew M'Connell</hi> furniſhed or ſold a certificate for £. 3275:19:4, to <hi>Blair M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> which is among thoſe ſubſcribed by Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in his grand abſtract. The preſumptive teſtimony will be ſtrong, that the Comptroller received this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate in his official capacity, and that he afterwards took it to his own uſe: The firſt witneſs whom we ſhall call on this ſubject is <hi>Matthew M'Connell.</hi>

were there New-Loan certificates accompanied with the uſual abſtract or account for exchange, and did you, or did you not apply to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> the ſame time for indents, before you received the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and if ſo at what time, and did he then give you a further ſum of indents on account, and if ſo what ſum, on what account, and how did you diſpoſe thereof.</p>

When I delivered my certificates to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> there were many perſons from the country at his office, deſirous of having their buſineſs ſpeedily done—I told Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> I was willing that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people ſhould be firſt ſerved, and that he might ſettle mine at his leiſure, but as that would probably take up ſome time, I requeſted him to furniſh me in the mean time with ſome indents on account, to which he aſſented, and I received indents from him at ſeveral times before I received the Continental certificates, but do not recollect the amount of the indents received at any one time, nor in the whole.</p>

On the final ſettlement of my account with the ſtate, a balance of 4146 dollars and 24 cents in indents appeared againſt me, which in the ſummer of 1793 I requeſted Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to pay to the State on my behalf, and by his account rendered me, it appears that he has done it.</p>

at what time thereafter apply at the office of the Comptroller-General with the remainder of your New-Loan certificates, and did or not the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral receive them, and ſet down with you in his office and prepare an account thereof for exchange, and does the account numbered 1838, and 183, and 184, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with preſented to you, appear to be the ſame accounts, and did you, or did you not then requeſt him to draw the indents for you, which after exchange would be receivable on your Continental certificates, and did you, or did you not receive thoſe certificates afterwards, and if ſo, at what time?</p>

They were neither the property of <hi>Oldden, M'Clenachan,</hi> or <hi>John Nicholſon.</hi> None of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could uſe them for their own purpoſes. If he hath converted them to his own uſe, he has done a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the commonwealth, and it is a bad precedent. <hi>(Here he read the ſeventh article.)</hi> From all which it is plainly proved that he is guilty, that all this had been done is manifeſt from his abſtracts in his own hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from oral and written teſtimony, from the warrants preſented to and paid by the Treaſurer, the ſtate ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an immenſe loſs—which loſs, though great, the inconvenience is ſtill more conſiderable. <hi>(He then read the letter, page</hi> 102-3.)</p>
                        <p>Here (Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> obſerved) the Secretary entered into a diſquiſition of thoſe meaſures adopted by the ſtates, who have iſſued their own certificates—in which caſe he ordered the payment of intereſt to be ſuſpended for a time, ſo that it appears that <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> who had iſſued her own certificates, had been under the neceſſity of making an arrangement, ſuch as herein ſet forth, to prevent the payment of intereſt twice; this meaſure was not attended to. The Comptroller was well acquainted with it—this alternative occaſions a double ſubſcription to compleat the meaſure, as in the caſe of <hi>Blair M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan</hi> who ſubſcribed his original certificate to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic

loan, and the Comptroller ſubſcribed to the ſtate loan.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Comptroller-General has drawn ſixty-three thouſand, odd hundred dollars, without any previous appropriation from the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> by which ſhe has loſt above five thouſand pounds ſpecie; becauſe the Continental certificates are ſo much leſs when divided into ſecurities: The difference between twenty ſhillings in the pound and the current value of the different parts of ſtock creating that ſum.</p>
                        <p>I will conclude by obſerving that as it was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good and not any acrimony againſt an individual, hath moved us to inſtitute the preſent proſecution; I hope the deciſion will be ſuch as the good of the ſtate, public juſtice and equity require, and that it will be conducted with temper and moderation.</p>

                        <p>TO facilitate the exchange of certificates agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Act of General Aſſembly of the twenty-ſeventh day of March laſt, Council have judged it proper to give you the following inſtructions, viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">"1. Every perſon who in conformity with the ſaid Act ſhall preſent to you a New-Loan certificate, may at his option receive from you the Continental certificate or certificates, for which the New-Loan certificate was granted, or receive a like ſum of principal in certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of debts of the U. States, which have been paid into the Land-Office.</p>
                        <p n="2">"2. When New-Loan certificates have been cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſeveral certificates have been by you given for the amount thereof, to enable the party to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Land-Office, &amp;c.—and where one or more of the latter ſhall be preſented as part or parts of ſuch New-Loan certificate, the perſon preſenting the ſame may in lieu thereof receive ſo many of the original Continental certificates as ſhall be equal to, or neareſt, it, and under the amount of the New-Loan certificates ſo preſented.</p>
                        <p n="3">"3. In thoſe inſtances in which it may be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to make the exact amount of a New-Loan certificate or certificates with Continental certificates, you will iſſue a new certificate or certificates, bearing ſimilar intereſts for the balance or balances.</p>
                        <p n="4">"4th. In a ſet of books to be prepared for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you will keep exact and fair accounts of all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates you may receive, diliver or iſſue, with their numbers, principal ſums and dates of intereſt.</p>
                        <p n="5">"5th. That the balance of intereſt to be received or paid by the ſtate according to Act of Aſſembly, may be aſcertained, you will calculate the arrears of intereſt which may be due on all New-Loan certificates you may receive as well as on all Continental certificates you may deliver.</p>
                        <p n="6">"6th. You will receive indents or facilities for balances of intereſt as may be due to the ſtate, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p n="8">"8th. If you conſider it neceſſary to your own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or to the regularity of your proceedings in the premiſes you will demand receipts from all perſons to whom you may deliver certificates or indents as well as require vouchers of the certificates or indents which may be delivered or paid to you.</p>
                        <p n="9">"9th. In the firſt Wednesday in every month you will produce to Council for their inſpection the books in which your tranſactions relative to the exchange of certificates according to Act of General Aſſembly of the 27th day of March, 1789, are contained.</p>
                        <p n="10">"10th. If any difficulty or obſtruction ſhould occur in the execution of the duties required of you by the Act above mentioned of the 27th day of March laſt, or by the foregoing inſtructions, you will repreſent the ſame to Council, that ſuch difficulty or obſtruction, if poſſible, may be obviated or removed.</p>

                        <p>When or how impeachments began in England, or for what purpoſe, and whether this mode, like engines, are made uſe of for power or faction, is immaterial. Here they form a part of the Conſtitution of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. There hereditary nobility command reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Here the Comptroller meets the charge, and he is to be tried by his peers. The tribunal is great, and the cauſe of importance. The defendant meets the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment conſcious of his own innocence, he never ſhrunk from it, he at firſt propoſed a queſtion to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued before the Supreme Court, (ſee page 82) he is
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:027132_0277_0FD350B9A38840A0"/>
impeached in the name of the people of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the Houſe of Repreſentatives is the grand inqueſt of the nation. The Senate will judge without any regard to the impreſſions made on the Houſe of Repreſentatives. The Comptroller is here in the ſame ſituation as any defendant in a common law court. The grand jury found the indictment, the Senate as a jury is ſworn to try the indictment. Lord <hi>Mansfield's</hi> expreſſion on this occaſion is worthy of notice, That the juror's mind ſhould be like <hi>"blank paper,"</hi> free from any impreſſions but that of the evidence. That the late Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives and the Managers were actuated by the pureſt motives, and the preſent Houſe alſo, I have no doubt, but from what ſource this impeachment ſprings time only will diſcover. Public bodies are liable to be acted upon when the object in contemplation is to acquire public good or great public evil; the public good is a faſcinating conſideration to carry on a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The good intentions of the Houſe is not doubted, but this goodneſs might make them liable to be eaſily acted upon. Popular bodies are eaſily warped by an artful individual when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour, and impreſſes an idea on the Aſſembly that he has the public good at heart.</p>
                        <p>Objections have been made againſt commonwealths and popular governments on this account—<hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Phocion,</hi> ſome of the greateſt men of antiquity, fell thro' the miſtaken zeal of popular bodies: no doubt the Aſſemblies who convicted them, thought that they had condemned them for the public good; and now theſe Aſſemblies are curſed and their memory held up to public execration. But no objection with us. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on which I have the honor to addreſs you, has not been very familiar to me, having no knowledge of it but what I collected ſince I have been retained by the Comptroller. Its branches are various, requiring much perſpicuity and a thorough acquaintance with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Comptroller throws himſelf on the candor of his Judges, he has always acted from a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:027132_0278_0FD327EE837A03C0"/>
of the Act, or not. If he has, he cannot be guilty, and it is no proper ſubject of impeachment, if he had not, it is a ſubject of enquiry whether ſuch conſtruction was his known opinion or baſely contrived. If he put a bad conſtruction on it, we ſhould enquire, Whether the guilt is from the heart or from the head. The conſequences are removal from office, utter inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to hold any poſt of honor, profit, or truſt—the charges ought to be clear and perſpicuous—they are not ſo perſpicuous <hi>[the firſt article read.]</hi> There is a point in this article that mentions he did ſubſcribe at <hi>various times.</hi> I do not know to <hi>whom,</hi> nor did I know till the opening, there are ſome certifications, but none in his own caſe—ſhould there be any obſcurity in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it is to be attributed to this, to whom did he declare them to be ſubſcribable? it wants certainty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>[2d article read.] "Declare"</hi> without ſaying to whom, total want of certainty, entirely omitting to whom or at what time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>[3d read.]</hi> This wants certainty likewiſe as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the firſt and ſecond, which are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, uncertain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The fourth</hi> article is ſtated by the Manager as a deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the former articles. If the former articles want certainty, this being deduced will conſequently be void of certainty likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The fifth</hi> is ſo vague, it requires no comment.</p>

                           <hi>The ſeventh</hi> ſtates more explicitly, but don't expreſs whether Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> paid value for them or not, an exchange is completed, and he ſubſcribed them, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they will explain themſelves by and by.</p>
                        <p>In charges of ſuch ſerious tendency, the particular objects ſhould be pointed out—That certainty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity which are ſo neceſſary in indictments in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

law courts not altogether requiſite, that preciſion and critical nicety required in the courts of Juſtice would be too much in this particular, but theſe articles are too vague, too doubtful, too uncertain, we are not bound to anſwer theſe charges; the charge muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and according to the laws of the land before it can be entitled to an anſwer. But we will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, proceed to anſwer them, and if the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's judgment is right, this honorable court will not heſitate to pronounce him <hi>not guilty.</hi>

                              <p>YOU are right in conſidering yourſelf not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by law to accept on the loan of the aſſumed debt certificates of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> dated on or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt day of January 1790. It is however my wiſh that you minute in a book to be kept for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the amount of ſuch certificates offered by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, together with the name of the perſon offering them.</p>
                              <p>It will not be proper that you commit the examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and checking of the certificates of the aſſumed debt to any perſon who does not actually belong to your

office. It cannot be deemed a legal execution of your duty to rely upon any perſon not duly authoriſed. You will receive theſe certificates and give on the delivery of them to you, and before compariſon with the checks, a deſcriptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment, that ſuch certificates are placed in your hands with a view to the loan. The ſubſcribers will be ſenſible that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becauſe the ſubſcriptions may exceed the aſſumption, and the certificates may prove counterfeit or forged. Having received them in the manner above mentioned, you will commit to ſome perſon competent to ſo nice and important a buſineſs, the compariſon of the certificates with the regiſters and checks in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the ſtate, to which no doubt the eaſieſt acceſs will be given. Should however any unexpected impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment occur, you will make it known to me.</p>
                              <p>"I do not perceive any objection to your ſtriking a mark in the form you have exhibited (≠) upon all the certificates depoſited with you towards the loan of the aſſumed debt, which however ſhould be done in ſuch manner as not to obliterate the printed or manuſcript words. You will be careful to ſelect a proper place for the mark, which as far as poſſible ſhould be uniformly made, that the eye may inſtantly perceive it.</p>
                              <p>"I do not conſider you as juſtifiable in refuſing the certificates of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> (which are in all other reſpects aſſumable) becauſe they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the ſtate in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper to uſe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſuade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they perſiſt to offer, refuſe to receive them.</p>
                              <p>"You will perceive on re-examination that you have miſconceived the inſtruction contained in my letter of the 9th ult. in regard to Loan-office certificates iſſued prior to March 1778. It applied to thoſe only pointed out in the 10th ſection, that is to the <hi>non-ſubſcribed,</hi> and not to thoſe that ſhould be loaned. You will diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:027132_0283_0FD3507D5CC44200"/>
the practice of making ſuch endorſements on thoſe <hi>loaned,</hi> and you will, when transfers takes place of ſuch ſtock as has ariſen from loans of thoſe certificates take care not to make a ſimilar endorſement on the new cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to be given.

                              <p>THE Legiſlature of the U.

"until it ſhall appear to the ſatisfaction of the Secretary of the Treaſury, that certificates iſſued for that purpoſe by ſuch ſtate, have been re-exchanged, or redeemed, or until thoſe, which ſhall not have been re-exchanged or redeemed, ſhall be ſurrendered to the U.

"To pay the debts required, would take upwards of £.230,000, which ſum muſt all be in the Treaſury before the State can with ſafety declare payment, ſo great a ſum to be brought in without returning into circulation would in a degree incapacitate the dealers in the funds from purchaſing our ſtock, we ſee now the effect a few days diſcontinuance of diſcounts at bank hath on ſtock. The Act would limit a time in which the money muſt be in the Treaſury, the ſales of the ſtock muſt take place within that period, to raiſe the money the creating ſuch neceſſity to ſell, and the knowledge that ſo great a quantity would be in the market, would reduce the price of the 3 per cent. ſtock, to be ſold, and the more ſo, as the time approached nearer an end, and all this while the monies from the firſt ſales would be unproductive, altho' not ſo the property ſold to raiſe it. But without allowing for theſe things let us ſuppoſe the preſent price 12<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>9 to be obtained throughout the ſales, the State would then be diveſted of a ſpecie capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of above £.400,000, of which a part might always be held as a mean of diſcharging the reduced debt, which would exiſt on the plan propoſed, and leave a balance of near £.200,000 clear profit in favor of this plan, and this ſum would be greater by all the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the price from the cauſes aforeſaid which would be very conſiderable. But this is not all, for after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting the State of all her 3 per cent. ſtock it would take the moſt if not all the 6 per cent. or deferred ſtock, to be parted with to make up the deficiency, and the State deprived of this annual income would be obliged to reſort to direct taxation for further expences or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements which the intereſt of this ſtock is now <hi>appropriated</hi> to.</p>
                        <p>"All writers on the ſubject of finance agree that a public debt is accompanied with ſome advantages by combining the intereſt of individuals with the ſucceſs, ſtability and honor of government, and altho' theſe and other advantages ſhould be outweighed by the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſo that a public debt ought net to be termed

a public bleſſing, yet in the preſent caſe we ſhould poſſeſs all the political as well as pecuniary advantages without any of the objections, for as it is ſhewn above the State poſſeſs the ſpecie capital always to meet the debt, altho' they are at liberty to redeem in certain portions, yet they are not bound to pay, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without doing it until Congreſs pay the capital of their 3 per cent. ſtock.</p>
                        <p>"The policy of this meaſure muſt ſtrike forcibly every one who is deſirous of preventing the annihilation of the State governments and preſerving the balance of power between them and the General government. The limits of which are but imperfectly traced out in ſome caſes by the federal Conſtitution, and if the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of implication gains ground, may prove no barrier to the encroachments of power. We ſee what exertions the policy of the general government directs to, on this head reſpecting the aſſumption of the State debts.</p>

                        <p>(E.) "Theſe emiſſions thus provided for, may and will redeem them out of the way and may prevent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties hereafter. That a government may interrupt the currency, ſo as to take it out of circulation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it by other bills we have, beſide other precedents, two in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> between the year 1730 and 1740. All the old bills were called in and others given for them, and at the Revolution a ſimilar law was paſſed reſpecting all the bills emitted before that period: But how far the government may decide that after a fixed period thus to exchange them ſhall have elapſed, they may wholly refuſe payment thereof, no ſuch terms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting when the bills were emitted, is a queſtion which may better be got rid of in this way, which will afford the holders more than the laſt current value of the bills. This is clear that the bills emitted by the old govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have no better fate than thoſe emitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſent, nor ſhould any preference ariſing out of diſtruſt of the late revolution, and the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, operate any advantage to this claſs, while thoſe ſhould ſuffer who in confidence, and compliance with the laws of the ſtate, exchanged their bills, the former for the latter.</p>
                        <p>(F.) "Theſe certificates cannot be redeemed, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with the faith and honor of the ſtate, by calculating the accumulated intereſt half yearly, for an annuity of nine years, becauſe they and the Act under which they were iſſued, contain an obligation to pay the intereſt until it ſhall be done by the United States, If therefore no payment ſhould be made of intereſt in 1801, or any future period, on deferred debt by the United States, the obligation of the ſtate ſtill compel us to pay.</p>

                        <p>I recollect there were ſeveral conferences between the Comptroller-General and myſelf, am unable to diſtinguiſh with preciſion the one alluded to, I recollect one interview in particular in which this point was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, that is, whether intereſt on the ſtate debt ſhould be ſuſpended. I really charge my memory with nothing more than, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> urged arguments to induce me to believe that the ſpirit of that part of the Act of Congreſs was only to prevent the payment of
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:027132_0296_0FD3519384B5F690"/>
double intereſt, and that a ſurrender was neither practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable nor equitable, <hi>(ſee page</hi> 220-1-2-3-4); as none of theſe had been ſubſcribed, this inconvenience could not ariſe, the intention of the Act of Congreſs was fulfilled, I was convinced the reaſoning was juſt, there being no baſis on which the U. S. could demand a ſurrender.</p>
                        <p>If the New-Loans in my view of them <hi>at that time</hi> had not been ſubſcribable, this difficulty could not have ariſen. The Comptroller always appeared to me to be of the opinion that they were ſubſcribable—none were ſubſcribed in the former loan. The enquiry whether any had been ſubſcribed to the loan was directed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of loans, the information mud ultimately have come from him—Mr. <hi>Wolcott</hi> might have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate agent, I can't remember.</p>

<pb n="291" facs="unknown:027132_0299_0FD3518C908E5F70"/>
told me he did not like the law, and his arguments convinced me, this turned my attention to the plan recommended by him, on examination I ſaw ſome parts of it which I did not like, and therefore thought his plan wrong. The particular reaſons not recollected—one objection was the ſale of ſo much ſtock would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croud the market, and, ſold to a diſadvantage would injure the ſtate. <hi>(Retired.)</hi>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> remarked that as Mr. <hi>Hamilton's</hi> letter to Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> had been brought forward, the two letters (ſee page 74 to 79, and one letter, page 218 to 220) ſhould alſo be read, which he did. In the latter the Secretary mentions the virtual rejection of them, but did not recollect the Federal Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> was called—</p>
                        <p>Shortly after the Houſe aroſe after the paſſing of the Act of the 10th April 1792 I was in the Comptroller's office on buſineſs—Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> was preſent, I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the 6th ſection was very looſe and would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace unfunded depreciation debt. In which ſentiment there was an agreement of opinion, and I think Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> obſerved if Congreſs would aſſume the old bills of credit of the ſtate, the Act would embrace them. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> obſerved that the ſection was more general than he at firſt thought, or intended it, and that it would embrace unfunded depreciation, don't recollect that any converſation took place, nor difference of opinion about that law until after the ſubſcription of New-Loans, when we had a conference, and we agreed in opinion that they were ſubſcribable and aſſumable. No other converſation about them until the conference above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. I recollect the letter of the 13th of April 1792, reſpecting the ſale of ſtock. But as to that ſaid to be loſt, in my letter book there is no reference to ſuch a letter, I have been much perplexed about it, ſtrongly impreſſed that there had been ſuch a letter, but cannot account for it, and doubt whether there was any as it is not on my books. When the committee on Ways and
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:027132_0300_0FD327F540CBD798"/>
Means had the ſubject before them laſt year, they requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eſtimate—I turned to my letter book, but could not find it.</p>
                        <p>The defendant's accounts were paſſed through my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the uſual form. His abſtracts were made in his office, this difference, that aſſignments were made on them in his office, then they were ſent down to mine.</p>

                           <hi>Queſ.</hi> Is there any thing upon theſe abſtracts from whence, in the common courſe of buſineſs, they could be diſtinguiſhed that New-Loans were included?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; dates of intereſt on New-Loans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced at mixt and different dates. The date of the commencement of intereſt on funded and depreciation debt on fixt and particular dates. Funded debt firſt of January, firſt of July, depreciation 10th April, 10th of October. No other certificates but New-Loans are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated on the principal.</p>

The fact was I never conſidered it of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence what the abſtracts were made up of, ſo that they were received at the Loan-office.</p>
                        <p>I encouraged ſubſcribing under the idea that <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> would be a creditor ſtate, the documents were preſented to the Comptroller, if they paſſed him, that is whether they were aſſumable; they then came to me a ſecond time, the principal examination was confined to the calculations of principal and intereſt, the buſineſs was carried thro' in the uſual time, no hurry or ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on the part of the Comptroller to carry his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thro', or get his abſtracts paſſed. If there had been I ſhould have turned the other buſineſs by. One day's buſineſs was generally finiſhed the ſame day. In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having examined a number of witneſſes and read many documents to ſhew that our conſtruction of the Act is conſonant to law, and that the defendant's opinion and judgment was the legal one, I will only examine one or two more to the ſame point.—In order to ſhew this more fully I will quote the Governor's words in the minutes of the Aſſembly, 10th December, 1791, page 12, where his words allude to the payment of arrears due not on New-Loan certificates but "on the New-Loan debt." Where they are quoted, they are ſtiled New-Loan
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:027132_0303_0FD35198160B5F20"/>
certificates. The reaſon why the New-Loans are not ſtated as a debt to be paid, is becauſe the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth thought ſhe had a fund in her hands equivalent to anſwer them at any time, the State and her officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had a fund, commenſurate to their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either when the party ſhould come to exchange, or when future proviſion ſhould be made by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. The word <hi>"redeemed,"</hi> minutes, page 389, 1791, ſo much relied on, alluded only to the Land-Office. Page 421, the Regiſter-General heads the title "New-Loan Debt." In Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon's</hi> report 15th Auguſt, 1791, No. 25, the expreſſion is "Arrears of intereſt on New-Loan Debt:" with many other ſimilar expreſſions.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have underſtood that thoſe were the points to which I ſhould give evidence, and I have juſt ſent for the minutes of 1791 to whet my recollection as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is imperfect at this time. <hi>[Gets the books.]</hi> The only difficulty I have is, the date of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I do not recollect that very well, whether before the bill was reported, or while the report of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee on ways and means was before the Houſe—the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the converſation was that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> had an objection, he gave me his plan, and requeſted me to give my opinion, the plan before the Houſe was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the debts, his plan did not propoſe a redemption but commutation with an irredeemable quality. I thought the redeeming plan better and therefore did not approve and I returned him his plan. Another cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, After I returned the plan to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> the Secratary of the commonwealth ſhewed me that plan or a copy of it, and requeſted me to look at it, and that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> requeſted the Governor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the Legiſlature, the bill agreeably to the report of the committee of Ways and Means was
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:027132_0304_0FD3514900B5A400"/>
then under the conſideration of the Legiſlature, I told Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> that I had ſeen it before, and diſapproved of it, and told him the Governor had better examine the plan, and not ſend it except he approved of it.</p>
                        <p>After the bill paſſed; and the Houſe adjourned. I was in the Comptroller's office; the converſation turned on the poſſibility of carrying the Act into execution, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveral difficulties aroſe, and objections were ſtarted, on account of the price of ſtock in the market being lower than the price limited in the Act, and propoſitions were made to get over the difficulty. Alſo whether a part of the 3 per cent. ſtock ſhould be ſold or the whole at once; I was afraid the whole plan would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated. Theſe objections were raiſed by the officers. The defendant ſuggeſted that by the law unfunded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates were redeemable, altho' the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature perhaps might not intend it: That it appeared to him unfunded depreciation was redeemable, altho' the report excluded them. Upon that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſhewed me the 6th ſection, I aſſented to what he ſaid, and ſaid that I thought the unfunded certificates were included in that ſection. I added that I had drawn the bill my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and had made the 6th ſection a <hi>proviſo</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; expreſsly providing for the redemption of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain certificates therein defined, which would put the thing beyond diſpute, becauſe the ſecond ſection defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the thing to be redeemed, that the <hi>proviſo</hi> was made a diſtinct ſection out of the Houſe; as ſome kind of proviſo, always conſidered in the Houſe, but aſſented at the ſame time that the conſtruction would extend to unfunded depreciation. I had no time to form an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it was of the moment, on the firſt impreſſion. I alſo added that it was very immaterial to the ſtate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem this way, or by the Land-Office, the price being at that time nearly the ſame as caſh.<note n="*" place="bottom">The defendant refers to the price-current of the brokers to prove that the price of New-Loans in the market was then as high as unfunded Depreciation certificates.</note> Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> was preſent the whole or moſt of the time. I don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:027132_0305_0FD350E302A49320"/>
member to hear any other opinion from Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> except at that time. At the next meeting of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature on my return to the city, I was aſtoniſhed to hear that New-Loans were redeemed—I had a ſmall New-Loan certificate from Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> which I kept pretty late, don't know whether before or after the law paſſed, I gave it to the Comptroller to exchange it, he ſaid he was hurried, he would get it exchanged and ſubſcribed and give me the parts; he gave me a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt for the New-Loan. I do not know the time, it was about May, it was not completed at the end of April, I left town with that receipt in my pocket, which I gave to Mr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> I know I had no idea of their being of any other uſe than for the purpoſe of exchange, if I had thought they were redeemable, I would enquire and do the beſt for him who employed me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ.</hi> Did you not give an opinion that whatever were ſubſcribable, were redeemable?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; that was the ground of my opinion that the unfunded depreciation were redeemable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Lewis.</hi> Of what date was that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> A day or two after the advertiſement was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I ſtaid in town ten days after the Houſe had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, the advertiſement was put into the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers before I left town, the ſale of ſtock was the 16th April—the ſum to be ſold was 986,000 dollars. I think the advertiſement was the ground of our converſation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll.</hi> Did you concur in opinion with the Comptroller-General that if Congreſs ſhould aſſume the ſtate debts that bills of credit would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> That was not mentioned, if it was I did not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The reaſon why I recollect it, was that during the following Legiſlature a letter was written by the Comptroller in which ſuch an idea was introduced. This made me look into the law, to ſee whether there were any grounds for it, ſaw there a diſtinction made between <hi>certificates</hi> and <hi>bills of credit,</hi> the ſixth ſection
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:027132_0306_0FD350E4C11E1648"/>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> I don't remember his giving any opinion, I think he acquieſced as far as the unfunded depreciation certificates.</p>

                        <p>The Regiſter-General expreſſed his opinion very ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next year before the committee of ways and means, but before that time I do not remember.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll.</hi> Did he mention his opinion at the time New-Loans were redeemed?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes. (Report of committee on ways and means, page 337) a part of the report was grounded on the teſtimony of the Regiſter-General reſpecting them— (Here he read <hi>"deluded into error, diſcriminate,"</hi> &amp;c.) the whole of that was grounded on the declaration of the Regiſter-General, he declared he was not conſulted and the abſtracts on the face did not diſcriminate, there was a change took place between this and the time when the articles of impeachment were before the Houſe, he ſaid the abſtracts ſufficiently diſcriminated, and that the New-Loans could be eaſily diſtinguiſhed. Another article was then made to conform to this idea. <hi>(Hers</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin pointed out what, he called, an error in the minutes, page</hi> 361 <hi>and</hi> 374.) He alſo ſaid he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived if they were aſſumable, they were redeemable with this ſingle difficulty, whether there was power lodged with the Comptroller to give up the Continental certificates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Comptroller had always certified the ſubſcribabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity without his knowledge. He was alſo aſked how he did not diſcover them by other marks—his anſwer was, that his part was the calculation of intereſt, and did not attend to any other. Laſt ſummer when the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of inveſtigation examined the certificate of <hi>John
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:027132_0307_0FD3516E15549628"/>
Thompſon,</hi> for £. 231:7:7, found that intereſt was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated on £.300—<hi>that</hi> certificate was reduced by the ſcale of depreciation, I aſked <hi>Donnaldſon,</hi> here was one you could not miſtake, you ſaid you calculated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt from this calculation, and date of intereſt, you muſt be ſatiſfied that this was a New-Loan?—He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much confuſed and ſaid a clerk had done it, and appeared as if he knew nothing of it. He alſo ſaid he paſſed one ſmall one after he knew it.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; about the latter end of June or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of July 1792, I was aſked for New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, I aſked what they would give me, they ſaid 6 or 7 pence more than for final ſettlements, I had none then, but from this circumſtance I was induced to try to find out what they wanted to do with them. After reading the Act of Congreſs of 4th of Auguſt 1790, aſſuming ſtate debts, and the Act of this ſtate which was paſſed in April 1792, it was my opinion they were aſſumable, and in conſequence I purchaſed and ſubſcribed part on my own account and part on account of another perſon, none on Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> account, I can't tell who came to me, I made an abſtract, carried it to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> he certified them <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,</hi> they were not redeemed as the buſineſs was ſtopped.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſ. by</hi> Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll.</hi> What's the reaſon of 6 or 7 pence higher than the other certificates? Were they equal before?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> No difference. I did not know that Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> was purchaſing at that time—was informed by
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:027132_0308_0FD3519A5F612C30"/>
the Regiſter-General that a ſtop was put to them in the Secretary's office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> proceeded—</p>
                        <p>It appears alſo that Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> was making a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſubſcription, it is preſumable that he knew the law. It is mentioned that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> did not certify in his own caſe. This is a ſtrong circumſtance: If he was conſcious that the certification would be improper, he would have omitted it: before the ſecond loan it was not cuſtomary. A counterfeit certificate of <hi>Lawman,</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> gave riſe to this certification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Smith</hi> (ſon to the late Commiſſioner of Loans) brought the ſubſcription book to the ſtate loan of the U. S. and being ſworn, declared as follows.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>George Lawman</hi> of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſubſcribed in the name of <hi>Gungachu,</hi> a certificate No. 234 which proved to be counterfeit. I believe the cauſe of certifying was to prevent inconvenience to the parties, when they came without ſuch certification they were generally ſent to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> office, I did not know when the practice commenced—it made no odds to us whether it was done or not, as the receipt which my father gave was <hi>ſubject to examination,</hi> when the firſt and ſecond loans cloſed we took the certificates to the Comptroller's office and examined for ourſelves. <hi>(Retired.)</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>It hath been objected that the Governor called for a ſtatement which does not at this time appear, altho' its contents are pretty ſatisfactorily acknowledged, a bare attention to the time when this tranſaction took place will ſhew the aſſertion is unfounded—It is true the ſtate committed herſelf ſo far as to redeem what would be aſſumed, but as the Act of Congreſs was not then paſſed, it was unknown what Congreſs would aſſume. The Comptroller never thought New-Loans came under the ſecond ſection, the ſale of ſtock related only to the ſecond ſection, he could not divine more than others, it by no means follows from this that New-Loans were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable—ſtrange that in the fourth article they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

to prove the premiſes from the concluſion.

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi>—</p>
                        <p>Before I proceed to the next head, I will remark that the ſtate ought to pay the full amount, that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable and redeemable, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſtate ought to pay pound for pound, and really the complaint againſt the Comptroller is of an extraordinary nature—<hi>"Mr. Nicholſon acquired wealth that the ſtate ought to have got!"</hi>—I fancy if any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be raiſed, it ought not to be between the commonwealth, but between the perſons from whom Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> bought, he however bought fairly. I now come to the Acts of Aſſembly, and I will ſhew that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction drawn by the managers, is injurious and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and I hope to ſhew Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be conſonant to good faith, honor and equity. If the law is to receive their conſtruction, it will oppoſe the Federal Conſtitution, which is the ſupreme law of the land; and therefore it is utterly void.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="302" facs="unknown:027132_0310_0FD3514C4CEE68D8"/>My poſitions are, that New-Loans were ſubſcribable to the firſt loan, alſo to the ſecond, and likewiſe redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under the ſixth ſection of the Act of the 10th April 1792.</p>
                        <p>(Here Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> read the 3d, 7th and 11th ſections of the Act of March 1, 1786, to prove that New-Loans were as much a debt as any other.) No matter whether the commonwealth became immediately indebted or thro' the agency of others. Temporary proviſion is not apparent from the Act. If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth entertained temporary views they were not mutual. Mutuality and reciprocity are the eſſence of contracts. Whatever is reaſonable with private perſons in the caſe of contracts is ſo with the State.</p>
                        <p>But it hath been contended that the Act of March 27 1789, puts theſe certificates into an ambiguous ſtate; let us examine the Act itſelf—"Whereas the duties on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and impoſts are given to Congreſs—<hi>temporary</hi> relief —it became inconvenient to pay half-yearly, &amp;c."—this Act does not compel an exchange, it leaves it optional; perhaps the commonwealth could not pay, what then ought to be done?—we will give you an option. You are our creditor; we have contracted to pay you prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intereſt; we will pay you four year's intereſt becauſe we are able to do ſo, and we will give you back your original certificate at your option, or we will pay you when we can.</p>
                        <p>The 3d ſection did not contemplate that all would exchange, and it implies too much injuſtice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety to preſume they meant to abſolve themſelves from the payment of the remainder; "MANY," is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive term, it does not imply a majority, it means ſome may, others would not.</p>
                        <p>Under the conſtruction of the Managers the New-Loan holder is a creditor of nobody; but poſſibly or probably may become the creditor of the Continent. Notwithſtanding the time of payment is altered, yet the State holds the value in her hands and continues no debtor. How can ſuch a conſtruction be put on this
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:027132_0311_0FD35180B9F7E3B8"/>
Act without flying in the face of the Federal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—(Section 10 of the firſt article is cited,) Congreſs in the ninth ſection of the ſame article is denied the power of making <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> laws.</p>
                        <p>This is the laſt of all ſuppoſable caſes, by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution no State can paſs a law impairing the obligation of contracts made between A and B, conſequently a State cannot do it, when ſhe is a contracting party.</p>
                        <p>I now refer to the Act of 7th April 1791, that the commonwealth contemplated them as a debt. (He quoted Act of 7th April, 1791, page 51 and 54.) Where the State ſeemed to contemplate the preventing of New-Loans from ſubſcription. No. 235 is the firſt abſtract which was certified—No. 234 was counterfeit as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.

No. 1551 for Brigade-Inſpector, and ſeveral others which he referred to. If there was no fund it was no guilt imputable to the Comptroller, as it was not his look out, but the Governor's who drew the orders. <hi>(Here Mr.</hi> Wilcocks <hi>hinted to Mr.</hi> Tilghman, <hi>"no matter what fund, ſo you get the money." Mr.</hi> Tilghman <hi>replied, "I believe it to be the ſame with the Managers and their Counſel; but we have a legal fund tho' you have not.)</hi> Other warrants were produced here—warrant No. 243 in favor of Mr. <hi>Rittenhouſe,</hi> May 16th, 1792, no law expreſsly appropriating this fund.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> was called up and ſaid, he never knew unfunded depreciation debt to have been paid under the Act of 10th April, 1792. The unfunded depreciation debt was not in the eſtimate (Mr. <hi>Trimble</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with his book) and Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> read from his records the forms of the certificates and warrants—the original ſtatement did not extend to unfunded depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion debt: The Comptroller and Regiſter-General were called on for a ſtatement of the debt to be redeemed and accordingly the Governor directed the ſale.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi>—Having obſerved that the 1ſt, 2d and 3d articles of impeachment are not ſupported, and the 4th being a conſequential deduction from the preceding ones, if the former has no foundation, the latter cannot be ſupported, I will to-morrow endeavour to diſcharge my duty reſpecting the ſucceeding articles.</p>

(The Treaſurer was ſent for at this time, who anſwered he could not come, and if the defendant wanted the vouchers he muſt ſend a horſe and cart for them.)</p>
                     <p>Under the fifth and ſixth articles the Comptroller is charged with purchaſing certificates of perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his office for the purpoſe of exchanging them —I acknowledge the fact and contend it is lawful; he purchaſed of <hi>Oldden,</hi> I contend that the property of the certificates were not veſted in the State or <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the buſineſs was inchoate: a good deal remained to be done, the property belonged to the party, the amount of intereſt was to be calculated, indents to be paid, &amp;c. before the exchange was completed. Inſtances will be be ſhewn to prove the practice of withdrawing after they had been thus rendered.</p>

                        <p>I had been in the practice of frequently bringing New-Loans to the Comptroller-General's office to be exchanged. I was once at the Comptroller's office, I met a perſon from <hi>Cheſter</hi> county who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly left a New-Loan certificate with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to be exchanged, he appeared to be going away, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to get indents; I offered to do it for him, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> delivered me the certificate which I afterwards exchanged, probably at ſome ſubſequent period when I was exchanging more for myſelf, the date I ſuppoſe in the winter of 1792.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will relate a circumſtance; previous to the paſſing of that Act, I came to the Comptroller-General's office, I met Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> going down, almoſt as ſoon as I came up to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> table, I ſaid is it poſſible that they will paſs that law? if paſſed as reported it will include New-Loans. Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſaid, I have been endeavouring to convince Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> that it will do ſo.</p>
                        <p>We converſed on the ſubject and both agreed that it would not be for the intereſt of the State, and that it would be better if the Act did not paſs. We thought it better for the State not to ſell the ſtock. Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſaid, he thought he had convinced Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> I do not remember any thing about unfunded debt—it appeared to me ſo extraordinary that I thought it would not paſs. We did not go into particular ſtatements, no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience mentioned except the ſelling of the public ſtock. After the law paſſed I revolved in my mind whether I ſhould go into a ſpeculation, but from ſome conſideration I did not.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the 16th of March 1792, the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:027132_0315_0FD3518D84B189C0"/>
(by the minutes) reſolved itſelf into a committee of the whole to take the Act of the 10th April 1792 into conſideration. I will ſhew from the books of Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> that he ſpoke to Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> as the laſt witneſs had depoſed—(after ſome debate the diary, book A, of the Comptroller was rejected as improper teſtimony, being the private memorandum of the defendant, as they alledged.)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> was called and declared,</p>
                        <p>I was never before the Houſe of Repreſentatives; only before the committee of Ways and Means: never on oath. I was requeſted to reduce what I had to writing, and ſend it to them, which I did.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi>—It has been ſuppoſed that <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> received Continental Loan-office certificates from the commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> theſe have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> on <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> account to the domeſtic debt of the United States—And the correſponding New-Loans alſo by the Comptroller-General on his own account to the State loan. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thence drawn is that the New-Loans were firſt exchanged and then ſubſcribed, we are not charged with having miſapplied the Continental certificates, the charge muſt be that the New-Loans were exchanged and then ſubſcribed, but this by no means appears, nor was it the caſe, as we ſhall prove by the teſtimony of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> himſelf, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> purchaſed thoſe New-Loans of him.</p>

                        <p>The firſt entry of the redeemed debt made on the 2d of July 1792. The number of the abſtract was preſented and the entry was made of the whole. The firſt entry of unfunded depreciation debt was <hi>Samuel Powel,</hi> upon the ſeparation of the debt the abſtracts were ſent to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> office to mark the ſeveral kinds. They were ſent in Auguſt or September. After their return to my office, I entered the abſtracts. The next of unfunded depreciation was No. 218, <hi>Robert Buchannan.</hi> The next inſtance was No. 256, <hi>Jaſper Yeates.</hi> The whole amount of unfunded depreciation was 4,070 dollars and 10 cents:
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:027132_0316_0FD351502870D438"/>
It was paid out of the ſale of ſtock. I find by my report, that my eſtimate to the Governor did not include them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The unfunded Depreciation were entitled under the ſixth ſection of the Act of the 10th April 1792, and yet they contend that no fund was provided: I have now the warrants from the Treaſury—(Here a number of warrants were produced to ſhew that ſimilar claims were paid by the 3d and 12th appropriations out of the fund for claims and improvements.) Here I will leave the 4th article.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew inſtances of New-Loan certificates being lodged with the Comptroller-General for exchange and withdrawn by the proprietors. The following letters were then read.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> obſerved that the character of the witneſs was unexceptionable, and the Managers might do as they pleaſed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> agreed to any time the Managers and their Counſel would appoint to prepare interrogatories to the witneſs.</p>

That it was a week
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:027132_0321_0FD35154B739FC38"/>
or more ſince he called for the book of Exchanges, no intimation was then given of the depoſition, nor ſince until the evening of the day before yeſterday, that the depoſition could not be admitted, nor the trial poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned; that the day of trial had been fixt, and every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle could have been removed on proper application.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I acknowledge that the depoſition cannot be admitted agreeably to the ſtrict rules of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. However well this point may be known to the committee and their counſel, it was unknown to the counſel of the Comptroller-General, till lately; Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> did not conſult us; if he had applied to us, I can't pretend to ſay what we ſhould have adviſed him to do. I requeſt however that we may have time either to procure his depoſition, or liberty to prefer the preſent depoſition. If the defendant had been negligent, it is hard to condemn him unheard. One of the Managers agreed to inform the Comptroller whether this would be brought forward on the trial or not, which was not done.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll.</hi> I can't conceive that a witneſs can come forward as well as if he had not been previouſly ſworn; I will however agree to ſay nothing about <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> If there can be a return of the commiſſion before the argument will be cloſed: I have no doubt but a return may be had without interruption.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I think the propoſition a fair one, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> is known to ſome members of the Legiſlature. And if the anſwers cannot be had in time, the Senate will judge whether they will wait for them or not.</p>
                     <p>Some arguments were adduced reſpecting the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponement of the 6th and 7th articles, at laſt it was agreed to omit <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> altogether.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>Here Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ſhewed from the book of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes kept in the Comptroller-General's office, that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> had brought upwards of 74 thouſand dollars to the office and had them exchanged. He alſo ſhewed the abſtracts of theſe exchanges made out for Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> as it was uſual for the parties to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their exchanges were made at the office.</p>

was, when the indents were paid: the abſtracts were made immediately—and theſe were all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes that were ever made for Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman.</hi> I will now take a retroſpective view of the articles of impeachment, and firſt of the 7th, which if taken by itſelf, and no objection hereafter to be made the teſtimony fixes no criminality on the Comptroller-General; the 5th and 6th are not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, no criminal conduct in him to do what any perſon might have done, the exchange had not been prohibited, any perſon might purchaſe. 4th article, the holders of principal and intereſt are entitled to draw their money out of the 12th appropriation—it is evident he uſed no deceit.</p>
                     <p>3d article. It is manifeſt that he uſed no deceit with the Regiſter-General or other officer, the account was ſent forward in a poſitive manner, the amount of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſum plain, no diſguiſe in the tranſaction, the abſtract was in his own name, from the nature of the account they might eaſily diſcover they were New-Loans, he did not certify <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable</hi> in his own caſe. The 1ſt and 2d articles—<hi>the</hi> 6<hi>th ſection provided a redemption pound for pound.</hi> Whatever was ſubſcribable was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable. Attend to the Act of March 1789—"Many would be willing to exchange" others would not, ſhall thoſe who are unwilling, be excluded, this is a miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, any other conſtruction than ours would be derogatory to the honor and dignity of the State.</p>
                     <p>If the defendant had been miſtaken, here is a great queſtion, whether he acted with a fraudulent deſign, or whether his actions were the reſult of his judgment, his opinion was not ſimilated but genuine and poſitive that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States. To convict him there ought to be proof clear and unequivocal; the conſequences of that conviction are terrible, not only diſmiſſion from office, but incapacity of holding any poſt of honor or profit, the party who attempts to criminate ſhould prove the charges.

                        <p>This article, after declaring that the New-Loans ceaſed to be a State-debt on the paſſing of the Act of March 1789, charges the defendant with certifying them to be ſubſcribable to the loan of Congreſs as debts of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> contrary to his official truſt, and as he well knew to the manifeſt injury of the commonwealth.</p>

The fourth diſtinguiſhes the kinds of Continental certificates to be received. The ſixth and ſeventh mention that certain Continental Loan-office certificates iſſued between 1 Sept. 1777 and 1 March 1778 are ſubject to liquidation by the ſcale of depreciation on their final redemption, altho' the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors are entitled to receive the annual intereſt at full value on the nominal ſum until ſuch redemption takes place, and direct a reference to theſe certificates to be made on the New-Loans iſſued therefor; that on the payment of the <hi>principal</hi> they may be ſubject to the ſame liquidation.</p>

                        <p>A Supplement to this Act was paſſed 28th March 1787, p. 508, extending the loan to thoſe citizens who had made loans in the Continental Loan-offices of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the whole complexion of this Act it appears that the Legiſlature conſidered the certificates iſſued in purſuance of it, or in other words the New-Loans, as effectually State debt, as thoſe of any other deſcription. For they on the face of the certificate promiſe to pay the principal on or before the year 1796, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt half-yearly until that time. The Land-office is open for their reception as for other certificates; and thoſe which were peculiarly ſituated as already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are directed to be reduced to ſpecie value on the payment of the principal.</p>
                        <p>The merit of the holders of theſe certificates was equally great, with the holders of any other. The debts were contracted in a common cauſe—the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> were the creditors, and the State her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enjoyed in common with the other States, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their exertions.</p>
                        <p>That the proviſion made in this Act was deſigned to be permanent, and the New-Loan creditors conſidered by our Legiſlature of the moſt meritorious claſs, will appear in the ſtrongeſt manner by referring to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legiſlature upon this ſubject on the 27th December 1786, Minutes of Aſſembly, p. 97.</p>
                        <p>This reſolution took place upon a very preſſing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion—Congreſs being much embarraſſed, appointed a committee to diſcloſe to our Legiſlature the urgent ſtate of their affairs, and to requeſt an immediate grant of the impoſt to enable them to comply with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the Union.—The Legiſlature after paying all the attention due to the importance of the occaſion, reſolve in words as ſtrong as language can expreſs, that

their engagements to their own citizens prevent them without a breach of good faith from complying with the requeſt, at the ſame time informing Congreſs of their unfeigned regard for the honor of the United States, and of their unremitted exertions to do all in their power to ſupport it. (The report is as follows.)</p>
                        <p>"The report of the committee to whom was referred the report of the committee of the late Houſe of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, appointed to confer with the honorable Mr. <hi>Monroe</hi> and Mr. <hi>King,</hi> read December 15th, was read the ſecond time, and adopted as follows, viz.</p>

                        <p>"That they cannot help conſidering the debt of the United States in one aggregate point of view, and are of opinion that the principles of juſtice require like payment of every part, whether the ſame be due to foreigners or citizens:</p>
                        <p>"That there appears to have been due to the citizens of this commonwealth a ſum which ſhe has undertaken to pay them, and which probably amounts nearly to her proportion of the whole debt.</p>
                        <p>"That the appropriation of funds for that purpoſe is of ſuch nature, that the report now referred to your committee (and which was adopted by the laſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) declares, "an immediate compliance with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation would involve a breach of the faith of this ſtate, pledged to the public creditors, citizens thereof, unleſs at the ſame time ſome further and other funds were provided for payment of the intereſt due and which ſhall become due to them:"</p>
                        <p>"That in the opinion of your committee, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the appropriation juſt mentioned renders the proviſion alluded to in the report impracticable.</p>
                        <p>"That in the opinion of your committee, it would
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:027132_0328_0FD3517172453B70"/>
neither be juſt nor prudent to call on the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> for payment of taxes, to diſcharge the money due to others, while that which is due to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is unprovided for.</p>
                        <p>"Your committee therefore propoſe the following reſolution:</p>
                        <p>"That the Delegates of this State in Congreſs be inſtructed to aſſure the United States of the ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to make an adequate proviſion for all the debts of the Union; that this deſire, fully evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her ready compliance with paſt requiſitions, will equally operate on future determinations; that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of her citizens, to whom large ſums were due, and who were at the ſame time compelled to pay their proportion of ſupplies for the current expenditures, called loudly for relief; that having waited in vain for a general aſſent to the meaſures propoſed by Congreſs, until the grievance complained of could no longer be borne, it became neceſſary to aſſume the payment of thoſe ſums which were due by the Union to her own citizens; that in conſequence, the funds now required by the United States were appropriated to this object, and the debts due to individuals were transferred to the State, whereby <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> became the creditor of the Union; that this Houſe cannot divert the funds ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the appropriation formerly made, until ſuch ſolid proviſion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual intereſt payable to <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will be a certain and ſufficient fund for diſcharging thoſe ſums, which ſhe is bound in the manner abovementioned to pay to her citizens, but that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will in the mean time account for her full quota of the ſums ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to diſcharge the intereſt, and inſtalments of principal, due or to become due by the United States, and, after deducting therefrom the intereſt ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to receive, will regularly pay any balance that may remain due on ſuch quota."</p>
                        <p>In this ſituation the New-Loans continued; a debt deliberately formed, and ſanctioned by this reſolution,
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:027132_0329_0FD3519E07C132F0"/>
until the Act of the 27th of March 1789, p. 694, which it is contended has deſtroyed the debt.</p>
                        <p>It may be proper to glance at the ſituation of affairs at the time of paſſing this Act, before we proceed to conſider the Act itſelf. For by ſeeing how far the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the times required an alteration, and what alteration was requiſite to anſwer and remove that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, we obtain a good criterion to determine the true intent of the law;—as the firſt muſt have been the cauſe inducing the Legiſlature to paſs it, and the laſt the object deſigned to be accompliſhed by its paſſing.</p>
                        <p>It appears then that by the Act of March 1786, the Legiſlature freely and openly eſtabliſhed the loan upon permanent and liberal principles, that they had conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a debt, which they conſidered themſelves <hi>abſolutely</hi> bound to diſcharge, and which they could not, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with good faith attempt to injure. In the year 1789, from the eſtabliſhment of the Federal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Congreſs became entitled to the impoſt, and the State was in conſequence deprived of her moſt uſeful and productive revenue, and was utterly unable without additional taxes, to diſcharge the annual demands, Theſe additional taxes it would be too burthenſome at this time to levy, as the citizens excluſive of thoſe they paid in common, were then paying an annual land tax of £.76,000; many of the former were greatly in arrear, and of courſe no additional one would be punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually complied with. The beſt mode that occurred to remove theſe difficulties was to ſuſpend the payments of the New-Loan debt, which from its greater magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude preſſed harder man any other. The ſuſpenſion of the principal (which might eaſily be done as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be exacted by the contract before 1796) immediately cloſed the Land-office againſt it, which in conſequence became a more productive fund for the redemption of the other debt, and together with the preſent ſtoppage of the intereſt, would remove the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment occaſioned by the loſs of the impoſt. As Congreſs would probably provide for the public debts,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:027132_0330_0FD35156F72C1988"/>
being conſtitutionally authoriſed to do ſo, it would be but fair to permit theſe creditors to enjoy the benefits of ſuch proviſion, as a compenſation for the loſs now ſuffered, and to enable them to become Continental creditors for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>That this was the intention of the Legiſlature we may not only preſume from adverting to the ſituation of the times, but it alſo appears from the complexion of the Act itſelf.</p>
                        <p>The firſt ſection which conſtitutes a lengthy preamble, recites the Act of March 1786, with its ſupplement, and ſtates the actual ſituation of things. That Congreſs have power to provide for the public debts; that they have become entitled to the impoſt, which the State conſequently loſes; that the aggregate fund, out of which the New-Loans were paid is diminiſhed by the withdrawing of the impoſt; that Congreſs will no doubt provide for the creditors; and declares that on theſe conſiderations the relief granted by the preceding Acts ſhould ceaſe, proviſion ſhould be made out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the United States, and that proper alterations are neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>This preamble conforms to the ſtatement juſt given. As far as there is a recital and conſtruction of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Acts, they muſt both conform to them. The Legiſlature certainly had no deſign to deceive—nor to form a conſtruction, nor to purſue meaſures, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch conſtruction which the Acts themſelves or public faith would not warrant. The proviſions made in the former Acts were deſigned to be permanent, and if public neceſſity now compelled an alteration it juſtified it no further than the inability of the State required—that inability required no more than a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſuſpenſion of payment, and juſtice to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors demanded that to compenſate this loſs, they ſhould be entitled to any benefits Congreſs might grant by exchanging their certificates ſhould that meaſure become neceſſary. This Act ſhould not be conſidered ſeparately and diſtinctly, but relatively to the others on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:027132_0331_0FD351A028D61DE8"/>
and the conſtruction be determined from a general view of the whole.</p>
                        <p>The alterations intended are contained in the ſecond ſection, which directs "That the intereſt due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates iſſued by the Comptroller-General in purſuance of the ſaid recited Acts or either of them, ſhall be paid up ſo as to complete the payment of intereſt to four years; and that ſo much of every Act or Acts of General Aſſembly as directs or ſecures the payment of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſum or ſums in the ſaid certificates or any of them mentioned, or of the intereſt thereof beyond the term of four years ſhall be and the ſame is hereby repealed and made null and void."</p>
                        <p>The Legiſlature inſtead of repealing the Act of March 1786, or deſtroying the certificates, declaring them in the language of the impeachment to be no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt, due and owing from the State of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> merely repeat that part of it, which provides for the payment of the principal or the intereſt beyond 4 years: the remainder therefore of the Act continues in full force and every thing already completed ſtands unaffected. The expreſſions <hi>null and void</hi> could not be here intended to have any reference to the paſt, becauſe the intereſt is directed to be paid on the whole to complete 4 years, and in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with this requiſition payments muſt in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be made of intereſt <hi>accruing after</hi> the paſſing of this Act, as in theſe caſes its commencement was not four years before its paſſing; the whole clauſe therefore with reſpect to payment, operates on ſome as a preſent on others as a future prohibition, but in no inſtance as a retroſpect.</p>
                        <p>Moreover had the Act of March 1789 entirely repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Act of March 1786, it would not have thereby effected the deſtruction of the certificates. They were completed under the Act while in full force, and could not be injured by any ſubſequent repeal. Like titles
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:027132_0332_0FD351A17872E1C8"/>
under laws that afterwards become obſolete, expire, or are repealed they ſtill remain in full vigour.</p>
                        <p>The Act alſo of March 1789 ſo far from having a retroſpect to the paſt, only refers to the preſent and the future, and beſides the payment of the intereſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, contemplates the probability that many New-Loan creditors may wiſh under the circumſtances in which they are placed, to retake the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates loaned to the State, and therefore appropriates them <hi>a fund</hi> for the redemption of the New-Loans to ſuch as chuſe to take them; the 3d ſection regulating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding—Council under whoſe direction the whole was placed, among other regulations direct by rule 3d that where an equal exchange cannot be made <hi>freſh New-Loan certificates</hi> ſhall be iſſued for the balance. Theſe have accordingly been iſſued in numerous inſtances, and have always been conſidered of equal validity with thoſe originally iſſued. This could not be juſtified had the law <hi>aboliſhed</hi> the certificates, as their circulation would be deſtroyed, they would no longer exiſt a demand againſt the commonwealth, and of courſe no new ones could legally be iſſued.</p>
                        <p>Had the Legiſlature deſigned to annihilate the debt, they certainly would have taken effectual meaſures for that purpoſe and have aboliſhed the certificates alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. An appoſite inſtance has taken place in <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> where the Legiſlature deſigning to deſtroy certain certificates, commonly called Warrenton certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, which had corruptly iſſued, altho' under legal authority; they explicitly declare that <hi>all the certificates</hi> of this deſcription are <hi>null and void</hi> and ſhall not be received in payment of taxes or any other public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whatſoever. <hi>(North-Carolina</hi> Laws, p. 475.)</p>
                        <p>Let us ſuppoſe however for a moment, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature deſigned to deſtroy theſe certificates. It would then be contended that they were deprived of the power. At the time of paſſing this Act the Federal Conſtitution was in complete operation: The 10th ſection of the firſt article declares that "No State ſhall enter into any
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:027132_0333_0FD351A49FDA0D80"/>
treaty, alliance or confederation; grant letters of marque and repriſal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make any thing but gold and ſilver coin a tender in payment of debts; paſs any bill of attainder, ex poſt facto laws, <hi>or law impairing the obligation of contracts,</hi> or grant any title of nobility."—That the ſtate by the firſt Act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the holders of New-Loans and engaged herſelf to pay them, can admit of no doubt, for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the Act itſelf, it is ſolemnly acknowledged in the reſolution of December 1786. As little doubt can be entertained that if the Legiſlature in the laſt Act, intended to deſtroy the debt, it was invalidating the engagement and of courſe impairing the contract. This Act therefore if deſigned for this purpoſe is <hi>void</hi> by the Conſtitution of the United States. This Conſtitution was lately adopted; it had been fully debated before its adoption; many of the members of this Legiſlature had alſo been members of the Convention that adopted it, they muſt have been fully ſenſible of its obligatory force, and little inclined to act in direct, and it may be added, violent oppoſition to it.</p>
                        <p>To conſtrue this law then, as an <hi>abolition</hi> of the debt, would be to make it violate every principle of national honor and juſtice—to operate in the nature of an ex poſt facto law, reſcinding contracts fairly made, and ſolemnly acknowledged to be binding—it would make the Legiſlature act in direct oppoſition to their former explicit declarations and the Federal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—it would in fine be ſuppoſing intentions very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe that actuated the Legiſlature at the time.</p>
                        <p>We have ſeen then that the occaſion did not require an abolition of the debt; that a repeal of the whole Act of March 1786 would not effect it, much leſs then a repeal of a particular part—that it would be contrary to the principles of juſtice and the Conſtitution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it—of courſe we have no reaſon to preſume that the Legiſlature intended it.</p>

Theſe certificates are here claſſed among the other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of the State, as certificates <hi>ſtill in exiſtence,</hi> and the arrearages of intereſt are directed to be paid prior to any future intereſt on the funded debt.</p>
                        <p>An Act paſſed 30th September 1791, page 147, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief to <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> and others, who had loſt New-Loan certificates, after reciting the particulars of their caſe directs ſufficient ſecurity to be given to <hi>indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify</hi> the commonwealth <hi>againſt the certificates</hi> before the relief can be granted. It is remarkable alſo that this Act purſues <hi>exactly</hi> the ſame expreſſions in requiring the indemnity againſt the certificates with thoſe uſed in a former Act paſſed for the relief of <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> long before the Act of March 1789, viz. 4th October 1788, page 535, ſect. 2. If theſe certificates were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi> by the Act of March 1789 they would no longer be recognized by the Legiſlature as certificates <hi>of this ſtate</hi>—If the ſtate was not <hi>anſwerable</hi> for the amount of them it would be uſeleſs to require an <hi>indemnification</hi>— This indemnification is <hi>general,</hi> being intended to guard the ſtate againſt <hi>any injury</hi> that could poſſibly ariſe from granting relief in the premiſes, or the New-Loans tho' loſt might ſtill be in circulation. As the <hi>ſame</hi> requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made in this Act that are made in the firſt mentioned one which preceded the Act of March 1789 and in the <hi>ſame</hi> words; we may further conclude, that the Legiſlature conſidered them as much <hi>obligations now</hi>
                           <pb n="327" facs="unknown:027132_0335_0FD350F3435A3720"/>
as they were <hi>then,</hi> and prudently provided againſt any contingent injury that might otherwiſe ariſe, from granting the relief intended by the Act.</p>
                        <p>The 3d ſection of an Act paſſed 7th of April 1791, page 54, directs the <hi>injurious and impolitic expedient</hi> of re-iſſuing the bills of credit which the <hi>public faith</hi> was already plighted to deſtroy; to pay off the arrearages of intereſt due on the New-Loans, in order that they might not interfere with the arrangements of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth for ſubſcribing to the loan of Congreſs. Their <hi>interference</hi> muſt certainly have been a matter of great importance to render ſo injurious an expedient neceſſary in order to prevent it; but in what manner it may be aſked can they poſſibly interfere? If they no longer continue <hi>State debt,</hi> the State is <hi>no longer</hi> under an obligation to pay them, ſhe therefore on this account could have no concern—if they are not <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> to the loan of Congreſs, they could not interfere with the arrangements of the State for ſubſcribing to that loan; for they would be of no validity, and if offered for ſubſcription, would undoubtedly be rejected. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates which the State had received in lieu of the New-Loans, ſhe had already appropriated as a fund for redeeming them, and if they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for the New-Loans, theſe laſt would not be ſubſcribed by the State, becauſe the law of the United States which authoriſed the ſubſcription, expreſsly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected an equivalent to be ſurrendered up, before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt could be paid, and as the State in this inſtance, would have parted with the equivalent it would be injurious to do it. The New-Loans could therefore interfere with theſe arrangements in no other way than this; they were at this time both State debt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable to the loan of Congreſs; their quantity (if ſubſcribed) would exclude the other State creditors from ſubcribing, and deprive the State of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity ſhe now had, of diſcharging great part of her debts, and of making ample proviſion for the future diſcharge of the remainder. In order to improve this
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:027132_0336_0FD351A9410FB2B0"/>
favourable opportunity, it became a matter of moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous concern to exclude theſe certificates from ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the State was compelled thro' the want of a better, to purſue the injurious expedient mentioned in the Act, which it was preſumed would be, as it actually was, counterbalanced by the reſult.</p>
                        <p>By virtue of the Act of Congreſs of the 4th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, 1790, two loans were opened; one of the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic debt to its full amount; the other of the State debts to the amount of 21,500,000 dollars, which were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the United States, under the exceptions and reſtrictions laid down in the Act. Of theſe 21,500,000 dollars, the portion allotted to <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was, 2,200,000, which was payable in thoſe ſtate certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates which prior to the 1ſt January, 1790, had iſſued for national purpoſes. The debt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was at this time claſſed under three deſcriptions, Funded debt, Depreciation debt, and New-Loan debt. On the whole of the Funded, and part of the Depreciation (thence called Funded Depreciation) the State paid an intereſt of 6 per cent.; on the unfounded depreciation, (which include the remainder) intereſt tho' payable, had never been paid as no funds had been appropriated for the purpoſe: and on the New-Loans, no intereſt except the 4 year's arrears was at this time paying. The whole amount of the funded and depreciation debt, did not exceed 1,500,000 dollars; the New-Loans alone exceeded 2,200,000 the ſum aſſumed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the New-Loans could be <hi>excluded</hi> from ſubſcription, and the holders <hi>induced</hi> to redeem them by the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates, at the ſame time proper encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to thoſe State creditors, to whom the State was paying intereſt, viz. the holders of the funded debt, and funded depreciation, to ſubſcribe to the State loan; the State would immediately get rid of all her New-Loan debt, ſhe would have the amount of the other ſubſcribed, redeemed by virtue of the ſubſcription— her revenues would be relieved from the greater part of the annual intereſt ſhe was now paying, as upon the plan
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:027132_0337_0FD351AABA0001D8"/>
ſhe was purſuing, the intereſt ſhe would receive from the unſubſcribed reſiduum, would compenſate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers for what they would otherwiſe looſe by ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If on the contrary, the New-Loans were ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would exclude the others, and add to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the State. No time however could be more favourable than the preſent, for accompliſhing the plan, and no mode better adapted to the purpoſe, than the one purſued.</p>
                        <p>In the domeſtic loan, the intereſt ſubſcribed, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the principal, and excluſively became 3 per cent. ſtock: two thirds of the principal became 6 per cent. ſtock, and the remaining third, 6 per cents deferred. In the State loan the principal and intereſt were thrown into a common maſs, one third of which was converted into 3 per cent. ſtock, two thirds of the remaining two thirds into 6 per cent. ſtock, and one third of two thirds into 6 per cents. deferred. From this laſt arrangement it followed that unleſs the intereſt ſubſcribed, amounted to one third of the whole ſum ſubſcribed ſo much of the principal as equalled this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, ſupplied its place and was converted into 3 per cents. In order that the intereſt ſhould amount to one third of the whole, it required an arrearage of eight years and a quarter. In the caſe therefore of the New-Loans, when the arrearages was eight years and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the holder might ſubſcribe them to the State loan, or exchange them for the Continental certificates and ſubſcribe theſe to the domeſtic loan, ſince in both caſes the intereſt alone, became 3 per cent. ſtock. Where the arrear was greater it was his intereſt to ſubſcribe the New-Loan in preference to the Continental certificate, as the exceſs of intereſt became 6 per cent. ſtock or 6 per cents. deferred. Where it was leſs it became inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to ſubſcribe them becauſe part of the principal went to ſupply the deficiency. By paying off four years immediately on the New-Loans, and diſcountenancing their ſubſcription to the State loan, (which was done by the Act paſſed two days afterwards, making the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:027132_0338_0FD350F551B8C228"/>
alluded to in this Act, and which gave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement only to the ſubſcription of certificates on which an intereſt was then paying,) the arrears of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt were reduced below eight years and a quarter, it became the intereſt of the holder to redeem the New-Loan by the Continental, and ſubſcribe to the domeſtic loan. It was alſo his intereſt to receive the 4 years arrear in preference to ſubſcribing the New-Loan; as the indents to be paid the State on the exchange to equalize the intereſt, were then low, the amount he paid the State on the New-Loan became due to him on the Continental, and the money paid him by the State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a new principal. The State by agreeing to pay 6 per cent. on the deferred, and 3 per cent. on the 3 per cent. ſtock, created by the ſubſcription of the other State debt, was a ſufficient inducement to the creditor to ſubſcribe, as by this mean the arrears of intereſt were converted into 6 per cent. ſtock.</p>
                        <p>The State by this policy got rid of moſt of the New-Loans; redeemed 650,000 dollars of her other debt; and became entitled to an intereſt of a reſiduum of 1,550,000 dollars, which amounted to nearly 56,000 dollars annually or upwards of £. 20,000. Theſe were the advantages ſhe promiſed herſelf from the plan ſhe had then formed; they appeared ſufficiently important to be purchaſed at the expence of this ruinous expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and they were effectually ſecured, in conſequence of the meaſures purſued. Theſe two Acts as effectually ſhew the ideas the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> entertained of the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribability</hi> of New-Loans as the moſt expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could poſſibly be made on the ſubject.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing ſurvey it ſufficiently appears, that the Act of March, 1789, <hi>did not deſtroy</hi> the New-Loans, that in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> they ſtill continued a debt, and were in their eſtimation ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the loan of the United States. It will now be proper to conſider the Act eſtabliſhing that loan and to point out that part which admits their ſubſcription.</p>
                        <p>The Act of Congreſs of the 4th of Auguſt 1790,
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:027132_0339_0FD351AD03707288"/>
continued by that of the 8th of May 1792, was formed to introduce order and harmony into the public finances, by reducing to a few kinds the great variety of public ſecurities;—to make a Continental debt of all thoſe State certificates which had iſſued for national purpoſes —and to give ſecurity and value to the whole by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting counterfeits, and appropriating permanent funds for their regular payment. It therefore in the 13th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, page 93, aſſumes all State certificates or notes which had iſſued prior to the firſt of January 1790, as compenſations or expenditures for ſervices or ſupplies towards the proſecution of the war, excepting the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly excluded.</p>
                        <p>The New-Loans clearly come within this deſcription. They were directed to iſſue, and conſequently did iſſue, only for Continental certificates which had iſſued for theſe ſervices. The <hi>ſervices</hi> themſelves were the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inducement for iſſuing them, and Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of this deſcription only were received.</p>
                        <p>If this ſection is conſtrued ſtrictly according to the letter the depreciation certificates about which there has exiſted no doubt would alſo be excluded, as they ſtrictly ſpeaking did not iſſue for <hi>ſervices</hi> but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate <hi>loſſes</hi> occaſioned by the depreciation of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pay; tho' here as in the caſe of the New-Loans, the ſervices rendered were the original inducement.</p>
                        <p>This conſtruction would alſo operate to exclude a conſiderable portion of the funded debt, as it ſtood at the time of the loan. For altho' the greater part of it originally iſſued agreeably to the letter of the Act, as compenſations or expenditures for ſervices or ſupplies, yet, for the convenience of payments at the Land-office, and to facilitate their circulation, the original certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were frequently ſurrendered up, and new ones iſſued for different ſums, and in different numbers as ſuited the convenience of the party. Theſe laſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having iſſued for <hi>other</hi> certificates would agreeably to this <hi>ſtrict</hi> conſtruction be excluded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="332" facs="unknown:027132_0340_0FD3515849ACB710"/>In order to accompliſh the deſign of this Act it was as neceſſary to aſſume the New-Loans as any other certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. They were certificates of the State, and the State was a creditor of the United States to an equal amount. Congreſs therefore by aſſuming them, and directing that before intereſt could be paid an equal amount of Continental certificates ſhould be ſurrendered up, at once withdrew both from circulation. As a holder of New-Loans, the United States could exchange with the State for an equal amount of Continental certificates, and the ſum ſubſcribed, for which the State would be debited in her accounts with the Union, ſhe could ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance by preſenting an equal amount of New-Loans which ſhe had redeemed in this way, and which would be on the ſame footing with the other certificates ſhe had redeemed.</p>
                        <p>Could any doubt exiſt reſpecting the conſtruction of the 13th ſection, it muſt be removed by the 18th, page 97, which conſidering all certificates ſituated like the New-Loans, as ſubſcribable under the 13th ſection makes the neceſſary regulations to prevent any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that might otherwiſe enſue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the Treaſury in his inſtructions to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Commiſſioner of Loans for this State, declares they are ſubſcribable, and directs arrangements in conſequence. In his letters to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly conſiders them ſubſcribable. His negociations with our government are founded on a belief that they have been <hi>actually</hi> ſubſcribed, and turn at laſt upon the fact of their having been ſubſcribed or not.</p>
                        <p>If an inconvenience were to ariſe to the State in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their ſubſcription, this would not deſtroy their ſubſcribability. That ariſes from the <hi>aſſumption</hi> of Congreſs and not from any <hi>arrangement</hi> of the State. The loan is opened to the State creditors and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or refuſal of the State has no concern with it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may aſſume what debts they pleaſe, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may transfer to them all debts of a transferrable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is a matter entirely between Congreſs and the
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:027132_0341_0FD351AED574CC40"/>
creditor in which the State cannot interfere more than in the transfer from citizen to citizen. In the ſettlement of accounts between the United States and this ſtate, the intereſt commences, and either party may allow or reject ſuch items as are improper, but this can have no effect upon the original aſſumption, which concerns merely Congreſs and the ſtate creditor.</p>
                        <p>One object in view by the aſſumption was to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the creditor, from the precarious and frequently inadequate relief of State proviſions. Theſe creditors were certainly of this deſcription, and in no caſe except in others ſimilarly circumſtanced could Congreſs aſſume certificates with ſo much ſafety, as they had iſſued for debts originally liquidated and adjuſted by the United States.</p>
                        <p>I hope then it has been ſatisfactorily proved, that the New-Loans were in their firſt eſtabliſhment State debt; placed on a permanent footing, and highly favoured; that their deſtruction was not deſigned by the Act of March 1789; that at ſucceeding periods they have been conſidered as State debt and ſubſcribable by the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature itſelf, of courſe the ſubſcriptions made have been conformable to law.</p>
                        <p>We now come to the poſition which forms the eſſence of the ſecond article, viz. that the New-Loans were not nor could in any way be contemplated as objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the Act of April 1792.</p>
                        <p>This Act was deſigned to diſcharge the certificates of the State, and her other obligations which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt required and which it was now in the power of the State to perform. Our Legiſlature had always conceived it to be more advantageous to the State to redeem her certificates in the caſes where ſhe had it in her power thro' the <hi>medium</hi> of the United States in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>paying them off</hi> and making that payment a credit in her accounts with the Union. This was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the firſt ſubſcription to the State loan which was promoted by the ſtate, and this was their wiſh in the Act of April 1792 as is apparent from the Act itſelf.
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:027132_0342_0FD350F816CBDC78"/>
By the firſt ſubſcription the State redeemed all the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates that were ſubſcribed, and only paid in return that portion of intereſt which the United States did not, which payment was to continue only until the United States paid it. She now wiſhed to redeem all her debt incluſive of the evidences of this obligation, commonly called Purpart certificates, and altho' ſhe in the preſent caſe, paid off the whole in the firſt inſtance, yet ſhe received from the United States an equivalent for the greater part of it, which was an active and productive ſtock annually encreaſing in value, and which by good management might be uſefully appropriated. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in value between the certificates received and the money paid by the State in redemption, which was the only loſs ſuſtained by this mode, (for if they were of equal value it would only amount to a mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of equal intereſts) was of leſs conſequence, than paying off the whole at once, and that payment remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dormant claim upon the Union, until the final adjuſtment of accounts and proviſion for the balance ſhould call it into activity. It ſhould be conſidered alſo that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was at this time deemed a creditor State, to a conſiderable amount and as in other caſes of debtor and creditor, it was more to her advantage to redeem her certificates by way of ſet-off in this account than to advance more money on it and thereby ſwell the credit further. Moreover upon ſtriking the balance of this account the State had no reaſon to preſume that ſhe would be more favoured in the diſcharge of it, than the citizen creditors had been in the payment of their debts, but that certificates would iſſue to her in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, they had already iſſued to them. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better to receive them now and make them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately productive than wait a future day.</p>
                        <p>The Act therefore of April, 1792, after appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 3 per cent. ſtock as a redeeming fund, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting certain debts to be paid from the proceeds of the ſale; contemplates in the ſixth ſection a further proviſion to be made by Congreſs, and directs that all
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:027132_0343_0FD351B0B89BBEB8"/>
certificates entitled to ſuch proviſions, ſhall be entitled to the benefits of this Act upon transferring to the ſtate all the benefits the creditor was to enjoy from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The 8th of May following the loan was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Congreſs upon the <hi>ſame terms,</hi> and of courſe included all certificates that were ſubſcribable to the firſt. This Act of April 1792 directing all certificates to be paid that were ſubſcribable of courſe redeemed them. The New-Loans have already been proved to be ſubſcribable to this loan; and are therefore within the proviſions of this Act. That they came within the view of the Legiſlature at the time, and were deſigned to be redeemed, will appear from the following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations. The Legiſlature knew they were in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They had paſſed laws relieving thoſe who had loſt them. They had endeavoured to prevent their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the firſt loan, and promote their redemption from the fund provided. In this deſign they had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to redeem the greater quantity; the whole amount now in circulation not exceeding fifty thouſand pounds, a ſum comparatively ſmall. Altho' intereſt was not now paying, it was accruing, and the arrear becoming great. Though the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were a fund for their redemption, yet the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor could not be <hi>compelled</hi> to redeem them in that way. The year 1796 was approaching when they were to be paid agreeably to contract. The extenſion of the firſt loan was contemplated in this Act, as the meaſure moſt probable, which they knew would include them. In fine, every argument that applies to prove the neceſſity of redeeming any part of the public debt, applies with equal force in favor of the redemption of the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>The third article charges him with not conſulting with the Governor, nor the Regiſter-General; nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating the certificates on the abſtracts, by which he declared them aſſumable, nor on the certificate by which he declared them redeemable, by which means
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:027132_0344_0FD350F94BC1B848"/>
the checks of office were broken, and the other officers deluded into error.</p>
                        <p>Both loans were opened with the concurrence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of our Legiſlature, who promoted ſubſcriptions of ſtate debt by laws enacted for the purpoſe. It of courſe became the duty of the officers of this ſtate who had it in their power to facilitate the ſubſcription by their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the conductor of the loan in this ſtate, applied to the defendant before the opening of the firſt loan (ſee page 271) to give him a deſcription of the ſeveral ſorts of certificates ſubſcribable, and ſuch checks as would enable him to conduct the buſineſs with ſecurity. The defendant was the only perſon to apply to, he having iſſued all the certificates of the ſtate, and having all the checks in his poſſeſſion, he accordingly gives him the required information and at the ſame time his opinion that the New-Loans <hi>were ſubſcribable.</hi> None can preſume he had any intereſt at this time in giving this opinion, as the loan cloſed without any ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of New-Loans being made.</p>
                        <p>After the cloſing of the loan; in all the conferences which took place on the ſubject of New-Loans, by the direction of the Governor, and which were reported to him, the defendant continues of the <hi>ſame opinion;</hi> no <hi>exception</hi> is made to its propriety, and all matters reſted in this way, till the opening of the ſecond loan.</p>
                        <p>Before the paſſing of the Act of April 1792, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant oppoſed that plan of redemption and propoſed another to the Governor in which New-Loans are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly provided for. He deprecated the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which that Act in its original comprehenſive form, would probably occaſion, and oppoſed its paſſing by ſpeaking to members of both Houſes on the ſubject, and pointing them out, (ſee page 279 to 286.) The Act was afterwards narrowed down to include certificates only. Had he deſigned to ſpeculate on the Act, it would have been his intereſt to encourage its paſſing, or at leaſt not to oppoſe it; after it became a law he was as much entitled to its benefits as another citizen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="337" facs="unknown:027132_0345_0FD35192157FEBE8"/>On the opening of the ſecond loan it was diſcovered, that non-aſſumable certificates had been ſubſcribed, and the owners in conſequence deprived of them until the cloſing of the loan, at which time they would be returned. To prevent this inconvenience in future, the defendant undertook to examine the certificates brought for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and if they were genuine and aſſumable, to mark them ſo. His conduct in this tranſaction was intended to oblige and aſſiſt all parties, it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of great trouble, and no profit to himſelf; the information given, was for the uſe of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and the creditors who might rely upon it or not. There was no law forbidding ſuch proceeding. It was further in advancement of the intereſt and laws of the State. The mode purſued was the dictate of the moment, the words "genuine and aſſumable" being ſometimes writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the abſtract, at other times on the certificate, and in both caſes ſigned with the initials of his name. The matter was notorious. His opinion openly given. No objections advanced againſt it, and the loan cloſed without any idea of criminality in his conduct being entertained by any body.</p>
                        <p>With the <hi>form</hi> of the abſtracts the defendant had no concern, <hi>That</hi> was ſettled by the officers of the United States. Blank forms were printed for general conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, and printed forms were generally uſed. As all the certificates <hi>aſſumable</hi> were <hi>equally</hi> ſo; there could be no occaſion to <hi>diſcriminate</hi> on the abſtracts, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds. If it had been neceſſary as the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> he would have requeſted it. It was not the <hi>duty</hi> of the defendant to do it, as he had merely undertaken, and that voluntarily to declare them genuine and aſſumable; and it would require more of his time than his official engagements would permit. Since all certificates ſubſcribable were <hi>equally</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there could be no occaſion to <hi>diſcriminate</hi> on the abſtract on the transfer to the State their ſeveral kinds, becauſe they were to be <hi>equally</hi> paid. If it were, the Regiſter-General ſhould have done it, as they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:027132_0346_0FD350FE43E82AF8"/>
him in the firſt inſtance, and it is his duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter the accounts of the State. After his examination, they were preſented to the Comptroller-General accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a demand on the State for payment. The <hi>abſtracts themſelves</hi> afforded every information that a diſcrimination could, for the <hi>dates</hi> of intereſt marked on the abſtracts, diſtinguiſhed the ſeveral kinds of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates; the intereſt on the funded debts commencing on one fixed date, that on the depreciation on another, and that of the New-Loans on various and mixed dates, all of them however diſtinct from the other two. There could have been no deſign in the defendant to conceal any circumſtance relating to the New-Loans from the Regiſter-General as they had had a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation on the ſubject, in the courſe of which they both concurred in opinion that the New-Loans were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable and redeemable, and the Regiſter-General afterwards paſſed the accounts knowing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>His own ſubſcription being <hi>openly</hi> made in his <hi>own</hi> name, confutes the idea of any clandeſtine deſign, and ſtrongly ſhews his thorough conviction of being right in his opinion. Had he ſuppoſed the contrary and wiſhed to deceive, how eaſy would it have been to divide the ſum into ſmall parcels, and procure other perſons to ſubſcribe for him in their own names. The idea that he meant to deceive until he obtained <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the money which ſeems to be advanced in this article, is too futile to have any weight and was perhaps introduced more from inadvertence than deſign. Detection would eventually be certain; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that detection would be diſappointment and diſgrace. His own ſubſcription was not hurried thro' the offices, it remained the uſual time with the Regiſter-General who might, and probably did, examine every item.</p>
                        <p>No checks of office have been broken. No official conſultation is required by law in <hi>any</hi> inſtance; nor can there legally, be any <hi>interference</hi> of the Governor
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:027132_0347_0FD35101E6B09E08"/>
except upon a <hi>difference</hi> of opinion between the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller and Regiſter in which caſe he is called in to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide: Here was <hi>no</hi> ſuch <hi>difference</hi> of opinion and of courſe there could be no <hi>interference</hi> of the Governor. The Governor alſo knew from the defendant's former communications, and his late propoſal for new model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the debt, made at the time the Act was before the Legiſlature, that he conſidered the New-Loans as a debt and at a future time to be redeemed. The certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate preſented to the Governor on which his warrant was grounded was in the <hi>uſual form,</hi> there could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no <hi>concealment</hi> implied in it. The accounts which were preſented and adjuſted and in conſequence of which adjuſtment this certificate was drawn, were alſo preſented in the <hi>uſual form</hi> and therefore would not <hi>authoriſe</hi> any deviation from the uſual courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Any cauſe that would require a <hi>diſcrimination</hi> of the New-Loans would alſo require a <hi>diſcrimination</hi> of the funded debt and the depreciation certificates. Yet no ſuch diſcrimination has been made and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has ariſen in conſequence.</p>
                        <p>If any interference in the ſecond loan by the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was wrong from principle it was equally wrong in the firſt loan, for the two loans were preciſely upon the ſame footing. Yet no fault has been found with him for it; and he has only been criminal according to the articles for acting between the 10th of April, and 1ſt of Auguſt 1792, the <hi>principle</hi> is therefore admitted to be right and the <hi>execution</hi> only wrong.</p>
                        <p>But if it be (as we hope we have proved) that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable and redeemable, that all the proceedings on his part have been regular and legal; he has acted in every inſtance right and is a ſubject of commendation rather than blame.</p>
                        <p>Even on the ſuppoſition of his having formed a <hi>wrong opinion;</hi> that opinion has been proved to be formed, when there was no <hi>intereſt</hi> to induce him to form it. To be advanced upon every <hi>public occaſion</hi> that required it. To be perſiſted in and mentioned at a time when
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:027132_0348_0FD3510389F04BD8"/>
a <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> intereſt would induce a concealment; and we cannot look for a <hi>change,</hi> when it had received <hi>ſanction,</hi> from <hi>time,</hi> from meeting with <hi>no</hi> oppoſition of ſentiment, from the <hi>concurrence</hi> of others in the ſame, and when <hi>nothing</hi> additional aroſe to occaſion an alteration. Even then upon the ſuppoſition the opinion on examination ſhall be found erroneous; it was innocently formed and cannot ſubject its author to the pains and penalties of an impeachment.</p>
                        <p>The following poſitions then have it is hoped been fully eſtabliſhed. That the New-Loan certificates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a <hi>State debt</hi> notwithſtanding the Act of <hi>March</hi> 1789, which did not contemplate their deſtruction, and which could not effect it had it been its deſign. That they were <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> to the loans of the United States and <hi>known</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be ſo by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf. Than they were <hi>redeemable</hi> by the Act of April 1792, and <hi>deſigned</hi> to be ſo by the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that paſſed the Act. That no <hi>checks of office</hi> have been broken, of courſe the defendant has <hi>broken none.</hi> That his conduct throughout has been open, candid and ſincere, and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> conformable to law in every particular. That his <hi>opinion</hi> on the ſubject is <hi>right</hi> and ſo <hi>innocent</hi> in its formation that had it been <hi>wrong</hi> he could not be amenable to puniſhment in this proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the honor of being of counſel for the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> who are the excluſive Repreſentatives of the People of this State, and they found it their indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty to execute their conſtitutional right of bringing before the Senate, in this inſtance, the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Judges, a public officer who has long ſuperintended the finances of the State, under a ſerious charge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> is accuſed of having violated the confidence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the truſt repoſed in him. Upon common caſes the hand of the law is directed by the ordinary courts of criminal juriſdiction. The Senate is conſtitutionally aſſembled to decide upon a cauſe in which the intereſts of a People are involved to which the common limits of practical law are ſcarcely applicable.</p>
                     <p>A cauſe which requires the more conſideration as it is the more rare, ſince public truſts are confided but to a few, and ſince violation of theſe truſts are happily uncommon, the preſent is recorded as only the firſt

                        </gap> citizen will wiſh it may be the laſt.</p>
                     <p>To conſtitute an offence there muſt be a concurrence of fact and of intention.</p>
                     <p>The errors of the judgment cannot be criminally puniſhed.</p>
                     <p>But when by the aid of teſtimony we probe the heart, when motives unlawful from the ſtation and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of the agent are already proved to be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to action—then the act is cloſed in the liſt of offences, and the voice of ſociety calls for its judicial animadverſion.</p>
                     <p>Of offences there are two general claſſes, one is found in the breach of any poſitive law, municipal inſtitutions, or ſtatutes.</p>
                     <p>The other in the breach of a law not of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution but impreſſed by nature on the heart.</p>
                     <p>The penalty of the firſt may be incurred without any criminal intentions, but the other depends upon the will, ignorance may at times occaſion a lapſe into the firſt, the other is known to all men at all times, in all places.</p>
                     <p>The defendant's counſel have anticipated another very obvious diviſion of the queſtion; that is, that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller acted under a proper or miſtaken conſtruction of the law. If the latter, corrupt motives muſt be plainly charged, and clearly proved.</p>
                     <p>If we ſhew that the defendant made a profit againſt law, the impeachment is ſupported. If we ſhew that impelled by improper motives, by artifice and dexterity he evaded, altho' he did not break the law, it is equally ſupported, and the commonwealth is entitled to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Something has been ſaid as to the manner of fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charges.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſtated only to be waved, and at the ſame time the Senate is informed that the defendant does not well know what he is to anſwer, you're told that he will go fully into his anſwer.</p>

                     <p>But we aver the charges are exhibited in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and cuſtomary form, that the minute certainties of indictments are not requiſite, that nothing is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally dark or tending to deceive, and that as in ſome inſtances of indictments the defendant may require a ſpecification, theſe are framed conformably to well eſtabliſhed precedents in another country. (Here Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> quoted 2 vol. <hi>Woodeſon,</hi> page 605, and <hi>Foſter's</hi> reports of Crown Laws, 389, 390, to ſhew that in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratry the defendant is not compelled to anſwer until a ſpecification of the charges is exhibited; and ſaid, ſuch was not requiſite in impeachments, and therefore concluded it was only want of form and accuracy had been attempted to be ſhewn; Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> interrupted him, and ſaid, It is not to the form but to the ſubſtance of the articles of impeachment that he intended to take exception.)</p>
                     <p>The accuſation is, in ſubſtance divided into ſix dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and ſubſtantial heads which Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then enumerated including the 5th and 6th articles in one.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. Converting to his own uſe certificates actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</p>
                     <p>The formal arrangement of theſe charges is compriſed in ſeven articles of impeachment. In all them he is charged with criminal motives, with the Commiſſion of a miſdemeanor; and if the evidence is adequate to the charges there is no doubt but the reſult will be a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Comptroller-General.</p>

                        <head>FIRST ARTICLE</head>
                        <p>Was read by Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> in a ſhort and abridged man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, retaining only the principal <hi>data,</hi> ſuch as facts, and dates; omitting the uſeleſs appendages of amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>The general charges are thus opened with the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fact reſulting from the plain and obvious text of the law and finally reducible to this ſingle point: Whether there exiſted a Legiſlative power in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                        <p>If the Legiſlative power reſided in the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and, if the Act of 27th March 1789 was paſſed by that General Aſſembly we have then only to enquire whether it did not aboliſh the former engagements of the State and reduce the certificates to mere receipts for other certificates.</p>
                        <p>Without any efforts of ingenuity, or having recourſe to meſſages, votes, reſolutions and other proceedings of of the Legiſlature from their minutes, we are led to acknowledge the affirmative from the exiſtence of the Act of March 27, 1789, and to aſcertain with accuracy the operation of it, we are led to conſider the nature of New-Loans previous to the paſſing of the law.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1, 1786, depended upon the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the public at the time, the ſtate poſſeſſed the impoſt, and appropriated it to pay the intereſt of the reputed quota of the State debt incurred during the late war.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1785 the Legiſlature affected by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and yielding to the clamours of many of their own citizens, creditors of the United States, finding itſelf poſſeſſed of a great and growing fund ariſing from the impoſts—by its Act of 16th March 1785, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated ſuch a proportion of that fund with the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the taxes as ſhould amount to £. 123,932, the eſtimated quota of this State of the annual intereſt of the federal debt.</p>
                        <p>This Act tho' little noticed, yet deſerves no ſmall degree of preliminary attention.</p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <pb n="345" facs="unknown:027132_0353_0FD351B76AAA7C40"/>13th <hi>ſection.</hi> The State-Treaſurer is to pay that ſum annually to the Continental Loan-officer.</p>
                        <p n="11">11th <hi>ſection.</hi> Monies ariſing from impoſts and arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of taxes ſo far as releaſed from former appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are reſpectively and expreſsly appropriated.</p>
                        <p>Having thus obſerved, that, this Act, the parent of the New-Loan Act, could not in its outſet be conſidered as otherwiſe than temporary, for the chief part of the impoſt being the principal fund, remained only the <hi>conditional property</hi> of the State; <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> having by her Act of 23d September, 1783, acceded to the requiſition of Congreſs in regard to the 5 per cent. and the annual tax as ſoon as thirteen States ſhould accede thereto.</p>
                        <p>To this reference appears in the ſecond and third ſections of the Act of 16th March 1785.</p>
                        <p>In the 4th ſection, one or more have not complied.</p>
                        <p>In the 5th ſection, conſiderable time <hi>may</hi> elapſe.</p>
                        <p>In the 6th ſection, citizens labour under hardſhips.</p>
                        <p>In the 7th ſection, relief to them, and to accord with ſuch meaſures as the United States in their wiſdom may adopt.</p>
                        <p>By this it is apparent that the proviſion made by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was temporary, whereas the United States did reſolve for 25 years. The declarations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of our Legiſlature contained in the laſt recited ſections are expreſsly affected by the 18th ſection, in which the proviſional limitation of the Act is contained, and this expreſs deſignation of the original fund confutes one of the arguments of the counſel who opened the defence, (Mr. <hi>Tilghman.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I need not enter into meſſages or reſolutions to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſignification of this proviſion; it was intended and declared to be temporary and conditional, and as ſuch the Legiſlature has always acted upon it.</p>
                        <p>We are told it is of no uſe to the creditors out of what fund this debt is to be paid, whereas the fund is held out and the party accepts it on the faith of that fund, and that only.</p>

                        <p>The articles of Confederation gave no power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the neceſſary funds for the payment of the public debts. Hope and view on one ſide, and the actual ſtate of things on the other. For theſe reaſons the Act of March 1, 1786 paſſed:—</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Act is expreſsly occaſioned by the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs of the 24th of September 1785, if the reſolution had not paſſed the Act would not have been made. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read the preamble to the Act 1ſt March, 1786.)</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The aggregate conditionally aſſigned by the Act of 16th March 1785 is the only fund appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Act of March 1, 1786.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is no repeal of the conditional clauſe in Act of the 16th March 1785 by the Act of March 1, 1786; the ſpirit is the ſame, only differing in mode, and form from the Act March 16th 1785.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is no aſſumption of the principal, for the receivability of the certificates in the Land-office was common to almoſt all kinds of Continental certificates.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties of the country increaſing, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a common head became more apparent, the Federal Conſtitution under which we now ſo happily live, was formed and recommended the 17th September, 1787. It was adopted by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> the 13th of December following, and by nine States on the 21ſt of June, 1788. The Act of 27th March, 1789 adheres to the original contract, it does not deviate from it. The Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> on the 27th of March, 1789, found the Conſtitution thus adopted and ready to be put in execution, it conſequently found the fund liable to be withdrawn, it found the United States able to do juſtice to her own creditors. The people their conſtituents who ſurely included the creditors had aſſented to the ſubtraction of the fund from their firſt application. In adherence therefore to the original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:027132_0355_0FD351B84AABA8B0"/>
they confirmed the payment of intereſt during the intermediate interval from the firſt ſteps taken by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to the ceſſation of the fund: They termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the payment from that time afterwards.</p>
                        <p>In the great ſcale upon which this ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the difference of a few months is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: The fund ceaſed the 1ſt Auguſt, 1789, four months after the paſſing of the Act, when the General Government took place.</p>
                        <p>If the Act of March, 1789 was inactive and wanted efficacy until that time, it then received it, the original contract was terminated. After that, none who agreed to the federal Conſtitution can oppoſe this conſtruction. This ſubject was ably handled by the young gentleman (Mr. <hi>Gibſon)</hi> who ſpoke laſt, whoſe talents exhibited on this occaſion are an honour to himſelf, and promiſe to be an ornament to his country.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1789 repealed part of the law of March 1786, the law of 1786 repealed that of 1785.</p>
                        <p>After the paſſing of the Act of March 1789 nothing of the Act of 1786 remained except what related to the payment of intereſt: For by that Act three things were to be done, 1. Receiving certificates on loan; 2. Delivering out New-Loans in exchange for others. 3. The payment of intereſt; the loan cloſed with the Act of March 1789, after that time no certificates could be iſſued, certificates iſſued by the Comptroller-General after that period are unwarranted by law. Iſſuing was unneceſſary, the Act of March 1789 is explained and arguments againſt our poſition are anſwered by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1786 was only a loan, it is ſo declared in every part of the bill. The obligation ariſing from a loan is ended with the reſtitution of the thing loaned. <hi>A.</hi> lends <hi>B.</hi> certificates to be paid the 1ſt of May, <hi>B.</hi> returns the certificates, the loan is ended. Therefore the State is diſcharged on the return of the Continental certificates, (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then adverted to the certificates and the length of time, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:027132_0356_0FD35108F4BD1170"/>
by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> as a loan to be returned by the firſt March 1796, or ſooner if convenient, and then the whole contract to be at an end, the four year's intereſt being paid.)</p>
                        <p>Sir, It cannot be ſuppoſed the Legiſlature of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> intended to go farther in 1786 than they meant to go in 1785.</p>
                        <p>In the ſummer of 1786 the Convention met at <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis;</hi> on the 30th December ſame year delegates were appointed to the General Convention; at this time a federal Union was expected; the anſwer returned by the Aſſembly, 27th December 1786, to Congreſs is not ſurpriſing, (ſee page 319, 320).</p>
                        <p>We do then aver, that the Act of March 1786 was only a loan, little comment need be made on the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſes of the law, as the only engagement pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was not to diſcharge the principal, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the intereſt on account of the United States: The Act of March 1789 in unequivocal terms puts an end to that part of the contract, and therefore the New-Loans were not ſubſcribable to the loan opened by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. He certified them to be ſubſcribable, we aver the contrary. The public debt of the United States in June 1790 was divided into three claſſes, 1. Foreign, 2. Domeſtic, and 3. State debt.</p>
                        <p>The foreign debt was ſomething more than ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: The domeſtic debt was about forty or fifty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. Of the State debts an eſtimate cannot eaſily be made. To the queſtion what debts were intended to be aſſumed by Congreſs, circumſtanced as the Union then was, it was propoſed to aſſume the State debts; and to the queſtion, <hi>What were the State debts?</hi> the anſwer is obvious, debts at that <hi>time</hi> due by the State.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the 13th ſection of the Act of Congreſs 4th Auguſt 1790, entitled "An Act making proviſion for the debt of the United States," the ſum aſſumed being 21,500,000 dollars. The two general heads of SERVICES and SUPPLIES deſcribe the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no other certificates admiſſible; and the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:027132_0357_0FD3510B4316AA28"/>
in the Act, "debts by them reſpectively owing," therefore a debt of that kind would embarraſs indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual States if the fund was withdrawn; <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had then a peculiar and proper debt, and unleſs the vacant land and the Continental certificates had afforded a fund, ſhe would be conſiderably embarraſſed, the magnitude of her debt is not eaſily aſcertained now, if underſtood at firſt; the holders had no other to look to, ſetting aſide the bills of credit: the amount of funded and unfunded depreciation certificates was about four or five hundred thouſand pounds of our money, theſe were admitted into the general claſs as being iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies in proſecuting the war and for the expences incurred during the general conflict.</p>
                        <p>The New-Loans were not within this deſcription, they were only available to withdraw the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and four year's intereſt; this is the fact, ſo far as we can gather the evidences of the intentions of the Legiſlature, and as far as we can collect a knowledge of our finances from the laws of our country.</p>
                        <p>The commonwealth was under no obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>Certificates, therefore originally loaned were divided into two claſſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thoſe which were the property of the State from the New-Loans having been laid out in the purchaſe of land.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe which were to be preſented to the holders preſenting the New-Loan certificate for re-exchange.</p>
                        <p>By the Act of 7th April 1791, no officer of your commonwealth by the Acts of your Legiſlature could ſubſcribe State debts. Her Continental certificates were an incumbrance to her until the New-Loan certificates were brought forward on the domeſtic loan.</p>
                        <p>Two days afterwards, the 9th April 1791, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part Act was paſſed by the Legiſlature; if the State of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> conſidered New-Loans as a debt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable ſhe would have included them in that law. The Act of 30th March 1791 by which the Treaſurer
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:027132_0358_0FD3515B5AC5AEF8"/>
is directed to ſubſcribe, refers to and depends upon the proviſion of the Act 1ſt April 1790. By the Act of April 1, 1790 it had been directed that they ſhould be depoſited with the State-Treaſurer: could he part from them without the order of the Legiſlature? It was not till the 30th March 1791 that an application was made of them. Then they were ſubſcribed, not to the State, but to the domeſtic loan.</p>
                        <p>By this expoſition it is manifeſt that the law of the 27th March 1789 repealed every former proviſion, and that the New-Loan certificates were only a demand to get back the Continental certificates and for equalizing the intereſt for four years.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not conſider the Conſtitution of the United States, ſo far as relates to the Acts of a State with its own citizens; no contract was impaired, no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law had been paſſed; it is not neceſſary on our part to introduce any conſideration about it.</p>
                        <p>Yet in a charge of an highly criminal nature ſome extenuation is ſought in the endeavour to eſtabliſh that this was not a ſingle conſtruction of the law; but that others, whoſe judgments were not perverted by any corrupt motives, were of the ſame opinion; that the ſame opinion was entertained by the principal officers of the United States' Treaſury. If our conſtruction is right, contrary opinions are erroneous; but had he, with all the light that ought to have been communicated to him, held the ſame opinion, what ſhelter can the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of one officer find in the error of another. It is not uncommon to juſtify the culpable tranſactions of ſome by the erroneous judgments of other individuals; if they do not mean this as an extenuation, it is intended as a juſtification, if not deſigned as one, or the other, it ought not to be brought forward at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then aſked, whether the opinion of the Secretary of the United States, a moſt reſpectable officer, ſhould be a juſtification and a proof of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the defendant, whereas the Secretary renounced his former opinion on being better informed, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:027132_0359_0FD351B9C1D22BD8"/>
ought to have been furniſhed by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General. This opinion of the Secretary ſhould not be depended upon, inaſmuch as he renounced the ſame on better information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read, commented, and made remarks on the circular letter of Mr. <hi>A. Hamilton</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the reſpective States, (ſee page 275-6). Then on letter <hi>Dallas</hi> to <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> (page 276)—then on letter (page 102-3)—then letter <hi>Dallas</hi> to <hi>Nicholſon</hi> (page 220)—then letter Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to Governor (page 220-1-2)—then on letter Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> (page 277)—then on letter Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> (page 277)—then on letter Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (page 278).</p>
                        <p>So far as theſe communications extend, it is apparent from the evidence or teſtimony of the Secretary (ſee his teſtimony page 287-8-9) that no information of the repealing law of the 27th March 1789 was ever brought before him in a <hi>"prominent point of view."</hi> When that was known, an arrangement immediately took place and the reſult is known;—Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the letter from Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> (page 76-7-8-9).</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the Comptroller-General was the only officer of the commonwealth, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the Secretary of the Treaſury on this ſubject;—Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the following letter:—</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then read the letter from Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> to the Governor, (page 218, 219).</p>
                        <p>The foregoing letters were commented upon in a ſuitable manner by Mr. <hi>Rawle,</hi> and he added;—</p>
                        <p>It is then clear that the New-Loans were never ſtated by the Comptroller or Regiſter-General as an exiſting State debt after the Act of the 27th March 1789—Notwithſtanding all this we find the Comptroller-General forgetting his official duty, and in 1792 certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying theſe New-Loans to be <hi>genuine and aſſumable;</hi> the large abſtract is not certified by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to be <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable;</hi> but the Senate well recollects, that the end for which it was intended was viſible, the 30th of June was the laſt day of ſubſcription, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of <hi>John Oldden</hi> were ſubſcribed by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General as late as the 9th of July, altering the date to hit the purpoſes, when the laws would not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the redemption of any; his omiſſion of certifying <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable</hi> in his own caſe is a proof of more increaſed dexterity, than any excuſe can be a defence.</p>

                        <head>THE SECOND ARTICLE.</head>
                        <p>In the preceding article of impeachment a charge of practices indirectly, and conſequently pernicious to <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have been compriſed; in this we trace the ſame paſſion in direct oppoſition with her laws, and operating moſt immediately and unequivocally to her diſadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Here again the proſecution commences with an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a fact for which we only pray the candid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the law: It is averred that New-Loans were not ſpecified and could not be contemplated as objects of redemption; that they were not ſpecified requires only a peruſal of the Act.</p>
                        <p>(The ſecond ſection of the Act of 10th April 1792 was then read.)</p>
                        <p>That the New-Loan certificates could not be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by any fair unprejudiced and unbiaſſed mind is not difficult to be eſtabliſhed; that they are not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond ſection is apparent; as they were not included in the ſecond ſection, the ſixth ſection ought not to be preſſed into their ſervice as an auxiliary.</p>
                        <p>The loans on the part of the United States were directed to be opened on the firſt of October 1790, and to continue open until the 30th September 1791.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was then poſſeſſed of a large portion of United States' debt, which the Treaſurer was directed to ſubſcribe by the 30th March 1791: It was believed that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> would be a creditor of the Union.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> glanced at the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldſon,</hi> which ſee laſt paragraph, page 292,) this has been ſtated by Mr. <hi>Gibſon,</hi> (ſee page 334.)</p>
                        <p>It was doubted whether the balance due to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth would be punctually paid, as the ſubſcription of every dollar of her own debt was an aſſumption of the payment of it by the United States, it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="354" facs="unknown:027132_0362_0FD351895EDE8AC8"/>
Union; but as the manner of funding the State debt would not have yielded to the State creditor a benefit commenſurate with that enſuing to the State, as ſhe was relieved from the payment of 6 per cents. by a meaſure which yielded to them only 4 per cent.; an Act was paſſed the 9th of April 1791 inviting her own creditors to accede to the United States' loan by engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compenſate them for their loſs. This Act had its effect, ſubſcriptions took place to the amount of £. 252,697: And purpart certificates were iſſued to the amount of £. 136,543.</p>
                        <p>In December 1791 the Legiſlature beheld with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction the wealth and proſperity of the State, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the author of the plan of finance, ſhe paſſed the Act of the 10th of April 1792—the State being then only encumbered with the intereſt on funded and unfunded depreciation debt, funded debt, dollar money and purparts.</p>
                        <p>Far from thinking a public debt, attended with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient advantages, either neceſſary to procure her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the Union, or to attach her own citizens to her intereſts.</p>
                        <p>To counterbalance theſe inconveniences, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make uſe of the means to relieve her incumbrances at once, they reſolved to ſell ſo much of her 3 per cent. ſtock at 12 ſhillings in the pound, or £.60 per cent. as would diſcharge all her debts: It was propoſed by the Legiſlature fairly to purchaſe the ſubſcriptions of thoſe of her own State creditors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſecond article who would ſubſcribe; the law itſelf juſtifies this conſtruction, and manifeſtly nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives the conſtruction attempted to be given to the ſixth ſection. In the law, as it now ſtands without any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the ſixth ſection is a proviſo to the ſecond ſection, this we have in the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> (ſee page 295-6-7-8.) The fifth ſection directs the payment by the State-Treaſurer on or before the firſt of July ſame year; the 6th ſection goes on to ſtate that they ſhall be entitled to the nominal value from the Treaſurer
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:027132_0363_0FD351BB934BAE98"/>
upon condition that they ſhall ſubſcribe to the loan, and transfer to the uſe of the State-Treaſurer.</p>
                        <p>Now, no other law exiſts authoriſing the State-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to pay the nominal value, and no other mode of effectuating the payment but by warrants drawn by the Governor, payable out of this fund: The Governor derives his authority from the fifth ſection in reference to the ſecond; but no additional clauſe, no authority is given to draw in execution of the ſixth.</p>
                        <p>It follows therefore that the intention was, that, if the loan re-opened, the ſecond ſection was only to be executed as the parties ſhould comply with the ſixth ſection.</p>
                        <p>The ſeventh ſection more clearly exhibits the views of the Legiſlature; it requires the holders of every cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate intended to be redeemed to apply before the firſt of July, and after that time all intereſt ſhall ceaſe, but if no ſale, nor notification, intereſt ſhall continue: Now it is notorious that New-Loans did not bear an intereſt of 6 per cent.; it is therefore conſequently obvious they were not included in this proviſion: Yet this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly extended to all the certificates intended to be redeemed; it follows New-Loans were not intended to be redeemed. If a member of the Legiſlature was to be aſked by one of his conſtituents, "What did you mean by this Act?" the anſwer is obvious, "Read the ſeventh ſection."</p>

                              <p>"IT is evident that the Legiſlature intended to make a general ſettlement with the creditors of the State upon the principles expreſſed in the Act of the 10th inſtant, and conſequently a partial ſale of ſtock, or a partial commutation of State debt for ſtock, will not juſtify my iſſuing a notification, which, by the terms of the law, muſt be addreſſed indiſcriminately to all the holders of the ſpecified certificates and bills of credit, requiring them to comply with the conditions of the redemption. But if the offers to purchaſe ſtock and to commute the debt at the rate preſcribed, ſhall, together, be commenſurate to the aggregate amount of the certificates and bills of credit, which are to be redeemed, I conceive that, without violating the ſpirit of the Act of Aſſembly, the object of the arrangement

                        <p>Accordingly the Comptroller and Regiſter-General joined in a report already read, dated 30th April 1792, (ſee page 225-6.) This letter encloſes the names of the purchaſers for the ſtock amounting to the ſum of 986,000 dollars.

                        <p>But it is ſaid that no verbal communication was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, except when differences of opinion between the Comptroller and Regiſter-General had occurred, and when they differed in opinion; How? When only one officer knew the tranſaction.</p>
                        <p>The Comptroller-General and Regiſter-General could never diſagree becauſe the Comptroller-General had not communicated with the Regiſter-General.</p>

                              <p>"IN conſequence of the doubt, which you have ſuggeſted, I am directed by the Governor to inform you, that when he aſſented to the idea of the State debts being received on the ſales of ſtock, it was upon this principle, that it ſhould be conſidered and eſtimated as caſh, at its nominal value; beyond which nominal value, and the rates in particular caſes preſcribed by the Act of Aſſembly, he is not authoriſed, upon the redemption, nor, conſequently, through the medium of a commutation to liquidate the demands upon the public.</p>
                              <p>"A fund commenſurate to the whole amount of the debt to be redeemed, muſt be eſtabliſhed, before the Governor can iſſue his notification; and it is certainly immaterial, whether that fund is ſatisfied by ſpecie pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by depoſits as caſh, in the public ſecurities, for which the ſpecie is to be raiſed: but the Governor conceives, that it would be contrary to the ſpirit of the law, to an impartial diſtribution of juſtice, and to the public intereſt, were the propoſals to be accepted, ſo that the payments by way of commutation ſhould be conſidered as caſh, in order to entitle the parties to a transfer of the three per cent. ſtock, and alſo as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit in order, to entitle them to intereſt until the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the time, which the notice ſhall limit for the general redemption.</p>
                              <p>"By an arrangement of this nature, a diſcrimination is not only introduced between the purchaſers of the ſtock for caſh, and thoſe who purchaſe with State debt, to the great benefit of the Latter claſs; but it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:027132_0368_0FD351629FAE9C68"/>
operate with ſimilar inequality in relation to all thoſe State creditors, who cannot have the opportunity of ſettling their claims by way of commutation; the State, too, will not only loſe the current intereſt on the 3 per cent. ſtock; but be precluded from the advantage of an immediate ſettlement with ſuch of her creditors as ſhall be diſpoſed to anticipate the period, for which the notification muſt iſſue.</p>
                              <p>Such have uniformly been the Governor's ſentiments; but, if by any means they have been miſunderſtood, he would rather relinquiſh all advantage from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent propoſals than ſuffer any cauſe of complaint to exiſt: He requeſts, therefore, that you will be pleaſed to confer with the parties, on the ſubject; and to inform them, that they may now make their election, either to abide by their propoſals upon the terms which I have ſtated, or to withdraw them.

                        <p>This article charges the Comptroller-General with a breach of the Conſtitution, here no ſhelter can be found in the ambiguity or contradiction of the law, it is a direct violation of a ſingle clauſe in a plain and explicit inſtrument; accordingly the endeavour is not to oppoſe but to eſcape the charge.</p>
                        <p>Aſtoniſhing to hear, that a warrant expreſsly to be paid out of a fund created by the Act of the 10th April 1792, and actually ſo paid by the Treaſurer, and ſo reported to the Legiſlature by the Governor—is to be protected from reprehenſion by quartering it on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fund previouſly appropriated by law to other objects, and altho' his warrants are expreſsly drawn and paid <hi>out of the fund</hi> provided by the Act of 10th April 1792, they were drawn out of the fund eſtabliſhed by the Act of the 7th April 1791—and not out of the fund provided by the Act of 10th April 1792.</p>
                        <p>By the Act of the 26th March 1789, £.10,000 were ſet apart for claims and improvements; that this has always been conſidered a peculiar fund, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to thoſe caſes which did not belong to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular claſs, and as ſuch I ſhall ſhew the ſentiments of the Comptroller-General upon it, in an official ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under his own hand.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read a part of the Comptroller's report, page 386, Minutes December 11, 1790, as follows, to wit:)</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="362" facs="unknown:027132_0370_0FD35176F0496F58"/>"There is another ſpecies of expence called claims, which cannot properly be arranged under the debts of the State, and which is certain in its amount, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the grants of the Legiſlature at the time, and not on accounts adjuſted upon fixed principles. The ſum of £. 5,000 annually is appropriated by Act of March 26th and 28th September 1789, and is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a fund for this purpoſe. It may be worthy the conſideration of the Legiſlature, whether ſuch a fund is not likely to beget many improper applications, and whether, after the State hath, by an Act of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, barred even unſettled claims which would have been legal, ſuch an invitation ſhould continue to be held out."</p>
                        <p>Theſe claims (the defendant obſerved) were likely to beget "improper applications," nothing in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion relative to the Act of April 1791: No New-Loans could be redeemed under that law, nor any claim on that fund.</p>
                        <p>But an unexpected effort is made to defend, which requires further conſideration, the charge is, that he cauſed money to be drawn from the Treaſury without a previous appropriation by law.</p>
                        <p>Not a ſingle inſtance can be produced which will ſhew, that where a warrant has been drawn on a fund, to which it was not applicable, the ſame ſhould be paid out of the twelfth appropriation of the 7th April 1791.

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> No. By the Act of the 7th April 1791 all the revenues of the State were collected into one maſs, and formed an aggregate fund towards paying the debts
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:027132_0371_0FD3511883E471D8"/>
and obligations of the commonwealth, and finally to pay all warrants drawn for claims and improvements.</p>
                        <p>It was with great propriety the warrant in favour of Mr. <hi>Rittenhouſe</hi> of the 27th September 1791 was paid out of the fund for claims and improvements.</p>
                        <p>That warrants were drawn without a ſpecification of the funds, in the caſe of Dr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and others after verdicts in the Supreme Court: Was this agreeable to law? In the ſecond ſection of the Act of the 4th April 1792 the duty of the Comptroller and Regiſter are defined, where it is enacted that the balance and fund ſhould be certified by them to the Governor, and a warrant ſhould iſſue accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Can his conduct on this occaſion be juſtified? Can this tranſaction be preſſed, as a defence, into the ſervice of the Comptroller-General?</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> at this time, and deſired him to produce the warrants. Whereupon the warrant No. 14 for unfunded depreciation debt, was read, and ſhewn that it was not certified to be payable <hi>out of the fund</hi> of the 10th April 1792, but that it was payable <hi>per Act</hi> of the 10th April 1792, and the following letter.)</p>

                        <p>☞ The ſtatement conſiſted of ſix certificates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in the whole to ten thouſand five hundred and ſeventy-eight dollars and ten cents.</p>
                        <p>By theſe it was evident unfunded depreciation was not included in the eſtimate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="364" facs="unknown:027132_0372_0FD3511A00348550"/>The Governor did not know that unfunded deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were included, nor could it appear to him that there were any others but thoſe directed to be redeemed by the firſt eſtimate and expreſsly connected with it.</p>
                        <p>Had the conduct of the Comptroller-General on theſe occaſions been otherwiſe, no impeachment would ever have lain againſt him.</p>
                        <p>I will reduce the remaining three articles into two as conciſe as poſſible, the fifth and ſixth I will conſider together as the ſame evidence applies to both.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> read the fifth and ſixth articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.)</p>
                        <p>The fifth ſtates in general terms the final objects of the labours to which the preceding articles refer.</p>
                        <p>That the plan of finance (which ſee page 280) was not laid for others, when only £.20,000 was eſtimated to be out, that he purchaſed to ſo great an amount, it muſt be acknowledged that he was induſtrious. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> explained the buſineſs reſpecting the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of Dr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and others, as not connected with this buſineſs.) With regard to the ſixth article of impeachment that he ſubſcribed for his own uſe the certificates received to be exchanged.</p>
                        <p>It is ſurprizing that ſuch a quantum of evidence hath been procured. His counſel do not deny the charge, but the inference, and contend to juſtify the tranſaction.</p>
                        <p>That the Comptroller-General led the way is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; 1. Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> a principal broker is at a loſs to divine what uſe the defendant intended them for. 2. Mr. <hi>Boggs</hi> certifies New-Loans roſe in price, and unable to know what for. But Meſſrs. <hi>Evans, Hale</hi> and <hi>Stroud</hi> have been produced to prove that the New-Loan certificates have been taken back, after they were lodged for re-exchange. The charge is, that the Comptroller-General made propoſals to purchaſe, and did actually purchaſe from perſons bringing certificates to his office to be re-exchanged. Is this an anſwer to the charge? The queſtion is not whether on an alteration of their
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:027132_0373_0FD351C0C3E95BA8"/>
minds, they took back their certificates after having lodged them with him.</p>
                        <p>But the charge is, that a ſteward of the public reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue is accuſed of having prevented an exchange which the party was deſirous to make, and which it was his duty to accelerate, by which the State ſuffered a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſs: And the defence is that in other inſtances wholly indifferent to the public, <hi>he,</hi> and not another officer aſſented to the parties receiving back, at their own requeſt their own certificates for private purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>The laſt article is certainly of too ſerious and too plain a nature to be viewed with indifference. We have Mr. <hi>M'Connell's</hi> teſtimony that he ſold that certificate to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan;</hi> Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> teſtimony proves that he never ſold any certificates nor had any private dealings with the Comptroller-General in his life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the advance of ſome indents. That he delivered all the certificates which he had to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon;</hi> that he is of imperfect memory that this certificate was of the number; that on the 15th September 1790 he drew intereſt on this certificate. As Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> never commuted with him, nor had any other dealings with the Comptroller, he is put to prove how he came by this ſuſpicious certificate.</p>
                        <p>The Comptroller-General brings his books of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, dates, numbers and ſums are not apparent on the face of them.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-ſix of theſe certificates united without dates, &amp;c. make up £.26,000 which is No. 183; forty-five certificates make up £.27,000, No. 184.</p>
                        <p>Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi> obſerves, all evidence <hi>(Couper,</hi> 65,) is to be weighed according to what one party can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and is in the power of the other to contradict.</p>
                        <p>We are not to make teſtimony but to find it; if any imputation is thrown on <hi>Blair M'Clenachan,</hi> we did not ſelect him, but his teſtimony ſhould however have this effect, that it deſerves a better anſwer than hath been yet given to it by the Comptroller-General.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="366" facs="unknown:027132_0374_0FD327F2D8139AD0"/>This impeachment hath not been precipitated, it is now almoſt twelve months ſince it commenced; the Comptroller-General has had full leiſure for the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of official documents neceſſary for him: Having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of a great part of his defence, it only remains to notice two circumſtances adduced by his counſel.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His innocence is to be inferred from his open and avowed ſentiments at former periods relative to the nature of New-Loans; (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then adverted to the Comptroller's letter, December 24, 1791, page 220-1-2, his letter to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> page 278, and his letter to Mr. <hi>Mifflin,</hi> page 223-4.)</p>
                        <p>The unvaried tenor of opinion is certainly evidence of its ſincerity—but when we find the ſame man, at or near the ſame period of time, and under the ſame circumſtances delivering opinions diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, we are led to enquire which of the two occaſions required the moſt ſerious reflection.</p>
                        <p>But in the official document, 30th November, 1791, all the claims againſt the commonwealth are mentioned and ſtated; New-Loans are omitted, yet they are not altogether too inferior objects of notice, as £. 600 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of intereſt on them are mentioned.</p>
                        <p>It will not be pretended that he intended to miſlead the Legiſlature or the Governor; and it will not be pretended that the nature of the ſtatement precluded the mention of the principal of the New-Loans: For, 1. It is an account of "claims," and he profeſſes to have always conſidered this as a claim. 2. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of other claims was noticed by him, ſuch as funded and unfunded depreciation debt, penſions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Yet while on this ſtrong ground, this important pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the 10th April 1792, it does not in all his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence appear that practical views, his avowed opinion, his mortiſing and inlaying of New-Loans into the compoſition of the fund for redeeming State debts, ſo as to make all appear of one piece was ever commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to any one; no intimation that the redemption
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:027132_0375_0FD351C2CB7DBA08"/>
of New-Loans was practicable altho' that was the time to have avowed the ſentiment.</p>
                        <p>This was however (as Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> ſays) authoriſed by the ſecret and avowed objects of ſpeculation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That ſome of the Acts in queſtion, being lawful to others were lawful to the Comptroller-General.</p>
                        <p>This is important and attacks the baſis of ſome of the articles of impeachment. I conſider it as applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his purchaſes of <hi>Oldden,</hi> and <hi>Biddle;</hi> his avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly purſuing what he profeſſed to ſuppoſe the literal conſtruction of the law of April 10, 1792, in oppoſition to what he knew to be the meaning of the Legiſlature.</p>
                        <p>The intereſt of the commonwealth, the happineſs and ſucceſs of a republic depend on the deſtruction of this unworthy principle.</p>
                        <p>It is an axiom, neceſſary for our proſperity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſeparable from our exiſtence, that a public officer ſhould have no intereſt oppoſed to that of the public: Perverting public offices to private emolument was one of the principal cauſes of the downfall of one of the greateſt commonwealths in the world.</p>
                        <p>In this grand national view, I will not deſcend to the jealous ſuperintendance of courts of chancery over executors, guardians and truſtees.</p>
                        <p>You, who are here collected, and delegated to decide this national enquiry, will never forget, that ſolemn obligation are derived from important truſts; and that whoever ſtipulates faithfully to ſerve the public, ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to renounce every perſonal advantage incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the public intereſt.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore, for a breach of this engagement he is accuſed—an offence which in all times has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as requiring adequate puniſhment. 2. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſon,</hi> 602.</p>
                        <p>I fear no contradiction in ſaying, that had <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> in 1782, when about to take the oath "faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſerve the commonwealth," and to execute the office of Comptroller-General, declared his conſtruction of it to be, that he was at liberty to purſue his opinion
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:027132_0376_0FD351C4FB160D88"/>
of the letter of the law in oppoſition to what he knew to be the intention of the Legiſlature.—That he would claim the privilege of private men to prefer his own intereſt to that of the public, and that he would avail himſelf of his official opportunities for ſo doing—he would be rejected with diſguſt and without heſitation. If this conduct would be wrong in 1782, it cannot be right in 1792. With theſe obſervations I ſubmit the caſe to the conſideration of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>In the minutes of the Houſe of Repreſentatives the following entry is recorded:</p>
                        <p>"In conformity to the reſolutions of the 25th Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laſt, the Houſe reſolved itſelf into a committee of the whole, in order to attend the trial of <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General.</p>

                     <p>MR. HIGGINSON.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Senate of the commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> is called upon by the Conſtitution to execute one of their moſt important functions, that is, A TRIAL BY IMPEACHMENT.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Repreſentatives being the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular branch have exerciſed their juriſdiction in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the charges againſt <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General: This important right devolves upon you, whoſe part is the more difficult as you have to decide and are ſet as judges over this individual, your tribunal is the greateſt in the land; being thus conſtituted, you have to reaſon with capacity; the chain is compoſed of mixed buſineſs, habits of intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and principles of confidence between the two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſympathy for each other, a mere ſuggeſtion of the danger is ſufficient to deſtroy the exiſtence of the danger.</p>
                     <p>Having premiſed this hint to you, his judges, permit me to ſay that the defendant has every thing that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable at ſtake, his reputation is at iſſue by this accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if rumour ſpread through every corner of the ſtate, if the public opinion, envenomed by prejudice, if reports of guilt and torrents of prejudice, rouſed and fomented by malice, and foſtered by envy, are ſufficient to condemn a man, the defendant is already brought to judgment.</p>
                     <p>Yet the impartiality of the tribunal will ſecure the
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:027132_0378_0FD3513B6E05E7F8"/>
officer from condemnation on any other ground than that of a fair trial according to the evidence.</p>
                     <p>We have heard great panegyricks beſtowed on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment trials in <hi>England,</hi> but hiſtory affords but few examples of ſuch trials being any other than proſecutions, oppreſſive and violent, and ending in corrupt deciſions.</p>
                     <p>The preſent trial, I hope, will be different in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and deciſion.</p>
                     <p>The articles of impeachment are diviſible into two claſſes.</p>
                     <p>The 1ſt is ſubdiviſible into four claſſes.</p>
                     <p>The 2d is of a different nature and ſcope, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently worthy of different conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Upon this, two points ariſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whether our conſtruction hath been right or wrong.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. If not conformable to law, whether it had not been our honeſt faith and good opinion.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, If New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribable to the loan opened under the Act of the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. If redeemable.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe depends on the Acts of Congreſs. (Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> then read the Act of Congreſs of the 4th Auguſt 1790, ſection 13th and the proviſo.)</p>
                     <p>By this ſection and proviſo two things are requiſite.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. That they ſhould be iſſued before the firſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1790.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. That they ſhould be iſſued for SERVICES or SUPPLIES.</p>
                     <p>With regard to the firſt of theſe qualities, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they were iſſued by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> before the 1ſt Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1790. And it is equally evident as to the ſecond. The gentleman who preceded me did not go on to ſay, that the New-Loan holders had no other debtor to look to but the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> They were iſſued for Continental certificates, ſtrange! He did not recognize this particular! Strange that a transfer of the debt ſhould alter the conſideration! The transfer was made
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:027132_0379_0FD3511FE29BBDC0"/>
for a valuable conſideration.—The law which they ſay abrogated them was paſſed before the 4th day of Auguſt 1790. The <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates excepted, being iſſued in 1786 corruptly, for no valuable conſideration, is a ſtrong argument in our favour; Congreſs prohibited the aſſumption of theſe <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates, and enacted that they ſhould not receive the benefit of this Act, becauſe they were iſſued without any valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; this exception makes the rule more ſtrong; and the New-Loans are much more included in that general proviſion, being iſſued by government, and having the recognition of public authority, being exchanged for Continental certificates which iſſued for a <hi>bona fide</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                     <p>Two objections may be raiſed againſt this argument. 1. That the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> were in their original form iſſued without that exception, and that New-Loan certificates exchanged for Continental ones were not recognized by the general government, nor by their officers, and that they could not be ſpecifically included in the 13th ſection: But are they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly mentioned in the 18th ſection?</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. By concluding from the generality of the rule, that New-Loans could not be included: But as Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> a man of much ingenuity, in the caſe of his conteſted election, quoting the words of the 4th article of the confederation, "paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from juſtice, excepted," argued that theſe were includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the article had been penned without theſe words. The arguments are ſtronger here than if they had all ſtood without the exception. But Congreſs to place it out of all doubt and controverſy, enacted a clauſe to except the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on the loan. There are no reaſons which could apply, but would have applied to the neceſſity of the New-Loans being expreſsly excepted from the loan of the Union, if they had ſo deſigned.</p>
                     <p>At all events the exception whether ſound or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded will be perfectly immaterial, when we conſider
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:027132_0380_0FD3517C426A7050"/>
our law of the 27th March 1789, which paſſed after the adoption of the Federal Conſtitution, if it meant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from proviſion, why not make a literal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to them?</p>
                     <p>Before I come to conſider the Act which erects New-Loans into ſtate debts, permit me to obſerve, that the Act which authoriſes the payment of a demand is in fact an appropriation by law previous to the grant of the warrant, and is conſtitutionally payable out of monies not otherwiſe ſpecifically and previouſly appropriated.</p>
                     <p>One reaſon is, it would always promote the good faith and intereſt of the ſtate, and it would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
                     <p>The money was to have been drawn from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury by the warrant of the Governor; if the certificate was in the uſual form, if it was ſuch as the officers would and ought to have made, believing it to be juſt and right, the officer is not to anſwer, if there was any thing untrue in the certificate, it muſt be ſhewn; if any marks of deluſion, it muſt be pointed out. The Treaſurer paid the draft, if there had not been an appropriated fund the Governor ought not draw—the Treaſurer ought not to pay.</p>
                     <p>The ſum was certified by the Comptroller-General, the ſame paſſed through the office of the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral before it was handed to the Governor.</p>
                     <p>If the certificates are not redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792, the charge is right, if they are redeemable the charge is not true; if not literally true, the charge muſt fall to the ground: Nay, ſomething more is neceſſary to make it criminal, than to ſay true, or untrue.</p>
                     <p>One criminal point is <hi>an omiſſion,</hi> but it muſt be ſhewn; that it was the officer's duty to diſcriminate, and it is their buſineſs to ſhew that it was his poſitive duty to make it known to the other officers.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="373" facs="unknown:027132_0381_0FD35121E6BE07A0"/>Much has been ſaid about the liberality and juſtice of the Legiſlature, reſpecting the Act of 1786, yet the meaſure grew out of ſelf-preſervation, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of government.</p>
                     <p>The State at this time had to chooſe the leaſt of two evils. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was punctual in paying her quota, other States were deficient; Congreſs was obliged then to iſſue indents for intereſt which depreciated, perſons from other States might buy up theſe indents to the loſs of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and the advantage of the delinquent States, and yet the payment thro' the State Loan-office was diſagreeable to Congreſs. The State of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was therefore under the neceſſity of paſſing the law of 1786 in order to ſhun the worſt of two evils. Her quota was aſſeſſed; and ſhe paid it. The motives were in order to confine her own payment to her own citizens, and the money to circulate in her own territory.</p>
                     <p>Thus it was agreed on all hands in the Legiſlature at that time, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſhould aſſume the debt to her own citizens, the only difference conſiſted in the mode: This is fully proven by referring to the plan of finance then brought forward in oppoſition to that which was adopted, both equally ſupport our argument.</p>
                     <p>(Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> read the following parts of the plans of Finance, ſee Minutes of Aſſembly, 22d December, 1785, pages 117, 124, and 126.)</p>
                     <p n="13">"XIII. Thus the foregoing balances due to the United States may readily be diſcharged. But there is ſomething more that claims the attention of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"According to the eſtimation of Congreſs, the ſum of 4,834,279 16/90 dollars, will be neceſſary to diſcharge the intereſt on the domeſtic debt of the United States till the end of the year 1784; and by the reſolutions of Congreſs of the 27th of September, 1785, facilities or intereſt certificates are directed to be iſſued for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt due until the 1ſt of January, 1785, conſequently facilities will be iſſued nearly to the amount aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>"Although this ſtate hath diſcharged the intereſt of
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:027132_0382_0FD3512546540690"/>
the debts of the United States, nearly to the amount of the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in the ſum requiſite to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the intereſt of the whole domeſtic debt to the ſaid period; and, although this ſtate hath by the Land-Office redeemed above £. 220,000 of the principal of the domeſtic debt due by the United States to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and yet continues to redeem the ſame by the means aforeſaid; nevertheleſs there remains a large portion of the whole of ſaid debt yet due to the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and there are large arrears of intereſt yet unpaid upon the principal ſums ſo due to them—This demonſtrates the delinquency of ſome of the other ſtates; a delinquency which ought not to be permitted, for (unleſs meaſures be taken to prevent it) they would even profit by ſuch delinquency, and the creditors of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſuffer on account of their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtrenuous exertions. The great quantity of facilities which would be paid to the citizens of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> would cauſe them to depreciate, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proviſion made by Congreſs to prevent it; ſo that the creditors in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> would not have the value intended them, and to which they are juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled—And this depreciation would enable citizens of other ſtates to procure them in this ſtate at a diſcount, and ſo to pay off their proportion of the Continental requiſitions with certificates obtained at leſs than ſpecie value. For remedy whereof it is propoſed,</p>
                     <p>"That the poſſeſſors of all certificates of debts due by the United States to citizens of this ſtate, the intereſt of which were made payable at the continental loan-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the Act of March 16th, 1785, ſhall have it at their option to receive from the Comptroller-General of the ſtate, a certificate for a like ſum in lieu thereof, bearing intereſt from the ſame date; and that the faith of the ſtate be pledged for the redemption of all ſuch certificates ſo iſſued.</p>
                     <p>"And that ſuch Loan-Office certificates, entitled as aforeſaid, as have been granted for continental money, ſhall be ſettled and liquidated in ſpecie by the ſaid

Comptroller-General, agreeably to the ſcale provided for that purpoſe by Act of Congreſs of the 28th of June, 1780.</p>
                     <p>"And whereas, according to the ſaid Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the poſſeſſors of certificates for money loaned before the 1ſt day of March, 1778, are entitled to an intereſt of 6 per cent. per annum in ſpecie upon the nominal ſum expreſſed in the certificates, until the final redemption of the principal; that the ſaid Comptroller-General ſhall alſo certify ſaid nominal ſum on the back of every certificate iſſued by him for Loan-office certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates of the aforeſaid deſcription; to the end that the ſaid poſſeſſors may receive the ſame juſtice from this ſtate as hath been promiſed them by the United States."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The other plan contains as follows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">"III. As the demands under the 11th and 12th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have not been duly liquidated, the preciſe amount cannot be aſcertained: But it is conceived that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs abovementioned, together with the ſales of lands, formerly pledged for the redemption of depreciation certificates, and the arrearages of militia fines, ſuppoſed to be about £.31,500 would be more than ſufficient to pay them; and that probably theſe ſources would afford the means of ſatisfying claimants as faſt as their claims could be adjuſted. The balance ſhould be carried to the aggregate fund.</p>
                     <p n="4">"IV. In order to provide for the ſum contained in the 13th and 14th articles, it is propoſed that a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription be opened at the Bank for a loan of £.2,000,000 to the State, the ſubſcription to be kept open till the firſt day of April next. The ſubſcribers to pay one-fourth of the ſubſcription down, one-fourth on the firſt Monday in April, one-fourth on the firſt Monday in July, and the remainder on the firſt Monday in October. The payments to be in Loan-office certificates, or other certificates of debts due by the United States to citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> on which the intereſt is by law now payable in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> or in ſuch depreciation
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:027132_0384_0FD35168610A8AB8"/>
certificates as are now entitled to receive intereſt from the exciſe, or in ſpecie. The intereſt to be payable from the firſt day of April, at the Bank, half-yearly. The firſt half year's intereſt to be paid on the firſt Monday in October, the ſecond on the firſt Monday in April, 1787, and ſo on, until the final payment of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. The late proprietors to be entitled to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſum of £.225,000 of the loan, or to adhere to their rights under the Act of November 1779, at their option.</p>
                     <p>"The proviſion propoſed for payment of the intereſt, and eventual payment of the principal, is as follows:</p>
                     <p n="1">"I. A tax on imports.</p>
                     <p>"Under this head it is to be obſerved, that as the preſent plan is calculated to forward and not obſtruct the views of the United States, the duties propoſed will be the loweſt ſtated in their recommendation. And when their ſyſtem ſhall be generally adopted, the duties now propoſed may be relinquiſhed, and an equivalent ſum be paid to the Bank from the duties raiſed for payment of intereſt on the debt of the United States; and of which a conſiderable part will be payable to the State, in conſequence of their receiving continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates for a loan made by the State."</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Note,</hi> It is not improbable that the funds will be inſufficient for the purpoſes to which they are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated. The diſturbances at <hi>Wyoming</hi> may perhaps call for a conſiderable ſum, which is not comprehended in the eſtimate.</p>
                     <p n="4">"VI. The amount due on the requiſitions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is (according to the 16th article) £.91,915:17:6 which is payable by their Act on the 1ſt day of May next. From this ſum muſt be taken, 1ſt. The intereſt which will at that time be due to <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> from the United States on Continental certificates received at the Land-office and in taxes. 2d. The monies paid and payable before the firſt of May to penſioners diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the ſervice. Theſe two articles will probably
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:027132_0385_0FD351C68A4F1D48"/>
amount to about £.52,000 and will of courſe reduce the balance to about £.40,000.</p>
                     <p>"But as it is propoſed to receive on the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned loan to the State, Continental certificates to the amount both of the principal and the intereſt which may be due on them, the intereſt will form a conſiderable part of the ſum. The total is eſtimated at £.1,775,000 and therefore that part which conſiſts of intereſt muſt greatly exceed the above balance of £.40,000.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Note,</hi> The poſſeſſors of Loan-office certificates bearing date before the 1ſt day of March, 1778, are entitled (by reſolutions of Congreſs) to receive 6 per cent. on the ſum ſpecified in their certificates, altho' their real value (by the Continental ſcale of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is conſiderably leſs than the nominal ſum. Hence it follows that the calculation (in the 13th article) of a principal ſum due, which is made according to the amount of intereſt actually paid by the Loan-officer, is erroneous. But ſince the intereſt due on Continental certificates will (as juſt mentioned) be an addition to the principal, it is probable that the exceſs of one will balance the deficiency of the other.</p>
                     <p>"By receiving in the propoſed loan (at their real value) thoſe certificates which bear an intereſt of 6 per cent. on more than their real value the State will gain the difference between the intereſt on ſuch real value, and the intereſt now payable by the United States, and the preſent holders of the certificates will have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain, becauſe they may (at their option) either lend them to the State on the terms held out, or have recourſe to the United States on the terms of their reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>"On the future requiſitions of Congreſs, whenever they can be proportioned (either by the rule laid down in the articles of confederation, or by the rule lately recommended to the States) it will be expedient to raiſe an account of quotas with the United States, paſſing to their credit the total ſum payable by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and to their debit the total ſum which <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> has
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:027132_0386_0FD351C9ED15AFE0"/>
paid. The balance of this account (being the exceſs or deficiency of payments) will be carried forward, ſo as eventually to be liquidated in the annual demands of Congreſs, and annual payments of the State. Since therefore a conſiderable ſum will (in the event) be pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the United States every year (however the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance may now ſtand) it will be expedient to continue the preſent annual tax on property, and carry the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the aggregate fund, which will receive.—"</p>
                     <p>It is true this laſt proviſion was not carried into effect, owing altogether to circumſtances and motives of ſtate policy.</p>
                     <p>It may then be ſaid, that it is contended the law of March 1786 was temporary. True, this idea is in the preamble of the Act of 1789, but it is not preſumed that it can be conſtrued by the <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> explanation of the ſame Act, neither intended nor mentioned, nor does the Act contain a ſingle idea of a temporary proviſion.</p>
                     <p>Read this Act according to the minutes already read, it will be eaſily ſeen that the New-Loans are an exiſting ſtate debt. Read it you will ſee a better rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction than by ſpeeches, reſolutions or reports of committees. (The 1ſt and 2d ſections were then read.) Now, Sir, let the firſt and ſecond ſections of this law be taken in any point of view, I contend the New-Loans are not deſtroyed as a debt, but at moſt only a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of payment, and a proviſion for completing the payment of intereſt for four years.</p>
                     <p>Or, a modification as to payment: To thoſe who did not chuſe to embrace the invitation, there is an offer, in the ſecond ſection. It was only as a ſuſpenſion, and to thoſe who did not chuſe to embrace it, it was only a modification of payment.</p>
                     <p>Then follows the proviſion of the option held out to New-Loan holders; thus the Act operates either as a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, or a modification; in this, two points are to be conſidered, enough of the Act of March 1786 is left to conſtitute a debt.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="379" facs="unknown:027132_0387_0FD3517F47820AF8"/>2. Repealing a law is not repealing what was done under it.</p>
                     <p>Of the Act of March 1786 enough is unrepealed to make the certificates neither null nor void.</p>
                     <p>For 1. In the 8th ſection the intereſt is directed to be paid: 2. In the 11th ſection they are made receivable in the Land-Office.</p>
                     <p>Both are only mere forms of words, for the Legiſlature could not make them null and void if they intended ſo to do; to do that, and to exclude them from the loan they muſt be rejected by the Legiſlature of the Union as the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina</hi> heretofore adverted to.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion may be reduced to this ſimple poſition, that as the gentleman yeſterday ſaid reſpecting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of a legiſlative power in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> a poſition indiſputable; ſo likewiſe in this inſtance, the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of Nature, may as well be ſet bounds to as to the principles of natural juſtice; in either caſe to become a legiſlative act, it might have the form of a law, but not the force of one: There are moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities as well as natural ones, and theſe exiſt with Legiſlatures.</p>
                     <p>A Legiſlature therefore can no more effectually anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate any rights, or enact away its own obligations, than it can enact that a body ſhall decreaſe in gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in proportion as it deſcends to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have ſaid to enforce that rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that if a law can receive any poſſible conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will avoid ſo ſerious an imputation as the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of public faith, and will comport with juſtice, ſuch conſtruction we are bound to put upon it. What a government cannot of right do, we ſurely ſhould not preſume it meant to do; unleſs the Act was planned for ſuch, unequivocal in its meaning, and unſuſceptible of any other conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>In the third ſection the words <hi>many</hi> and <hi>ſo much</hi> are relative terms, and imply that ſome would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exchange or to take back the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="380" facs="unknown:027132_0388_0FD3516A3B8D6C20"/>I obſerve that the framers of that Act, in order en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to deprive the holders of the benefit of an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſolemnly iſſued by the ſtate, would have uſed other words, would have gone further than barely to give the holders a permiſſion to exchange if they ſaw fit; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the caſe of holders who might not chuſe to exchange, they would have gone on, and declared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly the conſequences of not exchanging.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, do the operative words of the repealing clauſe deſtroy the debt of which the New-Loans are the evidence. In order to deſtroy them, the certificates themſelves ſhould be declared null and void; becauſe the payment of the intereſt or principal expreſſed on the face of them ceaſes to be ſecured by any law: does the debt of which they are the evidence ceaſe to exiſt? Can the exiſtence of a debt depend on the exiſtence of a proviſion for the payment of it's intereſt or principal? May there not be a debt without any exiſting appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the payment of the principal or intereſt? Surely there may.</p>
                     <p>How then can it be ſaid that by repealing all laws ſpecifically ſecuring the payment of the principal or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the debt itſelf is annihilated?</p>
                     <p>No, Sir, both the Preamble and the Act clearly ſhow, it was only meant the exchange ſhould be optional, and thoſe who did not chuſe to exchange ſhould retain their certificates valid on their original grounds, though without any particular appropriation for the payment of the principal or intereſt: This is the caſe under the Continental loan, and thoſe who did not chooſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the terms of that loan and ſubſcribe to it, ſtill hold and were meant to hold their evidences of debt as valid as at the firſt moment of their exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>The preamble to this Act ſtates that the funds which were intended for the payment of this debt were likely under the new government to be transferred to the Treaſury of the Union.</p>
                     <p>It was for this reaſon that the laws which ſpecifically ſecured the payment of intereſt or principal the New-Loans
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:027132_0389_0FD35127F5626990"/>
was repealed, leaving the debt itſelf, of which they were the evidences, ſound and entire. Says the ſtate, I do not mean to deſtroy my obligation, I cannot do it, but my funds are gone, and I muſt ſuſpend the payment, take your chance of my future competency, eventual ſolvency, and ultimate payment, or I will give you another choice, you may if you had rather re-exchange my obligation for thoſe of the continent, then take back your Continental certificate, and give back my New-Loan.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, Sir, inſtead of charging the Comptroller-General with having tranſgreſſed the law in violation of his duty and to the prejudice of the ſtate, rather let it be ſaid, that he magnified the law and made it honorable.</p>
                     <p>If the proviſion in the third ſection reſpecting the Land-Office be regarded, it will be recognized, that by the ſecond ſection an obligation is impoſed not upon the holder but upon the ſtate, pay the New-Loans on ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with a like ſum in Continental certificates, let it be remembered that this idea of exchange is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the queſtion, as it does not come after the repealing clauſe, the obligation, I ſay, is altogether on the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>I aſk then when the obligation of this tranſaction is not equally obligatory on both ſides, and when the ſtate is either to pay or take up the New-Loans on the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the holders, by delivery of its own property of a particular kind, but equal value, what is the reaſon, or meaning of it?</p>
                     <p>Does it not imply neceſſarily a right in the holder to demand, and an obligation on the ſtate to pay or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver?</p>
                     <p>Does it acknowledge the debt or not? Are not the Continental certificates ſtrictly the property of the ſtate? When they are obliged to part from them, does ſhe not part from a thing of value?</p>
                     <p>If the ſtate lies under this obligation, the New-Loans are a debt due from her, ſtrictly and properly ſpeaking, though they are redeemable only in a particular mode.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="382" facs="unknown:027132_0390_0FD3512B541F2F20"/>What are the Continental certificates? They are not money to be ſure!</p>
                     <p>But they are a commodity, or thing of value: The exiſtence of the debt does not depend on the ſpecies of payment: Whether my ſatisfaction of a demand, my diſlodging an incumbent obligation on me, is done by the delivery of money or any other obligation, it is a debt ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Let me aſk, whether any ſubſcriber of ſtate debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that Congreſs if their funds were to fail for the diſcharge of intereſt, could compel them to take back ſtate certificates again. AH PUNIC FAITH!</p>
                     <p>This would have been a mere tender law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently void; and a nullity.</p>
                     <p>The continent had aſſumed ſtate debts; the entries were made on the books of the Treaſury. In other words, will the United States perform their engagements if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States ſhould ſay, take back your ſtate certificates. Such a law would be unjuſt, and not binding; any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the debt would be diſhonorable to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it would rip up credit from it's ſource—Oh! ſuch an idea is prepoſterous. What then is the meaning? Then ſure, it does recognize the debt. Are not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates ſtrictly the property of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe for inſtance, that Congreſs had enacted that propoſition into the funding ſyſtem, which was propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Secretary of the Treaſury in his report on public credit, that two thirds of the debt ſhould be funded at an annuity of ſix per cent. redeemable at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the other third be paid in lands in the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Territory, at twenty cents per acre. Would this have been a deſtroying of one third of the debt? No; it could only have been in this caſe a modification of the payment. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> in his teſtimony (page 296) declared that it was immaterial to redeem that way or by the Land-Office, the price being then nearly equal; the Land-Office was ſhut againſt the New-Loans by the Act of March 1789, but another door is thrown open, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fund is ſubſtituted for the holders of the New-Loans,
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:027132_0391_0FD3516D1141F030"/>
in point of principle the ſame. The ſtate ſays, we cannot go no further, the holder does not get quite ſo much; Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells you, whilſt the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was open, a fund was provided; then the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice being open recognizes the debt; ſhut the Land-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the loſs is certain. Here is a recognition of the debt; this is a matter of diſgrace to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> firſt make an advantage of a bargain, then depreciate, and laſtly buy in at a diſcount.</p>
                     <p>Who is our accuſer? The State of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> I demand that the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will come with clean hands herſelf; we are ready to receive the ſtroke of juſtice; there is no force in the objection; it is of no conſequence to ſay that Congreſs would eventually pay the money on the Continental certificates; the means of reducing that to poſſeſſion are certainly juſt as valuable as the benefits thoſe means can procure, and the parting with the means is parting with the end, and therefore with the value.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe, I pay my debt to my creditor with the bond of my debtor, it makes no difference.</p>
                     <p>To explain further. If the New-Loans are admitted as debts of any kind; if they inveſt the holder with a right, and impoſe an obligation on the ſtate, as in the words of the Act; if thoſe holders are creditors at all of the ſtate, then they are within the ſixth clauſe of the redeeming Act of the 10th of April 1792. (Mr. <hi>Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginſon</hi> was interrupted by Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>"It is not admitted.")</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the holders are creditors this will not be denied. Are the holders of the New-Loans creditors of any body? If they are creditors then, and the New-Loans are the evidence of that credit, to whom are they cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors? Of the Union? No. Are they creditors of the State? No; ſay they! that character is deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Juſtice and ſimplicity delight in each other; they are the creditors of the ſtate, or more literally ſpeaking, they put their truſt in the ſtate, and the ſtate on the other hand, in this Act, acknowledges that ſhe has
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:027132_0392_0FD3513C79F19E40"/>
ſomething in truſt for them; which ſhe obligates herſelf in this very Act to pay or deliver.</p>
                     <p>But, it is ſaid, that this Act had received a ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the ſtatements of this, and other officers, ſpeeches of the Governor, wherein the claims againſt the ſtate are enumerated, in which the New-Loans were omitted, reports of committees on ways and means, in which the actual demands againſt the commonwealth are ſet forth, in many places they are called New-Loan debts: Theſe were likewiſe omitted, all being after the paſſing of the Act of March 1789, make a ſtrong argument, as ſhewing the uniform conſtruction in all their proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſafe to infer ſtrongly from mere omiſſions, this is a negative circumſtance, to infer from the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more ſhould be ſhewn than the omiſſion; that there ſhould have been a propriety or duty in abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting them.</p>
                     <p>The Executive whoſe part it is to addreſs the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the opening of each ſeſſions; to communicate to them the tranſactions of his department, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of pre-exiſting laws, to point out the objects which ſeem particularly to claim legiſlative attention, and above all, to ſtate the ſituation of the Treaſury, the amount of exiſting and payable obligations, for which proviſions muſt be made by actual appropriations.</p>
                     <p>Finds it neceſſary to reſort to thoſe officers with whom the documents giving this information are lodged: Theſe officers make reports with an eye to this object; the Governor takes this report for his guide to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his ſpeech, or other communications.</p>
                     <p>And then the committees on ways and means, in the Houſe, whoſe very name and ſtile point out their duty, and their ſphere, reported upon the ſame ſubject; in neither ſtatements, ſpeeches or reports were the New-Loans included after the paſſing the Act of March 1789. And why not?</p>
                     <p>Becauſe there was no propriety in including them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were unfunded, and therefore irrelevant to
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:027132_0393_0FD3513ED7327DE8"/>
the ſubject of Ways and Means: (Becauſe the arrears of intereſt excepted which were expreſsly ſtated) there was not ariſing out of them any demand which the Legiſlature had made actually payable, and for which an appropriation with Ways and Means would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It was on this ground the unfunded deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not included in them. To draw any inference from this omiſſion would deſtroy the diſtinction between funded and unfunded depreciation debt. If an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation had been neceſſary, it would be a ſubject for the conſideration of the committees on Ways and Means. It is one thing for the Legiſlature to reſolve to pay a demand, and another, and a ſubſequent one to provide Ways and Means, 'till the former is done, the latter is nugatory and unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Again, Sir, it is true, that in the laſt report read, which is the only inſtance of the kind, there is a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the debts of the commonwealth, and alſo the ſources of revenue, in which the unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation is included, and the New-Loans are not includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this will be accounted for, when we conſider; that the Land-office was open to the unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation certificates, whilſt it was ſhut againſt the <hi>New-Loans:</hi> for which there exiſted the proviſion by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in the Act of March 1789, the State was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming her New-Loans with thoſe who chooſe to make the application without diminiſhing her own active ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, while the holders of the Continental certificates exchanged, ſuffered a diminution on the nominal value, contemplated in the funding law of Congreſs; but as long as the State kept her Land-office open to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciation certificates ſhe was actually paying off the unfunded depreciation out of her own capital.</p>
                     <p>But theſe topics may certainly be diſmiſſed, for if the committee had expreſſed their opinion directly againſt the New-Loans as a debt, it would be neither more nor leſs than the laſt committee did, who originated this impeachment, and could have no more influence
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:027132_0394_0FD327F00DC99250"/>
or weight, except their opinions had been bottomed on a more ſolid foundation.</p>
                     <p>But, again, it is contended from another quarter that this ſubject hath received a conſtruction, and been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly decided upon by the Secretary of the Treaſury againſt their ſubſcribability. Permit me to turn for a moment to that correſpondence, the firſt letter which is connected with this ſuppoſed deciſion is the letter of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> of January 14, 1793, (page 74-5-6) and its anſwer, (page 76-7-8) by which it is attempted to be proven that he has decided on their non-ſubſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                     <p>(After the two letters were read, Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.)</p>
                     <p>I will not undertake to ſay how far it was proper for an individual member of the committee to anticipate the Act of the whole, and as it were foreſtall informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſubject; however, it may be remembered, that at this time, the impeachment was ſlowly growing under the foſtering kind culture of the writer's, <hi>(Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)</hi> hands.</p>
                     <p>The firſt circumſtance that ſtrikes me in reading <hi>this letter</hi> and <hi>the anſwer,</hi> is, that the two laſt queſtions were left unanſwered by the Secretary of the Treaſury; to the laſt he replies nothing, and on the matter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he obſerved hypothetically, that if the New-Loans are not a debt they are not aſſumable; from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance I infer, conſidering that gentleman's charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (I mean the Secretary of the Treaſury) that thoſe queſtions were in his opinion improper; at all events it is certain that the anſwer to it was not what was wiſhed for, otherwiſe the ſubſequent letter of the Governor, which I ſhall preſently read, would have been unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, the object of enquiry being preciſely the ſame. This letter of Mr. <hi>Gallatin's,</hi> contains a ſingular courſe of reaſoning, and deductions from premiſes, which the writer knew at the time to be unfounded. The Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtates forty thouſand pounds, as outſtanding; he (Mr. <hi>Gallatin)</hi> then goes on to obſerve, "But as ſome
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:027132_0395_0FD351CB855F5208"/>
have been offered," &amp;c. (page 75.) Sir, he had it not more in proof that ſome of them were not ſo exchanged after they were offered than before. From the documents of the Comptroller-General a report had in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance been made to the Governor, and tranſmitted to the Secretary of the Treaſury; the writer's animadverſions therefore on that ground impliedly criminates that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
                     <p>He obſerved alſo, that "I ſhould be led to think," &amp;c. The grounds of the Secretary's opinion did not imply any ſuch declaration; but even if the premiſes had been true, the concluſion would not follow: This would indeed be a fiction with a witneſs to it.</p>
                     <p>Here I will take it with Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> that the reaſon why the Secretary of the Treaſury did not require the ſurrender or ſuſpend the intereſt, muſt neceſſarily have been, becauſe, he looked upon all the New-Loans to be either redeemed or re-exchanged; now, if in order to account for the Secretary's not requiring a ſurrender or ſuſpending payment of intereſt, the inference is that he conſidered them aſſumable and redeemable; Does it follow that he ſhould reject them as aſſumable? by no means. The contrary is the proper concluſion; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows immediately and directly that he ſhould admit them as aſſumable, and it would alſo follow, that the demand could only be on the grounds that they were aſſumable, and alſo that a ſuſpenſion would follow unleſs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates were ſurrendered, which the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury agreed might be done.</p>
                     <p>But the anſwer to this letter did not contain the idea which ſeems to have been anticipated and expected by the writer; therefore we find the Governor writing to the Secretary of the Treaſury on the ſame ſubject the 29th July 1793, (letter page 351-2 then read) and the Secretary's anſwer of Auguſt 21, 1793 (ſee page 218-9). This letter left the queſtion of the validity of the Act of March 1789, reſpecting the aſſumability of the New-Loan certificates untouched. The opinion of this officer on the ſubſcribability of the certificates is not expreſſed
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:027132_0396_0FD352608A16D320"/>
in any part of this letter. "Theſe circumſtances, &amp;c." this ſentence contains an opinion, but that opinion is not on the principle that New-Loans are not aſſumable, is not, that the law of March 27th, 1789 deſtroyed them as a debt, but it is that the foregoing enumerated cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ariſing from the interference of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have amounted to a virtual rejection of them in effect; which does not even implicate his opinion on the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of law.</p>
                     <p>Again, "I was about to conform, &amp;c."—This ſurely does not imply his own opinion, and how far this officer, after having referred a queſtion of law to the Attorney-General of the United States, the firſt profeſſional officer of the government, and received his opinion, may think himſelf bound by it, I cannot undertake to determine.</p>
                     <p>It is probable however, when the queſtion was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtful and the opinion founded on public expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency, when this State appeared ſo anxious to avoid any miſunderſtanding with the Treaſury of the Union, that opinion might be conſidered obligatory as to the fact of admitting or rejecting them. We contend, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that the Secretary of the Treaſury had not in this letter expreſſed his opinion at all on the operation of the Act of March 1789, much leſs on the validity of it; if then, it is clear, that the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury has in the courſe of this tranſaction expreſſed his opinion unequivocally in favour of the New-Loans, and if in this letter he does not expreſs his opinion againſt them, there are ſtill odds in favour of the officer now on his defence: But I go further, Sir, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that if this officer has at all expreſſed his opinion on the principle of this queſtion even after the diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Act of March 1789, it is in favour of the New-Loans and not againſt them.</p>
                     <p>This will appear from ſeveral paſſages in his letter in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> letter; when the Act of March 1789 had been brought into his view, for he expreſsly adverts to that objection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="unknown:027132_0397_0FD32802D2864F40"/>Before I read thoſe paſſages, ſuffer me to make a comment on the firſt part of a former letter (ſee page 76, &amp;c.) from this officer. It may ſerve to ſhew that the extreme ſolicitude diſcovered by the State with regard to this queſtion might have betrayed the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury into a want of accuracy, a miſtake which can be very ſeldom imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>The paragraph to which I allude is that (page 77) <hi>"that they ſhould at the time of being ſubſcribed be recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the exiſting laws of the States as evidences of debts by them reſpectively owing."</hi> With the moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful deference to the writer of this letter, I conceive that this expreſſion is not ſufficiently defined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; for if any State had paſſed a law abrogating cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain certificates, which by the funding law were made ſubſcribable and redeemable, that law would not be permitted, or ſuffered to take away that right or benefit thus given and guaranteed by a pre-exiſting and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount law of the United States.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe, after the paſſing of the Act of the 4th of Auguſt 1790, the whole loan under the aſſumption, at that rate, might have been defeated, fruſtrated, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered void.</p>
                     <p>In a ſucceeding paragraph, he obſerved, "If how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the New-Loan certificates are not by the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> conſidered as <hi>debts</hi> but merely as receipts for certificates of the United States," &amp;c. (ſee page 78.) It may be obſerved that this is a mere hypothetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and as it comes in as a qualification to the other remark, that as the certificates were then preſented, no doubt could be entertained of their aſſumability, it clearly implies that if this condition fails, that is, if the New-Loans cannot be conſidered as mere <hi>receipts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable at the pleaſure of the government, then no doubt could remain of their aſſumability alſo.</p>
                     <p>Now taking it for granted for a moment that the State could convert that into a mere receipt, which was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally iſſued as an obligation, yet ſhe has not done it; as there is nothing then which obliges the holder to part
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:027132_0398_0FD351FD454AC450"/>
with his New-Loan on the application of the State, it is utterly impoſſible to conſider the New-Loans as mere receipts, demandable at the pleaſure of the State; and their being ſo, conſtitutes the very object of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury's ſuppoſition. As then this hypotheſis fails, as the New-Loans cannot be conſidered as mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts demandable at pleaſure, what follows? Why, they revert back to their original ground, the propoſition aſſumes its firſt and original form, and in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſury, they are aſſumable:—This idea is held out in another of his letters, where he adverts to the Act of March 1789, but to ſuppoſe that the holders of New-Loans are creditors, and their certificates no more than mere receipts, and conſequently no debts, this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be ſupported without doing a violence to the letter of the law; but, on the other hand ſuppoſe we ſhall coincide with their conſtruction of the Acts of the Legiſlature, and agree with the Attorney-General of the United States himſelf, who ſays, (page 81) that "the Act of March 1789, &amp;c. aboliſhed theſe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates as debts of the State, as wanting the due recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from the State, and cannot be legally received upon loan." A moment's conſideration will ſhew that this was a contract: And when the Conſtitution of the United States is brought into view, this inſtrument ſays, that all debts and engagements ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under this conſtitution as under the confederation. But they ſay firſt, this does not apply, and ſecondly they ſay, the Conſtitution refers only to contracts between individuals, and not between a State and her own citizens.</p>
                     <p>Now it is certain, loans are contracts, and if contracts are loans, and the Act of March 1789 paſſed after the adoption of the Federal Conſtitution, then it is certain that the New-Loans are ſubſcribable and conſequently redeemable.</p>
                     <p>If it can extend to contracts between citizens of a State, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> it extends to contracts in which the State is a party.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="391" facs="unknown:027132_0399_0FD328041FEFA0F0"/>So intimate is the connection; ſo great is the influence which the conduct and character of the ſeveral States have upon that of the Union, that the framers of this inſtrument muſt have been blind to the general intereſt, if they had not introduced this proviſion.</p>
                     <p>To tie up the hands of the Union, therefore, in that Conſtitution would have been uſeleſs, without tying up alſo the hands of the States with reſpect to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</p>
                     <p>Will the United States tie up their own hands and not tie up the hands of the individual States? Thus guarding the two extremes and leave a vacuum in the middle unguarded!</p>
                     <p>What was the reaſon for inſerting it in the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? To preſerve public credit. Is there a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſubject in the world than public credit?</p>
                     <p>The ſituation of the country at the time made ſuch a proviſion neceſſary. The <hi>American</hi> name which from the independence had been ſliding faſt to ruin, had every thing to make her happy, but wanted one thing to make her reſpectable, that was CREDIT; the grand <hi>deſideratum</hi> without which the reſt would be nugatory and unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Sir, if the limbs were palſied, what would it avail that the body was ſound, I will not inſiſt upon the proverb of the ſheep, but this I will ſay, that where the children turn out badly, it is apt to hurt the reputation of the family: If a State had the power of impairing her own contracts and ſacrificing her faith, then it would follow, that however well diſpoſed the general government might be, however ſound at the centre; yet all the States in ſucceſſion might ſacrifice their credit by impairing their contracts, and the Union robbed of her reſpectability, and her credit by the miſmanagement of her children left to parry the ſtrokes of fortune.</p>
                     <p>But another thing; this omiſſion would not only have been the road by which the credit of the Union would deſert it, but it would have been the ſource of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and contention at home. If the Conſtitution had
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:027132_0400_0FD351CD9C8911A8"/>
not expreſſed this prohibition, civil wars might have been the monuments of its weakneſs. While in one State the obligation of contracts was held as ſacred as it ought to be; in another they would be proſtrated to temporary convenience.</p>
                     <p>Taking this caſe, then, to be literally within the words and eſſentially within the ſpirit of this clauſe; let us ſee in what manner it has been violated.</p>
                     <p>And firſt. Were the New-Loans a debt, or evidence of a debt due from the State of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> at any time before the paſſing of the Act of 27th March, 1789?</p>
                     <p>As to this, I take it to be undeniable that the New-Loans had been a debt of this State. This is not only acknowledged and implied by the tenor of the articles themſelves, but they are expreſsly called a debt of the State in the Act which created them; and alſo in the Act which impaired them.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, this is conceded on all hands, except by one, the Treaſurer of the State (ſee page 68) in his letter to the Speaker of the lower Houſe; wherein he ſtiles them <hi>"Which in fact never were a State debt."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be obſerved however, that if the law of March 1789 ſhould be found not to abrogate or deſtroy the debt, which I think will appear, yet if it in any way impairs the obligation of the contract, it is moſt clearly and undeniably a violation of the Conſtitution of the United States, and therefore void to all intents and purpoſes, and if ſo, this tribunal is bound to conſider it, as never having any exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Again, and for the laſt time, upon a ſtrict compariſon of the Acts of March 1786, and that of March 1789, it will be found that the New-Loan certificates were equally unimpaired after the Act, as they were before.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee how much, in order to diſtinguiſh between thoſe parts which created the debt itſelf, and thoſe which directed the payment of principal and intereſt: It may be conſidered the funds for payment of intereſt were temporary. (Mr. <hi>Higginſon</hi> then read the minutes of 1789, page 145, by which it appeared that the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:027132_0401_0FD35262B2B72780"/>
reſpecting the principal of the New-loans was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced at the third reading of the bill. The original and primary object of the bill being, that the intereſt ſhould ceaſe, as the proviſion for that purpoſe had been temporary.</p>
                     <p>In page 184, "it was moved by Mr. <hi>Fitzſimons,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Mr. <hi>M'Pherſon,"</hi> &amp;c. The bill originated through the exigency of the State. Before the law paſſed, the Land-office was to have been ſhut, in what manner was it to be produced? it was forbidden—Is not forbidding a <hi>payment</hi> in futuro, a teſtimony of the exiſtence of the debt.</p>
                     <p>The payment of New-Loan certificates was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Land-office. Now, what parts are thoſe of the Act of March 1786 which created the debt? Even the Act itſelf did not immediately create the debt; thoſe parts in the ſecond ſection do not. The loan was to be opened, ſuppoſe none chuſe to ſubſcribe to it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; then there would be no debt: By opening, ſubſcribing, and paying, the debt ſprung into exiſtence, that moment it became a debt: and a certificate is given merely as an evidence of that debt. (The ſecond ſection of the Act of March 1, 1786 was then read.)</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in this to ſecure the payment of either principal or intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Nothing in the ſecond ſection directs or ſecures the payment of the debt, the kinds of certificates directed to be received on loan are not immediately under the firſt and ſecond ſections.</p>
                     <p>But the repealing clauſe of the Act of March 1789 has full force, ſatisfaction and complete exiſtence out of the other clauſes of the Act of 1786. Ingenuity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all her hundred eyes is not able to eſcape the inference which I draw from a ſtrict compariſon of the Acts of March 1789 and 1786.</p>
                     <p>Why then need we be drawn into the imputation of ſo diſreputable a violation of public faith? How then, can it be charged, as hath been done by one gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that this officer by the <hi>magic wand</hi> of his office
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:027132_0402_0FD35210C6BFB8E0"/>
had conjured up the ghoſts of the departed New-Loans to frighten away the dollars of the commonwealth, without imputing to the State, who was their creator, the odious crime of unnatural murder?</p>
                     <p>Let us now conſider how this hath been conſtrued by the Legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>In an Act paſſed the 30th September 1791, for the relief of <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> and others, who had loſt New-Loan certificates, the State undertook to ſubſcribe for their uſe, and to pay to them the intereſt on ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, on their giving ſecurity to indemnify the State ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inſt the holders of her certificates.</p>
                     <p>This Act proves two things. Firſt, that the New-Loan creditors of themſelves could do nothing, they had no claim on the Union, and therefore were not creditors of the Union. And ſecondly, By requiring an indemnity from the holder, inevitably implies a right of demand on the State veſted in that holder, and that right of demand whatever it be, conſtitutes the ſtrictneſs and propriety of character of CREDITOR.</p>
                     <p>In the inſtructions of the Supreme Executive Council (page 267) are theſe words, <hi>"You will iſſue a new cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate."</hi> Will it be contended that theſe are mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts? can certificates of parts be debts, when the whole was no debt in its original form?</p>
                     <p>As the caſe then is brought thus clearly within the ſcope of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, what can be offered in oppoſition to our concluſion?</p>
                     <p>One thing only, that as the New-Loans themſelves amounted to more than this State's proportion of the aſſumed debt, it could not be imputed to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they meant to include the New-Loans: it may be remarked, that as the inference drawn by Mr. <hi>Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> from the conſequences of the rule laid down by him relative to the 4th article of the confederation, it only proved the law a bad one.</p>
                     <p>As this is introduced a preſumptive argument is brought forward againſt it. They ſay, how injurious it is to the State, and of what bad conſequences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:027132_0403_0FD352663A9617B8"/>
her own debts at 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> in the pound! If they call this a bad conſequence, give it that conſtruction, as a preſumptive argument as it regards the State, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is with us, and not with them.</p>
                     <p>Here is a ſingular circumſtance, they have violated the rules of law, they have conſtrued the law of 1786 ſtrictly with regard to this object; and they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued the law of 1789, which confers benefits liberally in their own favour.</p>
                     <p>Again, another argument is brought forward.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid the ſixth ſection is a proviſo to the ſecond ſection.</p>
                     <p>If ſo, the object was thoſe which ſhe had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in the ſecond ſection to the benefit of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>If ſo, the ſixth is co-extenſive with the ſecond as to objects. If the New-Loans by the ſixth ſection are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable through the medium of the United States, it is ſtill better: If they are not redeemable, the mode is not commenſurate to the objects contemplated in the ſecond ſection, and it is wrong to aſcribe that to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, which could not be her motive.</p>
                     <p>Bills of Credit are enumerated and provided for in the ſecond ſection; the ſixth ſection is introduced to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, and yet Bills of Credit are not included in that ſection at all, notwithſtanding which, it is called a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to the ſecond ſection; with an eye to ſuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they aſcribe a ridiculous motive to the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature: that by the Act of April 7th 1791, the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is injurious refers only to the Act of March 1789, as an arrangement for the <hi>future:</hi> The State <hi>may</hi> deem it proper to make ſuch for the purpoſe of avoiding any interference with the State or domeſtic ſubſcription.</p>
                     <p>Had it been the reaſon the State would have actually aſſumed her domeſtic debt.</p>
                     <p>It was eaſy to tell the amount of what was outſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>It was only to conduct the outſtanding from thoſe on hand; there was no difficulty; it was only to add or to ſubtract; the object was to leave greater room for thoſe
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:027132_0404_0FD351FEBA291960"/>
debts which were a greater and a more immediate bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then on the State.</p>
                     <p>One of two things muſt be their object.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Either to narrow down the intereſt, or 2 To give a facility to re-exchanging, and to their ſubſcribing to the Continental loan; and in either caſe the New-Loans would not be re-exchanged at all.</p>
                     <p>No other reaſon can be properly given for it; if we conſtrue the law liberally, and not fooliſhly.</p>
                     <p>It was contended, that if we ſhould have conſtrued the ſixth ſection literally, we could not have given it ſo fooliſh a conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid the Comptroller committed himſelf by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering an eſtimate to the Governor. If a proviſion is made in the ſixth ſection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, there may be ſome reaſon for it; but if not, the ſuppoſition is unſupported.</p>
                     <p>Let us conſider this a little; it is clear from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſection, that no proviſion is made there for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciation, and none for the New-Loans in the ſame ſection.</p>
                     <p>One of them it is agreed, and both, we contend, are included in the ſixth ſection; it is alſo clear that no certificates which are not included in the ſecond ſection, can participate in the funds to be created by the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock; for that fund is limitted to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects therein enumerated.</p>
                     <p>It this be true then in an eſtimate which was to direct the Executive in the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock, neither the unfunded depreciation nor New-Loans ſhould have been included, even if the eſtimate had been made after the Act for re-opening the loan had paſſed: But at all events, I aſk, how was it poſſible that the two offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, from the 13th to the 16th of April, could include in their eſtimate objects that would be embraced even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, if at all by the ſixth ſection; whereas the Act of Congreſs of the 8th of May 1792, was not then paſſed.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of uſing this conſtruction of the law for their
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:027132_0405_0FD3525D43E60430"/>
own purpoſes, they are compelled to uſe it for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                     <p>Let us for a moment ſuppoſe, that the Legiſlature intended as they are inclined to have it, and ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and how do you find this conſtruction of theirs, to work the deſtruction of the debt? Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is conjectural, uſeleſs and dangerous: If ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribability is the criterion, they are miſtaken in the premiſes; if the New-Loans are a debt, ſubſcribable and redeemable are convertible terms.</p>
                     <p>If the ideas are not to be collected from the Act it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then we ſhall in time have an hundred laws inſtead of one, then an end to legiſlation.</p>
                     <p>Having made theſe obſervations on the firſt articles reſpecting the law, I will in the next place treat of the the motives. But firſt permit me to make ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations reſpecting the three laſt articles of impeachment.</p>
                     <p>We avow the facts contained in the fifth article, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the legality, and contend we had a right ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>When the defendant aſſumed the office of Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, he did not relinquiſh the duties of a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. How far it may be good policy to paſs inhibitory laws, and how far it may be improper, to paſs ſuch poſitive laws, until ſuch laws are paſſed, we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a right, and until a queſtion is raiſed on ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law, our actions cannot be impeachable.</p>
                     <p>We have heard from <hi>Wodeſon</hi> that a public officer ſhould have no intereſt diſtinct from the State.</p>
                     <p>Where is the force of this reaſoning? attend to the circumſtances. That impeachable matter muſt be an injury to the State, and not the gain of the officer. Where is the injury to the commonwealth in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular? In what does it conſiſt? Does the payment of a juſt and valid debt conſtitute this injury and detriment? If ſuch can be viewed in this light it is well worthy of obſervation.</p>
                     <p>The 6th and 7th articles aim to place us in a much more irkſome and ugly ſituation, and here I cannot help remarking on what fell from the other ſide; that great
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:027132_0406_0FD3526CC5A7FF80"/>
merit is due to them for being able to ſhew ſo much, when from the heinouſneſs of the fact, the Comptroller might conceal the whole matter; how ſingular, that this very proof and teſtimony is evincive of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. Nay, in this particular our accuſers take merit, that they have ſhewn and proven too much.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing common to both theſe articles, they infer property in the State, and make it by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation neceſſary, and from different premiſes; it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable the framers of theſe articles thought property eſſential to conſtitute the offence.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixth article it is inferred from the certificates being lodged for the purpoſe of being re-exchanged. It may well be aſked, Had the owner no controul over them, what was his ultimate object? On what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were they to become the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
                     <p>Sir, the Act was only inchoate, indents were to be paid, or received. Could the State withhold the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates if the party chooſe to withdraw them? Would it not be liable to execution as the property of the party? No doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>The committee, who were the drawers of this article, have ſhewn their idea that this concluſion was weak, and unſound, for if this conſtituted property, the fifth article would be nugatory and unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>(The fifth article was then read.) This gives a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the exchange. The committee have plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the facts in the ſixth may be demurred to.</p>
                     <p>What is the proof brought forward to ſupport this 7th article? It is ſaid Mr. <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> was once the proprietor of a certificate which he never ſold to us, and they endeavour to throw the burthen of the proof on us. This witneſs ſpeaking from memory, ſays he did not receive this certificate from <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> he does not pretend to ſay that he ſold or exchanged this or any other certificate with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller-General; but he tells us expreſsly that he ſold to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="399" facs="unknown:027132_0407_0FD3526FF9F43268"/>Let us examine this a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ſays he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our certificate of £. 3275:19:4 from <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> this he abſolutely received in April 1788.</p>
                     <p>The witneſs, who is brought forward is unable to prove how he came by any of his certificates.</p>
                     <p>This idea involves a new and delicate point of law, taken from analogy in other criminal caſes. When a felony or forgery is ſworn to, and the inſtrument with which the felony or forgery was committed be found on a perſon, the preſumption is ſo ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has the thing wherewith the crime was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated, that the party with whom the inſtrument is found muſt account. Here they ſay the witneſs did not ſell it to us; but they endeavour by the abſence of the fact to lay the burthen of proof on us, to make a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal charge where there is no proof of criminality.</p>
                     <p>A certificate was once Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's;</hi> one of two things muſt be admitted. 1. That the certificate was exchanged, and criminally converted to our uſe; or, 2. We bought from ſome other perſon. It proves nothing againſt us. Out of the two modes, which is moſt preſumable? one is a fair purchaſe in a circuitous route, the other a criminal converſion.</p>
                     <p>Is there a criminal tribunal on earth which would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a proof ſo nugatory to ſupport and enforce a proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Need I aſk which will be choſen. Is the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt attrocious item to be ſupported by the ſlighteſt proof, by the vague remnants of a memory frail in its beſt eſtate? If this were ſupported as it is repreſented, the breath of the offender might taint the walls that hold him. But we find a mill-ſtone in the articles, and a feather in the proof.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I do not fear, becauſe I do not believe that this tribunal will find it to their ſatisfaction to convict a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable fellow-citizen and a reſponſible officer upon a raſh and dangerous implication upon evidence ſo trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and indefinite, and that too going to a charge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly vague in itſelf and general as the light we ſee by.</p>
                     <p>This brings me to the ſecond diviſion of my ſubject,

                     <p>Mr. HIGGINSON ſpoke as follows—</p>
                     <p>Having yeſterday obſerved on all the articles of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, except the third article; as it reſpects mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of evidence in ſupporting the criminal intent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming or cauſing to be redeemed New-Loans: I will make ſome remarks on that head, and the circumſtances which evince the integrity of the officer now upon trial.</p>
                     <p>To introduce this, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that, out of the doubtfulneſs of the queſtion on the law itſelf, if on all hands the conſtruction of the ſeveral Acts has created embarraſſment, it will be remembered, that on the reading of the report to the Lower Houſe, after the committee had had the ſubject before them a very long time, Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> apologized for that delay by inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe that they had waited ſome time for the opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States (Mr. <hi>Randolph.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If their charity hath begun at home, I hope yours will not end there.</p>
                     <p>The Secretary of the Treaſury doubted the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act of March 1789, and deemed it ſo
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:027132_0411_0FD351D33A7B63C8"/>
doubtful a queſtion as to induce him to conſult the law officer of the general government.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſir, let it be recollected, that in ordinary and perſpicuous caſes, this recourſe is never had to profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional and official opinion. From this, then, it may fairly be inferred that this caſe was not ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to ſtate the degree of perſpicuity which is neceſſary for any particular mind to found a concluſion upon.</p>
                     <p>But if the mind of the Secretary of the Treaſury in conſidering the caſe from the relation that every law bore to the ſubject, partook of theſe embarraſſments, how eaſy is it to conceive that from the <hi>bona fide</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Comptroller-General, that deciſion might have reſulted, the conſequence of which was the redemption of theſe certificates.</p>
                     <p>If then there was this want of perſpicuity that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on all hands heſitation and embarraſſment, it would have been highly uſeful and proper in the Legiſlature to have given to this ſection a clearneſs incapable of being miſtaken.

                     <p>But in the ſecond place with regard to their ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, other officers of eminence, of talents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, concurred in opinion with the officer now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Sir, it is in teſtim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> that the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury pending the firſt loan was of opinion, that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable, and gave ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Continental Loan-officer, and that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not to this moment decided upon, and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the ſame to the commiſſioner aforeſaid (ſee page 273-4-5.) "I do not conſider you as juſtifiiable." &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> a law officer of the government, was
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:027132_0412_0FD352BF8019F870"/>
of this opinion, a gentleman well qualified, and of much integrity. What is to be inferred from the ſilence of all the State officers during the demand of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates? they all held the ſame opinion. (The letter, page 102, was then read.)</p>
                     <p>If the Secretary of the Treaſury had been unacquainted with the law, were the Governor and Secretary of the commonwealth ignorant? The whole tenor of this letter neceſſarily implies the ſenſe of the writer to be that the New-Loans were liable to be aſſumed, for the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion being to prevent the payment of intereſt twice on the ſame ſum; no queſtion could ariſe out of it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the New-Loans, without their being ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: In all, the <hi>ſuſpenſion of intereſt</hi> and <hi>aſſumability</hi> were the principal things to be conſidered. If any doubt had exiſted with the Governor, would he not have ſifted it to the bottom? If any doubt remained reſpecting their ſubſcribability, would they not endeavour to clear up the matter?</p>
                     <p>With regard to the Secretary of the commonwealth, there is a circumſtance which ſtrongly corroborates the aſſertion, that he muſt be ſatisfied of the ſubſcribability of the New-Loans. He appeared to be ſurpriſed when the matter of the aſſumption was communicated to him; this information ſeemed to run counter to his judgment! The Secretary had ſeen Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> plan of finance, in that plan the New-Loans are recognized as a debt; he approved of the plan, (ſee his letter page 286.) It came before him with its "prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;" the plan put the New-Loans on the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other debts of the commonwealth. Why ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed? Perhaps the reaſon may be, becauſe there was no redemption law at that time. Is that a reaſon? Why? certainly not.</p>
                     <p>Further, It is given in teſtimony that after ſeveral conferences the Regiſter-General concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and that the accounts contained ſome certificates depreciated on the principal which no body could miſtake for any other than New-Loans;
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:027132_0413_0FD35270C36504C0"/>
the probability is, that the ſame was redeemed; immaterial whether before or after our abſtract, which had been <hi>bona fide</hi> preſented and redeemed: Yet this man, whom they repreſent as hackneyed in perfidy, this man who veiled and maſked the proceedings to delude the other officers of government into error is found expreſsly to have communicated with them, while they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in the conviction which that conference produced.</p>
                     <p>The next reaſon, then, that I would offer is that the Comptroller-General held the ſame opinion on the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumability of the New-Loans, long before the Act of April 10, 1792, by which alone he became intereſted.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From the teſtimony of the Secretary of the Treaſury (page 287-8-9.) 2dly, From the Comptroller's own letter to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the Loan-officer (page 271-2) eighteen months before the redemption law. Nothing is clearer than that the writer of this letter was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the New-Loans were aſſumable, although he was convinced they would not be offered ſubject to the diſadvantages of the funding law.</p>
                     <p>It was againſt the intereſt of the New-Loan holders to ſubſcribe them, it was for their intereſt to exchange them for Continental certificates, and then to ſubſcribe thoſe. In the next place, the ſame opinion is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his letter (page 220-1-2) to the Governor. I aſk whether it is poſſible for any thing to expreſs more clearly and unequivocally his opinion of their being a debt due from the ſtate, and of their ſubſcribability; it ſeems from the former part of this letter that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury had taken higher ground, and demanded a ſurrender of Continental certificates equal to the amount of New-Loans outſtanding; or ſuſpend the payment of intereſt, this it is evident had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually relinquiſhed by the Secretary.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the current of teſtimony ſets in, ſtrongly, on the ſide of innocence. (His next letter to the Secretary of the Treaſury, page 277, then read.)</p>
                     <p>It will be remembered that in the letter of the 24th December 1791, five days before this, the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:027132_0414_0FD3527259134408"/>
tells the Governor, that none of the New-Loans were actually ſubſcribed; though they were ſubſcribable, and therefore there was no need of a ſurrender. This was the object of the negociation, and therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the Secretary of the Treaſury of the ſame thing; that if a doubt ſhould ariſe, whether part of the <hi>aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or ſubſcribed debt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> does not conſiſt of New-Loans, it can be eaſily proved it does not. No body can doubt this to be the meaning, when they recollect that in his former letter to the Governor, and that to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> he not only recognized them to be ſubſcribable, but ſaid they were not, or would not be ſubſcribed; it being againſt the intereſt of the holders.</p>
                     <p>Still leſs ſhall we doubt it, when we turn to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (page 278) wherein we trace the ſame ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>(The letter page 223-4 was then read.)</p>
                     <p>Thus, we ſee the conſiſtency and uniformity of the officer now on defence, in perſevering in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for the ſpace of eighteen months before he became intereſted. Sir, I think this gives a mortal blow to the proſecution, and the charge of fraud vaniſhes like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, which leaves not a wreck behind. But this is not all, for if we deſcend to the particular periods when the tranſactions took place, we ſhall diſcover there, alſo, a train of co-temporary facts, equally invulnerable and concluſive.</p>
                     <p>The next reaſon which I ſhall offer, ariſes from the caution which he gave the members of the Legiſlature when the redemption law was under conſideration.</p>
                     <p>When the extent of that law was in contemplation, when gentlemen undertake to paint the diſtreſſed and ruinous conſequences to the ſtate, which would follow the admiſſion of the New-Loans to ſweep away the whole quota of the aſſumption of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> while at the ſame time it abſorbed the ſpecie from her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; let them have the charity to remember that this officer, whoſe ſpirit they are now grieving, raiſed his voice and hands againſt that dangerous proceeding at that time. This is not the language of diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="407" facs="unknown:027132_0415_0FD35274AA0A5440"/>But, again; the tranſactions were conducted in the uſual forms of office, and in his own name; and it is remarkable that the committee on whoſe report this impeachment was founded, gave their opinion in that report, that the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> has been guilty of a high miſdemeanor for two reaſons, one of which was that he paſſed and certified the New-Loans to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive in the uſual forms of office, thereby cauſing them to be redeemed. The jet of the reaſon is in the <hi>"uſual forms"</hi> of office, by which they were redeemed.</p>
                     <p>If then forms had been unuſual, the very ſingularity would have been <hi>prima facie,</hi> a preſumption and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of other than ordinary deſign or intention, this charge is indeed to make the uſual courſe of buſineſs the evidence of guilt.</p>
                     <p>A like charge and equally unimportant appears to me the matters contained in the third article of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>This article is mean in ſubſtance, and pitifully drawn: The firſt thing ſingular is, that they begin with the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality and go on to the facts. "In order to promote and procure his own emolument," &amp;c. till it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reduced to poſſeſſion, implying, that after the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument was reduced to actual poſſeſſion, there was a certainty or probability of detection; this idea is too futile, nobody in their ſenſes will believe this to be true; for what purpoſe could it anſwer to deceive for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, when certain detection was to follow it? Again in order to avoid "diſcovery till" &amp;c. "he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Regiſter-General," implying that after the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments were in his poſſeſſion, he did conſult the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter-General: Let me aſk, how came this peculiar phraſeology to be given to this article?</p>
                     <p>We have had the hiſtory of that from Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> who was the principal member of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives at the time, we have been informed that upon the examination of the Regiſter-General, although not examined upon oath, the firſt part of this article was founded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="408" facs="unknown:027132_0416_0FD352124B7EFA58"/>It was found, that, after moſt of the abſtracts had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and the Comptroller-General had actually received the amount of his; there was a conſultation among the officers, when the Regiſter fully concurred in opinion with the Comptroller-General, and although there were ſufficient diſtinguiſhing marks on the face of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts, to aſcertain that New-Loans were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; and although theſe diſtinguiſhing marks were in a part to which the whole buſineſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter was confined, namely the calculation of intereſt, and therefore, it was no fault of the Comptroller-Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that they were not ſooner known, and although the Regiſter declared that when they were known, he was fully of the ſame opinion, and accordingly officially paſſed ſome abſtracts afterwards, knowing them to be New-Loans; yet the committee, forſooth, inſtead of throwing aſide the article as unſupported, reſolved to amend the article, to ſuit the teſtimony whatever it might be, in order that the Comptroller-General might be ſet for a while on the ſtool of repentance; becauſe the Regiſter-General in calculating intereſt on a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate depreciated on the principal, was not ſagacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to find out that it was a New-Loan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the true ſtyle of the dramatiſt, the paſſion for incident is to abſorb every other faculty.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, let me proceed to the facts, facts! Did I ſay? I was wrong, ſir, there is not a ſingle fact charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this article, they are only omiſſions. That "he did not conſult the Regiſter-General, nor communicate the matter to the Governor" before he got his money, and that he did not diſcriminate between the New-Loans and others. It is pretended, that this was an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent duty on him, the contrary is clear, for neither did his duty require it, nor the uſage or practice of the officers make it neceſſary. It is not ſhewn to be his duty but it has been obſerved that in ſo important a caſe, he ought to uſe ſome works of ſupererrogation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="409" facs="unknown:027132_0417_0FD351D580F898A0"/>Is it ſingular that a man ſhould be charged criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the omiſſion of that which avowedly was not required of him by law?</p>
                     <p>As to his certifications to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Loan-officer, I conceive them to be out of the queſtion, for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 1. He was not acting then as an officer at all, but having received a letter from Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> requeſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he gives it as a friend to the beſt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 2. As he was not then performing a duty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him in his official capacity, ſo neither was Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who received the information, bound to give any credit to it, unleſs he chooſe to do ſo. 3. As that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was for the United States, and not this ſtate, if that information was attended with loſs or injury, the government of the Union alone have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
                     <p>The certifications and proceedings with regard to our own ſtate were in the uſual forms of office; no certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were more particularly ſet forth or deſcribed than others. The New-Loans themſelves were ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically aſcertainable from the variety of dates in the commencement of intereſt, which no officer with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial attention could overlook.—Beſides this, one certificate in the ſubſcription of the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was depreciated on the principal, it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to miſtake that for any other than a New-Loan; therefore the certification of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable</hi> being done at the requeſt of individuals, and in no inſtance of the Comptroller's own ſubſcription, it was a labour without the ſmalleſt intereſt or profit: If then this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,</hi> had no ſort of influence in the right or queſtion of ſubſcribing them, in what ſhape can it be criminal? The ſubſcription was in his own name alſo. Sir, however this may be lightly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, yet to aſcertain the motive it is of the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: As theſe certificates were payable to bearer it was in his power to have them ſubſcribed in the name of ſome unknown perſon, and his intereſt in them could not have been diſcovered; the whole tranſaction becomes
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:027132_0418_0FD352788553F7C8"/>
an eaſy riddle inſtead of a well concerted plot, this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance aroſe from conſcious rectitude of mind, with that fearleſs independence, which is the nobleſt aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of honeſty and its ſureſt indication.</p>
                     <p>Another reaſon: Sir, it is notorious, when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was brought forward he ſolicited an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate trial: it is not the part of conſcious wickedneſs to court enquiry, but to dread and procraſtinate it even when it is unavoidable, yes time and delay are the only harbours of guilt! theſe things may be fetters to the guilty; but they are wings to the innocent, when he was impeached, he flew to met the proſecution. I will not enquire for what purpoſe that accuſation ſlept in impotent abſtraction in the boſom of a numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, till the very cloſe of the ſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Although many months have elapſed ſince this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was preferred, although the committe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, have uſed every effort during the receſs, after trying by every means to diſcover official frauds, yet they have been unable to faſten on a ſingle inſtance of the ſort, among the numerous documents and the voluminous records of that department; but they have laid their hands on a ſolitary fellow-citizen, the dark and doubtful corners of whoſe memory they have ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked again and again, with the pleaſing hope of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the thong that would bind in diſgrace an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious tranſgreſſor.</p>
                     <p>I will not pretend to ſay, that the motive for poſtpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inveſtigation was to ſuſpend him during the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as a culprit with his lips ſealed for the hand of ſcorn to point his ſlow and moving finger at. I will not ſay that it was to rake up the aſhes of long-forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tranſactions, in hopes, that while the memory had loſt the co-temporary circumſtances neceſſary to explain them, they might by the breath of ſuſpicion and party be invigorated and matured into a crime: But I will ſay, that whatever be the motives for poſtponing it, the impulſe in the accuſed in ſoliciting an immediate trial, could be no other than the impulſe of innocence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="411" facs="unknown:027132_0419_0FD3527A8FFE3530"/>Sir, need I mention that ſuch a thing would be againſt his real and ſubſtantial intereſt; on this ground the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have placed the corner-ſtone of this proſecution. Common ſenſe decides that the eventual emolument of this officer can have no operation as a proof of guilt.</p>
                     <p>It is underſtood in the firſt place, that he directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travened his own intereſt in cautioning the members of the Legiſlature when the Act was under conſideration. For laying it down as a principle that every man is moſt ſtrongly inclined to make gain. He was either poſſeſſed of theſe certificates at the time the redemption law paſſed, and was of opinion that the law would warrant the conſtruction it received, or he had them not at the time, and thought the law would not bear that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; now, if he was not poſſeſſed of them at the time, there was nothing to induce him to purchaſe them, as he had nothing to loſe, and having given his opinion againſt them, he would have no motive in becoming poſſeſſed of them, but a firm belief that the Act would warrant their redemption. If he was poſſeſſed of them, or if he was not poſſeſſed of them, but only intended to become ſo, he certainly would not have interpoſed his opinion at the time, as it might be expected that it would have produced an amendment to the ſixth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Act, by the introduction of ſome negative words. In the next place, it is not a difficult taſk to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the appearance of truth in this ſort of argument from the real fallacy which gives it a direction againſt the officer now on trial; as it is to be underſtood that his eventual emolument is contended for, as the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proof of guilt; and this is certainly nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>fallacy</hi> of theſe tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>I take it that in the event, intereſt or ſpeculation might reſult from either caſe.</p>
                     <p>If he corruptly put a deciſion upon the law, contrary to his real opinion, ſpeculation and intereſt was his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But I preſume this emolument as we find it, would have followed the conſtruction itſelf, whether
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:027132_0420_0FD35201B06C58D8"/>
that conſtruction originated in an honeſt or diſhoneſt motive. In the one caſe, if he acted from a diſhoneſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſpeculation was his object, and he acted corruptly. In the other if he acted from an honeſt motive, ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was the effect. In the one caſe he would ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late becauſe he had ſo decided the law, in the other he would ſo decide the law, becauſe he had predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeculate; ſo that the argument of emolument is thus far as broad as it is long; but I apprehend on a cloſer inſpection it will be found againſt the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and in favor of innocence.</p>
                     <p>One fact is certain, that a profit has reſulted to the officer, it's mother was either honeſty or corruption, let it's parentage be decided by natural and fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities; arguing from the effect to the cauſe. It is a fair rule of juſtice and common ſenſe, that effects in the natural world ſhall be attributed to the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the moſt natural cauſes, and in moral caſes to the moſt innocent cauſes. This emolument might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from honeſt or diſhoneſt cauſes: In the one caſe, ſpeculation and emolument is the natural and legitimate effect of a conſtruction fairly and honeſtly put upon the Act. In the other, it is the corrupt pretext for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction inconſiſtent with the opinion of the party uſing it, and proſecuted at once againſt honor and honeſty. So far are they from proving any thing, that their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of guilt muſt be deſerted, unleſs ſome other ſtrong leading circumſtances can be brought forward to its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Are there any others? No. So far from being able to bring forward any proof to convict the defendant, that all their arguments ſeem to militate againſt themſelves, and every circumſtance adduced by them, ſeems to favor the cauſe of innocence.</p>
                     <p>But theſe obſervations might be ſpared, for how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakbly abſurd is the argument of intereſt when placed in contact with ſome part of the teſtimony. It has been proved by teſtimony in profuſion, that this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer entertained the ſame opinion as to the aſſumability ot theſe certificates, pending the firſt loan of Congreſs,
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:027132_0421_0FD351D6F89B8808"/>
and long before our redemption law paſſed, as he does now.</p>
                     <p>Sir, can we believe that it was the hope of intereſt which ſupported this officer through thoſe ſcenes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, before the Act, which in fact created it, was in exiſtence? Behold then the gordian knot untied, for the argument of intereſt to have force muſt take it for granted, that this officer, while he expreſſed his opinion unequivocally eighteen months before the Act of April 1792, foreſaw nevertheleſs, that ſuch a law would paſs and afford him an occaſion of profit; nay, further it muſt be taken for granted that his coincidence of opinion with the Secretary of the Treaſury, and other officers of the ſtate and general, government ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time, was a game of hypocriſy, which his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning induced him to play to conceal the mercenary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which futurity was to gratify.</p>
                     <p>Behold then this rope of ſand, will this then, bind a victim to the altar? Can we believe that it was the hope of intereſt which ſupported this officer through thoſe ſcenes of deception before the Act had an exiſtence? For if intereſt was at that moment the embryo motive of his heart; if he could at that diſtance of time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the growing harveſt; while he prepared his ſickle to partake of it, inſtead of being arraigned as a culprit he ſhould be deified as a prophet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN a public point of view it is much to be regretted that charges of ſuch ſerious magnitude and importance, ſhould be thus built upon the ſlendereſt foundation.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved by ſome parliamentary ſpeakers, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (by <hi>Cheſterfield,)</hi> that accuſations by impeachment are not ſo likely to be well founded as preſentments by grand juries, for while in the one caſe political objects and party ſpirit are moſt apt to govern the accuſers, in the other they are generally governed by the diſpaſſionate and impartial dictates of judgement operating on the weight of evidence. The hiſtory of impeachments in

                        <hi>England</hi> verifies this idea, and confirms its truth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Sir, in a more popular government this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and its conſequences are the more dangerous.</p>
                     <p>It augurs not well of the public weal in a free coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where all officers depend directly or remotely on the voice of the people, to find them ſwept away from the port of confidence by the plea of groundleſs accuſation.</p>
                     <p>An impeachment is an engine of State as ſacred in its nature, as it is delicate in its conſtruction, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but imminent danger will warrant the uſe of it, the danger of falling a ſacrifice to popular indignation, which ſometimes even merit has provoked, or to party reſentment, of all the reſentments the moſt implacable, will enhance the difficulty of procuring good officers, while it depreciates the incentives to virtuous actions in thoſe who are ſuch; while events are our preceptors, and have taught us, that we ſhould give to government only the ſame enlightened ſelf intereſt, which is granted to a good man in the ordinary concerns of human life.</p>
                     <p>Let then the ſword of the people be ſuſpended over the heads of their ſervants, but let not its deſcent be ſo accidental or precarious that like the ſword of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> over the head of <hi>Damocles,</hi> it ſhould be as much the tormentor of the faithful, as the ſcourge of the unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the officer now on defence, diſcards all fear, he provokes no compaſſion, he ſolicits no favor, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands but juſtice. Here are facts on which he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges your conſciences, and defies your perſuaſion. Winnow the chaff from the ſubſtance and the breath of heaven will diſſipate it, ſo that it cannot be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To conſtrue a law is an act of the underſtanding, how wide is the difference between intelligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
                     <p>Let then the records of this tribunal, which his accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had deſtined to emblazon his diſgrace, harmonize with the decrees of time, the great arbiter of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay, the decrees of that arbiter who is greater than time, and greater than heaven itſelf.</p>

                        <opener>
                           <salute>
                              <hi>Mr. Speaker, and
Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                           </salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>THIS ſubject is very complicated in its nature, and my attention hath been much attracted to other objects, and interrupted in the ſtudy of this caſe: So ſingular were my circumſtances that at the firſt appearance I might reaſonably claim an apology. A ſtranger invited to appear before this reſpectable body, nay, invited by the honorable Houſe of Repreſentatives of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to lend his aid to defend their cauſe, and aſſert their rights; my obligation was multiplied, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the importance of the honorable Houſe who made the application; conſcious as I have been, that I ſhall not be able to add to the reaſoning of the enlightened gentlemen (Meſſrs. <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Rawle)</hi> who preceded me on the ſame ſide; perhaps prudence would have induced me to decline; but when called upon by ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable a Legiſlature, nay, a ſtranger ſolicited to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the cauſe of the public, and to redreſs their wrongs againſt one of their own citizens, loaded with the wealth and ſpoils of the commonwealth!</p>
                        <p>This conſideration commanded my exertions and magnanimity; the invitation was too flattering, I could not refuſe my aid; I will not waſte your time in making prefatory obſervations, but will endeavor to make the cauſe now before the honorable Senate very intelligible, and therefore will divide the ſubject into four points.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Has the defendant cauſed New-Loans to be ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which were not ſubſcribable by law?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Has he cauſed New-Loans to be redeemed, when by law they were not redeemable, and thereby had broken and violated the Conſtitution of this commonwealth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Has he not appropriated to his own uſe New-Loan certificates which had been ſurrendered to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the holders, and ſhould have been cancelled?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="416" facs="unknown:027132_0424_0FD3525078DB8AC0"/>4. <hi>Has he not done all this knowingly and corruptly to make unjuſt gain, betraying the intereſt repoſed in him, and traded on the public confidence?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe diviſions were neceſſary before I begin to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the objections which have been raiſed againſt the forms of theſe articles of impeachment; but no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage can be taken of them, as to their form; they are not deficient either in ſubſtance or form—as to forms, two things are only neceſſary, 1ſt. They ſhould be clear to be underſtood. 2d. They ſhould be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent plea in diſcharge of another proſecution for the ſame offence.</p>
                        <p>To make objections to mere forms, the reliques of antient times, I ſay, times of darkneſs and ignorance, is like the obſervation reſpecting the nets and the traps in which he had been caught: The articles are ſufficiently definite, and anſwer all the purpoſes of juſtice in trials by impeachment. Mere forms are never attended to in ſuch caſes.</p>
                        <p>Impeachments ſhould be ſo worded, as to anſwer two purpoſes, 1ſt. They ſhould be definite. 2d. They ought to be ſubſtantial as to form: The articles under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration are ſufficiently <hi>definite</hi> and ſubſtantial, to anſwer theſe two purpoſes.</p>
                        <p>We have been told that the Houſe of Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives adopted this as a mode of <hi>perſecuting,</hi> rather than <hi>proſecuting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That honorable body does not wiſh to perſecute, the buſineſs of the Legiſlature is primarily the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the innocent; the protection of the innocent is of greater importance than the puniſhment of the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet it is of ſome importance to the community when a public defaulter is puniſhed.</p>
                        <p>A man who is clearly charged with ſuch crimes, it is not unimportant to the public to know how he can acquit himſelf, and how he hath diſcharged his truſt; although it is irritating to any Legiſlature to proſecute ſuch an offender as the preſent defendant.</p>
                        <p>If zeal in the counſel who have appeared for the
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:027132_0425_0FD3525EBA97C568"/>
Comptroller-General, had been an evidence of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the defendant ought to be acquitted; never had any defendant more brilliant diſplay of rhetoric, or apparition of reaſon, to prevent his being found guilty, than the Comptroller has had on this preſent trial.</p>
                        <p>In my arguments I will conſider two things, to wit, the law and the teſtimony; in the way that I have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſubject, the different conſtructions of the Acts of Aſſembly as they ſeem to favour or make againſt the the defendant ſhall be attended to. The conſtruction of the Act of 1786 relative the the iſſuing of New-Loans is perhaps doubtful, and unimportant; if the defendant's conſtruction is the true one, what will be the iſſue? But it will be very material if our conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the right one, as guilt is charged home and fixt on him; if his conſtruction is right, it by no means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits him; and it will not ultimately determine the caſe.</p>
                        <p>Previouſly to my entering further into this buſineſs, I will conſider the cauſes and motives which produced the Acts. I will not read them, they have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy repeated, no perſon can be better acquainted with them than the Speaker; it will not be controverted that the Act of 1785 was enacted as a temporary proviſion for the payment of intereſts, the Act of 1786 was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the failure of the Act of 1785 for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and had the ſame general object in view, and brought the Act of 1785 into execution.</p>
                        <p>I can ſee no reaſon why the Legiſlature in 1786 ſhould make that perpetual, which in 1785 was temporary. There is neither reaſon nor equity for it; if equity did not require it, there was no reaſon to grant it. This is proſtrating the principles of juſtice; the Legiſlature would not unneceſſarily encreaſe its own burthen.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman's reaſoning, who opened the defence is ſomewhat ſingular; he ſays it became "an equitable claim," ſo far I agree with the Gentleman. But, Sir, will the gentleman go on, and ſay, that the contract was not as great to the inhabitants of all the other States who have been creditors of the Union, more equity
<pb n="418" facs="unknown:027132_0426_0FD3527FFA1D8488"/>
was not due to the creditors citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> than to the creditor citizens of other States; if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are admitted, the conſequences can't be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Equity is not partial and would embrace the whole, this is clear reaſoning, he cannot deny it.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March 1786 did not, at all events, pledge the public faith for the redemption of thoſe certificates in money; if then it is viewed in this light, why did the State receive the Continental certificates and give their own certificates in lieu of them? The object of the Legiſlature was to make a ſubſtitute. If <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> did not take the certificates, and was to pay, ſhe might do it at her loſs, as ſhe could have no claim on Congreſs. This is confirmed from general opinion, and their ſubſequent views.</p>
                        <p>If the Treaſurer had paid off the Continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates they could not iſſue the New-Loans; and for this purpoſe <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> choſe to take in the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates and iſſue new ones, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth might at her option be the creditor of the Union, or debtor to her own citizens, by returning them to the original holders; in the mean time to ſettle and pay the intereſt was the intention of the Legiſlature: It is manifeſt, and confirmed by the opinion of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen converſant in the tranſactions of the Aſſembly, and by the public Acts.</p>
                        <p>One circumſtance of great importance is to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; that is, the margin of the New-Loans and the reference to the Continental certificates; this provides how the debts were to be ſecured, and the memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums made in the ſame.—<hi>(Here he read a New-Loan certificate.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This margin was of no conſequence unleſs they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return the New-Loans. We here look for the intention of the Legiſlature, and not for the negligence of the executive officer. Was it of conſequence to pay in caſh at all events, full intereſt on depreciated principal? this was not ſufficient for it might have been ſettled at the iſſuing, why not at the time reduce the
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:027132_0427_0FD35281440D6638"/>
certificate and give the whole amount when reduced by the ſcale. If a purchaſe, it was worth juſt as much as the value of the certificate's nominal amount of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt.</p>
                        <p>Another reaſon and a better one than the conſtruction of the law, is the intention of the Legiſlature,</p>
                        <p>The preamble of the Act of March 27 1789, calls it a temporary proviſion, look into the preamble of that Act, is a Legiſlative conſtruction important, relying on the margin and memorandum in it, does all this weigh nothing?</p>
                        <p>Was it maneuvre in the Legiſlature? it is too diſreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful, too indelicate to ſuppoſe, out of the whole I find that the Act of 86 took the certificates into the cuſtody of the ſtate and that they were only to pay the intereſt; if otherwiſe they would have found a fund to provide for the payment of the principal, they knew at that time the funds were precariouſly in their hands, if ſo, it would perhaps be wrong to contend that nothing more was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended than a re-exchange by the Act of 1786. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law of 1789 <hi>repealed nothing;</hi> but carried the Act of 1786 into effect.</p>
                        <p>The conſtruction of the law of 1786 is much more certain and important. If we chuſe to take back our certificate at any time, we ſhall have a right ſo to do, to do away theſe they enacted the repealing law of 1789. The queſtion now is not whether the law is right or wrong, but what was the <hi>intention</hi> of the Legiſlature. If the law was right, it does away moſt of the difficulty, the Act of 89 is an Act of much importance, of clear and certain conſtruction, let us enquire what was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legiſlature, not whether it was conſtitutional or not, the law is right or wrong only as the Legiſlature intended. After we ſhall diſcover the intention we'll enquire if open under the Conſtitution, and whether obligatory as a law is another queſtion.</p>
                        <p>The conſtruction of the defendant is ſo contradictory, ſo diſtorted, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language can hardly find a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive idea to correſpond with it, he hardly knows
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:027132_0428_0FD351DC8B741548"/>
what anſwer to make, every thing he advances is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to what is mentioned in the Act, ſo obſtinate is every part of it in favour of the proſecution; and he is obliged to run counter to every expreſſion in the law; if the Act of 1789 deſigned only to <hi>unfund the debt,</hi> it is equally unjuſt with deſtroying it, it is different not in principle but in degree. If it is ſo, for what reaſon: It is alledged they could not deſtroy the claim, is it not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a breach of contract to unfund as to deſtroy it, truly equal; why unfund the <hi>principal</hi> that was never funded if the reaſoning of the Gentlemen be right, they ſhould have followed wherever it led them; was it not equally ſo to ſubtract the fund? What did the law of 89 do? They ſay it had no effect, it neither deſtroyed nor anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated the operations of the former Acts, yet the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant muſt admit that the ſtate committed a fraud in unfunding the debt, the proviſion was repealed, yet they ſay it was altogether compatible with the law of 1786.</p>
                        <p>If the alienation of the funds to the General Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been the reaſon, was not that ſurrender to be perpetual? Did they expect a return of the funds? If they were to pay the intereſt, why not the principal? Where were the funds? Where was the debt? It either proves too much, or it proves nothing at all; it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces both principal and intereſt, or only principal, and excludes the intereſt. If this is not broad enough for them, conſider only for a moment the intention of the Legiſlature in paſſing the Act.</p>
                        <p>The declaration in the Act of 1789, proves they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in 1786 to make a temporary proviſion.</p>
                        <p>Could the Legiſlature labour a preamble declaring their intention, if they did not mean to carry that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention into effect?</p>
                        <p>The Legiſlature expreſly ſays, the payment of the ſaid debts ought to be from the Treaſury of the United States, and not from <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> A conſtruction in the Act of 1786, to aboliſh the ſame Act, if there is no reaſon for doing away the Act of 1786, why labour
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:027132_0429_0FD351DF9B8E6D98"/>
three or four pages; to do what they did not intend to do.</p>
                        <p>Yet if the preamble is read, no man will doubt that they did intend to repeal the law, and poſſeſſed the right to do ſo; look further into it, you'll find the the words <hi>"certificates" "reaſonable,"</hi> &amp;c. there.</p>
                        <p>In fine, that the debts, not intereſt, is to be paid by Congreſs; there is another conſtruction of the Act of 1789, almoſt too ingenuous to be admitted and not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtood, operating not on what is done under the Act.</p>
                        <p>In the caſe of the North-Carolina certificates there was no Act to repeal, as the certificates had iſſued frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently.</p>
                        <p>It is a contradiction in reaſoning and almoſt in terms, do they provide that the principal ſhall be paid by the State of <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi> Perhaps the Gentlemen would have found no Act to deſtroy, when they were not iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Act. This long Act of 1789 was not made for nothing, the Act of 1786 was completed in 1788. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legiſlature in repealing the Act, meant to knock away the foundation on which they ſtood.</p>
                        <p>Here the conſtruction is too artificial to be credible, the defence is at war with itſelf. Firſt, that it did ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on the certificates, 2dly, It did not operate. This is an invariable rule of all laws, that all parts ſhould be conſtrued ſo as to ſtand and no part periſh.</p>
                        <p>The defendant's conſtruction is too fine ſpun to be ſtrong, it breaks aſunder, by another it is held differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtill, it is ſo various that there ariſe three contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory modes, but truth is ſimple and uniform, there are various accounts, all ſimple and conſiſtent, if theſe are true, they are all the creatures of fancy; they could not repeal the firſt and ſecond ſections of that Act, and therefore could not provide for the payment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe are inviſible entities of reaſoning, we need a microſcope to aid our intellectual optics to ſee them. The Aſſembly could not intend what they could not underſtand, where is the law which directs payment? It proves the reverſe
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:027132_0430_0FD35282E2458770"/>
of what was intended, this is the reaſoning the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is driven to, if the law proves it, they will avail themſelves of it, for my part I can't think it was the intention of the Legiſlature, the majority never ſpun thus finely this creature of metaphyſics by the Act of 1789.</p>
                        <p>Can a man have an intention to do what he does not underſtand? the exchange being optional does not ſerve the defendant, it conforms to our ſtatement. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to re-exchange is no objection to our conſtruction, <hi>"Many</hi> may be deſirous," it is therefore true, that it is optional with the holders, it is therefore conſiſtent with my explanation, and perfectly conſiſtent in itſelf. Take the whole amount together, it is equity, it is juſtice. We make our option, which is no more than this; come and take your original certificates, we were never bound to pay you in caſh, you may come and take them if you pleaſe; it was not neceſſary to make a law to compel them to take their certificates: It was only this, that if they did not come the obligation on the part of the commonwealth was done away, we are not obliged to pay caſh, we will not pay caſh, we will perform our contract, you may have your certificates, they were never demandable in caſh, they were never a claim for caſh, they were a claim for the original certificates for which they were exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are no claim againſt the government.</p>
                        <p>That ſubſequent laws called them a claim it is true. They were a claim for certificates, the defendant's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to ſhew a law to juſtify him; but this reaſoning proves there is none, the firſt ſection did not provide or payment, and the ſubſequent ones were repealed. That theſe New-Loans were contemplated as claims or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts is undoubtedly true, if we would deny this, we ſhould commit an outrage againſt common ſenſe; this is corroborated by the maxim, that we are not to create a being to be deſtroyed, they knew ſuch poſitions were not ſupportable: Much reaſoning and paper might have been ſpared: If our conſtruction is the right one, they were a claim for the original certificates; one of the
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:027132_0431_0FD35285B06A0B00"/>
Gentlemen ſays, that the providing to pay in certificates is a confeſſion that they were a claim for caſh; they were a claim, that claim was merely for re-exchange; but not for caſh.</p>
                        <p>The proviſion for exchange is no acknowledgment of debt. Another reaſon muſt meet us very forcibly, that the law of 1789 is void, as being againſt the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, and impairing the validity of contracts; it is not ſo, if our conſtruction of the law of 1786 is right.</p>
                        <p>But let us ſuppoſe for a moment (being willing to put it in every poſſible point of view) that we are wrong, that it was an engagement at all events to pay caſh, this is taking the higheſt poſſible ground contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean what is contended for on the other ſide, for it appears a little ſingular, that the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the United States ſhould herein impair the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of contracts. If the Act of 1786 had made an abſolute debt, it's repeal would not be contrary to the conſtitution, the ſection only means that a ſtate ſhould not eſtabliſh iniquity by law.</p>
                        <p>It was a mere act of favour by the State, or elſe it might be underſtood that the ſtate made laws, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into effect the breach of contracts. Take your New-Loans for the Continental certificates. If it means more than this, it muſt be that the very letter and terms of the contract ſhould be carried into effect; if ſo, a State could not eſtabliſh a chancery juriſdiction, which ſays, penalties ſhall not always be exacted.</p>
                        <p>Nor ſtatutes of limitations, a thouſand pounds pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on demand, is as juſtly due after four years as before; the four years expire, and the contract is not performed; yet it is a bar pleadable and no injuſtice.</p>
                        <p>Let us advert to the ſtatutes againſt uſury, giving damages inſtead of compelling a ſpecific performance, and a contract to pay 12 per cent. if it were not for the law would be a contract; the law ſays it ſhall be no contract. Is this impairing the obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract?
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:027132_0432_0FD351E0BB5B34A8"/>
this compels a perſon to receive what he did not contract for; are theſe againſt the conſtitution of the United States? where juſtice is done the contract is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                        <p>If the conſtruction of the law muſt be literal, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damages for ſpecific articles, ſuch as to deliver lands inſtead of caſh, muſt alſo be a breach of contract: the ſpecific article ſhould be given, the Act of 1789 now under conſideration, ſays take your certificates inſtead of caſh; theſe obſervations are all unneceſſary, becauſe they go on the foundation that all New-Loans are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in caſh.</p>
                        <p>But to give the Gentlemen every thing they want, admit for a moment that we're wrong, this contract is unfair, ſuppoſe it is impaired, another queſtion ariſes, who is to ſay it is impairing the contract, where is the proper judicature? Who is to be the arbiter between the State and her own citizens? This is a ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; <hi>Monteſque, Locke</hi> and other writers will oppoſe them here, the power of making laws is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the State, is there a power ſuperior to the ſupreme power? If the judges have this power, it follows that the ſupreme power is controlled by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior power. If courts cannot, the Senate cannot, both as a court and a part only of the Legiſlature.</p>
                        <p>This is a very important queſtion, there ſhould be ſome important judiciary, it is a complex queſtion, the conſtitution is ſilent on the ſubject. We muſt arrive at ſome period, let us proceed to the end of the chain, another Legiſlature to judge the former, another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the latter, and ſo on to infinity.</p>
                        <p>Can the Senate rejudge it, being only one branch? the Legiſlature of the State has the ſupreme power, can any individual enjoy it? ſhall we leave it to a jury to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine? they judge of facts, this is uncertainty, and contradiction, ſhall every petty officer arraign his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? ſhall any man vainly imagine that he is wiſer than his repreſentatives? language of this kind hath been held,
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:027132_0433_0FD352873A06C450"/>
nay, hath been pratiſed. This is riſing againſt the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of ſociety.</p>
                        <p>If he decided wrong, he decided at his peril; here it is contended is the check, the judiciary are to judge; but this brings us back again, the judiciary in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would ſit above the Legiſlature, the people only are ſuperior to the Legiſlature, the Legiſlature is amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their repreſentative capacity to the people, but ſhall a jury judge? Do juries repreſent the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? They are not the Repreſentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their office is to judge of facts and evidence, not to judge of the conſtitutionality of laws. If they are to be the ultimate criterion, it is void to day, becauſe a jury ſaid ſo, it will be in force to-morrow, if a jury ſhall ſay ſo.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſufficient check on the Repreſentatives, it is this, they are amenable to their conſtituents, their ſeſſions being only temporary, their doings may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed until then it is a law; they may repeal a law orderly by ſubſequent repreſentations—No power on earth can exiſt ſuperior to the Legiſlature of the State, except what exiſts in the People, it does not exiſt in the Judiciary, not in the Senate, nor in Juries. They will, if they diſapprove, chooſe others who will repeal obnoxious laws. If they miſ-judge, they are corrupt; they will again chooſe others; the power is leſs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous here, if they refuſe, the People may recur to their original ſtate, diſſolve the ſocial compact, untie the knot, and redreſs every miſtake. Here is an evil but a leſs one; this free agency in man, this torpid debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this <hi>"vis inertiae;"</hi> the former is the fever, the latter the death of patriotiſm.</p>
                        <p>I have been the more particular in this inſtance, as there are two important points to be conſidered, that if theſe certificates were not ſubſcribable, they were not redeemable, although the reverſe of the poſition is not true; if the ſervant is to judge of what his maſter does, then the defendant is to adjudicate between the State and the holders, there is no ſituation ſo unfit at his to
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:027132_0434_0FD351E2439F8550"/>
decide; the Comptroller aſſumes a right to adjudicate, he buys up all the New-Loans, places himſelf in the ſhoes of one of the parties, and then determines he is to be paid; this is the ground on which this judge ſtood on this queſtion between the State and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>But ſtill diſpoſed to ſuppoſe every thing credible; let them ſuppoſe us ſtill wrong; there are yet ample grounds for the conviction of the defendant, if they ſtill exiſted in the form of debts, they were not ſubſcribable debts and payable in caſh, it was ſaid that theſe were, by virtue of the Act of Congreſs, ſubſcribable; ſituated as theſe certificates were, it was out of the power of Congreſs to take them, and to charge <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> with their amount in adjuſting the ſettlement between the United and Individual States: The proviſion was only for ſuch as the State acknowledged to be debts payable in caſh.</p>
                        <p>They were only acknowledgments of debt. The Secretary of the Treaſury ſo underſtood them, we will go on broader ground than this, and ſay, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pay ſuch, it would be completely out of their power. The State held the Continental certificates; Congreſs could not ſay, we will not pay the State, but pay the holders of New-Loans. The Act of 1789 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the diſſent of the State.</p>
                        <p>It is true <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> owes <hi>A.</hi> becauſe he holds New-Loan certificates, and the Union owes <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> becauſe ſhe holds original certificates. It will not be contended that Congreſs deſigned to pay both; then could Congreſs pay the holders of New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates without the conſent of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and pay the State too?</p>
                        <p>The ſubſcribing New-Loans implies they were not to be exchanged, and makes the State a creditor by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of having the Continental, without the conſent of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> Congreſs could not aſſume the New-Loans and refuſe the payment of the Continental.</p>
                        <p>Congreſs muſt previouſly authoriſe a power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the New-Loans to be a debt, before they could
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:027132_0435_0FD351E458DB1538"/>
aſſume them. This would amount, to decide a caſe between a State and her own citizens.</p>
                        <p>The Supreme Court refuſed to decide it. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury never would decide this, if it was to be decided by its nature, none are competent but the people, who might recur to original principles.</p>
                        <p>Congreſs could therefore make no ſuch proviſion, if this is true, the New-Loan certificates were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable to the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I have been willing to deſcend, ſtep by ſtep, from that ground on which the proſecution reſted, to prove the charge againſt the Comp. Gen. is well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his defence not maintainable. I will deſcend one ſtep lower, and admit that the New-Loans are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable, yet the defendant is guilty in the true ſenſe of the articles of impeachment, and upon every principle of juſtice, although no gentleman will agree that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, the Secretary of the Treaſury, or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had a right to decide on their aſſumability.</p>
                        <p>It was the intereſt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> that the Act of 1789 ſhould be complied with. They viewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to pay 20<hi>ſ.</hi> in the pound. This buſineſs was committed to the Comptroller-General, and he had the care of making the bargain. Is it juſt in him to take meaſures to defeat this truſt? It was his buſineſs to promote it; he oppoſed it.</p>
                        <p>Has he not taken every dollar from the Treaſury, which he has put into his pocket, and this after the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain was completed? She committed the management of this tranſaction to her agent, the holders of New-Loans were to apply to him for re-exchanges, he was the agent, nay, call it more, the commonwealth made the offer, and appointed Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the re-exchange. Is this faithfulneſs in an agent? Did he fulfil his truſt? Does not this look like perfidy? Did he take pains to procure exchanges? When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons offered to exchange and ſurrender, did he not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that exchange? Did he not after they were lodged in his hand as agent, and Comptroller-General, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:027132_0436_0FD3528C9C7074E0"/>
and put them as Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> into his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket? And if they had been ſo exchanged, could they have been redeemed? After the parties had agreed to take the offer of the State from this officer entruſted to make ſuch bargain, and by which the State would gain the difference in the exchange; he clearly had no equity to put this difference into his own pocket. After the parties had conſented to carry the exchange into effect, he refuſed to deliver the Continental certificates, he ſent a line offering to take and buy them himſelf; nay, he actually purchaſed them, after which he ſubſcribed them to the loan of the United States, and procured their redemption at the State-Treaſury; ſo that all conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is out of the queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I aſk, if guilt is not irreſiſtably proved on Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon?</hi> Perhaps much leſs than this would be crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Whenever a perſon was willing to ſell a certificate, every ſuch perſon willing to exchange his property, but was prevented by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> even in the ſtreets, by which exchange it would be the property of the State, but had been not only put into the pocket of the Comptroller, but taken out of the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is a little ſingular that the ground on which the defendant reſts his defence, is by doing equity in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to law, and being anxious to defeat the views of the Legiſlature, that equity ſhould be done to the holders of New-Loans, by procuring for them 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. per pound; inſtead of this equity, we find Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> choſe to make a bargain, and to take this equity from them, and the means of doing it in like manner is wreſted from them, leſt the State ſhould take it. This is cruſhing equity to death; this aggravates the charges, to deprive them of 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. in the pound, law or no law. If Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> knew it, it was unjuſt, he defrauded the State or the party; where he took this equity from the State, he defrauded the public, when from the holders he defrauded the holders. Where then is this equity?</p>

We are here to do juſtice, an offence is committed, he is guilty, if the evidence is ſufficient to ſupport the charges, the eſſence is not in writing a word, and adding <hi>I. N.</hi> at the bottom, a deceit had been practiſed, the crime was not in the certificate, but in the deceit, the State was defrauded, the deceit is proved if the evidence is ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it; his abſtract was in his own hand writing, he deceived the officer who called for the certificate, he deprived the commonwealth of the money which he pocketed at her expence. The ſubſtance of the charge is literally true, and the ſame is proved and ſupported.</p>
                        <p>It is charged that he certified a number of New-Loan certificates to be ſubſcribable, the ſame is literally true.</p>
                        <p>The charge is proved, becauſe he certified others, and that is equal to certifying his own.

                     <p>Mr. DEXTER,</p>
                     <p>Roſe and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>I endeavoured in the forenoon to prove my firſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>the Comptroller-General cauſed New-Loans to be ſubſcribed, which were not ſubſcribable by law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Act of March 1789 ſhews the Legiſlature did not mean to unfund the debt, as the principal never was provided for, therefore it was unneceſſary to repeal what never was enacted.</p>
                     <p>It is contended by the counſel for the defendant that the intereſt only on the New-Loans was attended to, and conſidered. If the intereſt was only to be paid, why introduce the word <hi>principal,</hi> which was never funded at all? We will now attend to our ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which is, <hi>That he cauſed New-Loans to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, when by law they were not redeemable, and thereby had broken and violated the Conſtitution of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That he cauſed New-Loans to be redeemed, that he certified them to be ſo, and that that certificate was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, officially, will not be controverted. That this fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal arrangement by his certifications, had the effect of
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:027132_0439_0FD3529358838728"/>
drawing the money out of the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> will not be denied.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion is, Whether there was, or was not a law:</p>
                     <p>The Act of the 10th April 1792, is much relied on, to juſtify him. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> read a part of that Act.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed that the ſecond ſection is not extenſive enough to cover New-Loans, and for the payment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and diſcharge of all the certificates of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                     <p>It is agreed that intereſt is not payable on New-Loans, as it is conceded that this expreſſion does not cover New-Loans, and as no intereſt was payable on them, it is contended that in a part of the 6th ſection they are included, aſſuming the New-Loans as ſubſcribable, New-Loans are not mentioned, and yet they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable, and if ſubſcribable, they muſt be redeemable, becauſe ſubſcribable certificates are to be paid; but all the ſtate and continental officers agree they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable, and conſequently not redeemable. (He then read the 6th ſection). "The holder of a certificate or certificates, <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> to the ſubſcription," &amp;c. If they are not ſubſcribable, it cannot be within the purview of this act, it is well underſtood from the complexion of the law, that whatever is not ſubſcribable cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, and whatever is not ſubſcribable nor redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, cannot be included in this ſection. Whatever might have once been the opinion of the Comptroller-General, it is evident it never was the opinion of the law officers of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> nor of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General of the United States. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> wanted to lay his hands on the letter of Mr. <hi>Randolph,</hi> page 81-2, but could not find it) and he added, We need not recur to the unanimous opinion of the officers, the laws are here, the Senate underſtand them, and will judge; that paper ought to have been here; if the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates are not redeemable, then all the reaſoning of the gentlemen will fall to the ground, becauſe they are not ſubſcribable to the loan opened by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Admit that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable, ſtill
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:027132_0440_0FD3529526879A08"/>
they are not redeemable. The gentleman who opened the defence, agreed that the fund had not been provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the redemption of New-Loans by the 6th ſection, but by the 2d. (Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> obſerved, The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did not attend to my ſtatement. The ſixth ſection is more extenſive than the ſecond. The fund by the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock, was not to cover New-Loans.)</p>
                     <p>Taking this to be true, the object of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is not obtained, and it is clear no New-Loans are redeemable; but recourſe muſt be had to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fund, nay, the fund for claims and improvements they ſay, covers it; the defendant's warrant and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, prove the contrary; theſe are raw troops preſſed into his ſervice; this is a ſtrange departure of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General's plan of defence; his counſel ſhift their ground. The Comptroller-General committed the fact, and retained counſel to find other laws for it, but thoſe laws are confeſſed to be of no uſe. It is ſaid New-Loan certificates were a debt by the Act of 1786. Could the Act of 1792 make them more than a debt? But the Comptroller being determined to get a fund to draw his money from, and finding he could not ſucceed in drawing his caſh by virtue of that law of 1792, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his opinion, and his counſel procured him another fund. (Here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> ſaid, If I am not right, they will put me right. Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> ſaid, <hi>You're wrong this long time, but go on.)</hi> The funds for claims and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements ſhould be made uſe of; this was done by the Act of 1791. This is too remote for diſcuſſion, fixed by its hiſtory raiſed per Act of 1789, and limited to £. 10,000 for claims and improvements. <hi>(Here Mr. Bradford interrupted Mr. Dexter, and ſaid, The Act of April 7th, 1791, created the fund, and did not limit it.)</hi> This fund without any particular appropriation only to provide for claims and improvements, and without any proviſion for minute occaſions or any occurrence which may happen during the receſs of the Legiſlature; why is this called up? it is a confeſſion of diſtruſt, it is peeping out of the window.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="433" facs="unknown:027132_0441_0FD3529684276A60"/>Let us take the uſeleſs Act of 1792 out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Act of 1786 and 1791 are ſufficient for the defendant.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loans are ſaid to be a claim, therefore it is ſaid to be within the act of 7th April 1791, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded depreciated debt equally within it? There are no debts but are claims, if they exiſted at the time of creating the fund, they are all included in the fund for claims and improvements. Theſe were for objects too various and minute for legiſlation: this tranſaction muſt be unconſtitutional; if thus general, why not a little zeal in the defendant? By the law of 1789 the defendant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired wealth, and gained money.</p>
                     <p>It is argued that the act of 1789, ſtopped intereſt on New-Loans, notwithſtanding, by this means the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General got intereſt. The gentlemen will not contend, that New-Loans are one of the objects.</p>
                     <p>When any money was drawn out of the Treaſury, the fund was particularly mentioned, that ſuch a warrant or claim was payable out of ſuch or ſuch a fund; therefore it eſpecially behoves the defendant to ſhew out of what fund, the money was to be drawn to ſatisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. This act goes to ſhew what ſhall be paid out of the claim found by the act of April 7th 1791. This ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral clauſe covers all warrants hereafter to be drawn by virtue of any law or laws, &amp;c. Was this a claim pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? It is clear there was no appropriation; conſequently the Conſtitution was broken. This ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe (6th ſection) cannot cover ſo important a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: By the law of 1786, the New-Loans are a debt in ſome ſhape or other; by the law of 1789, they were made no longer payable in caſh, it was agreed <hi>that the intereſt was not to be paid in caſh;</hi> the principal was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver funded. This is a blind general clauſe, altogether incapable of altering the conditions of the New-Loans.</p>
                     <p>That the principal and intereſt of the New-Loans ſhould be paid, but ſtill I miſunderſtand them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they are miſtaken, in ſaying that the Act of 1786 created a debt. The intereſt is not funded by the law of 1789.

If an appropriation to pay by the law of 1789, why in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce it by the Act of 1792? If the Act of April 1791 provides for it, and a fund competent for its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, why is the Act of 1792 ſought for to make it more than a debt? This is calling in a law, which gives it no additional ſtrength, their own conſciouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays their faithfulneſs to their client, they are convinced that their proof is not ſufficient to ſupport them; this is manifeſt, though not expreſſed by them, it would be prudent in them to cloſe the door of ſecrecy on this diſtruſt. Nothing can be done by the law of 1792 if they are right in their conſtruction of the Acts of 1786 or 1789.</p>
                     <p>It will not be contended that the Act of 1792 made the New-Loans a debt. If the law of 1792 is uſeleſs, take it out of the queſtion; having taken it out, you apply for payment by the law of 1791.</p>
                     <p>If right in this reaſoning, it will be admitted there was no fund, and conſequently no appropriation; and therefore the ſecond charge is fully proved, and the Conſtitution of the commonwealth was broken by the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>That there was an appropriation by the law of 1792, for the redemption of debts, is evident from the ſecond ſection. What is the Comptroller-General's language? He ſays, although the Legiſlature ſay by the Act of 1789 that theſe certificates are no debts, yet he ſays, <hi>A. B. C.</hi> are creditors of the commonwealth by the Act of 1792. I know the ſtate owes theſe people, I will determine, I will take the money, I will pay it to the holders of New-Loans, I will go further, I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this equitable claim myſelf, having the power, although the agent of the government, I will purchaſe it from the holders by virtue of my official authority, and retain the money by virtue of the Act of 1792.</p>
                     <p>Is this the language of a faithful agent? On what principles of equity is this juſtified? Is this juſtice to the New-Loan holders? I will no longer detain you on this ſecond diviſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="435" facs="unknown:027132_0443_0FD35219257E2500"/>I am now come to the third general queſtion, that is, <hi>Has he not appropriated to his own uſe, New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates which had been ſurrendered to the commonwealth by the holders; and ſhould have been cancelled?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the Comptroller-General, as truſtee of the commonwealth, had done this, will not be doubted; our evidence however on this point is not now as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as it may be, we expect the teſtimony of <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> but there are other evidences, <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Oldden,</hi> by whoſe teſtimony the ſame imputation is fixed on the conduct of the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>The teſtimony of both are ſimilar, both applied to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to exchange, both brought the New-Loan certificates to be exchanged, one of them filled up a blank exchange, they manifeſted their conſent to re-exchange, no expectation ever to receive back their New-Loans again, this is a ſtrong evidence of their intention to re-exchange, theſe were by all principles of juſtice ſurrendered to the commonwealth, and ought to have been cancelled; the property was ſhifted from the holders to the State, for the expreſs purpoſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed, if he ſhould have delivered the certificates to the original holders, it would be perfidy in the agent.</p>
                     <p>We are told with confidence, that "the charge is a mill-ſtone, the evidence as light as a feather." They are much miſtaken in the merits of this controverſy; the property was not in the original holders as ſoon as the proprietor reached it to the agent of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the ſame was completely ſhifted from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal holders, not a doubt can remain of their being liable for the holder's debts.</p>
                     <p>It will not be contended that if two parties agree to exchange commodities, and they agree on all the terms, the bargain is completed. One ſays, here, take my goods, I will call to-morrow and receive my articles. The property is ſhifted. If theſe general principles are eſtabliſhed and admitted, if the caſe before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate be an exception to ſuch general principles, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their duty to ſhew it. This is not a bold aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:027132_0444_0FD35297D0D7BCB0"/>
but authority which is acquieſced in; the agent was ready, the holder was ready, the party brought the certificates to the agent, the exchange was propoſed to the Comptroller, the agent had poſſeſſion, it was in the cuſtody of the commonwealth, an expreſs agreement, "give me the original certificates"—nay, more, the exchange is made in writing. I will call to-morrow or when you can look up the original certificates. If this was not a contract for New-Loan certificates, the government had no original right to iſſue them.</p>
                     <p>The holder had a claim on the State for the amount of his certificates, and no dealer in the market would doubt, but he had parted with his property.</p>
                     <p>What right, then, had the Comptroller General to make propoſals for certificates thus depoſited and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of; and to appropriate them to his own uſe? The fact is, there was delay. The Senate will judge of the intention of the officer by the application: The certificates being thus depoſited, the bargain was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted; he purchaſed them from men who held the property, not the property of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> but the property of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> and to give a reaſon why he did ſo, he produces neither reaſon nor authority for his acting in this manner.</p>
                     <p>But there is another caſe ſtill ſtronger than that of <hi>Oldden's</hi> or <hi>Biddle's;</hi> and that is the certificate of <hi>Blair M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true the matter is not perſpicuous enough, but it is true enough to ſatisfy certain facts, to wit:</p>
                     <p>It appears <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> held ſuch a certificate, he never ſold to Mr. <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> it is true, he ſold to others; 'tis alſo true, and poſſible, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> might have bought from others; if a fact, it is capable of proof—and the weight of that proof reſts on the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>It is incumbent on him to ſhew how he came by it; he has ſubſcribed it, it is his duty to point out how he became poſſeſſed of it, we have paid it, it is ſimilar to ſtolen goodſ found on a perſon, he muſt account how
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:027132_0445_0FD351E6523EC6C0"/>
he came by them; this may be ſaid to be leſs hard on Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> than on a felon, or on a common vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, who knows nothing of accounts; this is not the caſe with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> he is a perſon of information, of books, and of accounts, knows with whom he deals, and keeps a diary to aſſiſt his memory. <hi>(Mr. Lewis gave him here a loud hoarſe laugh, for talkin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of diaries, when none of them would be admitted as teſtimony.)</hi> Why! he ſays ſo—he began to keep a diary in March 1792.</p>
                     <p>It is a fact that he had this certificate, the amount of which is £.3275:19:4, he can trace a tranſaction of ſo much importance, the name cannot be loſt in the mere hurry of buſineſs, if the perſon exiſts upon earth, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> can and ought to produce him; in ſome inſtances it is uſual to give a bill of ſale of ſuch certificates.</p>
                     <p>And further, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is in poſſeſſion of books and official documents, if it is not exchanged, where are the Continental certificates for which this was iſſued.</p>
                     <p>Can the defendant ſhew them? Let him turn to his books and ſhew them; will not the books be ſufficient to clear up this point? and to ſhew the amount on hand and not delivered out, or how he has accounted for them, if the books are kept as they ought to have been, it muſt appear from ſome of thoſe official docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the poſſeſſion of the defendant, if no other anſwer can be procured, but that he is not bound to prove it, it is in vain to make any enquiry into the conduct of a public officer.</p>
                     <p>If the certificate had been conſolidated <note n="*" place="bottom">It was conſolidated. See Mr. <hi>M'Connell's</hi> evidence, page 186.</note>, ſtill it is in his power to ſhew this by his books <note n="†" place="bottom">The books alſo ſhewed it to have been the caſe.</note>. Finally, if we are to prove the charge, what other evidence can we produce, or can be expected of us? We have proved the facts, the defendant muſt prove his miſtake. It is his duty to ſhew, when and where he purchaſed it, and what became of the counter parts: But if he does not, the charge is proved upon him, and the evidence is ſtrong and irreſiſtible.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Having proved the facts which were breaches of laws, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove he is innocent, that it was done through miſtake and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, that he acted with an honeſt intention, and that this <hi>killing</hi> was not maliciouſly done; if the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller will not prove this, there is no doubt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and criminal intentions. Can any doubts exiſt of what a man tells us in the public records, after the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of many days, ſhould he ſay that he did not know it?</p>
                     <p>In theſe records he has explicitly ſhewn the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe laws, his ſtatement in 1790 is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, (here Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> read the minutes of 1790, page 389) that the New-Loans amounted to a certain ſum, which were claims againſt the State, but by the Act of 1789 were excluded from redemption. (The whole being taken, it reads, <hi>"redemption" by the Land-office.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe claims were only claims for certificates (page 395, ſame date) by the Act of March 178 they were excluded from the Land-office, in the ſame page are moſt material paſſages, but for what purpoſe? They were claims not for money at as early a date as Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1790. I have urged this confeſſion as a reaſon, and a number of circumſtances ſtrongly apply to confirm that this was the true conſtruction, that the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General and the other officers of government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the ſame opinion, that New-Loan certificates were not ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid the Secretary of the Treaſury was of that opinion, when he was better informed, he renounced his former opinion. The conſideration of the two Acts of 1786 and 1789, together with the conſideration of the Conſtitution of the United States, never came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him for deciſion in a <hi>"prominent point of view."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General was not miſtaken in his
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:027132_0447_0FD3529D035AF2A0"/>
views. Is he to ſhelter himſelf under the opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſury? After his partial infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to that officer, the Act of 1786 had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Act of 1789 had been retained, he knew it, and ſtated in his reports the debt as a claim againſt <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> as they operated in the way.</p>
                     <p>Here is an important queſtion, the Comptroller ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets the Act of 1789, is this opinion a proof of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intentions? it proves the reverſe.</p>
                     <p>The Regiſter-General never knew that any New-Loans were ſubſcribed, until Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> had got his money; he went to Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> office in a ſurpriſe, a circumſtance ſo <hi>ſingular,</hi> to know whether it was true or not.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo true, that the Comptroller-General did not know what was the opinion of the Regiſter-General; a converſation took place, ſame time went to <hi>Smith's</hi> office. The Regiſter gives his reaſons, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it would be to the intereſt of the State. Therefore he gave it in the integrity of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> and ſome other reſpectable gentlemen are named, as having ſubſcribed New-Loans. I doubt this to be evidence in the preſent caſe. Was not the opinion of Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> founded on the opinion of the Comptroller-General? Did not the Comptroller broach it? Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſuffered others to act to keep himſelf in countenance. Is that opinion ſufficient excuſe? Had it ever been the ſame before? No, until the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler rendered it faſhionable, there is no evidence of any perſon entertaining ſuch an opinion before the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, who ſhould have ſaved to the State the wealth that he is now poſſeſſed of. This opinion would never have been thought of if the Comptroller had not broached it. All the holders would have re-exchanged their certificates if he had not defeated the views of the Legiſlature.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid, others determined to purchaſe New-Loans before Mr. <hi>Nicholſon.</hi> The opinion of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:027132_0448_0FD3529E85E6E510"/>
them; ſome determined before, others determined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Where is the public officer who has not determined the reverſe? They ought to be convinced, as they had been when they had the ſame opportunity.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid the defendant had long before the Act of 1792 the ſame opinion; it is a miſtake, his report made in 1790 clearly proves the contrary, he conceived the deſign that the New-Loans were a claim, not a claim for certificates, but a claim for caſh.</p>
                     <p>His oppoſition to the law of 1792 has been much relied on, much credit hath been taken for the ſecret ſources of wealth contained in his plan of finance from pure and diſintereſted motives. Why did he oppoſe it? Does it prove his innocence? The Comptroller oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; becauſe it would ſubject the State to the payment of ſome debts, which the commonwealth ought not to pay. Does not this ſhew a conſciouſneſs? Does not this prove that he knew New-Loans were not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able either legally or equitably.</p>
                     <p>It ſhews covetouſneſs; to ſuffer them to be re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed might include an imprudent proceeding. Was he not bound to take no advantage of their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? And he was not bound to uncover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This he thought right, and puts the difference into his own pocket; all this under the colour of law. By theſe principles he took the advantage of the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with an ill grace. All this is a plan proof of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, converting every thing to his private gain. It is poſſible, nay, it is probable that he conceived the deſign of oppoſing the Act of 10th April 1792, from pure motives, for what reaſon? We ſay they were afterwards corrupt. There are other parts of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which demonſtrate the guilt of the defendant.</p>
                     <p>The ſtatement of the Comptroller, that New-Loans were excluded in the proviſions for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a proof in point; it cannot be pretended that they are in the law of 1792, it is confeſſed not to be in the ſecond ſection, it is ſaid to be in the ſixth. Pure motives theſe! When this officer wanted an engine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:027132_0449_0FD352A10913A778"/>
the word "ſubſcribable" can be found in that ſection.</p>
                     <p>The complete ſecrecy is a ſtrong proof of his guilt, bound to communicate with the other officers, which he declined until he actually obtained poſſeſſion of the money. If the opinion of the Comptroller was known for ſo many years, why ſecrecy ſo many years? He did not receive money to pay it back again, he carried his plan into execution before the Governor, a faithful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer took meaſures to ſtop it, the Regiſter was check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the progreſs. This is the conduct of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> This is the meaning of the articles. On all that came before the Houſe, I do not ſee a clauſe by which I can be able to find thoſe ſigns of innocency, he was the officer of the public, he was paid for his ſervices, he was not to ſacrifice their intereſt to his own private gain; his whole courſe is a ſacrifice of duty to gain: he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it with a ſtep as ſteady as time. We have ſeen the conduct, we have traced the motives of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General; let us take an extenſive view, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with the general principles of faithfulneſs and honour. As an Executive officer, he was an hand to fulfil the volitions of the public, the Legiſlature's will was his duty. If we find him going forward in other principles of gain, they are baſe. Is this faithfulneſs, fairneſs and honour, in a country like ours, where the government lives on public confidence? They are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by every breath, if they are not equipoiſed, the nice balance is eaſily diſplaced. By this means the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of European politics will deſtroy our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and falſe conſtructions will overwhelm our own politics, and ſacrifice the principles on which we built our Republic.</p>
                     <p>Of all the parts the public revenue ought to be moſt cloſely watched; revenue is food which in a diſeaſed ſtate is humour and diſeaſe, and becomes the food of corruption. No jealouſy is too great to check un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded power; no jealouſy too great to watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
<pb n="442" facs="unknown:027132_0450_0FD35252B78EBB88"/>
confidence, in equal ſyſtems purity and ſeverity are neceſſary,</p>
                     <p>We have been told that great patriots have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to popular fury, through clamour and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Is this an argument againſt convicting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant! Where is the clamour, where is the public reſentment? The influence of the reſpondent is great, more danger of impunity, he has many friends. No compariſon between the Republics of antient times and our own, the repreſentation here is judicious, their laws were indefinite; no more ſimilarity between <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> than there is between their patriots and the reſpondent. They knew nothing of repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they knew nothing of the diviſions of power, they did not decide by fixed laws, paſſion was their only principle.</p>
                     <p>Hence an unjuſt acquittal is perfidy to the public. I know the Senate have too much underſtanding to leave their poſt; the proof is competent to authoriſe a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conviction; if the opinion of the Senate ſhould be different, the Comptroller will not be puniſhed for mal-conduct, the community will be defrauded, the day of acquittal will be forgotten, it will be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reward for crimes, in future no reſponſibility will be expected, this will be opening the flood-gates of corruption; but conſider, they ought to know that you are above them; they will then do juſtice, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the Senate will in this caſe do juſtice to the commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and to the reſpondent, and prevent the torrent of ſeduction from ſweeping away our liberties and our rights.

                     <head>Thirteenth day of the Trial. <hi>THURSDAY, MARCH 13.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Senate met; the conſideration of Legiſlative buſineſs was poſtponed; Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> and his counſel were at the table, inſide the bar as uſual; the Court was called, as in page 201.</p>
                     <p>Mr. BRADFORD roſe, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THOSE circumſtances which have deprived the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant of one of his counſel, occaſion my appearance in this cauſe. Having been ſubſtituted in his place, I wiſh I were able to ſupply his loſs.</p>
                     <p>I appear for an officer who has been long in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice, and, I may add, long a public favorite:— an officer who has been as it were burdened with the public confidence and oppreſſed with duties numerous, delicate and difficult in their execution. When ſuch an officer is <hi>accuſed,</hi> the very confidence with which he has been honored begets ſuſpicion; and if he be accuſed of <hi>peculation,</hi> a jealouſy for the people's rights provokes a peculiar zeal in thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the proſecution. That zeal has not been wanting: and the reſult, I truſt, will be honorable both to the Houſe of Repreſentatives and to the defendant. Their committee, in their inveſtigation of his conduct, left no tract unexplored—no office unſearched—no expence ſpared: and yet, although the defendant has been twelve years in office, they have been able to bring forward only a ſingle charge of <hi>this kind:</hi> and that founded on the ſingle teſtimony of an unrecollecting individual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="445" facs="unknown:027132_0453_0FD352A301D9D4C8"/>Impreſſed with the importance of the cauſe I will endeavour to diſcuſs it as well as my ſtrength will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: and in order to follow ſome method, the articles of impeachment ſhall be my guide. They will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately conſidered and probably ſeperately decided on by you: and therefore a diſtinct and ſeperate diſcuſſion of them is in ſome degree neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The firſt article may be divided into three diſtinct poſitions,</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. That the Act of March 1789, rendered the New-Loan certificates no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. That he declared theſe certificates to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable to the loan of the United States.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. That this was a miſdemeanor, in violation of his duty.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe poſitions, is the baſis of the whole proſecution. It therefore deſerves a minute examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for unleſs it can be ſupported, the Coloſſus which is reared upon it muſt inevitably fall.—Its importance ariſes from the Act of Congreſs of the 4th of Auguſt 1790, which makes the ſums ſubſcribable to the loan, payable in certificates iſſued by the reſpective ſtates "as acknowledgements or evidences of debts by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively owing."</p>
                     <p>That the New-Loan certificates were at <hi>one time</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a debt owing by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſeemed ſo manifeſt that it could not be denied; and accordingly the committee thought it neceſſary to ſtate, that the Act of 1789 had deſtroyed that quality. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore placed this poſition in the front of the battle: It is our duty to encounter it; and in ſo doing I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove,</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. That theſe certificates were debts of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> before the Act of March 1789.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. That the Act of that date neither <hi>did</hi> nor <hi>could</hi> annihilate the debt.—</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe is a principle conceded in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of impeachment. When they ſtate that the Act
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:027132_0454_0FD352A825E848E0"/>
rendered theſe certificates <hi>no longer</hi> a debt, they impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly admit that they <hi>were</hi> a debt before the Act was paſſed. The learned managers, alſo, have occaſionly admitted it; but as their counſel have told us that it was not a debt—but a temporary exchange of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates—that they were not abſolute contracts for the payment of money—but mere receipts to enable the holder to get back his Continental certificates—it has become neceſſary to examine this point.</p>
                     <p>By a debt every lawyer underſtands <hi>ex vi termeni,</hi> a ſum of money due by certain and expreſs contract. Such we hold theſe certificates to be:—a debt created by the Act of March 1786.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of that Act hath been gone into to prove that this was only an engagement to pay the intereſt as long as the ſtate choſe, and not a permament debt. And it was ſaid to be a mere temporary proviſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was originally the debt of the United States and not the proper debt of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will therefore be proper in this place to mention a few facts which illuſtrate the hiſtory of the certificate —debt of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the war commenced it was underſtood and afterwards expresſly ſtipulated that all expences ſhould be paid out of a common treaſury. Congreſs had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally the power of raiſing money but no organ by which they could effectually exert that power. They could make requiſitions but could not enforce them: and it has properly been called a government of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.—Hence they were obliged to iſſue paper-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but that depreciated and large debts were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably contracted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe debts were for ſervices rendered, articles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or monies advanced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. Part of this debt aroſe from the depreciation of the ſoldiers pay. Congreſs in 1786 determined to make up that depreciation, and not being able to do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, requeſted the ſeveral ſtates to compenſate their reſpective troops for the deficiency of their pay. Hence
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:027132_0455_0FD352AA57AD5B08"/>
aroſe the depreciation debt of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> originally the debt of the United States, and ſtill chargeable in account to them. But as ſoon as the certificates were iſſued by the ſtate, it became <hi>her own debt</hi> and ſo it has always been conſidered. For the reſidue of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſoldier received the paper of Congreſs; and for ſervices rendered to the United States, he held in one hand his depreciation certificate iſſued by the ſtate, and in his other a final ſettlement certificate granted by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. The ſecond ſpecies of certificates were thoſe iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued under the Act of 1ſt April 1784. Theſe have of late been called Funded debt—but the greateſt part of them were iſſued for militia ſervices, when called our by order of Congreſs, or for commiſſary or quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter certificates and other debts properly chargeable to the United States. Here again the ſtate ſtepped in to aſſume; yet theſe certificates are not denied to be the proper debt of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3d. But the greateſt part of the public creditors who were citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> held Continental certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates. Neither principal nor intereſt was paid upon theſe; and though this was not the proper debt of the ſtate yet ſhe was one of the partnerſhip, and as far as her quot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went, was bound to contribute. She was willing to do this: but amidſt a general delinquency of the ſtates, ſhe had no encouragement to exert herſelf for the payment of any but her own citizens—and theſe ſhe choſe to prefer.</p>
                     <p>The Legiſlature accordingly made Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates receivable in the Land-Office. They went further, and by an Act of 1783 enabled the Loan-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to pay <hi>one</hi> year's intereſt on ſuch of the Continental certificates as were held by the citizens of the ſtate. There were hopes, at this time, that Congreſs would be authoriſed to lay a duty of five per cent. on impoſts: but <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> refuſed to accede to it, and the hopes of a Continental proviſion for the payment of the debt became more diſtant. Still <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:027132_0456_0FD351EA5CEA6F70"/>
to aſſume ſo large a debt as was in the hands of her citizens: But deſirous of relieving them, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature directed the ſtate's quota of the annual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the aggregate debt to be paid into the hands of the Continental Loan-officer for the purpoſe of paying its own citizens, until <hi>permanent</hi> proviſion ſhould be made by Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>But this would have left foreign creditors unprovid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: and Congreſs by their ordinance of the 27th September 1785, diſabled the Loan-officer from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the plan into effect. This defeated the Act of 1785. The indent ſyſtem, propoſed by Congreſs, was ſeem to be deluſive; the creditors ſuffered; and the moment was arrived when <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſaw ſhe muſt either abandon the relief of her own citizens or take the debt due to them upon herſelf. In ſuch a criſis ſhe did not heſitate, but nobly reſolved to aſſume the debt, to become the creditor of Congreſs inſtead of the debtor; and by interpoſing her own credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, to ſave her citizens from diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>This gave birth to the Act of March 1786. The Legiſlature determined to open a loan—to receive the Continental certificates as gold and ſilver—and to give the note of the ſtate for their amount, payable in ten years.—In nothing but its amount did this aſſumption differ from that of the depreciation and other debts of the United States. The different ſpecies of certificates ſeemed to be equal favorites: All of them were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Land-office, all of them bore intereſt at 6 per cent. and by the Act of 1786 intereſt on all of them was made payable half yearly.</p>
                     <p>In the aſſumption of the <hi>Depreciation</hi> and <hi>Funded</hi> debt, <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> became entitled to a credit in <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> with Congreſs equal to the amount aſſumed:— In that of the New-Loan debt ſhe acquired a <hi>transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> credit: in both caſes ſhe contracted a debt to her own citizens and the certificates iſſued were <hi>equally</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of that debt.—Why then are we told in ſuch pointed terms that this was not an original debt of
<pb n="449" facs="unknown:027132_0457_0FD3521CE3928D58"/>
                        <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi> Is the contract leſs valid becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is a negociable debt, and not caſh or produce? Certainly not. The engagement was thus, "Transfer to me your certificate and I will give you my note to pay you an equivalent in money." If individuals had bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained ſo, what court of law or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>uity would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that the note thus given created a debt?—Here the <hi>conſideration</hi> was a valuable one—the ſum certain —the time of payment fixed—the note negociable. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, ſee page 317.) It has the nature and all the properties of a legal debt; and as to ſubſequent hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they had only to look at the face of the certificate, to learn that the ſtate was obliged to pay that debt to <hi>the bearer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again: The Act which created theſe certificates ſpeaks of them <hi>as debts.</hi> Thus in ſection II, it directs that the margin of the certificates ſhall be "ſufficient for a memorandum of the eſſential circumſtances of the <hi>debts</hi> to be thereby reſpectively ſecured." The ſame expreſſion occurs in the eighth ſection.—They are conſidered as <hi>debts</hi> by the Acts of 28th March 1786, and are ſo called in all the Legiſlative proceedings. It was ſo conſidered when the Act or 1789 was before the Houſe, and in their minutes it is ſtiled a "debt originally due by the United States and aſſumed by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> for the relief of her citizens." (See votes Aſſembly, 26th December 1786, page 93-97, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1787, page 69; minutes 1789, page 77, 78, and 82, &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>Before I diſmiſs this part of the ſubject, permit me to make an obſervation on what fell from the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> yeſterday. He was miſtaken when he ſuppoſed that the memorandum on the margin was to be a memorandum of the <hi>Continental</hi> certificates loaned. On the contrary the memorandum was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſerve <hi>as a check</hi> and to record the eſſential circumſtances of the <hi>New-Loan certificates,</hi> on whoſe margin it was made. The inference ſo ingeniouſly
<pb n="450" facs="unknown:027132_0458_0FD3524C0F551C20"/>
drawn from it, is therefore unfounded: but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take was a natural one for a gentleman to whom this ſubject could not be familiar.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that the ſtate made a contract for the payment of the debt not only with the original creditors but with every <hi>bona fide</hi> holder. And if the ſtate reſerved a right to aboliſh the debt, where is the evidence of that right to be found? It is not in the law; it is not on the face of the certificate; nor had it a being till the ingenuity of counſel created it.</p>
                     <p>I here diſmiſs this point. It is proved that the New-Loans were originally evidences of a debt. 1. By the hiſtory of the Act which created it. 2. By the nature of the contract. 3. By the terms of the Act. 4. By the written documents of the Legiſlature. And, 5. By the articles of impeachment themſelves.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to prove, <hi>That the Legiſlature did not mean nor bad the power to impair the contract or deſtroy the debt, by the Act of</hi> 1789.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Legiſlature did not mean it; becauſe upon a fair and legal conſtruction of the Act, it only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to <hi>ſuſpend the payment</hi> but does not affect the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence</hi> of the debt.—The Act of 1786 made proviſion for the <hi>payment</hi> of the intereſt—but the certificates iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued under it <hi>ſecured the debt itſelf.</hi> I uſe this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage becauſe it is the language of the Act.—A repeal therefore of the Act of 1786 cannot affect thoſe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. There are no words in the Act under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which diſcover any intention to affect them, to render them irredeemable or to annul the debt.—This is always expreſsly enacted where the determination is ſuch. It is ſo in all caſes where bills of credit are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in. It is ſo in the Act of 4th December 1789 <hi>(Dal.</hi> 759) where certain certificates for ſupplies are directed to be brought in, and are declared after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day to be irredeemable. This has always been done when the evidence of the debt was meant to be affected. But in the caſe before us there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion on the holders of the New-Loans to bring them
<pb n="451" facs="unknown:027132_0459_0FD352220B4D0D18"/>
in and exchange them. They were left at liberty to hold them, or to exchange them, or to transfer them to others—The debt and the evidence of it remained ſecure though the funds provided by the Act of 1786 were withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>But it has been much relied on, "that ſo much of the Act of 1786 as ſecures the payment of the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſum,"</hi> is alſo repealed: And it is urged that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to pay either intereſt or principal is tantamount to annulling the debt.—But it is obvious that this clauſe affected only the certificate's <hi>receivability in the Land-office.</hi> No part of the Act of 1786 directed or ſecured the payment of the <hi>principal,</hi> except the ſection which made the certificates receivable in that office. There was no adequate fund provided for their redemption, and the hopes of receiving payment in 1796, reſted on the <hi>national faith and honour</hi> of the ſtate.—Theſe were the ſecurity of the holder and theſe were not affected by the repeal in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>That the word "principal" was not inſerted with an intention to annihilate the debt, appears alſo by the hiſtory of the Act. The bill in its firſt concoction and in all its ſubſequent ſtages till two days before it paſſed, was calculated merely to ſtop the payment of intereſt. (Minutes Aſſembly 1789, page 78, 143-5.) If it had been paſſed into a law in this form, no queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind would have ariſen: And as the word "principal" appears to have been inſerted on a ſudden thought, merely to meet that part of the Act of 1786 which made them receivable in the Land-office, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford a ground for the inference that is drawn from it.</p>
                     <p>The preamble has alſo been relied on as proving the intention of the Act. But, without inſiſting that the preamble cannot controul the purview, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that it ſtates the want of funds, which had been diverted to the general government, as the ground of the difficulty: and that it was reaſonable that payment of the debts due to the creditors ſhould be provided
<pb n="452" facs="unknown:027132_0460_0FD3524D8C6CC558"/>
for out of the Treaſury of the United States.—It was hoped, probably, that Congreſs would aſſume them— or, paying the intereſt to the ſtate, enable her to pay it over to the creditors—and until events ſhould deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the incapacity of the ſtate to meet the demand required a ſuſpenſion of the payment. But in the mean time an exchange of certificates was offered to thoſe who choſe it.—Circumſtances of imperious neceſſity may excuſe the ſtoppage of payment—but nothing can juſtify an attempt to deſtroy the debt.</p>
                     <p>Again: The debt is ſo far from being extinguiſhed by the Act, that the Legiſlature recognizes it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the payment of four years intereſt complete and providing a new fund for its redemption. But they do not <hi>compel</hi> the creditors to reſort to this fund. All the expreſſions of the Act ſhew that they have an option either to take back their Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or to rely on the future ability of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. It recites that <hi>"many may be deſirous"</hi> to take back their certificates—that it is "juſt and reaſonable" to grant it to thoſe <hi>"applying"</hi> therefor, &amp;c.—Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which prove that the exchange was diſcretionary with the creditors.</p>
                     <p>"But can that be a debt of which the payment both of intereſt and of principal is withdrawn?" Unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably it can.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is plain that the deſtruction of the intereſt is not the deſtruction of the debt. Thus during the war, intereſt ceaſed on <hi>Britiſh</hi> debts. So on money attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The intereſt on the ſtate debts due from confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated eſtates are at this moment in that ſituation. There is no fund for payment of principal or intereſt, and yet it is certainly a debt. 2. Neither will the annihilation of funds for the payment of the principal operate thus. If theſe certificates had never been receivable in the Land-office, they would nevertheleſs have been evidences of a debt. The debt is created by the promiſe; the means of fullfilling that promiſe are quite different from the promiſe itſelf.—Beſides, a debt may exiſt
<pb n="453" facs="unknown:027132_0461_0FD3524F18520B30"/>
where there are no means of compelling payment. A debt due from one individual to another is not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by a defect of remedy. For inſtance, when the revolution took place all poſitive laws ceaſed; the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor had no means of compelling payment; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the remedy was extinct the debt was in force. So in the caſe of alien enemies; their debts are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, not extinguiſhed. A ſimilar point was lately ruled in the higheſt tribunal of the United States, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgia</hi> v. <hi>Brailsford.</hi> It is the ſame caſe in thoſe ſtates where there is no mode of ſuing the government; tho' they refuſe to provide funds for the payment of the principal or intereſt of their certificates, thoſe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates are not leſs evidences of debts owing from them. So the New-Loans being evidences of a debt rightfully created are not deſtroyed by the withdrawing thoſe funds which the Act of 1786 provided.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me that the ſenſe of the Legiſlature ſince the paſſing of the Act of 1789 correſponds with this conſtruction. This may be collected from the Act of 29th March 1790, page 784. (Here Mr. <hi>B.</hi> read the Act and commented upon it.)</p>
                     <p>From the view already taken of this point, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that the Legiſlature did not mean to render the New-Loan certificates no longer evidences of a debt; but there is ſtill a ſtronger reaſon for avoiding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite conſtruction, which is, that it tarniſhes the honor of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>—It has been proved that there was a debt ſolemnly contracted by the ſtate on a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Now what is ſuppoſed by the articles of impeachment? That the Legiſlature intended—not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cancel this ſolemn obligation—to violate the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>—to ſap the confidence in the public faith, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> to ſubvert the honeſt principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and violate the Federal Conſtitution. Sir, it is imputing to the Legiſlature a crime greater than that with which the defendant ſtands charged.</p>
                     <p>All government is inſtituted for the protection of our natural rights. Property is one of theſe,—and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:027132_0462_0FD352250BB84268"/>
in contract is as ſacred as property in poſſeſſion. We have no ſafety if this can be violated; and thoſe who think that liberty can be ſecure where property is not protected will find themſelves miſerably miſtaken.</p>
                     <p>The neceſſity of preſerving the faith of contracts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween individuals is very apparent. If one man ſhould give his own obligation in exchange for another, no court of law or equity would diſſolve the contract:— and the conſtitution of the United States prohibits this injuſtice in <hi>all</hi> caſes. Why ſhould there be a difference made between the promiſſory note of an individual and of a ſtate? States are moral perſons, capable of duties and obligations; and none but thoſe who adopt the diſhoneſt refinements of the <hi>Florentine</hi> politician will in ſuch a caſe diſtinguiſh between them. What is it to juſtice whether the one of parties to a contract be one, or many—an individual—a corporation or a ſtate? Power, indeed, may be on one ſide, but power is not right. The naked arm of violence may tear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in pieces, but the immutable juſtice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, remains the ſame. It is the ſacred law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſays <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> that the faith of contracts be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The moſt deſpotic governments are obliged to reſpect this ſalutary principle—this voice of the divinity which is heard in every heart amidſt all the violence of deſire and the clamours of ſelf intereſt.—But in republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can governments the preſervation of this principle is eſſential to liberty. Such at leaſt was the conviction of the people of <hi>America</hi> when they formed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. They would not ſuffer ſo important a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be at hazard and ſolemnly declared "That no ſtate ſhall have power to impair the obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts." This is at once our glory and our reproach; our reproach as the evidence of paſt injuſtice; our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as an eternal bar to ſuch injuſtice in future. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of power—this inability to do wrong is more truly honorable to the ſeveral ſtates than unbounded authority. I ſpeak not only as counſel for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, but as a citizen who loves his country, when I ſay;
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:027132_0463_0FD352267A01A7B8"/>
that the preſervation of this article of the Conſtitution is of the laſt importance. We ought to watch over it with a holy jealouſy—we ought to guard it with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting zeal—we ought to reſiſt the ſlighteſt attempt to deſtroy or impair it. Among all the captious excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and honeſt prejudices againſt the Federal Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, no oppoſition was made to this principle—no amendment propoſed by any ſtate. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> not only formally approved of, but after three years conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration tranſplanted it into her own Conſtitution. We there find it placed among "the great and eſſential principles of liberty and free government." (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here read the articles in the Conſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania.)</hi> Around this every honeſt citizen ought to rally: and yet this muſt be beaten down before the defendant can be reached.</p>
                     <p>At the time of paſſing the Act of 1789, the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States was in full force. Ought we then to ſuppoſe the legiſlature ſo forgetful of their duty as to violate it? Is it neceſſary to ſully the fair fame of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by a harſh conſtruction of the Act when an honeſt meaning is eaſily diſcoverable in it?</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid the Act of 1789 reſtores all things to their old ſituation—that this is <hi>equitable and juſt</hi>—and therefore no violation of the Conſtitution. To this we anſwer, 1. That the contract was to pay money not to re-exchange certificates. The United States might as well annihilate their aſſumed debts in the ſame manner. A man who purchaſes land on ground rent might as well inſiſt upon the ſeller taking back his land and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rent; or when farms have been exchanged, that they ſhould be mutually reſtored. This argument will not hold in common life nor in the caſe before us, 2. It did not reſtore things to their old ſtate. The <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer</hi> of a New-Loan certificate never loaned any thing and the proferred exchange was offering what he did not wiſh and taking from him what he choſe to keep. 3. Even thoſe who loaned their certificates could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame certificates again; and if Congreſs had made
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:027132_0464_0FD352286EAC16F0"/>

To pretend, as was yeſterday ſaid, that the meaning of the conſtitution was mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ely this, "that no injuſtice ſhould be done by the ſtates"—and at the ſame time to leave them the judges of this juſtice in their own caſes, is to fritter away our liberties.—Juſtice is always the pretence; and even the pine-barren laws, as they were called, were paſſed on the pretence of <hi>Equity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid that even a ſuſpenſion of the payment of the intereſt was a breach of the contract as much as the annihilation of the debt. But it may be obſerved that funds for the payment of the intereſt were withdrawn by the conſent of the people themſelves; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to pay will excuſe the preſent ſtoppage of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the obligation of the contract remains. Thus the ſudden revolution in the form of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which abſtracted the funds juſtified a preſent ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of payment; and in the mean time a re-exchange was offered to thoſe who choſe to look to Congreſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than rely on the future ability and faith of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, Suppoſe the Act were contrary to the Conſtitution, who ſhall ſay ſo—what judicature has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to determine upon it? That point need not be much diſcuſſed. It has more than once been ſettled, that the judicial power is inveſted with authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on the conſtitutionality of an Act of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. In countries where they have no formed Conſtitution the Legiſlature may be conſidered as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme: But here their Acts are <hi>leges ſub graviore lege!</hi> It has ſo been determined in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Craig</hi> and others, v.—and alſo in <hi>North-Carolinna.</hi> In <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> we have often heard this doctrine from the mouth of the Chief Juſtice, and a recent determination of the Judges of the United States, on the penſion laws, proves that they entertain the ſame opinion. A decent reſpect for the opinion of the Legiſlature is very
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:027132_0465_0FD351ED92363B40"/>
proper and ought to govern every tribunal in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful point; but an undue ſubmiſſion would be a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of duty.</p>
                     <p>But we are preſſed with the objection that this is to ſet the Judiciary above the Legiſlative. But this is by no means the caſe. It only eſtabliſhes the preeminent authority of the <hi>people. They</hi> are above the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Judicial. To both they have delegated limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted powers; and the Conſtitution is the ſupreme rule by which both ought to govern their deciſions.</p>
                     <p>The objection is founded on principles long ſince abandoned. After the truths eſtabliſhed by our revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution—and in the blaze of political knowledge which illuminates the cloſe of the 18th century, I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear it affirmed in a republican government, that the ſupreme power reſides in the Legiſlature. It reſides only in the people who have delegated certain portions of it to the different branches of government. Properly ſpeaking neither of theſe is ſuperior—They are in one ſenſe equal and co-ordinate—The Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is controuled by the Conſtitution; and to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary the people have entruſted the power of interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws. And as the Conſtitution is the ſupreme law, the courts in the exerciſe of their functions muſt neceſſarily determine whether the Acts of the Legiſlature interfere with its proviſions. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to and read ſome paſſages from <hi>Publius's</hi> letters on the ſubject.)</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid that the people in caſe of a violation of the Conſtitution have no remedy but another election. If this be true, there is no ſecurity that another election will be in their power. If this be true, the Legiſlature might have been ſpared the trouble and expence of an impeachment. They might have paſſed a bill of pains and penalties againſt the defendant, or erected a torture chamber to oblige him to confeſs. If this be true our liberties are proſtrate at the feet of the Aſſembly, and a <hi>limited</hi> Conſtitution is of no avail.—What will the Freemen of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſay when they find the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:027132_0466_0FD3522B2DC8DEF8"/>
of the Houſe of Repreſentatives ſo liberal in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering their ineſtimable rights? or what muſt they think of this cauſe which cannot be ſupported without ſhaking the pillars of the Conſtitution?</p>
                     <p>To enforce his reaſoning on this point the gentleman added that he never heard that any power on earth had a right to adjudge a caſe between a ſtate and its own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Then, Sir, he never read the Conſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> which expreſsly provides that a ſtate ſhall be ſued as an individual. The poſition is a remnant of feudal ignorance;—and ſurely in a criminal proſecution every man has a right to avail himſelf, before any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, of the ſhelter the Conſtitution affords.</p>
                     <p>I will dwell no longer on this ſubject. From our examination of it, it is equally evident that the New-Loans are ſtill a debt—and that the Legiſlature did not mean nor had the power to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to examine the other poſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt article. They are, <hi>That</hi> John Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>declared theſe certificates ſubſcribable to the loan of the United Sates, and that this was a miſdemeanor.</hi> The fact of his certifying or declaring them to be ſubſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is admitted, except, that he did not certify this, in his own caſe; in which alone he could have derived any advantage from it. But no guilt reſults from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, if it can be <hi>juſtified</hi> or <hi>excuſed.</hi> We mean to do both, and contend, 1ſt. That this debt was by law ſubſcribable to the loan. 2d. That if it was not, it was at leaſt his real opinion;—an opinion honeſtly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by him and many others.</p>
                     <p>New-Loans are within the deſcription of 13th ſection of the Act of Congreſs. Compare them with it. They were certificates iſſued before the 1ſt January 1790, by the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>—as acknowledgments or evidences of debts by her owing.—They are not within the exception of the ſection;—nor could they be legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed at the Loan-office unleſs they could be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no longer evidences of a debt.—I admit that they muſt be evidences of a <hi>ſubſiſting</hi> debt;—but we
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:027132_0467_0FD3523309D0D140"/>
have already proved it to be a debt,—and it has never been paid off, redeemed or otherwiſe legally diſcharged. The argument need to be repeated.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid it muſt be a debt <hi>recogniſed</hi> by the ſtate. We anſwer, 1ſt. That it never was diſclaimed by the ſtate; though unfunded, it was ſtill a debt undenied. 2d. If it was really an exiſting debt, the ſubſequent acknowledgement or diſclaimer of the ſtate would be of no avail. To decline receiving certificates of a diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed debt, was a proper rule in the Treaſury, as they had no power finally to decide on it; but their doubts or difficulties cannot affect the creditor's right. The Act ſays no ſuch thing. Whether the debt be <hi>really owing,</hi> is the only queſtion: If it be, it will exiſt independant of the will of the debtor.</p>
                     <p>This aſſumption by Congreſs was not made for the ſake of the ſtate but of the people. The hiſtory of the Act is well known. Congreſs could not raiſe money to pay their debts during the war, and the ſeveral ſtates were obliged to advance their credit for the United States. The certificates they iſſued were conſidered as a Federal charge, and yet in many of the ſtates they were not paid; while in others the ſtate creditor was a favorite. To put theſe, who were in juſtice, creditors of the Union, on a footing, the aſſumption was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on.—Could a ſtate therefore which might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to this aſſumption, defeat the meaſure by refuſing to recogniſe the debt? The very exception of the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates is a proof that it could not. Theſe were diſclaimed by that ſtate, and yet an expreſs exception was thought to be neceſſary to exclude them.</p>
                     <p>The amount of the Secratary's letter on this ſubject is, that the officers of the Treaſury, who are merely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial, take a ſafe rule in receiving certificates on loan. But this does not preclude an enquiry. A <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>nus</hi> from the Supreme Court may be iſſued to decide the queſtion; and if the certificates offered on loan, come within the deſcription of the Act, the Treaſury officers would be compelled to receive them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="460" facs="unknown:027132_0468_0FD352369257D4D0"/>The opinion of the Secretary therefore is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this queſtion. Yet it may be remarked that he did ſo far decide upon it as to write to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the Loan-officer that he could not refuſe the New-Loans if the holders inſiſted on ſubſcribing them. We are told however that the Act of 1789 was not brought into his view; but on comparing what he was written on this ſubject it is probable that he did ſee it, though he could not ſee any ſuch doctrine in it as is now drawn from it. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here commented upon ſeveral of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary's letters which were read in evidence.)—It is true, that the certificates have been <hi>virtually</hi> rejected. The expreſſion was a cautious one; but the reaſon of their being in this ſituation is, that <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> who was the holder, took no ſteps to have them loaned, or the queſtion decided. The ſtate officers even deſired that they might not be received, and the opinion of the Attorney-General of the ſtate was, that they were not receivable.—Beſides, in the late conſideration which the Secretary have to the Act of 1789, he ſays, that the circumſtances of its being paſſed after the ratification of the Federal Conſtitution did not occur to him.</p>
                     <p>Whether ſubſcribable or not, depends therefore whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Acts of Congreſs.—It is evident, that the Act contemplates this <hi>very debt</hi> as a ſtate debt. The 18th ſection expreſsly provides for a difficulty which could ariſe in no other caſe. (Here it was read and explained.) The very nature of <hi>theſe</hi> ſtate debts, was urged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs as a reaſon for the aſſumption;—and there was a peculiar and evident propriety in aſſuming them. But no difficulty was made on account of the Act of 1789. —If the New-Loans were to be excluded, why not the ſame exception as that reſpecting the <hi>North Carolina</hi> certificates? Our delegates were as attentive to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> as thoſe of other ſtates; and one of them was a member of the Aſſembly in 1789. The Act of Congreſs was not paſſed in a haſty manner. It lay over a whole ſeſſion a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>as time enough for conſideration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="461" facs="unknown:027132_0469_0FD35237D9C3F668"/>But it is objected that this proviſo ſhews that the New-Loans could not be ſubſcribed becauſe the ſtate had authoriſed no one to ſurrender the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates which were exchanged for them. To this two anſwers may be given and both of them ſatisfactory. 1ſt. This debt was ſubſcribable under the general inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent clauſe of the Act. The proviſo reſpects only the payment of the intereſt and was introduced merely for the ſecurity of the United States. It does not in any manner limit or reſtrain the <hi>ſubſcription.</hi> Such is the conſtruction given to it by the Secretary of the Treaſury. (Here Mr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> read the letter p. 272-3, at the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Bradford.)</hi> The ſtate therefore had the power to ſubſcribe the Continental certificates to the domeſtic loan and the holders of the New-Loans to ſubſcribe to the ſtate loan. But intereſt would have been paid only on one of the ſubſcription; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the Legiſlature to ſurrender their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; would not have been with holden, if the rights of their creditors had required it. 2d. Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> had power to exchange the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for New-Loans, whether they were preſented by the United States or by individuals. The negociation in 1791 eſtabliſhed this. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here obſerved upon the letter relative to that ſubject, ſee p. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>2.)</p>
                     <p>Another objection is, That the ſum of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſtate debts aſſumed by Congreſs amounts to 2,200,000 dollars only; whereas if the New-Loans were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it would have been much greater. But the argument turns the other way; for the whole of what is called the <hi>proper</hi> debt of the ſtate did not amount near to that ſum. But the whole amount of the debts of the ſeveral ſtates was not intended to be aſſumed; but only a proportionable part of each. And although the New-Loan debt was large, yet great part of it had been already exchanged, and there was reaſon to believe that almoſt the whole would be ſo; becauſe, generally ſpeaking, it was the intereſt of the holders to ſubſcribe the Continental certificates rather than the New-Loans.
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:027132_0470_0FD352069F01B2C8"/>
(Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here exhibited ſome calculations of long and ſhort intereſt on the different certificates, to ſhew their effect on the different loans.) Beſides this advantage, the payment of the intereſt on Continental certificates commenced one year before that on the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed debt. It was therefore probable that this ſum of 2,200,000 dollars would embrace all that would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.—I will not enlarge on this ſubject. The reſult of our enquiry is, that New-Loans <hi>were</hi> ſubſcribable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were evidences of a debt owing by the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>But if a different conſtruction could be put upon the Act, is it ſo plain a point that the oppoſite opinion muſt be imputed to diſhoneſt motives and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of judgment? Is it a miſtake, that can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated only by a political <hi>auto de ſe?</hi> Is it a miſtake, which every one elſe may commit with impunity; but which muſt ſubject the defendant to a ſpecies of oſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm? Forbid it candor—forbid it juſtice!</p>
                     <p>I ought now to conſider the <hi>motives</hi> which really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated the defendant; but it will be more convenient to defer this till the <hi>principle</hi> ſtated in the 2d article is alſo examined.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, third and fourth articles are ſo intimately connected that the whole may be reduced to this; that the defendant certified certain certificates to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable which were not redeemable, with a corrupt and diſhoneſt view.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion therefore is, Were the New-Loan certificates redeemable by the Act of the 10th April 1792? The article under conſideration declares that they were not; and on the ſoundneſs of this opinion all the reſt of the three articles depend.</p>
                     <p>The Senate will be pleaſed to remember that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that whatever was ſubſcribable to the loan was made redeemable by that Act. We admit that they are not within the ſecond ſection of that Act; but they are manifeſtly included in the ſixth. The words of that clauſe are remarkably ſtrong: "The holder or holders of any certificate <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> to the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:027132_0471_0FD35259852D4588"/>
ſo to be renewed, ſhall be entitled," &amp;c.—Hence ſubſcribability and redeemability became convertible terms. The Legiſlature put themſelves in the power of Congreſs. Whatever <hi>ſtate debts</hi> Congreſs ſhould chuſe to aſſume, entitled the holder to the benefits of that Act. No other conſtruction can rationally be put upon this clauſe. Even Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> who drew the bill and gave us the ſecret hiſtory of it, acknowledged the juſtneſs of that conſtruction.</p>
                     <p>But it has been urged that the ſixth ſection was not intended to include any debts not included in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                     <p>Permit me here to remind this honorable body, that a mode of conſtruction has been introduced which is ſubverſive of all legal certainty as well as of perſonal ſafety. We are led from the language of the law, to the private ſentiments of the members of the legiſlature, and to the very manner of drawing the bill. Though moſt the members of this court, were members of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature wich paſſed the Act, they will remember that all recollection of private intention at that time, is to be laid aſide conſtruing its meaning. Its language alone is to be attended to. It is that on which every citizen muſt form his opinion of the law; and to depart from this in judicial conſtruction is to poiſon the fountains of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The danger of this has created doubts concerning the propriety of erecting ſuch a court for the trial of impeachment; and it has been made a great political queſtion whether one branch of the Legiſlature ſhould ever decide on charges exhibited by the other. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the particular objects they had in view, they are in danger of limiting or extending the words within or beyond their natural and proper import; while the ſafety of the citizen conſiſts in confining the judge to the meaning of the Legiſlature as <hi>expreſſed in the law itſelf.</hi> Inconveniences may ſometimes reſult from this; but the partial evil is overbalanced by the general good. <hi>Beccaria</hi> has an excellent chapter on this point. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here read ſome paſſages from that author.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="464" facs="unknown:027132_0472_0FD352ABFA8B84B0"/>But why do I dwell on this ſubject?—I am ſpeaking to the Senate of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Judging therefore by the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of the ſixth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no doubt of the redeemability of the certificates could remain. But ſeveral objections are made to this; and they ſeem to be all contained in the report of the committee on that buſineſs. The firſt is, That no funds were provided by the Act for the redemption of theſe certificates. I am diſpoſed to admit that the funds provided, are confined to the debts mentioned in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſection; but whether any ſpecific funds were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not is immaterial, as by the exiſting laws there was a fund for all <hi>claims.</hi>—But we muſt recollect that the ſecond ſecond was to operate at all events, whether Congreſs renewed the ſubſcription or not; but the ſixth was eventual and dependant on that contingency.—The Aſſembly therefore might chuſe to let it reſt upon the aggregate funds already mentioned. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here went into ſome calculations to ſhew that this might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.)</p>
                     <p>But the fallacy of their argument is proved by the caſe of the Unfunded Depreciation certificates. They are not included in the ſecond ſection, and yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied they are included in the ſixth.—No ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific funds were provided for <hi>them;</hi>—yet as they were ſtate debts and aſſumable, they were of courſe redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The induction is fair, and even Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> who drew the bill and did not intend to include them, could not withſtand its force.</p>
                     <p>That the Unfunded Depreciation were included was a general opinion. The Regiſter-General and Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> the late reſpectable Speaker of the Senate, were the firſt to put this conſtruction on the Act. He did not heſitate to preſent ſuch certificates for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were redeemed accordingly. Judge <hi>Yeates</hi> did the ſame; and the Legiſlature to whom the Regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-General made a report of a large ſum of theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates being redeemed, did not diſapprove of it. To this day there is no diſapprobation of it,—no ſuit
<pb n="465" facs="unknown:027132_0473_0FD352394F1F6A08"/>
brought;—and well, —for where is the court that would ſuſtain it?—If then Unfunded Depreciation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, ſo are New-Loan certificates.</p>
                     <p>But to do away the force of this, we are favored with the ſecret meaning of the author of the Act. Although we were in darkneſs before, now truly we are enlightened— the film is purged—a new ray of light breaks in upon us— and knowing what the drawer of the Act intended, we ſee as it were face to face!—Sin, if ſuch principles of conſtruction are to prevail in a criminal preſecution, the will of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cadi would be as ſafe a rule of conduct as the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is urged that the ſixth ſection can only be regarded as a proviſo or exception to the ſecond. If the Legiſlature intended it as ſuch, how eaſy would it have been, to have added after "certificates? the word "herein before ſpecified." This would have confined its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the certificates mentioned in the ſecond ſection. But <hi>ſi voluit non dixit.</hi>—The ſixth ſection as it now ſtands is a diſtinct independant clauſe If it operates as ſuch on the Unfunded Depreciation, why not on the New-Loans? "Becauſe, ſay they, theſe are not a <hi>ſtate debt."</hi> Here we are thrown back upon the old queſtion.</p>
                     <p>This forms the mind objection in the report of the committee.—"Becauſe," ſay they, "it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any but <hi>ſtate creditors."</hi> Now, if New-Loans were ſtate debts, the holders of them miſt be ſtate creditors. There is no magic in theſe words to include Depreciation and to exclude the Loan debt. They are uſed merely to diſtinguiſh the creditors of the ſtate from the creditors of the United States. We are therefore brought back to that which is the only real queſtion in the cauſe; whether theſe certificates were evidences of an exiſting debt or not?</p>
                     <p>But it has been hinted that whether in ſtrictneſs it were a debt or not, yet it was not <hi>ſo conſidered</hi> by the Legiſlature in 1792. What is the proof of this? Their Acts contain no ſuch thing—and if an appeal is made to the private opinions of the members, I repeat it, we
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:027132_0474_0FD3525BB474B600"/>
cannot take notice of them.—As to the Comptroller, <hi>he</hi> always conſidered them as debts. In his ſtatement of the 10th December 1791, he ſpeaks of them as ſuch, and the word "redemption" which has been urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him, refers only to the Land-office, from which the Act of 1789 had excluded them.—It was properly obſerved that it was not the duty of the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller to bring them forward in any other view, as there was no preſent intention or ability to pay them.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that none of the reaſons urged in ſupport of the conſtruction which the articles put upon the Act, will apply. We muſt therefore reſort to the plain <hi>language</hi> of the Act. Whatever Congreſs ſhould make aſſumable the Legiſlature made redeemable. Nay, thee Act goes further, and makes the acceptance in the Continental Loan-office, the rule for paying the nominal value by the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loans therefore are included. And what are the inconviences of this conſtruction?—The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> they have given up certificates for the payment of which the ſtate was bound at leaſt to the amount of her quota—and reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſolemn promiſe to be paid 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> in the pound.—And yet the burden of the complaint is, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was by the defendant's conduct obliged to pay this 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g> in the pound!</p>
                     <p>The certificates which the ſtate received in exchange have been and may be again ſold at their nominal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;—but if the ſtate could get them without paying a ſhilling in the pound, it ſeems as if it would be very acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Sir, this eagerneſs to put a little profit by the rife and fall of ſtock into the pocket of the ſtate is diſreputable. It is to repreſent the ſovereign ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> as a jobber in the ſtocks. Such was not the intention of the Houſe of Repreſentatives when they brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this impeachment.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole it appears that theſe New-Loans were a debt—that its exiſtence was not affected by the
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:027132_0475_0FD3523BD2ACF5C8"/>
Act of 1789—that of courſe they were ſubſcribable to the loan, and being ſubſcribable were redeemable. Hence if <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> did "recogniſe, certify and declare them to be ſubſcribable and redeemable" he did no more than the law authoriſed him to do.</p>
                     <p>Having now come to a dividing point of my argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and finding it impoſſible to finiſh the whole in the courſe of the morning, I ſubmit it to the Senate whether it will not be convenient to adjourn.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> roſe, and obſerved, that the gentleman muſt have been much exhauſted, having ſpoken four hours, had yet much to ſay, and he requeſted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to adjourn till next morning. Adjourned.</p>
                     <p>In the minutes of the Houſe of Repreſentatives the following entry is recorded—</p>
                     <p>"In conformity to the reſolutions of the 29th day of February laſt, the Houſe reſolved itſelf into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the whole in order to attend the trial of <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having, yeſterday, diſcuſſed the <hi>legal</hi> poſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the firſt and ſecond articles of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am now prepared to examine the <hi>fact</hi> charged in thoſe articles. It is, That the defendant declared New-Loan certificates to be ſubſcribable and redeema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cauſed them to be redeemed, with corrupt views, and in wilful violation of his duty.</p>
                     <p>We have endeavoured to prove that he was right in his conſtruction of the law; but if it be admitted that he was wrong in that, ſtill he is excuſable, and no guilt is imputable to him, if his conduct flowed from conviction of judgment and not from corruption of heart. It is therefore of importance to ſift his conduct thoroughly, and to ſee what were his real opinions and motives. The queſtion then is, <hi>Did John Nicholſon act thus knowing or believing it to be wrong?</hi> I am willing to put the cauſe on this ſimple iſſue without holding the oppoſite counſel to the proof of all the aggravations charged in the articles. It may however be proper to take ſome ſlight notice of theſe, as they have been preſſed againſt the defendant.</p>
                     <p>To begin, then, with the firſt article: It is ſtated that he declared theſe certificates ſubſcribable—" under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office—and in violation of the confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him."—It appears that he made this certification in very few inſtances; and that this was done at the requeſt of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> or of individuals, who wiſhed to
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:027132_0477_0FD352B04C567280"/>
transfer or ſell their abſtracts before the certificates due on them, would iſſue from the Loan-office. This was an accommodation to thoſe who requeſted it, but it was not an <hi>official</hi> act. No Act of Congreſs nor of the ſtate, either required or forbid it. Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> did not certify it officially; he did not affix his official ſignature; he merely ſubſcribed the initials of his name. This was not obligatory on the Commiſſioner of Loans, nor did he abſolutely depend upon it. It is in proof that he gave a receipt importing that the certificates were ſtill ſubject to examination; and in this examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was directed by the Secretary of the Treaſury to depend on no one but himſelf and his own clerks.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore truſted neither by the United States or the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> reſpecting this matter, the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's conduct could be no violation of official duty. But to ſay "that if it was an official act it was a breach of duty and if it was not an official act, he exceeded his powers and thus violated the confidence repoſed in him" —is a very convenient argument! This is to put the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant on the bed of <hi>Procruſtes:</hi> If he is too long, lop him; if he is too ſhort, ſtretch him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. It is charged that it was done "in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own emolument." This cannot be true, for he did not certify the certificates, preſented by himſelf, to be aſſumable; and in thoſe caſes where he did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, no emolument was or could have been in view. But this circumſtance <hi>of itſelf</hi> cannot aggravate the charge. To promote our own intereſt, is an honeſt end, if purſued by honeſt means. If the certification was <hi>wilfully</hi> wrong, whether it was done for his own or another's emolument, he ought to ſuffer; nay, it would be inexcuſable to promote the greateſt charity on earth, by diſhoneſt means.—But it will preſently be ſeen that he acted honeſtly; and that he ſincerely believed what he certified to be true. It was an opinion which he entertained ſo early as the 30th September 1790 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>efore the loan opened, and ſo late as December 1791, after it was cloſed.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="470" facs="unknown:027132_0478_0FD3523D32635E48"/>3d. It is charged to be a "miſdemeanor as contrary to the Act of 1789." We have already diſcuſſed that point, and ſhewn that it was not contrary to that Act; but if it were, yet, if the heart was free it could he no miſdemeanor.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. Laſtly, it is ſaid to be manifeſtly to the riſk and <hi>injury</hi> of the commonwealth <hi>as he well knew.</hi> This is the point—the ſting of the accuſation. If this be true, we do not aſk his acquittal; and I haſten to ſhew he did not <hi>know or believe</hi> that he was injuring the commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>In taking a view of the defendant's conduct, I am led to notice the repreſentation that has been given of it by the gentlemen who preceded me. I acknowledge the beauty of the painting—the ſtrength of the figures and the glowing elegance of the colouring; but I cannot perceive that a likeneſs to the original has been at all regarded. It is, in truth, a fancy picture, which ſhews the ſkill of the painter; but it is not a portrait, which exhibits the juſt features of the cauſe. It may impoſe on an inattentive obſerver; but I truſt that ſo deluſive a repreſentation will have no effect on this court, to whom all the facts are diſtinctly known, and who will form their judgment from an impartial view of the whole.</p>
                     <p>That the conduct of the comptroller did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the diſhoneſt motives will appear, firſt. From its being founded on an early opinion—conceived at a time when no advantage could be derived from it—an opinion fortified by that of the moſt reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and reſulting from a thorough view of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Secondly. From all the circumſtances of the tranſaction which taken ſeperately or together evince the rectitude of his intentions.</p>
                     <p>The Senate will conſider that proof of his holding theſe opinions at a time when no private or intereſted views could poſſibly actuate him, muſt be deciſive. I will endeavor to trace the proofs of this in order of time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="471" facs="unknown:027132_0479_0FD3523E7808C9A0"/>(Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> then went into a minute examination of the evidence, and to prove the early and continued opinion of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> that New-Loans were ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he made ſeveral obſervations, 1ſt. Upon the letter of the Comptroller 30th September 1790, p. 271-2. 2d. His letter to the Governor 24th December 1791. p. 220-1. 3d. His letter to Secretary <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> 29th December 1791, p. 227. 4th. Upon the conference between him and the Secretary, p. 288. 5th. His report to the Governor 29th December 1792, p. 223-4. 6th. His plan of finance and his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thereon, p. 284.)</p>
                     <p>Being ſatisfied that theſe certificates were ſubſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could not avoid believing that they were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe theſe were in fact convertible terms. As ſoon as the Bill or Act of 1792 was publiſhed for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, he informed Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> of his opinion on this point, in which that gentleman concurred; and in a conference with Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> it was agreed by them all, that whatever certificates were ſubſcribable were alſo redeemable. Hence it follows, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> opinion of their being redeemable was not a new opinion but ſubſtantially the ſame with that which he had entertained long before, and at a time when no poſſible intereſt could influence him.</p>
                     <p>Although he perceived ſo early as the middle of March that the New-Loans would, if the bill paſſed, become redeemable, he was ſo far from deſiring to avail himſelf of the advantages it preſented, that we find him ſolicitous to prevent its paſſing into a law. He even remonſtrated againſt it to ſeveral members of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and declared that he thought the words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive enough to embrace bills of credit. But the repreſentations which he made to Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> and others were not attended to—the Act was paſſed; and the door being opened, he had as good a right to enter as any other perſon.</p>
                     <p>From that time until June, when he certified ſome of theſe certificates to be aſſumable, we have no proof
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:027132_0480_0FD352B27B273810"/>
of his opinion on this ſubject being expreſſed; but his conduct ſhews that it was firmly fixed;—ſo firmly that he riſked his property and reputation upon it. He purchaſed this ſpecies of certificates with a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſubſcribe them; nay, to ſubſcribe them under circumſtances, which made the hopes of profit <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon the ſoundneſs of his opinion;</hi> for he affected no concealment, and if he had, it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing. He knew alſo that if he was wrong in his conſtruction of the law, he would be expoſed to the loſs of character.</p>
                     <p>In July, Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> who had heard the opinion of New-Loans being ſubſcribable, circulated out of doors, conſulted the Comptroller about it. Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> avowed the opinion, and ſatisfied the Regiſter-General of its juſtneſs; and ſo fully that he did not think it neceſſary to conſult any other officer, but paſſed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and abſtracts, although he knew them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>New-Loans.</hi> He certified them to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and would have gone farther, if the warrants iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued upon them had not been ſtopped in his hands.— Why then is not the Regiſter included in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment? Becauſe it is evident that he acted from conviction of judgment. Why not extend the ſame charity to the Comptroller; for it is not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the underſtanding of the Regiſter is more cloudy or weak than that of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we find the Comptroller avowing the ſame opinion to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who found him paſſing the account of Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> which related to New-Loan certificates. His expreſſion was, "I am ſure I am right, and that it is the regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Act."</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears that long before as well as after the Act, he conſtantly avowed one unvaried opinion on this ſubject, and under circumſtances which prove that it could be no other than the reſult of a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment.</p>
                     <p>Here it will be proper to notice a few objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="473" facs="unknown:027132_0481_0FD351EF40605FE0"/>1ſt. It is ſaid, that the letter alledged to be written to the Governor on the 16th April 1792 did not include the New-Loans, and therefore that neither the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller nor Regiſter conſidered them as redeemable.— Admitting that ſuch a letter was written, which is very doubtful on the evidence, it is ſaid to have been in conſequence of the requiſition of the Governor, who deſired a calculation might be made of the quantity of ſtock neceſſary to be ſold under the Act of 1792.—The calculation that was then made could only be founded on the 2d ſection, which did not include the New-Loans. The Act of Congreſs had not then paſſed; and the ſixth ſection of the law had then no operation, and it was therefore unneceſſary to include <hi>theſe</hi> certificates in the calculation. For the ſame reaſon the Unfunded Depreciation were not included, although Meſſrs. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin, Donnaldſon</hi> and <hi>Nicholſon</hi> concurred in opinion that they would be redeemable if Congreſs ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them. Here, again, we may aſk, why do we acquit the Regiſter-General and not the Comptroller alſo?</p>
                     <p>Again: It was hinted, that whatever the language of the Act might have been, yet he knew the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Houſe, which was explained to him by Mr. <hi>Gallatin.</hi> The anſwer is, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> could only give his own opinion; the intention of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be collected from the law; the Act ſpeaks for itſelf. Nothing more need be ſaid on this point.</p>
                     <p>From this review, the inference is clear, that the defendant was fully and honeſtly of opinion, that theſe certificates were both ſubſcribable and redeemable.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid that this opinion was ſtrongly fortified by that of the moſt reſpectable characters.—It is true this is no <hi>proof</hi> of his conſtruction of the law being right; but it forms a ſtrong ground of excuſe if he was miſtaken, to ſhew that others were miſtaken with him. If it was an error, it certainly was an error which had the appearance of truth.</p>
                     <p>Among thoſe who entertained this opinion we find the Secretary of the Treaſury, whoſe diſcernment and
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:027132_0482_0FD351F0A6F2B400"/>
penetration will be doubted by no one. It was his duty to decide in the firſt inſtance upon this queſtion. He had called upon the Loan-officer for all the laws rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to it, and he afterwards declared to him, "That the holders of the New-Loans have a right to ſubſcribe them; that he might endeavour to perſuade them to re-exchange their certificates, but if they perſiſted that he could not refuſe them." He intimates the ſame opinion to the Governor in his letter, 21ſt December 1791, and the conference with the Comptroller was founded upon it. At this time, it is evident, he muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Act of 1789, though he does not recollect that it was before him; and if he afterwards diſtruſted his former opinion, he explained it by adding, that it did not occur to him that the Act of 1789 was paſſed after the ratification of the Federal Conſtitution.—But the queſtion is, What was the Secretary's opinion at the time he had the conference with the Comptroller, not, what it appears to be at preſent?</p>
                     <p>The Commiſſioner of Loans entertained the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their ſubſcribability; ſo did Mr. <hi>Wolcot,</hi> as may be fairly inferred from his letter. The Governor alſo is officially apprized of the ſame opinion, and tho' he does not expreſs his concurrence, yet his conduct was founded on a belief that the Comptroller was right in his conſtruction of the law. Indeed it ſeemed ſo obvious a conſtruction, that few who examined the Act, doubted it. Almoſt all, whom he converſed with, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him. Mr <hi>Evans</hi> was convinced of the ſoundneſs of the opinion, and determined to adventure in a purchaſe of theſe certificates. Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> was convinced, though not <hi>deluded.</hi> Of the ſame opinion were Mr. <hi>Boggs,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Rittenhouſe,</hi> Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> and others. The laſt mentioned gentleman examined the Act which Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> ſhewed to him in the Council-chamber, and he was ſo fully ſatisfied, that he received the amount of his certificates from Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> who advanced the money, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate him.—Why then ſhould it be deemed cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:027132_0483_0FD3520F19AC3C30"/>
in the Comptroller to yield his aſſent to what convinced ſo many?</p>
                     <p>Second. The honeſty of his intentions appears from all the circumſtances of the tranſaction.—If he had been conſcious of any unjuſtifiable views he would have attempted concealment; but his conduct was open and fair. He concealed nothing but what was proper to be concealed; and as ſoon as the ſubſcription was made he was careleſs who knew it.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it appears that he made the loan, and ſubſcribed in his <hi>own name.</hi> It would have been eaſy to have uſed another's, and to have concealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the name of a friend. Again: He inſerted certificates in his abſtract, which muſt have diſcovered to the Regiſter-General and others, that they were New-Loans.—Thirdly. He did not attempt to hurry it through the offices. It lay there the uſual time and went through the uſual train of buſineſs.—Beſides, he knew that the ſubſcription of New-Loans muſt be known not only to all the officers of the Treaſury of the United States, but alſo to the ſtate, when an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement for delivering up the Continental certificates became neceſſary. He alſo certified the abſtracts of others, who had no motives for concealment and would no doubt mention the tranſaction. In this caſe, if his conſtruction of the law was not tenable, he would be obliged to refund. The clumſy fraud, if it had been a fraud, could not fail of being detected, and if it were detected, his hopes would be blown up, and muſt have proved fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>To the inſinuation that all this was done for the purpoſe of getting money into his hands <hi>for a time,</hi> which he could not finally keep, I have nothing to ſay. His circumſtances were not ſo miſerably dependant as to make this pitiful ſcheme poſſible.—In ſhort, he muſt have been deſtitute of common ſenſe if he had acted thus openly and incautiouſly, without a perfect convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he was legally as well as morally right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="476" facs="unknown:027132_0484_0FD352471F95E830"/>I ſhall now diſmiſs the firſt and ſecond articles, and proceed briefly to examine the third and fourth.</p>
                     <p>I conſider the third article as a mere ſtatement of evidence, and if the two former articles cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, neither can <hi>this,</hi> which is urged to prove his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt views and his endeavours to avoid diſcovery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For this purpoſe it is charged, 1. That he did not conſult the Regiſter. To this the anſwer is plain, that no law obliged him to conſult that officer; and why ſhould he have conſulted him when he had no doubts on the ſubject? Beſides, it was unneceſſary; for ſoon after the law paſſed, he and the Regiſter ſettled the principle, that whatever was ſubſcribable was redeemable.—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: It is ſaid, 2. That "he did not conſult the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor;" and to this it has been replied, that the law directs him to conſult the Governor only in thoſe caſes where the officers differ in opinion. It may be added that he did in fact appriſe the Governor of it when he informed him that the New-Loans were a ſubſcribable debt.—It is charged, 3. "That he did not <hi>diſcriminate</hi> in his certification nor in his accounts," &amp;c. As to this certification to the Loan-officer, it was not an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial act, and the ſtate has nothing to do with the form of it; and as to the account raiſed and tranſmitted to the Governor, it is a deciſive anſwer that they were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the manner which had been ſettled in April 1791. Theſe accounts <hi>originated</hi> in the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's office and were ſent up to the Comptroller mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for concurrence. Yet the purity of the Regiſter's views is not impeached, nor is <hi>he</hi> included in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, the abſurdity of the charge is evident, for this conduct could not have been adopted for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or avoiding detection, becauſe the ſpecies or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates contained in the abſtracts were diſcoverable from the abſtracts themſelves: 1. By the different dates of intereſt. And, 2. By the reduction of the principal ſum, which took place in no other ſtate certificates.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="477" facs="unknown:027132_0485_0FD352B48B1EA248"/>Laſtly, it is ſaid that the checks of office were thereby deſtroyed. What checks are there pointed out by law or former uſage, which have not been obſerved? There are none; and the Regiſter-General, even after he was informed that the abſtracts comprehended New-Loans, purſued the ſame method as before. There are no grounds for this flimſy charge, which ſeems to be thrown in merely to ſwell the account! (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> made ſome further obſervations on the evidence, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the fourth article.)</p>
                     <p>The fourth article depends upon the third—"In the <hi>above</hi> deluſive manner," &amp;c.—It is but another mode of ſtating the ſame thing.—If he be acquitted of the third charge, he cannot be convicted of this.—The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle goes on and ſays, that "he certified that the New-Loans were redeemable and payable." He had a <hi>right</hi> to do ſo, if by law they were redeemable—he is <hi>excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> in doing ſo, if he really thought them to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—As to the funds, the Act of 1792 is not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to, but that of April 1791. (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then made ſome obſervations on this Act to ſhew that this fund for claims might be applied to the redemption of the New-Loans.) There was no other fund than this for the redemption of the Unfunded Depreciation. Yet the Governor did not ſcruple to iſſue warrants for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe, though it was evident from the amount of the intereſt ſtated in the accounts that it could ariſe from that ſpecies of certificates only.</p>
                     <p>Here again I may be permitted to aſk, why is not the Regiſter-General included in the accuſation, ſince he joined in this certification to the Governor as well as the defendant? Since both acted alike, why this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination? I am perſuaded that both are equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
                     <p>But I quit this article, which is of no importance if the defendant ſhould be convicted of the other charges —and if he is acquitted of them, he cannot be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this.—They depend one upon the other, in a manner that reminds us of the Indian philoſophy. The
<pb n="478" facs="unknown:027132_0486_0FD351F2CDBF68C0"/>
world, ſaid the <hi>Bramins,</hi> reſts upon the back of a great elephant—the elephant on the back of a huge tortoiſe— and the tortoiſe on—they did not know what. So the fourth article ſtands on the back of the third—the third on the ſecond—the ſecond on the firſt—and the firſt on —nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>We now come to charges of a different nature from thoſe which have hitherto paſſed in review before us. The fifth and ſixth articles are, however, ſubſtantially the ſame, and charge the defendant with availing himſelf of certain official advantages for the purpoſe of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating in certificates. To the firſt of theſe we might have ſafely demurred, and admitting the fact, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on the law that it is not impeachable. But this would have heen uſeleſs, ſince the Senate being judges both of law and fact, will acquit the defendant, unleſs the facts proved are the proper ſubject of <hi>legal</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                     <p>Permit me to remind the Senate that impeachments muſt be founded on the breaches of exiſting laws. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence may be ſhewn to the <hi>form,</hi> but none to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the charge: And an impeachment cannot make that criminal here which would not be ſo before the ordinary tribunals of juſtice. (Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> here quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4 <hi>Black.</hi> Com. 256.2. <hi>H. P. C.</hi> 250, and <hi>Woodiſon's</hi> lectures.) Indeed the learned gentlemen, although one of them talks of "doing ſubſtantial juſtice," will not openly contend that any thing is impeachable which is not abſolutely illegal.</p>
                     <p>This honorable body therefore will recollect that they are not <hi>now</hi> to judge by the rules of expediency. That is the province of a Legiſlature not of a Court. Some things are lawful which many may think inexpedient; but while the citizen only exerciſes his rights, he is amenable only to the tribunal of public opinion. True liberty conſiſts in being always permitted to do that which the <hi>laws</hi> do not forbid; and a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has been well defined to be a government of laws and not of men. We are, therefore, not to diſcuſs
<pb n="479" facs="unknown:027132_0487_0FD352B5B79C7728"/>
in this place the <hi>propriety</hi> or <hi>impropriety</hi> of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's conduct; but its <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſs.</hi> We are not to enquire whether in any inſtance he has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtepped the extreme delicacy of official conduct, but whether he hath overleaped the mounds of the law. Delicacy is one thing, crime is another; and we judge by very different rules reſpecting them. To mark the preciſe limits of the <hi>proper</hi> and the <hi>improper</hi> is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of criticiſm and taſte; and the deciſion will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our education, habits, feelings and temper. —But the law is the only ſtandard by which we can meaſure the conduct of a citizen criminally accuſed.</p>
                     <p>There are men of ſo ſoft a contexture, that far from inſiſting on their rights, they make the expedient the rule of their conduct. They will not even eat meat, if thereby they ſhould offend a weaker brother. They ſhrink like a ſenſitive plant from the touch of cenſure —and their minds are accuſtomed to take the varying hue of public opinion. But men of more republican firmneſs will ſtand on their rights. They will judge for themſelves of the proper and improper; and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with confidence on the concluſions of their own minds, they are ſatisfied if they find the laws do not prohibit their conduct.—Judging therefore by theſe principles, the defendant muſt be acquitted; for what law made it unlawful for him to purchaſe certificates in the manner this article ſtates?—Whether ſuch official advantages ſhall be allowed or not, is a matter of <hi>poſitive</hi> regulation. Some ſtates allow their officers to ſpeculate in articles, in which their official ſituation gives them manifeſt advantages: Some forbid them; and the general government prohibits it more generally than the ſtates. Thus in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> the auctioneers were allowed to purchaſe at their own auctions until l783, when it was forbidden. The officers of the Cuſtoms by the laws of the ſtate mght have traded; by thoſe of the United States they cannot. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury and even the clerks in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice cannot ſpeculate in certificate; but in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:027132_0488_0FD352B9AB4D1158"/>
of our Treaſury it is different. So the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of our Land-office may deal with great advantage in land; and it is clearly lawful becauſe no Act forbids it.—If the conduct of any officer is in the opinion of the Executive manifeſtly improper though not illegal, the remedy is by removal not by impeachment.</p>
                     <p>But in the caſe before us there were no official advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that deſerve any conſideration. He could have bought theſe certificates as conveniently at a brokers as from thoſe who came to the office; and a ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance would have poured them into his hands. He is charged with purchaſing them of <hi>many;</hi> but only two inſtances of ſuch purchaſes are proved; that from <hi>Oldden</hi> and that from <hi>Biddle.</hi> If this be criminal, by what Act is it made ſo?—He has broken no law of the ſtate, and therefore no guilt is imputable to him.</p>
                     <p>We now proceed to the ſixth article, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the fifth new-vamped. It charges the ſame facts but ſuppoſes that the certificates bought were really <hi>the property of the ſtate.</hi> This legal poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wholly unfounded. Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> ſtated the offer to exchange as an executed contract—and as a complete transfer of the certificates to the ſtate, before an <hi>actual</hi> exchange took place. But his reaſoning on this point is fallacious. The certificates were lodged merely for examination, and the indents, required to complete the exchange, were not offered. How then could they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the property of the commonwealth?</p>
                     <p>Let us bring this point to the touch-ſtone of the law. Could the ſtate have ſued Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> for the indents? No, for an <hi>option</hi> is given him only on condition of his payment of the indents. The Act of 1789 permits, but does not compel an exchange. Again: Could <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> or <hi>Oldden</hi> have maintained a ſuit againſt the ſtate for the Continental certificates without an actual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the indents? Surely not; for it is ſettled, that where two concurrent acts are to be done at the ſame time, one party muſt do all that on his part is to be done before he can maintain a ſuit againſt the other.—
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:027132_0489_0FD352BBEED5D288"/>
The property therefore remained as before. The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who lodged them, might have wreſted them from the Comptroller in an action of trover; and they would have been liable in his hands, to the debts of the individual.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, it was the uninterrupted practice to re-deliver them, if required, after they had been lodged in the office. In proof of this we have the caſes of <hi>Thomas Hale</hi> in 1791, <hi>Danniel Stroud</hi> in 1793 and Col. <hi>Porter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the gentlemen be right in their law, all theſe perſons were plundering the commonwealth, becauſe they took back their certificates—and yet they do not ſeem conſcious of any impropriety! But really this refinement on the charges is unworthy of a ſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution!</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid "that if the Comptroller delivered back theſe certificates to thoſe who lodged them, he was guilty of perfidy." Well Sir! the Comptroller offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally informed the Governor that <hi>S. Mark</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his certificates and parted with them to others. Here is an avowal of "this perfidy" to the Executive Magiſtrate who is ſo far from diſmiſſing or puniſhing the Comptroller that he does not expreſs any ſurprize at the information. If this be a crime you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the defendant without involving the Governor in a degree of the ſame guilt.</p>
                     <p>There being, therefore, no ground to ſay that certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in that ſituation were the <hi>property of the ſtate,</hi> it follows that the 6th article does not differ from the fifth.</p>
                     <p>But we are told that reſponſibility of officers is the great ſecurity of Republics. Sir, there is a reſponſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of character and a reſponſibility of puniſhment. The former we will anſwer in another place; the latter ariſes only from a breach of the laws. Shew us then the Act of Aſſembly that we have broken; if there be none, ſhew us at leaſt ſome adjudged caſe which makes ſuch kind of dealing a crime. If there be ſuch a caſe, it will ſweep like the ſcythe of time; it will cut down
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:027132_0490_0FD352BD40ADACF0"/>
great and ſmall, and many fair and unblemiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters will come within its reach and may be brought before this honorable court.</p>
                     <p>If there be circumſtances here that require further diſcuſſion they ſhould be diſcuſſed elſewhere. I wave any further enquiry—for the Senate cannot decide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                     <p>I haſten to the <hi>laſt</hi> article—and rejoice that at length I ſee land. The amount of this is, that he plundered the ſtate—that he filched from the maſs of public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty a certain certificate which had been exchanged with the commonwealth. If this be true, he muſt be a wretch indeed! he would not deſerve the honor of an impeachment. Such a charge brought againſt <hi>any</hi> man ought to be well ſupported; but brought againſt a man of unblemiſhed character, the proof ought to be ſtrong indeed. It ought to be ſupported by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of witneſſes, or at the leaſt, by the lucid teſtimony of one man ſpeaking poſitively to the fact, on whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and recollection the firmeſt reliance might be placed. But what is the number of witneſſes againſt the defendant?—One. What the impreſſions on his memory? They reſemble the traces on the ſand of the ſea-ſhore.</p>
                     <p>The charge is, That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> exchanged this certificate with the ſtate,—and as it was afterwards ſubſcribed by the defendant—the inference is that he embezzled it.—It muſt therefore be firſt proved ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan did exchange it.</hi> Let us examine this.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that he had ſuch a certificate ſo late as September 1790;—and it is certain that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> had it in July 1792. He ſays he did not <hi>ſell</hi> it to <hi>Nicholſon;</hi> but whether he exchanged it or not he cannot tell, for he ſold to others. Such certificates as were unſold he carried to the Comptroller to be exchanged. When the witneſs cannot ſwear that he delivered the certificate in queſtion to the defendant, can you, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:027132_0491_0FD327FE5C335858"/>
upon your oaths ſay that he did? Here is not the ſhadow even of preſumptive proof!</p>
                     <p>Even in the caſe of a miſerable felon indicted for larceny, it muſt be firſt proved that a larceny was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, before he ſhall be put to make any defence. If the owner ſhould ſay, I cannot ſay it was ſtolen—" I had ſuch articles"—"I ſold to others."—The candor, of the Attorney-General would induce him to direct an acquittal. Principles eſtabliſhed for the ſafety of all muſt not be violated. They require proof in this caſe as well as in that juſt ſtated: but Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> cannot recollect what became of the certificate in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid altho' the evidence is not very perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yet it is ſufficient to oblige the defendant to ſhow how he came by it. No! <hi>They</hi> aver the fact. They cannot ſtir a ſtep till they have proved the exchange: But if any fact can be diſtinctly ſeen thro' the thick miſt—the palpable obſcurity which the teſtimony of this witneſs has ſhed upon the tranſaction, I am ſure it is not the fact required. The witneſs will not ſwear that.</p>
                     <p>But it is urged "That if Mr. <hi>Nicholſon bought</hi> this certificate, it is capable of proof." Indeed! then if Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan exchanged</hi> it, it is alſo capable of proof. "But the latter kept no account of his certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates!" and what proof have we that the former did. Why, it is ſaid, he is a regular man—he keeps a diary! I appeal to you gentlemen if that was fairly urged; ſince we offered to produce it and they would not ſuffer it to be read. But that was a diary of his official, not of his private, tranſactions. It commenced in March 1792. How then could it aſſiſt us in tracing a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſubſcribed to the loan which cloſed in 1791?</p>
                     <p>Again it is ſaid, "If the perſon exiſts upon earth who ſold it to the defendant he may be produced." At preſent it is ſufficient to aſk, What if he does not exiſt upon earth? Who can keep his witneſſes alive? In what a terrible ſituation would many be if ſuch modes of proof are to prevail. Thouſands would be unable
<pb n="484" facs="unknown:027132_0492_0FD351F509547550"/>
to trace the certificates they honeſtly bought. They paſs from hand to hand. Often no note made of the ſeller's name or of the purchaſe. In ſuch caſe your own oath will not be received; and a purchaſe of this kind will be incapable of proof.</p>
                     <p>The danger of obliging a defendant to produce ſuch proof even when there are ſtrong preſumptions againſt him is conſiderable. What would Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> have done, had <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> been dead?</p>
                     <p>Once more it is ſaid that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> delivered him <hi>many</hi> certificates. We anſwer that we <hi>bought</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The anſwer is equal to the proof.—Laſtly, it was ſaid, "What other proof could be produced?" I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that they ought clearly and poſitively to prove the exchange or to forbear the charge. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty in making ſuch proof if ſuch were the fact.</p>
                     <p>This is a ſufficient anſwer <hi>at preſent.</hi> The time may come when this matter ſhall be fully underſtood. Here, in a criminal proſecution, it would not be proper for him to anſwer upon oath; but in the civil ſuit, he will ſubmit to interrogatories. They may prove his heart to the bottom and I truſt they will find it honeſt.</p>
                     <p>But what is the manner in which the teſtimony on this article has been taken?—The longer I live the more I perceive the neceſſity and advantage of <hi>viva voce</hi> teſtimony in criminal proſecutions.—Had the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs been examined openly before you, the doubt or the certainty with which he ſpoke would have evidently appeared. But when his anſwers are reduced to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they appear to the beſt advantage, and we can only judge from the expreſſion. Yet even this exhibits a recollection feeble and uncertain. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> is known to be a man of the moſt perfect integrity and uprightneſs. He will not ſwear what he does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; and in his examination the burden of the ſong is, <hi>I cannot recollect</hi>—I cannot tell." (Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then read the anſwers to ſhew how very frequently theſe expreſſions occurred.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="485" facs="unknown:027132_0493_0FD351FAD3C06580"/>Can we then be ſure, even when he ſtates a fact, that he has not forgotten all the circumſtances attending it which ſerve to explain or qualify it? If every queſtion that leads to an explanation is anſwered with, "I cannot tell," or refuſed to be anſwered at all, what can we rely on? All that we can be ſure of is, that he carried a bundle of certificates to the Comptroller's office and left them with him, even without counting them, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he ſays, the moſt unbounded confidence in Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> integrity. That the certificate in queſtion was one of them, we have not the ſhadow of proof.— Shall the defendant then be convicted on ſuch flimſy evidence—the imperfect teſtimony of an unrecollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individual? There is no <hi>proof</hi> of the exchange— there is not even a probability—there is a bare poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Even that poſſibility is anſwered by our produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſtracts of the certificates exchanged by Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan.</hi> In theſe, the certificate in queſtion does not appear.—We might therefore venture to ſay that it is not poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Againſt ſuch evidence a ſimple denial of the charge is enough; but when it is aided by a fair fame and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right character, formed by a life of unblemiſhed inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, every ſuſpicion vaniſhes.</p>
                     <p>When I ſpeak of character, I mean the reputation he enjoyed before the jealouſies and cruel ſuſpicions which the manner of conducting this buſineſs has excited againſt him, exiſted. Theſe however will not injure him here. We call no witneſſes to prove his character becauſe it is well known. I appeal then to you, gentlemen, who have perſonally <hi>known</hi> him—to you who have known him <hi>long</hi>—to you who have known him <hi>intimately</hi>— who have looked as it were into his boſom and ſeen the bottom of his heart—I aſk you, if ye have not always found him an upright citizen—an honeſt man! Put this into the ſcale againſt that which is charged with the the accuſation—and ye will find that the proof againſt him is as duſt upon the balance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="486" facs="unknown:027132_0494_0FD352C10AED39D8"/>Here then let us pauſe; and from this point as from the eminence of truth, look back upon the field over which we have travelled. Where are the traces of this <hi>"fraud,</hi> diſhonour and perfidy," which have been ſo freely charged? Where are the "ſpoils of his country" with which he has been loaded? Where do we perceive the arts, the tricks, the deceit, the undue concealment of which we have heard? Where is the <hi>peculation</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Where the <hi>deluſions</hi> by which he accompliſhed it? I ſee them not; they exiſt only in the creative imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſpeaker (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> not in the evidence. I ſee a conduct open, but firm, and founded on the baſis of the law. I ſee an honeſt mind acting from convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment: I ſee him exerciſing the rights of an independant citizen, and finally facing this accuſation with that intrepidity which is the characteriſtic of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
                     <p>We rely therefore with confidence upon your juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:—that we ſhall be judged, not by opinion but by the law and the teſtimony; not by reports circulated out of doors, but by the teſtimony given here in court.</p>
                     <p>We feel not the weight of the accuſation; but we cannot be inſenſible to that of our accuſers.—The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the Repreſentatives of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but inſpire prejudice. To prevent the effects of that prejudice, the Conſtitution contemplated this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Court, and placed the accuſed ſafe under the independence and magnanimity of this high tribunal; a tribunal, ſuppoſed to be ſuperior to that awe which the moſt numerous and influential branch of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature might otherwiſe inſpire.</p>
                     <p>As this is the firſt impeachment, we are now to make an experiment intereſting to republican government. We are to ſee if the citizen is as ſafe here as before the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tribunals of juſtice. It is to decide, whether one order of the repreſentatives may ſafely be the judge when the other is the accuſer; and whether under any circumſtances it be adviſable to depart from a trial by a jury of our peers.—As for us, <hi>we</hi> have no doubt but
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:027132_0495_0FD352C33A399FD8"/>
that this Judicial authority is ſafely depoſited. We have no doubt but you will weigh with caution and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with firmneſs—that your ears will be open to the voice of truth but deaf to the clamours of ſuſpicion. So doing, Mr. Speaker, may you and this honorable Court receive that beſt of all rewards, the approbation of your own conſciences. Adjourned.</p>

The ſaid <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> on his ſolemn oath depoſeth and ſaith, That in the month of February in the year of our Lord one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-one, this deponent being then in the city of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> did apply to <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> with New-Loan certificates for the ſums expreſſed and mentioned in the firſt interrogatory, among others in order to have them funded in ſtock of the United States. The whole amount of which New-Loan certificates was 1237l. 16s. 10d. as the buſineſs could not be tranſacted at the commiſſioner of Loan's office for the State of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> before the firſt day of April then following, as this deponent had been informed by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> the commiſſioner of Loans, and expreſſing ſome uneaſineſs at the delay and expence he would neceſſarily be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to on that account, requeſted that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> would be ſo obliging as to take the management of the buſineſs in his behalf upon himſelf (he being a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in whom this deponent had particular confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and who had on former occaſions been friendly to him in aſſiſting and expediting him in his buſineſs) giving the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> power to commute the ſaid certificates for ſuch <hi>ſum</hi> or ſums as he would be entitled to in ſtock of the United States, and in ſuch manner as the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> might judge to be this deponent's beſt advantage.</p>

                              <hi>Inter.</hi> 2. If ſo, did you, or did you not agree to this propoſition and thereupon deliver to ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> your certificates of New-Loans as aforeſaid, and did you or not, then take the private obligation of ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to do as he had propoſed—and if ſo, what became of ſaid obligation?</p>

The ſaid obligation was always conſidered by this deponent as a private undertaking by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> and not as given in an official capacity.</p>

He the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> had replied, that he believed the papers or certificates were in his poſſeſſion, but that he was then engaged and had not time to make ſearch or examine for them. Upon which this deponent ſaid he did not want to lift the ſaid certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates,
<pb n="491" facs="unknown:027132_0499_0FD35351B801DC30"/>
ſo obtained for him as aforeſaid at that time or words to that effect, provided he could draw the intereſt due on them; upon which Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> gave this deponent a writing or check for that purpoſe on the bank, and upon this deponent's preſenting the ſame to the caſhier of the ſaid bank—he thinks to a Mr. <hi>Shields,</hi> he this deponent was informed by him that there was one year's intereſt due and deſired this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſubſcribe his name on the books for the receipt thereof, and upon ſo doing this deponent was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paid the ſum of one hundred and forty-eight dollars and fifty-three cents on that account, which he underſtood and was informed was in full of one year's intereſt. The ſaid funded certificates being left by this deponent and ſtill remaining in the care and cuſtody of the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> until the twentieth day of January, A.

D. 1794, again returned to the city, at requeſt of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> expecting to be examined upon the ſubject of the trial. That on the 20th of the ſame month, he, this deponent received from the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> three certificates which had hitherto, and by this deponent's conſent, remained in his care and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody. One certificate being for 2181 dollars thirty cents, dated October 3, 1791, and bearing intereſt from the firſt day of January, 1791, at the rate of 6 per cent. &amp;c.—one of ſame date for the ſum of 1090 dollars 65 cents, bearing intereſt at the rate of ſix per cent. from

D. 1791, all ſubſcribed by <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Commiſſioner loans. That the ſaid certificates were delivered to this deponent by the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> without any demand or requeſt made to him for that purpoſe, and had been all loaned in this deponent <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> name, and this deponent was informed by the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> at the time of his delivering up the ſaid certificates to him, that there was a balance due to this deponent, which he would pay him in a few days. That in the courſe of the ſame week this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent thinks he was paid by the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> the ſum of two hundred and ſeventy-ſix dollars in bank notes and ſpecie, being the balance due to this deponent as he was informed for a deficiency of ſtock which had not been transferred to him.</p>

The certificates received by this deponent from Mr. <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> are ſeverally in his this deponent's name for the ſeveral ſums mentioned in his anſwer given to the fourth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory on the part of <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> (and herewith tranſmitted) and reſpectively numbered 1017 State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and for this deponent's uſe as he has regularly received the intereſt thereon when demanded.</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. This deponent after having depoſited the New-Loan certificates of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> with <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> as an agent and obliging acquaintance, and not in his official ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as Comptroller, did not then or at any ſubſequent time purchaſe the Continental certificates originally loaned by him to this ſtate, or become any way proprietor of the ſame. This deponent, on the contrary, was obliged to diſpoſe of £.1300 out of, or being part of an original certificate for the ſum of £.1969:8:2 iſſued in his name, for ſervices rendered the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as pack-horſe-maſter, by Major <hi>Story,</hi> Commiſſioner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſettling and adjuſting ſuch claims. And which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate with ſome others this deponent's property was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted for New-Loan certificates of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> the ſaid ſale having been occaſioned by the embarraſſed ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this deponent.</p>

When you took your New-Loan certificates to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to be re-exchanged for Continental certificates, did you receive the Continental certificates from him, and then deliver them to him to be ſubſcribed in your name and for your uſe, as equivalent for the New-Loans depoſited with him, or did you before the receipt of the Continental certificates, and immediately after you depoſited the New-Loans requeſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to take the Continental certificates and ſubſcribe them on your behalf to the loan of the United States?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ</hi> 4. This deponent ſays that in the year A. D, 1786, he thinks he exchanged the Continental certificates his property for New-Loan certificates of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and that he occaſionally drew intereſt which became due thereon, and that the ſaid certificates were in his this deponent's own care

and charge until the month of February, A. D. 1791, when they were left with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> in manner mentioned in his anſwer to interrogatory firſt, on the part of the ſaid <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon.</hi> In order to have the ſame funded on the beſt terms in the ſtock of the United States for this deponent's uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 5. Did you re-exchange any New-Loan certificates for any of your original Continental certificates, or did you commute all your New-Loans with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> for funded ſtock of the United States?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 5. This deponent ſays he made no ſuch re-exchange; that he left his certificates as before mentioned with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> for the purpoſe of being funded in ſtock of the United States. That this deponent received the firſt year's intereſt on ſaid ſtock on the 10th of April, A. D. 1792 on Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> order in this deponent's favour, as before mentioned; but that he had not then or previous to his receiving the ſaid certificates ſo funded in ſtock of the United States, ſeen the ſaid certificates ſo obtained in lieu of his ſaid New-Loan certificates, but had underſtood they were iſſued in his name. But this deponent further ſaith that he had not at any time previous to the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth day of January laſt paſt, when they were returned to him. So for as this deponent can recollect, requeſted or deſired the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> to let him ſee the ſaid certificates or to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him any particular account touching the exchange of them, or his management or agency therein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 6. If you anſwer affirmatively to the firſt and ſecond of the defendant's interrogatories, relate why the Continental certificates ſo depoſited on loan were ſubſcribed by Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to the loan of the United States on your account?</p>

                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 6. This deponent ſays, that the anſwer to this queſtion is given in his reply to interrogatory firſt on the part of the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 7. Had you any other tranſaction with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> either in exchanging or commuting certificates of any deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion except that of commuting your New-Loans for funded debt of the United States? If yea, pleaſe to relate the ſame ſo far as ſuch tranſactions reſpect the ſaid New-Loans, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> paid you therefor?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 7. This deponent does not recollect having any other tranſaction with the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> in exchanging or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting of certificates than before mentioned, except the loaning of three certificates, one in the name of <hi>James Reynolds</hi> for the ſum of £. 12:15:2; one in the name of <hi>John Briſby</hi> for the ſum of £.4:4:6 and one other in the name of <hi>James Smith</hi> for the ſum of £.4:19:6 in the New-Loans, for their ſeveral uſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with this deponent, and for which he holds himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
<pb n="496" facs="unknown:027132_0504_0FD328216C3BDA40"/>
to them or their repreſentatives, further than that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> at this deponent's requeſt, gave him two certificates one for £. 1300; the other for £. 669:8:2 in lieu of a New-Loan certificate in his name for £. 1969:8:2, and which this deponent forthwith returned to the ſaid <hi>Nicholſon</hi> upon receiving the ſaid two loan certificates equal in amount to the loan certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate by him returned as aforeſaid—and this deponent ſays that his reaſon for requeſting the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> as Comptroller, to divide the ſaid certificate, was to enable this deponent to make ſale of the certificates for £. 1300, in order to enable this depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to diſcharge debts due by him. And that this tranſaction of iſſuing and granting the two certificates equal in amount to the one returned, was in the month of September in the year 1790, as near as this deponent can recollect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Inter.</hi> 8. Do you know any thing further that may be materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the commonwealth or the defendant? If yea relate the ſame fully and at large as if particularly interrogated thereto?</p>

againſt the Comptroller-General of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> This cauſe is very important in itſelf, from the nature of the charges, the high authority of the tribunal, and the intereſt of the party.

The Senate in caſes of conviction is therefore in ſome degree veſted with a diſcretionary power to puniſh. The ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has certain limits which cannot be paſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but within the extremities of it are certain diſcretion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary powers.

In the firſt place he can be removed from office; in the next place; if it it is deemed proper, he may be rendered incapable to hold any office of profit or truſt during life.

I will however endeavour to touch on the merits of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts, and will confine myſelf to thoſe points moſt eſſentially connected with the proſecution.</p>
                     <p>The two firſt articles can be conſidered in one point of view; the ſeveral Acts of Congreſs and Aſſembly to which each of theſe articles refers, makes it proper to claſs them together, as the obſervations and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will bring them into one point of view at the ſame time <hi>(He then read the ſubſtance of the two firſt articles.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the facts contained in theſe two articles, they are plainly proved, or openly acknowledged and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It appears from an inſpection of all the abſtracts except his own large one, that they are certified to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and <hi>aſſumable</hi> in the hand writing of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General. It hath been remarked on by every gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man engaged as counſel for the defendant, but not much relied on, that his own abſtract was not certified <hi>genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable;</hi> I am clearly of opinion, that it need not be much relied on; for if one ſingle inſtance can be proved, in which he criminally certified New-loan certificates to be <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,</hi> it is ſufficient to ſupport the charges.</p>
                     <p>They ſay he certified none of his own abſtracts. When the circumſtances come to be conſidered, all his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts are in his own hand-writing, and contain all the information to the Commiſſioner of Loans that he could deſire. Advert to the two firſt articles, he is not charged that he certified on the face of the abſtracts; but he is charged with recognizing, certifying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring New-Loans <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,</hi> If there is any ſpecies of common law proof, that he certified to the Commiſſioner of Loans, it is ſufficient to ſupport the charges; then why will it not appear as well from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts being made out in his own hand-writing. He was early called upon by <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Loans, for checks to prevent counterfeits and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:027132_0508_0FD352E803A77C60"/>
Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſends two certificates to him (ſee letters page 271-2.) What can be more ſatisfactorily proven, than that the commiſſioner of Loans thought them aſſumable, when the abſtracts appeared in his own hand-writing?</p>
                     <p>With regard to the certification to the Governor (ſee letter, page 356) it was certainly official. This will not be diſputed here as it hath been elſewhere, where they contend that he certified as <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> and not as Comptroller-General. If neither the laws of the Union, or of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> enjoined it on him, this is a very ſingular and ſtrange doctrine indeed!</p>
                     <p>In thus certifying it is very true, that he acted in his official capacity. Nineteen twentieths of the agency of the public officers ace not preſcribed by law, ſo in the departments of the Land-office, Finance or any others, there are various inſtances in all of them to be diſcovered, which are not particularly mentioned in the laws; the Acts generally point out only the outlines of the different offices. To act contrary to the courſe of the offices, or to deviſe ways and means in oppoſition to the rotine of the offices, are offences againſt theſe Acts, equally obvious as if ſpecially and expreſsly pointed out by law.</p>
                     <p>Independently, therefore, the Comptroller-General could not act in any other than in his official character. The commonwealth of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in that Act; ſhe wiſhed to act fairly and ſecurely with the United States. If the law is not expreſſive enough, ſhall nothing be done? Every officer was to act according to the duties of his reſpective department and when called upon to act with zeal in his official ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                     <p>We therefore find <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> deeply intereſted in the due execution of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, which made redeemable the debts which were ſubſcribable. It was of great conſequence to <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> that none ſhould be improperly ſubſcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="501" facs="unknown:027132_0509_0FD352ED7B8B06D8"/>How can the Comptroller-General deny his official agency? That officer and the Regiſter-General, in their joint communication to the Governor (ſee letter, page 217, 218) are concluſive on this head, wherein they point out the mode of conducting this buſineſs with the Commiſſioner of Loans: <hi>"Examine the ſame as to their being genuine certificates and aſſumable,"</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>How then can the Comptroller-General ſay, that he was not acting in his official department?</p>
                     <p>I now come to the conſideration of the queſtion, whether the New-Loans were ſubſcribable as State debts to the loan opened by the Act of Congreſs of the 4th of Auguſt 1790. It hath ever been impreſſed on my mind, that independent of the Act of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> of the 27th March 1789, New-Loans were not ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the loan of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>After the adoption of the preſent Conſtitution, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs found herſelf eaſy in her ſituation and perfectly competent to the ſatisfying all her domeſtic debt; and then contemplated the ſituation of the different ſtates; among them ſhe ſaw a number of individuals labouring under debts created by the war; ſhe contemplated the taking of ſuch, as in the firſt inſtance, the United States were not ſubject to be called upon, nor liable to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on them. This was the motive the General Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had for opening the loan.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen have mentioned the deſcription of <hi>State Debts</hi> receivable in this loan, and then aſk if the New-Loans are not comprehended under this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! It is true they are, but thoſe are not the only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſites; for in the ſame ſection we find, they muſt be <hi>iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies:</hi> Theſe were the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential requiſites, and the New-Loans <hi>being only grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others,</hi> they could not be within the meaning of the Act.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſuppoſe for a moment that the New-Loans were receivable, what would be the effect? <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> was to have the benefit of ſubſcribing 2,200,000 dollars; nay, let us ſuppoſe twice the ſum if you pleaſe,
<pb n="502" facs="unknown:027132_0510_0FD352EF1D59EE68"/>
for there was then near twice the ſum out, the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New-Loans would exclude the proper State debt of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> This would burthen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which the law was deſigned to aſſiſt. How would <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> be caſed then? Her condition would not be meliorated, for New-Loans are in effect no more than Continental certificates, only in another name.</p>
                     <p>The 18th ſection of the law of Congreſs was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced not to invite the New-Loan holders to ſubſcribe, but from an apprehenſion that they would be offered, and to guard againſt the conſequences. This clauſe (18th ſection) hath been, and I ſuppoſe will again be urged, that theſe New-Loan certificates will be received. They might by poſſibility, or by miſtake be ſubſcribed, but then all intereſt is to ceaſe until the Continental certificates be delivered up. Can it be ſuppoſed that Congreſs would aſſume them, when double intereſt might have been paid on the ſame ſum?</p>
                     <p>New-Loans were never a money debt of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> neither were they ſubſcribable or redeemable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her laws. The conſideration of this part leads me to think that Congreſs never meant to include them in the aſſumption.</p>
                     <p>But a more important queſtion ariſes, that is, Can they be contemplated as ſubſcribable after the paſſing of the Act of 1789?</p>
                     <p>I apprehend New-Loans were never a money debt to be paid on or before the year 1796. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Act of 1786.</p>
                     <p>The New-Loan was a certificate of a contract or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between the commonwealth and the public creditors, her citizens. The intent of which was that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> engaged to pay the intereſt half yearly, and the creditor pledged with her his certificate as a ſecurity, the proviſion was intended as a temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to continue until Congreſs ſhould be able to diſcharge her own engagements, and then if <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> choſe ſhe might authoriſe an exchange of New-Loans
<pb n="503" facs="unknown:027132_0511_0FD32821A7410AB0"/>
for Continental certificates, and the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors have reſort to Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Our attention hath been called to the Act of December 18th, 1780, for the depreciation of the the pay of the army; and it is aſked, why ſhould not <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> aſſume the one as well as the other? It was in order to ſhew when <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> contemplated a permanent debt ſhe knew how to diſtinguiſh between the depreciation certificates and thoſe iſſued in 1786. The depreciation certificates were iſſued at the earneſt ſolicitation of Congreſs; this commonwealth agreed to aſſume the depreciation certificates, Congreſs being unable to pay the debt, called upon the individual ſtates to pay it, promiſing at the ſame time, that they would repay them.</p>
                     <p>Here then, are circumſtances and inducements to do the one, and not the other. All ſhe did was to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſum due to each perſon for the depreciation of his pay in the army, the Act makes a proviſion for the redemption both of principal and intereſt, and reſerves the right of paying them off in ſpecie, or in any other current money equivalent.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceed to conſider the nature of New-Loan certificates. Previous to the paſſing of the Act of 16th March 1785, it is obvious to the recollection of every perſon, that the war was then over, the Federal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation ſhewed itſelf inadequate to the purpoſes of good government; Congreſs had a great foreign and do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>tic debt, and not able to call on the individual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> for reſources and revenues. In this torpid ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the public creditors who were citizens of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> laboured under inconveniences, reſorted to their own government, praying relief.</p>
                     <p>The Legiſlature then paſſed the Act of the 16th of March 1785, in which ſhe ordered her quota £.123932 of intereſt to be paid into the Loan-office of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and ordered the Loan-officer to pay it to the public creditors, citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> this ſhe did at the preſſing ſolicitations of her citizens; who were
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:027132_0512_0FD3281B759B8A90"/>
in diſtreſs, as Congreſs could not relieve them, this is ſtated in the preamble to be their motive, the 18th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes it temporary until Congreſs could pay; this is the ſpirit and intention of the law of 1785, the ſame motives pervade all the ſubſequent Acts on the ſubject: And her deſigns were never to make any other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments further than therein contained.</p>
                     <p>It may be aſked, and I now mention it, why did not <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> aſſume all this debt, as ſhe did in the caſe of the depreciation of the pay of the army? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It was not done at the deſire or inſtance of Congreſs, but by her own voluntary act. If this commonwealth had waited for the recognition of Congreſs, perhaps Congreſs would not recogniſe what <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had done. She knew this appropriation was unpleaſant and diſagreeable to Congreſs, who wanted herſelf the application of the funds in her own hands. Moreover the depreciation of the pay of the army, was an aſcertained ſum very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and far inferior to the other debt.</p>
                     <p>Thus the object of the act of 1785, was found diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Congreſs, and in September 1785, ſix months afterwards Congreſs determined to defeat the proviſions of that act, as being diſagreeable to her, and gave directions to her officer accordingly. Thus we find all the benevolence, all the advantages intended by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> abſolutely defeated by thoſe reſolves of Congreſs, and the creditors reduced to the ſame difficult ſituation they were in before the paſſing of the act of 1785. Thus circumſtanced, when the Legiſlature met in March 1786, ſhe found the ſame cauſe exiſting as in 1785, the creditors ſtill craving further relief, as there had been no change in their condition ſince March 1785; it was a reaſonable idea, that finding the citizens, public creditors in the ſame ſituation, ſhe ſhould contemplate how they might make ſome other proviſions for the exigencies of thoſe creditors on the ſame ground, ſame principles and ſame manners: It is preſumed, that the ſame men called upon to act in the courſe of one year would act as they did before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="505" facs="unknown:027132_0513_0FD352F04012E008"/>It was not neceſſary to give more relief, but it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to give it in a different way. The Legiſlature reaſoned a little here, they conſidered their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was defeated by Congreſs. How was it to be done? It was a perplexing thing; ſome other mode muſt be adopted without the intervention of the public offices of Congreſs; ſome good arrangements were neceſſary. It would not do to ſay, that every creditor ſhould bring his bundle of Continental certificates to the State-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to receive his intereſt on them; this was imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable and unſafe to the commonwealth; beſides, where was her ſecurity, that if ſhe paid ſo, it ever would be repaid her? The Legiſlature knew that it was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant buſineſs to Congreſs, and that ſhe defeated the ſame meaſure ſix months before.</p>
                     <p>Some other mode muſt therefore be deviſed; the idea of a loan was propoſed, and the expedient adopted; the iſſuing of New-Loans were deviſed only to give a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient mode to the creditor, and to continue only till Congreſs ſhould do juſtice to all her own creditors. How is this project to be carried into execution? We find, Sir, to effect this buſineſs, ſhe directs certain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of her own to be iſſued and given in exchange for Continental certificates: The amount of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates, their numbers, dates and other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential circumſtances of the debt to be ſtated in a large margin; it is worthy of attention to conſider how it was directed to be done. <hi>(Mr, Wilcocks then read a part of the Act of March</hi> 1786.) The preamble ſhews the Act of 1786 grew out of the reſolves of Congreſs, which defeated the Act of 1785, and only went to ſecure the intereſt, becauſe it was not done at the call of Congreſs, but voluntarily by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to relieve her own citizens. It is "inexpedient" to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that law, ſays the Legiſlature, but juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that our creditors ſhould be relieved as far as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will admit. The Treaſurer is to provide certificates with a proper <hi>margin</hi> ſufficient to contain the eſſentials of the debt to be ſecured. It was calculated
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:027132_0514_0FD328224D79DFF8"/>
with this view to make it eaſy to return it; they never meant an abſolute engagement, never meant to pay, elſe why not make a certificate for the amount of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intereſt? Every caution was taken by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to ſhew they meant ſomething beyond a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: Had they deſigned a purchaſe they would have required the principal and intereſt to be calculated, and have directed a certificate to iſſue at once for their amount, not doing it ſhews they did not deſign a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; an individual would have given his bond for the amount; therefore the caſe of the depreciation New-Loan certificates are very different; in the depreciation there was no margin, they meant different things, a ſpecial ſpecies of ſecurity, to contain the eſſentials of the debts thereby to be ſecured, and the annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intereſt which ſhall have been made thereon, to be prepared by the Treaſurer, delivered to the Compt. Gen. to be by him counterſigned and delivered out.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, I truſt from theſe obſervations, that the caſe of the iſſuing of depreciation and New-Loans are very different, and that the Legiſlature meant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this as the moſt convenient mode to facilitate the payment of intereſt on the New-Loans. All theſe circumſtances mentioned to be recorded in the margin, and directed by the Act are as good as if they had a place in the very body of the certificate, and are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a part of the contract.</p>
                     <p>The marginal notes and the printed part are one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, as if they had borrowed or received per margin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al notes ſuch a certificate and to ſuch an amount ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the margin: That the Comptroller-General or Treaſurer might not be at the trouble of going over and over again the Continental certificates, but be able at one view on what ſum intereſt is to be calculated.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, if theſe things be ſo, it appears by this Act of Aſſembly that the New-Loans were never an evidence of a money debt but an evidence of a ſpecial contract to pay the intereſt, and the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to be ultimately paid by the United States.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="507" facs="unknown:027132_0515_0FD3283D1A59A6B8"/>The next conſideration is, that of whatever nature the engagements of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> were, they were done away by the repealing law of March 1789.</p>
                     <p>All the laws preceding that Act were of a temporary nature, calculated to remove the difficulties of the times, and only to continue until Congreſs ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, which proviſion was now made, the 27th of March 1789 being the day ſo long wiſhed for, now the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief is withdrawn (Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> read the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Act of 1789) with regard to the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Legiſlature there can be no doubt of their deſigns, they could mean nothing leſs than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away all obligations under which they lay by the preceding laws.</p>
                     <p>Nothing remained but to make the proviſion, which is abſolutely and completely done in the ſubſequent ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Act. In the caſe of two individuals, one of whom is indebted to the other, if a law is paſſed or a circumſtance takes place to acquit the debtor from the payment of principal and intereſt, can any obligation remain? Is not the debt diſcharged? How then, is it poſſible any thing elſe can be meant here, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely to annul the debt?</p>
                     <p>The third ſection directs the manner in which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was to have been effected, and when that was done, they had performed all that in juſtice and equity they could be called upon to do.</p>
                     <p>It was not a contract for the payment of money but only payment of intereſt for four years, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but directing the manner of returning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates; <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> then had acquitted herſelf with honor and character from any engagement ſhe was under from the New-Loan creditors.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable that the words <hi>pay</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> are made uſe of at the iſſuing of the certificates by the law of 1786, which are alſo uſed in the repealing Act of March 1789, juſt commenſurate to the law of 1786; this preciſion is worthy of attention, it makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal commenſurate to the obligation, and the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:027132_0516_0FD3535B990F5C08"/>
to be annulled by the uſe of thoſe words—meaning <hi>to pay</hi> the intereſt, and <hi>to ſecure</hi> the return of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates; and being uſed in the repealing Act deſigned to revoke the paſt.</p>
                     <p>Whether or not this law was repugnant to the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States, if the above are right, the Conſtitution need not be attended to, becauſe no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was impaired by this commonwealth, the contract being in its origin only conditional. Therefore, Sir, I apprehend the law of 1789 is not to be taken in the defendant's view, but as an Act of the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> intended to do good in the different means pointed out by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitution of the United States, ſo far from deviating from, actually concurred with the repealing Act of March 1789 in defeating the obligations of the Act of 1786, and repealed the contract of itſelf: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the funds were thereby transferred to Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Let us attend to ſee in what manner the contract was impaired, if at all. The funds were a part of the contract, as much ſo as any other. The New-Loan holders aſſented to the change, and conſented that the revenues and impoſts ſhould be taken away from this commonwealth and be for ever veſted in the United States; the New-Loan holders were repreſented in convention, then that part of the contract was repealed, annulled and made void.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it may be ſaid with more truth, that the Conſtitution repealed the obligation of the Act of 1786, than that the law of 1789 is in violation thereof, and againſt the ſpirit of the Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>If then the law of 1786 was not a purchaſe of the certificates, but an engagement ſuch as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the State is fairly and honorably diſcharged, and ſhe diſengaged herſelf by offering the holders the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates which ſhe had received.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceed to conſider whether the New-Loans are redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="509" facs="unknown:027132_0517_0FD352D79489E770"/>When we come to conſider that law, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably find that the Legiſlature intended to place all the financial engagements of the State on as ſimple a footing as poſſible, by aſcertaining the <hi>extent</hi> of all her <hi>debts,</hi> and to diſcharge the moſt of them by <hi>payment,</hi> the means by which this was to be accompliſhed was a ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock therein enumerated.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſection directs the payment of intereſt on all certificates that bore intereſt to the time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came due.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſection authoriſes the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock as much as ſhould have been neceſſary to redeem, 1. All certificates bearing an intereſt of 6 per cent. 2. Six per cent. purparts on the deferred ſtock of the United States. 3. All three per cent. purparts; and 4. Dollar money.</p>
                     <p>The above ſection comprehended every ſpecies of State debt, the unfunded depreciation and New-Loan debt excepted; the intereſt only of the New-Loans was an engagement, and the unfunded depreciation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed to be in the hands of ſpeculators with a long arrear of intereſt, being bought up at a low rate, It was thought it might as well reſt to be redeemed at the Land-office.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee if it is poſſible, they ever contemplated the redemption of any other debts than thoſe enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ſecond ſection.</p>
                     <p>The third ſection provides for the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock, and giving warrants for its delivery.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſection directs the Comptroller and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter-General to keep the accounts.</p>
                     <p>The fifth ſection provides how they are to be paid on the 1ſt of July, after due notice be given, and the certificates be depoſited.</p>
                     <p>In this manner and thus far, it ſhould ſeem, ample proviſion had been made to pay off theſe ſtate debts. It was not known at this time that Congreſs would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely open their loan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="510" facs="unknown:027132_0518_0FD352F1D98AE508"/>Then comes the ſixth ſection, which we conſider and contend as a proviſo, as much as if the Legiſlature had ſaid that you ſhall at all events have your money, but there is an event which yet may happen, if Congreſs ſhould open their loan, we will impoſe an additional duty, that is, that you the holders of certificates ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribable to the loan ſo to be opened, ſhall not be treated and paid in the manner mentioned in the five foregoing ſections, but you ſhall be obliged to one thing more, namely, ſubſcribe your certificates to the loan, and transfer them to the State-Treaſurer for the uſe of the commonwealth, and then you ſhall receive your pay. The redemptive powers of the 6th ſection, were never deſigned to exceed thoſe in the 2d ſection, and was only a different modification upon the event of Congreſs opening their loan. <hi>(Mr. Wilcocks then read the 6th ſection.)</hi> All the ſubſequent ſections of the law are eventually proviſional, in caſe the price pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed could not be procured for the ſtock, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the fifth ſection be delayed, &amp;c—I ſay every other part of the ſections are proviſional.</p>
                     <p>But, Sir, we are told this 6th ſection is an independent clauſe, and conceived ſo extenſive as to oblige the ſtate to redeem whatever Congreſs ſhould have aſſumed. Even old bills of credit muſt be paid by the State if Congreſs would aſſume them. <hi>(Mr. Wilcocks was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by Mr. Lewis, who ſaid, Bills of Credit were not included in the teſtimony. Mr. Wilcocks repeated that it was given in evidence, as the opinion of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, that if old bills of credit were aſſumed by Congreſs, the State would be obliged to redeem them.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a good rule in the conſtruction of ſtatutes, to conſider all together, but how much more ſo in the preſent inſtance of the individual Act of the 10th April 1792, the ſixth ſection ſhould not be conſidered inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently, but connected with the other ſections of the ſame Act.</p>
                     <p>This is plainly and obviouſly militating againſt the defendant, and his Counſel; they ſay the State commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="511" facs="unknown:027132_0519_0FD353054BD28128"/>
herſelf to Congreſs; this conſtruction is narrow; the true and juſt conſtruction is not to enlarge the bounds of redeemability; in that caſe the ſixth ſection is a proviſo to the ſecond. When two conſtructions are brought into view, the one abſurd and inconſiſtent, the other rational and conſiſtent, ariſing from a comparative view of the whole Act, no doubt can be entertained which of them will be adopted. Shall a conſtruction ſo inſulting to the integrity and underſtanding of our Legiſlature be courted? To ſay, that they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to Congreſs, that they blindly threw themſelves into the arms of Congreſs, ſo unreſtrained, ſo regardleſs of their duty, void of prudence and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to ſuppoſe that the ſixth ſection was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive than the firſt and ſecond, as to embrace every deſcription of State debts; we will redeem whatever Congreſs will aſſume!</p>
                     <p>No Act of Congreſs was then extended; it appears an unreaſonable and extravagant ſuppoſition; the idea cannot be admitted on any other ground, but that the Legiſlature were remiſs, and did not do their duty.</p>
                     <p>But the law of February 1795<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> providing for the unfunded depreciation certificates being redeemed, ſhews they conſidered nothing redeemable but what the ſecond ſection compriſed. <hi>(Mr. Lewis aſked Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks, Do you produce a legiſlative conſtruction after the fact happened, as a proof where many of the unfunded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates were redeemed? Mr. Wilcocks ſaid he meant to ſhew the ſenſe of the Legiſlature, that by this law of 1793, their ſenſe of the law of</hi> 1792 <hi>was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the unfunded depreciation; therefore the New-Loans could not be included.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It therefore appears that New-Loan certificates were diſcarded by <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> the State had acquitted her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the arrears of intereſt on them were to be paid; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, it is impoſſible that New-Loans could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the Act of 1792, when in 1793 ſhe declared that even unfunded depreciation certificates were not contemplated to be redeemable by the Act of 1792.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="512" facs="unknown:027132_0520_0FD3535CFB11B058"/>Hence, then, Sir, I truſt it appears evident, 1. That New-Loans never were a State money debt, at all. 2. That they were never ſubſcribable, and 3. That they were never redeemable.</p>

                        <p>But ſay the learned Counſel for the defendant, there were ways and means, there is a fund for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New-Loan debt, under the heads of <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improvements,</hi> by the act of the 7th of April 1791. By this, ſay the gentlemen, it is provided "to pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> by virtue of any law or laws of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth." This appears to me one of the moſt ſingular ideas that hath been ſtarted in the whole courſe of this moſt important cauſe; 1. If it was liable for the New-Loan debt, ſtill this fund was not named, the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller did not draw out of this fund, but out of the fund created by the ſale of 3 per cent. ſtock under the act of April 10th, 1792. Therefore this argument and the certifications of the Comptroller-General, muſt be diametrically oppoſite. This ſeems oppoſite to the knowledge of every perſon who is any ways converſant in legiſlative appropriations.</p>
                        <p>This fund was a few years before limited to £. 10,000, and therefore inſufficient for the purpoſe; it is true, by the act of the 7th of April 1791, the limitation is taken away, and makes it the laſt appropriation; every other obligation is done away, but ſtill holds with equal force, yet ſtill the firſt act ſhews their idea of its probable amount, out of this claim Mr. <hi>Rittenhouſe</hi> and others, were paid, for ſurveying the <hi>Lancaſter</hi> road. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the idea of the Legiſlature was to make it a fund on which the Legiſlature might draw, but not to be drawn on, at the diſcretion of the Governor or other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. Then there is a neceſſity for an order of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature
<pb n="513" facs="unknown:027132_0521_0FD3283E98DB1150"/>
that that fund be drawn on, otherwiſe there would be no occaſion for any appropriations at all, this would be a general ſubſiſting fund, and would anſwer all demands without any ſpecific appropriations.</p>
                        <p>That my conſtruction of the act is a reaſonable one, and their conſtruction unreaſonable, I will mention the Act of the 4th April 1792, which directs certificates to be granted for ſettled demands without intereſt, but no warrants ſhould iſſue, only reports to be made of them to the Legiſlature of the number of unprovided debts without fund for payment; where was the neceſſity of this act, where was the neceſſity of reporting, to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, if the funds for <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>improvements</hi> were to anſwer all claims and demands without any further order from the Legiſlature?</p>
                        <p>Having now arrived at the uſual time of adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould be glad the Senate would pleaſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ. Adjourned.</p>

                     <p>HAVING arrived at the conſideration of that point of this buſineſs, which reſpects the criminal motives and intention of the Comptroller-General, and although it is alledged that the conduct of that officer, is not wrong in certifying the ſubſcribability and redeemabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of New-Loan certificates, and effecting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption under the act of Congreſs and law of the 10th April 1792; and that his opinion and judgment are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and he is not reſponſible in a criminal point of view.</p>
                     <p>Theſe pleas will be inadmiſſible, when weighed with all the circumſtances attending this tranſaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his ſentiments, and his opinion on this ſubject, how extremely cautious he has been in promulgating his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; conſider, whether he acted in his official charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and directly contrary to the intentions of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of his country; let us examine whether he is criminal or innocent, let us attend to the time when he wrote on this ſubject, what circumſtances may favour his intentions, and ſee whether there are ſufficient and reaſonable grounds for acquitting him, deliberate well whether his judgment was uninfluenced; if it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe he really did believe that New-Loans were aſſumable and redeemable. Connected with all
<pb n="515" facs="unknown:027132_0523_0FD3284049BA0168"/>
theſe circumſtances, it is to be called an obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe opinion, and can ſerve as no excuſe or apology. His former opinion, although much relied on, muſt have been formed from private views, he ſhould have taken advice.</p>
                     <p>I will recapitulate all the circumſtances in his favour, and thoſe againſt him, and place them in one point of view. It haſ been much relied on, and is worthy of obſervation, that his opinion of the ſubſcribability of New-Loans was long before the paſſing of the act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                     <p>In his letter to <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> (page 271-2) he writes,</p>
                     <p>"It is not preſumable the <hi>New-Loans</hi> will be offered."</p>
                     <p>In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he writes, "I think too highly of the faith of the public," &amp;c. It is true, he did ſo, but this declaration was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, being made at a time when it was connected with the ſubject of difficulty, namely, that of withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the payment of intereſt, in five days afterwards (ſee letter page 277) it was found New-Loans were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, all the difficulty was over, conſequently the Governor did not anſwer that letter, nor took any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the opinion.</p>
                     <p>In another letter (page 223) he ſtates the conference and ſhews his opinion that New-Loans were ſubſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; true, and it is equally true, that the conference was founded on an idea, that New-Loans were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are all that are given in teſtimony that the Comptroller thought the New-Loans were ſubſcribable.</p>
                     <p>The Governor did not care about the ſentiment, he was for another thing, he directed the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to confer with the Secretary of the Treaſury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtating to him in an open and candid manner, he only ſends him a New-Loan certificate, and the law of 1786, under which they were iſſued, and withheld the repealing law of 1789, which would have removed every difficulty as appears from his laſt letters; we find that the Secretary of the Treaſury did not know the law
<pb n="516" facs="unknown:027132_0524_0FD353394C7D9220"/>
of 1789, but as ſoon as that officer knew that the law of 1786 was completely and fully repealed, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment every difficulty vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>But the gentlemen ſay, he not only held the opinion, that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable, but alſo that they were redeemable under the Act of 1792. I requeſt the attention of the Senate in diſtinguiſhing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular periods to which this evidence points, as it is of the utmoſt importance to determine the degree of innocence or criminality.</p>
                     <p>After the month of February 1792 we find no inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his opinion, that the New-Loans were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable or even aſſumable.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſaid, that with regard to the Act of the 10th April 1792, the Comptroller expected the words there made uſe of would include New-Loans: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this was the reaſon of his objection, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the paſſing of that law.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Griffith Evans</hi> had no other authority for his converſation, that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans, than the declaration and opinion of the Comptroller-General on this head (ſee page 306) who told him he had been endeavouring to convince Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> that if old bills of credit were aſſumed, they muſt be redeemed; Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> had juſt paſſed out of the office, it reſts on Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> veracity, Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin</hi> was either gone or did not hear this, but he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocally denies the converſation; with reſpect to the unfunded depreciation, Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ſuppoſed that to be included, and thought it immaterial whether they were redeemed that way, or through the Land-office. (ſee page 296.)</p>
                     <p>Again: It is ſaid, that he ſubſcribed New-Loans openly ſo as to hazard detection and diſgrace. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Not ſo very openly, as facts and events will ſhew, he did not communicate his opinion to any other officer, his opinion was ſingular indeed; his conduct was more ſecret than open, the moſt intelligent brokers and others had no idea of their ſubſcribability.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="317" facs="unknown:027132_0525_0FD3535E885EAB70"/>The arrangement of the buſineſs was ſuch, that no officer of the government ſaw the certificates intended to be loaned but the Comptroller-General. No man could ſee what he was doing, and yet theſe are the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments adduced to ſhew the innocence of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, reſpecting his opinion of the ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability and redeemability of New-Loan certificates!</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary in this place to recapitulate all the circumſtances, which came within his knowledge in direct oppoſition to this opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General muſt have known, that the Act of March 1789 repealed all the obligations of the State reſpecting New-Loans. He muſt have known that his opinion was wrong at leaſt, as he was acting in direct oppoſition to an expreſs law.</p>
                     <p>The Comptroller-General ſays, New-Loans are a State debt. They are not ſo, ſays the Legiſlature; he inſiſts upon it that they are; nay, ſubſcribable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable too! Every department of government conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them as no longer having an exiſtence; but the Comptroller-General in defiance of the Legiſlature, perſiſts on their exiſtence as a State debt! The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in his communications to the Legiſlature, referred to all the debts and engagements of the commonwealth, but omits New-Loans among the debts, and when he mentions them, he only adverts to the arrears of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt due on the New-Loan debt.</p>
                     <p>The committees of ways and means officially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in like manner. His own and the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's ſtatements were made in the ſame manner. The Legiſlature themſelves had by a parliamentary declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for the payment of the balance of intereſt on bills of credit; this ſhews, that in doing ſo, they acquitted themſelves of all their obligations as to New-Loans; and by providing for the intereſt they had abandoned the debt.</p>
                     <p>The people, the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> conſidered the repealing Act as a good and valid law, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it; and in conformity to it, and at the call of
<pb n="518" facs="unknown:027132_0526_0FD3533C12230160"/>
the State came forward and out of £.1,819,415:18:9, they had exchanged all under it but about £. 50,000 as appears by his letter (page 220-1-2.)</p>
                     <p>And ſhall the Comptroller-General, an officer of high truſt under the commonwealth, with all this knowledge and information in his own breaſt, pretend to ſay "I am innocent?" Shall he excuſe and juſtify this, by ſhewing, that, he thought the year before, that the New-Loan certificates were aſſumable, ſubſcribable and redeemable? Is it reaſonable, or can we ſuppoſe after all this information in the Comptroller's own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and breaſt, that he could entertain an honeſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under all theſe circumſtances, and in direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all this great body of information, that the New-Loans were ſubſcribable and redeemable? I ſay, in oppoſition to the ſentiments of the Governor, the Legiſlature, the committees on ways and means, and all the officers of government.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me, that if this opinion ever exiſted, it muſt have been formed opon principles of obſtinacy and perverſeneſs, adhered to againſt the dictates of reaſon and good ſenſe, and not agreeable to the better light and information of a well informed mind.</p>
                     <p>If, then, Sir, ſuch an affected opinion can be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acted upon, in violation of law; nay, admitted, as a juſtification and apology; where ſhall we find of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial duty, honour or integrity?</p>
                     <p>There is another circumſtance in this caſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of conſideration, that, in point of time; all evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are prior to the paſſing of the Act of the 10th April 1792. He never communicated to any of the official characters of the State that the Act of April 1792 would include New-Loans. What are the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances reſpecting his interviews with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives? He was oppoſed to the paſſing of that law! He ſaid it would be injurious to the State! What were the objects of theſe communications! Undoubtedly they were for for ſome conſideration! When the law was about to
<pb n="519" facs="unknown:027132_0527_0FD353600A92B5F8"/>
paſs, we find him haſtening from one public character to another. In general, we find him manifeſting great zeal for the intereſt of the State, as this Act would be injurious to her intereſt.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time we find him manifeſting equal zeal for his own plan of finance, to help it to go down; many of the witneſſes do not remember his objections, yet no man approved of his plan. What were his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the bill? They are of a very trivial nature— 1. <hi>The price too high!</hi> 2. <hi>Ordering all the</hi> 3 <hi>per cent. ſtock to be ſold at once,</hi> &amp;c. I appeal to you, if theſe objections were not perfectly nugatory. He urged his plan of finance with all poſſible warmth: If I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his plan right, its object was not to pay off any of the debts of the commonwealth, but to fund them, and New-Loans amongſt the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I infer from this ſpecies of oppoſition to the one, and zeal to ſupport the other, that the Senate will judge the motives; in all theſe converſations hath he diſcloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any of thoſe members whom he conſulted, that the bill might injure the public, or does he produce any means whereby the commonwealth might not be hurt? Has he mentioned to any perſon that any debts were aſſumable and redeemable under the ſixth ſection, other than thoſe ſpecified in the ſecond ſection? Certainly not.</p>
                     <p>If motives of public duty induced him to oppoſe the law of April 1792, if he ſaw that individuals would ſpeculate to the diſadvantage of the State, why did he not ſays ſo? Does not all this ſtir in favour of his own plan, and againſt the bill, ſhew that it was not for the good of the State? and becauſe he liked his own plan of finance better.</p>
                     <p>Further, in a converſation with Mr. <hi>Gallatin, Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> warned him that his opinion was contrary to that of the Ligiſlature, and expreſsly informed him, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though unfunded depreciation might be redeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſixth ſection, yet he ſaid it was not ſo intended. <hi>(Mr. Morris, the Speaker of the Senate, obſerved, that
<pb n="520" facs="unknown:027132_0528_0FD353617A228D98"/>
agreeably to his notes, the Comptroller had ſaid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the teſtimony of Mr. Thomas (page</hi> 287<hi>) "The bill as it ſtood would admit of conſtructions that would open a door for ſpeculation," and "that ſome individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als would take advantage to the loſs of the State," ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the teſtimony of Mr. Montgomery (page</hi> 290.)</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> proceeded, and ſaid (addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Speaker) you have altered my recollection. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> made this obſervation on the Act, and yet he (Mr. <hi>Gallatin)</hi> allowed unfunded depreciation certificates were redeemable under the ſixth ſection of that law.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid, and it is true, that <hi>Gallatin's</hi> opinion was not to be purſued, nor admitted as the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in oppoſition to the <hi>words of the law.</hi> It is evident from the information of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> to the Comptroller-General that he knew the ſenſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, and that New-Loans were neither ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nor redeemable, nor embraced under that law; he ſhould therefore have heſitated and applied to the Governor for advice and have conſulted legal charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for official explanation.</p>
                     <p>Had he done this, how eaſy would it be to prevent the ſubſcription of theſe New-Loans, and ſubſequent loſs to the State; it ought, at leaſt, to have excited ſome doubt, and to have procured the Governor's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and if neceſſary, the Attorney-General's explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But in order to conduct his ſpeculation with ſucceſs, he diſregards all Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> obſervations, he did not, as his duty required of him, apply to the Governor, he not only neglected to do this but he proceeded in a manner to deceive the Governor.</p>
                     <p>When the Governor called for a ſtatement of the 3 per cent. ſtock to be ſold and of the debts to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed under the Act of the 10th of April 1792, the Comptroller rendered only thoſe redeemable under the ſecond ſection, and to keep his tranſactions further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
<pb n="521" facs="unknown:027132_0529_0FD35366132152D8"/>
he does not ſpecify New-Loans in his certificate to the Governor as one of them.</p>
                     <p>But ſay they, How could he do it, the loan of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was not then open? Poor excuſe! he was not aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a ſtatement under a particular ſection of the Act, the call was general and extended to the whole law. (Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> aſked for the letter alluded to, calling for the ſtatement. Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> went for the letter into the Secretary's office (ſee page 232) which being read, and not anſwering the ideas of Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> reſpecting the <hi>general call,</hi> for the letter called for no ſtatement; Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> in his teſtimony declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the call was general. This aſſertion was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> with no! no!!</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> then proceeded,—Laſtly, we find the certificate to the Governor was not explicit enough to have decided what debt was to have been redeemed. The New-Loans might have been ſubſcribable, yet not <hi>redeemable,</hi> as we contend that <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> and <hi>redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> were not convertible terms: After all it muſt be ſubmitted to the Senate, whether they were ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and if ſo, whether they were redeemable. I ſhall now diſmiſs this head, and proceed to the</p>
                     <div n="5,6" type="articles">
                        <head>FIFTH AND SIXTH ARTICLES.</head>
                        <p>By the fifth article, the Comptroller-General is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with purchaſing New-Loan certificates from thoſe who came to his office for the purpoſe of exchanging them.</p>
                        <p>In the ſixth article he is charged with taking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in his private capacity for preventing the re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of New-Loan certificates after they had been depoſited with him.</p>
                        <p>We are now arrived at that part of the ſubject, which is free from embarraſſing conſtructions, we may now even for the preſent admit that they were ſubſcribable and redeemable. Here it is not neceſſary to poſſeſs the abilities of a lawyer. Theſe laſt articles depend upon the principles of MORALITY and PRUDENCE! the degree
<pb n="522" facs="unknown:027132_0530_0FD35369834328C8"/>
of guilt will depend upon the intent. Has the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General acted with rectitude and propriety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? Has he acquitted himſelf of the duties which other laws impoſed on him, or not?</p>
                        <p>Theſe charges do not depend on the violation of Acts of Aſſembly, or Legiſlative Statutes, but they depend on moral principles interwoven with the common law as applied to all official characters. The crime is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by firſt aſcertaining the duty of the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, and by examining, whether he has acted in oppoſition to that duty. If he has acted againſt it, he is guilty, the degree of guilt is determined by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The wrong, if done, the wilfulneſs, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and inducements of the doer of the wrong, and the degree of criminality, will depend on circumſtances of aggravation or extenuation. That he is guilty in ſome degree or other, appears from a conviction that he hath violated theſe principles of integrity, morality and prudence, in the execution of his official obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This will be evident from the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Oldden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is in evidence that young Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> depoſited a certificate agreeably to Act of Aſſembly, and a printed exchange was filled up. In the inſtance of <hi>Oldden</hi> he rendered his certificates for re-exchange, went home, was deſired to call again the next day; in the evening the Comptroller-General wrote to him, offering him the aſſumable value, <hi>Oldden</hi> being a little ſtruck with the offer, ſuppoſed they muſt have been of ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him, came up to his office, the Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were not yet ready; he came up again the next day, ſtill the exchanges were not ready; he told the Comptroller, "give me thirty dollars and their nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal value, and you ſhall have them."</p>
                        <p>Is this conduct right or wrong? Where is honor, where is integrity, where is uprightneſs or equity? Is this conduct reconcilable with the principles of duty, prudence and official agency? The council for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="523" facs="unknown:027132_0531_0FD3536B96BD6D28"/>
have laboured to ſhew that the Act of March 1789, was void, as operating againſt the Conſtitution of the United States. Let it be admitted, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended that that part of the Act is void, which directs the Comptroller-General to exchange the Continental certificates for the New-Loans, many may be deſirous, is an expreſſion much relied on by them, and is cited from the law; with this plain direction <hi>"well and faithfully to do his duty,"</hi> under the ſanction of an oath to act honeſtly and uprightly towards the Commonwealth, he is directed by the Act of March 1789 to exchange when required. Yet he ſteps from his ſtation, and purchaſes <hi>in</hi> the New-Loans.</p>
                        <p>I ſay, under an oath well and faithfully to execute his office, what does he do? Theſe Gentlemen came forward and offered their certificates for exchange, and depoſited them for that purpoſe, he receives them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a time for the purpoſe of exchanging them, we find him ſtepping forward, offering to purchaſe, nay, actually purchaſing the ſame certificates.</p>
                        <p>Surely, Sir, this is an high miſdemeanor, if any ſuch thing as miſdemeanor can be found any where; although it is mentioned in the articles that New-Loans on depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, became the property of the State, this is not the git of the charge, but only a circumſtance of aggravation.</p>
                        <p>The charge is, his preventing the execution of the act, and heightening the offence by purchaſing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, defeating the law, and ſpeculating on them to his own great gain, and to the loſs of the commonwealth. I repeat it, Sir, it is mentioned here only as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but I will now ſay, that when the certificates were depoſited; they became the property of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and the conſequence was that ſhe had a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in them, and no body had a right to return them.</p>
                        <p>It is evidently and manifeſtly proved, that the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates were in the poſſeſſion of the commonwealth; the State had a property in them. Who had the authority to ſurrender the Continental certificates for them? The Legiſlature ſpoke by its laws directing the exchange
<pb n="524" facs="unknown:027132_0532_0FD352F34F5C6B38"/>
to be done. It was wrong in the Comptroller-General to do it in any inſtance; but we do not come forward to impeach him for merely returning the certificates when he had no intereſt himſelf. It was the intereſt which he held in theſe certificates, every ſuch intereſt muſt be connected with correſpondent property. The State had a property, and ſhe gave no power to any perſon to take it from her.</p>
                        <p>I beg the attention of the Senate to the recollection of the ideas of property, we know that bare poſſeſſion gives a property in caſes of larceny.</p>
                        <p>When the certificates were in his poſſeſſion, they were in the poſſeſſion of the State, and not in the poſſeſſion of <hi>John Nicholſon:</hi> occupancy gives a right. A horſe loſt or ſtolen from one man, and found in the poſſeſſion of another, leather from a ſhoemaker, or cloth from a taylor; the poſſeſſion of any of theſe articles is enough, the indictment is always for the property.</p>
                        <p>Here, Sir, the commonwealth had an intereſt and a property: The gentlemen once made a conceſſion, that no exchange was completed until the indents were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. I rather think Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> had no indents to pay, conſequently the balance was due to him, and Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> repaid it; of courſe the State had them to pay, therefore the exchange ſhould be completed when the certificates were offered.</p>
                        <p>I apprehend then that this was a moſt unwarrantable and unjuſtifiable proceeding in the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to ſtep forward to take this property which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the commonwealth, and purchaſe them.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman who ſpoke laſt, ſaid, that <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> had not yet decided, how far ſhe ſhould reſtrain the public officers from dealing; he mentioned that a law was paſſed prohibiting vendue maſters to purchaſe at their <hi>own ſales,</hi> that the General Government prevented the Secretary of the Treaſury and the clerks in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from ſpeculating in the funds, but that no law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted to prevent the Camptroller-General from dealing in this ſpecies of property! We do not bring a charge

againſt the defendant for purchaſing certificates through the medium of brokers, or dealing in ſtock, but only in violating his truſt in the foregoing inſtances. (Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> in this place, and remarked, that intereſt was due by Mr. <hi>Oldden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> ſaid, he took it as the witneſs gave it in his teſtimony which ſee page 243-4-5.)</p>

                        <head>SEVENTH ARTICLE.</head>
                        <p>The laſt article charges the Comptroller-General, that after the exchange was actually completed, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a New-Loan certificate for thirty-two hundred odd pounds, in his own name, and had it redeemed at the Treaſury, and received the money for it.</p>
                        <p>The hiſtory of this certificate is, that Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> was poſſeſſed of it on the 30th March 1790, that it was iſſued in his own name for £. 3275:19:4—that he delivered it on that day to <hi>Blair M'Clenachan</hi> (Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> the Speaker interrupted Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> here and ſaid, the entry was made on the 6th of March, and not on the 30th.) He entered it at the Treaſury on the 6th of March 1790, and received intereſt in September 1790, from the Treaſury. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſwears that when he went to the Comptroller's office to exchange his certificates, he carried ALL his certificates with him, and received the correſponding Continental certificates in exchange. He ſwears unequivocally, that he never ſold or commuted any certificates with the Comptroller-General in his life. It appears, the Comptroller ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this identical certificate.</p>
                        <p>If theſe facts are true, I forbear to make any further animadverſions on them! It hath been attempted to raiſe doubts reſpecting the witneſs who ſupports this charge, his veracity and integrity hath not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached but his memory.</p>
                        <p>His depoſition hath been treated in ſuch a manner, as no human teſtimony could ſtand the teſt. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did not read the interrogatories and anſwers throughout. I cannot tell what evidence could ſtand ſuch ſcrutiny.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="526" facs="unknown:027132_0534_0FD328431C37C910"/>It appears Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſwears with caution, and that he is not inimical to the defendant; he ſwears with certainty where his memory ſerves him, where he could refer to unerring documents, he did ſo; where he was uncertain, he doubted! (Mr. <hi>Wilcocks</hi> then read the interrogatories and anſwers, and commented on them, ſee page 253 to 260.)</p>
                        <p>His refuſal to anſwer four interrogatories will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, when their nature is conſidered, ſome of them look as if calculated to affront him (18th and 19th read) Sir, <hi>his feelings were hurt,</hi> it excited his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (20th read) perhaps he thought it implied ſome ſuſpicions not very honorable (21ſt read.) None of theſe contains a queſtion calculated to draw an anſwer material to the enquiry about the certificate, about which the enquiry was made: which induced him to ſay they <hi>"did not deſerve an anſwer,"</hi> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed they were calculated to confuſe and irritate him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſwears he never commuted with <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> This certificate is ſubſcribed by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſubſcribed all his certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. Where is there any room for any other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> had exchanged it. The evidence under this laſt charge is ſtriking and concluſive; if there was a doubt, what can be eaſier than for the Comptroller to bring forward information where he got it? If his brokers bought it, they have a bill, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep an account.</p>
                        <p>Is it of ſuch a nature, and <hi>ſo trivial,</hi> as to merit no attention? A certificate for three thouſand odd hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds! Or is it ſo <hi>concluſive</hi> as to deſerve no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? No attempt is made to ſhew it came otherwiſe into the hands of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His books of exchange are ſo irregularly kept, as that it is impoſſible to get any thing from them: They are not kept agreeably to the directions of Council, nor at the proper times. It is not to be pretended that the books can be balanced day by day, but it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſuppoſed, that when the exchanges are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted,
<pb n="527" facs="unknown:027132_0535_0FD3536CC05ED940"/>
then things might be known; theſe exchanges exhibit no receipts; they are not in the hand-writing of the party; you find only the initials of their names. There are forty-ſix odd thouſand dollars in two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. No individual certificates are identified or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. What uſe can be made of books of this ſort? <note n="*" place="bottom">It was ſtated by Mr. <hi>Tilghman,</hi> that theſe books had been laid before the SUPREME EXECUTIVE COUNCIL agreeably to their inſtructions, every week, ſo that, they had an opportunity to judge and give further directions if they were not kept as they ordered.</note>

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE defendant ſtands impeached on ſeven articles of high crimes and miſdemeanors in his official capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as Comptroller-General of this commonwealth. The Repreſentatives of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> have pledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make good their charges, and to add counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and influence to their proſecution, they have at a very great expence to the commonwealth, abandoned their duties elſe where to pay daily attendance here. To diſappoint them in their favourite object and to defend him, is the occaſion of my troubling you at preſent. It is to be regretted that my indiſpoſition will prevent me from rendering him that juſtice to which I deem him entitled: But it is no ſmall conſolation to me that I have been preceded by able colleagues, and if I had not yet that I appear before impartial judges who will be no leſs able than willing to render him ample juſtice.</p>
                     <p>I have always thought that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of too many and too extenſive powers to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to any man, and if the queſtion at preſent turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this, I ſhould have been far from advocating their propriety. If this was wrong it was not however his fault, but it reſted with thoſe who thought proper to entruſt them to him, with ſo few checks or means
<pb n="529" facs="unknown:027132_0537_0FD3284641655878"/>
of controul. I cannot however but conſider this as the real grounds of accuſation, and to lament how degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is to human nature, that ſhe affords ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men high in popular favour, becoming en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, ſuſpected, perſecuted, hunted down and ruined, ſo that the old adage of <hi>hoſannah</hi> to day and <hi>crucify</hi> him to-morrow, is not yet out of date.</p>
                     <p>As the doctrine which I have advanced with reſpect to extenſive powers entruſted to an individual applies to the <hi>accuſed,</hi> there ſeems to be an exception to the general rule, and my mind is much changed, ſince I have ſeen a mountain ſo long in labour without even producing a <hi>mouſe.</hi> The keen-eyed and quick ſcented committee of inveſtigation, of hunters and of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have probed every channel of information, and ſearched every corner for intelligence, have with unwearied induſtry traced all the uncounted millions and tens of millions with which he had been entruſted, and it now appears that THE TEMPTATIONS HOWEVER GREAT COULD NOT CORRUPT HIM ſince nothing has been found againſt him except with reſpect to the New-Loan certificates. Hence I am induced to believe that the public confidence was not miſplaced. Months of laborious induſtry have been employed by a committee conſtantly ſitting during the receſs of the Houſe, with free acceſs to his books, papers and official documents, and yet they have been able to bring forward nothing elſe againſt him. He has undergone this fiery ordeal of more than inquiſitorial perſecution; and if he ſhall not be found guilty, his character muſt, like pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doubly refined by an over ſevere heat, appear with unexampled luſtre.</p>
                     <p>The charges are of the moſt ſerious nature;—wilful and corrupt violation of the law! wilful and corrupt diſregard of official duty! wilful and corrupt violation of his oath! and all this from motives of private gain and ſordid lucre! and all this too, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public who had confided in him! If all theſe things are true, an unanimous vote of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="530" facs="unknown:027132_0538_0FD32846E5125370"/>
ought to take place, but if they are unfounded, an unanimous acquittal ſhould be the reſult.</p>
                     <p>The accuſed labours under diſadvantages which even common culprits do not experience. In ordinary caſes an unanimous voice is neceſſary to a conviction; not ſo with reſpect to him, and therefore more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proofs ſhould be required. Again, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>harged and boldly too, with a violation of his oath of office. On this ground too, the moſt concluſive evidence ſhould be required. On an indictment for perjury two witneſſes are neceſſary to a conviction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is but one oath of guilt, there is oath againſt oath, and truth hangs in an equilibrium. 10th <hi>Mod.</hi> 194.4 <hi>Blac.</hi> Comm. 351. This principle is ſurely applicable upon the preſent occaſion, where the defendant is charged with a violation of his oath of office, and it will be found that this charge is at moſt ſupported by the treacherous and confuſed memory of Mr. <hi>Blair M'Clenachan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are told, Mr. Speaker, that this proſecution me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits peculiar attention from the reſpectability of the accuſers, and a line of diſtinction favourable to them has been drawn, between an impeachment and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment by a grand jury. Of this reſpectability and of the propriety of this line of diſtinction we have not however any proof, nor am I at all ſatisfied with it. In public bodies heat too frequently takes place, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion too often bears ſway. When that is the caſe, the judgment is too often warped, and the innocent not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently fall victims to the rage of party. This is not the caſe in preſentments by grand juries. <hi>There,</hi> generally ſpeaking, the accuſed meets his accuſer face to face before the magiſtrate. They meet on equal grounds, the allegations againſt him are heard and he has an opportunity of vindicating his innocence. This palladium of ſacred rights is it is true but ſeldom refuſed in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Commons; where it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent for the party accuſed to be heard at the bar previous to the articles of impeachment being voted
<pb n="531" facs="unknown:027132_0539_0FD3531FF2146B58"/>
againſt him. The ſame indulgence (if an indulgence it is to be called) was upon a late occaſion afforded to Judge <hi>Hopkinſon,</hi> and had the Houſe of Repreſentatives been worthy of that reſpectability which the learned managers have been pleaſed to impute to them, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, that the ſame meaſure of juſtice would have been meted to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon:</hi> I nevertheleſs truſt that clothed as he is with conſcious innocence and ſhield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that coat of armour which truth and virtue never fail to afford, he will be able to baffle the views of his <hi>reſpectable</hi> but heated and miſguided accuſers.</p>
                     <p>We have been inſtructed, Mr. Speaker, by a long and laboured, though rather clumſy account of the riſe, progreſs and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of impeachments in <hi>England,</hi> and we are told that they are intended to prevent great and mighty offenders from eſcaping puniſhment for fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious crimes by an over-bearing influence. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever true this may be, I cannot ſee any neceſſity for its diſcuſſion here. Our own conſtitution and our own laws have erected ramparts of ſafe-guard round the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, while they have provided means of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the guilty, and to them only ſhould our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal be made. By the eighth ſection of the ninth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Conſtitution, it is provided that "no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſhall iſſue to ſeize any perſon without probable cauſe ſupported by oath or affirmation;" and the moſt ſolemn oath is required from every grand juror in order to prevent preſentments of the innocent, or the crimes of the guilty from paſſing unpuniſhed. In monarchical governments where the royal favour leads to a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ranks, the reaſon aſſigned for impeachments may perhaps be a juſt one, but in a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where no ſuch diſtinction prevails, it is as different as a beggar in his cottage wrapped in his rags can poſſibly be from a monarch on his throne with his diadem ſparkling upon his brow. Here the law is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme—it neither admits nor knows of any influence in its adminiſtration; an adminiſtration which is too pure to oppreſs the poor, or to ſcreen the rich; to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe
<pb n="532" facs="unknown:027132_0540_0FD3533F175AF548"/>
the humble innocent, or to let the haughty guilty go free. It nevertheleſs admits of impeachments; not upon the ground which has been mentioned, but upon a much more ſubſtantial one: The innocence or guilt of a public officer may and often does depend on a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of nice intricacies of law, which but few jurymen are competent to determine, and therefore our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution wiſely declares that "The Governor and all other civil officers under this commonwealth ſhall be liable to impeachment for any miſdemeanor in office." It is therefore evident that the humbleſt man in office is liable to impeachment for any miſdemeanor in office, and that no man however wealthy he may be, is liable to impeachment for any other cauſe; and hence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, that all the inſtruction which we have received on this head was ill-timed, and could only have been intended to miſlead or to make a vain parade of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing, Mr. Speaker, which my client has juſt cauſe to complain of. The Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, (ſee page 108) after exhibiting their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, pledged themſelves to offer proof of the premiſes; but upon what grounds did they thus pledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Why as to the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of the third article it was on the hear-ſay of the committee of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; founded on the hearſay of the committee of ways and means; founded on the hearſay of a man <hi>not under oath;</hi> and they afterwards materially altered that charge, on a <hi>chit-chat</hi> converſation between the ſame man, and a member of the Houſe, as it was reported to the Houſe by that member, and without requiring any oath from that member or his informant, or taking any trouble to enquire into the truth of it.</p>
                     <p>By this extraordinary procedure has the defendant been deprived of that ſecurity to which every man is by the laws and conſtitution of his country entitled; and this too by the very men who have thought proper to impeach the defendant for a ſuppoſed violation of the law and conſtitution! If he is guilty, they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="533" facs="unknown:027132_0541_0FD3536F37634688"/>
been ſo complaiſant as to keep him in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and he may juſtly retort upon them <hi>Turpe eſt doctori cum culpa redarguit ipſum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When it is conſidered that they are the ſworn guardians of the laws and conſtitution of the country, they muſt appear but with an ill grace as the accuſers of others, at the moment of committing ſo flagrant a violation on their part. I allude to the third article which charges that the defendant did "not conſult the Regiſter-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nor the Governor," and yet thoſe who made this charge, knew no more about the truth or falſity of it, legally ſpeaking, than any man in <hi>Europe.</hi> It appears indeed that Mr. <hi>Gallatin told</hi> the Houſe, that Mr. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldſon</hi> had <hi>told</hi> him ſo, but it alſo appears, that the Houſe upon this information, unſupported by any oath or enquiry before themſelves or a committee, voted the charge <hi>true;</hi> and what aggravates their conduct (if it be capable of aggravation) is, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> a leading member in bringing forward the impeachment, now ſwears that <hi>as Mr.</hi> Donnaldſon <hi>was an officer of government they thought he might be heard without an oath!</hi> A <hi>Britiſh</hi> peer, when ſitting on an impeachment, anſwers upon his <hi>honour;</hi> when teſtifying as a witneſs he anſwers upon his <hi>oath,</hi> but the Houſe of Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives have attached to the officers of government, a privilege ſanctioned by no experience, and reprobated by the laws and conſtitution of this country!</p>
                     <p>So much for the manner in which the impeachment has been brought forward. Whether it is ſupported or not, remains to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>It may not be improper however to obſerve, that in writing or ſpeaking, our arrangements ſhould be ſuch, as that, <hi>that</hi> which precedes, ſhould prepare the way for that which is to follow; and that the latter may be the reſult of the former; elſe repetition, obſcurity and waſte of time will be the conſequence. Under this idea I cannot think of conſidering the articles in the order of their arrangement, nor has the Counſel on either ſide found it practicable. My poſitions will be—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="unknown:027132_0542_0FD353713B338868"/>Firſt. THAT THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES WERE SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES; AND OF COURSE, WERE REDEEMABLE AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
                     <p>Second. THAT THERE WAS AN APPROPRIATION MADE BY LAW FOR THAT PURPOSE.</p>
                     <p>Third. THAT NO CRIMINAL OFFENCE IS SUFFICIENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY CHARGED AND PROVED AGAINST THE COMPTROL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LER-GENERAL.</p>
                     <p>Subdiviſions will perhaps be neceſſary for the more clear elucidation of theſe points.</p>
                     <p>Firſt poſition. THAT THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES WERE SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES; AND OF COURSE, WERE REDEEMABLE AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
                     <p>Under this poſition, we are ſo far from agreeing with our opponents the learned managers, that the Act of March 27, 1789 aboliſhed the New-Loan debt, created by the Act of March 1ſt 1786, as to boldly contend, that it left it as it was before, with this difference only, that it was funded by the law of 1786 and unfunded by the law of 1789, and left without the means of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until ſome new proviſion ſhould be made for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>We ſay that ſo much of the Act of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> of March 1ſt, 1786, as aſſumed the debt due to her own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens from the U. S. was a noble exertion of patriotiſm, benevolently intended and wiſely calculated to add value to their certificates, and inſpire them with confidence, when they had but little in the funds of the United States; but that ſo much of it as provided the means of payment, was originally founded on a breach of faith; was beyond the power of the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and if not originally unconſtitutional and void, it became ſo by the adoption of the Federal Conſtitution. It was therefore the meaning and duty of the Aſſembly in March 1789 to repeal one part of the Act of 1786, but it had neither the power nor the will to repeal the other part of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="535" facs="unknown:027132_0543_0FD353750BD173A0"/>To determine this, a minute attention to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious matters is abſolutely neceſſary, and the queſtion will be found to be ſo important, that it ſhould not be loſt ſight of in any ſtage of our enquiries.</p>
                     <p>All debts due to foreign and domeſtic creditors of every deſcription, for monies loaned, ſupplies furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſervices performed for the general defence, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and each of thoſe creditors, whether conſiſting of a nation or of a private individual, had both an equitable and legal claim on the aggregate fund, compoſed of the quotas of the ſeveral ſtates for payment. Foreign nations as well as foreign and domeſtic citizens, truſted on the ſecurity of this aggregate fund and on the plighted faith of the Union for payment out of it, and no one ſtate had the power of extricating herſelf or her quota of the public debt, from the claim of all the public creditors, by appropriating her quota in favour of any particular claſs of citizens in excluſion of others—yet it will be found that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by her Act of 1786 undertook to make a partial appropriation of her quota in favour of her own citizens, and to the prejudice of all other public creditors of every deſcription. If this ſhall be found to be the caſe, and if it ſhall alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had no ſuch power, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult as a neceſſary concluſion, that ſo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment of the New-Loan certificates, was founded on a breach of public faith and was under the articles of Confederation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional—It was therefore the duty of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature in the year 1789 to repeal this part of the Act of 1786—But in 1786 <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had the power of aſſuming upon herſelf the payment of that part of the public debt which was due to her own citizens, either upon any other funds than her quota of the public debt due from the Union, or without funding it at all—By her Act of 1786 ſhe did aſſume it, and therefore ſo much of that Act as related to the aſſumption could not without a breach of faith be repealed by her in
<pb n="536" facs="unknown:027132_0544_0FD3534088F99798"/>
1789—Theſe remarks will afford a ſufficient clue for the true interpretation of the law of 1789 and which I ſhall come to conſider its letter and ſpirit, I truſt it will appear that the Legiſlature of 1789 intended to reſtore public faith by repealing ſo much of the Act of 1786 as was founded on a breach of it, but that it did not intend committing a new breach of the public faith, by repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which was ſo far from being unconſtitutional as to be highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable—As a foundation for what has been ſaid and for that which is to follow, it is now proper to turn to the articles of Confederation which contain the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſions—</p>
                     <p>"ARTICLE VIII.

                     <p>Without enquiring into motives which may perhaps have been ſo laudable as to entitle her to an exemption from much cenſure, it muſt be admitted, that this laſt proviſion was beyond her power; was a violation of the articles of Confederation and a breach of public faith ſolemnly plighted by Congreſs and by <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> herſelf—<hi>Pennſylvania</hi> might make a grant to her own citizens to whatever amount ſhe pleaſed, but ſhe could not make it out of her quota which ſhe had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed Congreſs to mortgage, and which Congreſs had actually mortgaged to all the creditors of the Union.</p>

The reſult of their mature and ſolemn delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations on theſe great objects, is contained in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral recommendations of the 18th inſt. herewith tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Although theſe recommendations ſpeak them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the principles on which they are founded, as well as the ends which they propoſe, it will not be improper to enter into a few explanations and remarks, in order to place in a ſtronger view the neceſſity of complying with them.</p>
                        <p>The firſt meaſure recommended is, effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the debt of the U. S. The amount of theſe debts, as far as they can now be aſcertained, is 42,000,375 dollars, as will appear by the ſchedule No. 1. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the principal of this aggregate debt at once, or in any ſhort period, is evidently not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our reſources; and even if it could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the caſe of the community would require that the debt itſelf ſhould be leſs to a courſe of gradual extinguiſhment, and certain funds be provided for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mean time the annual intereſt. The amount of the annual intereſt, as will appear by the paper laſt referred to, is computed to be 2,415,956 dollars. Funds, therefore, which will certainly and punctually produce this annual ſum at leaſt, muſt be provided.</p>
                        <p>"In deviſing theſe funds Congreſs did not overlook the mode of ſupplying the common Treaſury, provided by the articles of Confederation; but after the moſt reſpectful conſideration of that mode, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to regard it as inadequate and inapplicable to the form into which the public debt muſt be thrown. The delays and uncertainties incident to a revenue to be eſtabliſhed and collected form time to time by thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen independent authorities, is at firſt view irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
<pb n="544" facs="unknown:027132_0552_0FD3537DA3584B48"/>
with the punctuality eſſential in the diſcharge of the intereſt of a national debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our own experience after making every allowance for tranſient impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has been a ſufficient illuſtration of this truth. Some departure, therefore, in the recommendations of Congreſs, from the Federal Conſtitution, was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but it will be found to be as ſmall as could be reconciled with the object in view, and to be ſupported beſides by ſolid conſiderations of intereſt and ſound po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
                        <p>"The fund which firſt preſented itſelf on this, as it did on a former occaſion, was a tax on imports. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which recommended this branch of revenue, have heretofore been ſtated in an Act, of which a copy, No. 2, is now forwarded, and need not be here repeated. It will ſuffice to recapitulate, that taxes on conſumption are always leaſt burdenſome, becauſe they are leaſt felt, and are borne too, by thoſe who are both willing and able to pay them; that, of all taxes on conſumption, thoſe on foreign commerce are moſt compatible with the genius and policy of free ſtates; that from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative poſitions of ſome of the more commercial ſtates, it will be impoſſible to bring this eſſential reſource into uſe without a concerted uniformity; that this uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity cannot be concerted through any channel ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as through Congreſs, nor for any purpoſe ſo aptly as for paying the debts of a revolution, from which an unbounded freedom has accrued to commerce.</p>
                        <p>"In renewing this propoſition to the ſtates, we have not been unmindful to the objections which heretofore fruſtated the unanimous adoption of it. We have limited the duration of the revenue to the term of 25 years; and we have left to the ſtates themſelves the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the officers who are to collect it. If the ſtrict maxims of national credit alone were to be conſulted, the revenue ought manifeſtly to be conſiſtent with the object of it, and the collection placed in every reſpect under that authority which is to diſpenſe the former, and is reſponſible for the latter. Theſe relaxations
<pb n="545" facs="unknown:027132_0553_0FD353085234A118"/>
will, we truſt, be regarded on one hand as the effect of a diſpoſition in Congreſs to attend at all times to the ſentiments of thoſe whom they ſerve, and on the other hand, as a proof of their anxious deſire that proviſion may be made in ſome way or other for an honorable and juſt fulfilment of the engagements which they have formed.</p>
                        <p>"To render this fund as productive as poſſible, and at the ſame time to narrow the room for colluſions and frauds, it has been judged an improvement of the plan, to recommend a liberal duty on ſuch articles as are moſt ſuſceptible of a tax according to their quantity, and are of moſt equal and general conſumption; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other articles, as heretofore propoſed, to be taxed according to their value.</p>
                        <p>"The amount of this fund is computed to be 915,956 dollars. The eſtimates on which the computation is made, are detailed in paper No. 3. Accuracy in the firſt eſſay on ſo complex and fluctuating a ſubject is not to be expected. It is preſumed to be as near the truth as the defect of proper materials would admit.</p>
                        <p>"The reſidue of the computed intereſt is 1,500,000 dollars, and is referred to the ſtates to be provided for by ſuch funds as they may judge moſt convenient. Here again the ſtrict maxims of public credit gave way to the deſire of Congreſs to conform to the ſentiments of their conſtituents. It ought not to be omitted, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, with reſpect to this portion of the revenue, that the mode in which it is to be ſupplied, varies ſo little from that pointed out in the articles of Confederation, and the variations are ſo conducive to the great object propoſed, that a ready and unqualified compliance on the part of the ſtates may be the more juſtly expected. In fixing the quotas of this ſum, Congreſs, as may be well imagined, were guided by very imperfect lights, and ſome inequalities may conſequently have enſued. Theſe, however, can be but temporary, and as far as they may exiſt at all, will be redreſſed by a retroſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
<pb n="546" facs="unknown:027132_0554_0FD3532396BFD270"/>
adjuſtment, as ſoon as a conſtitutional rule can be applied.</p>
                        <p>"The neceſſity of making the two foregoing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions one indiviſible and irrevocable act, is apparent. Without the firſt quality, partial proviſion only might be made where complete proviſion is eſſential; nay, as ſome ſtates might prefer and adopt one of the funds only, and the other ſtates the other fund only, it might happen that no proviſion at all would be made: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſecond a ſingle ſtate out of the thirteen might at any time involve the nation in bankruptcy, the mere practicability of which would be a fatal bar to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of national credit. Inſtead of enlarging on theſe topics, two obſervations are ſubmitted to the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and wiſdom of the Legiſlatures. Firſt: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent creditors, or rather the domeſtic part of them, having either made their loans for a period which has expired, or having become creditors in the firſt inſtance involuntarily, are entitled on the clear principles of juſtice and good faith, to demand the principle of their credits, inſtead of accepting the annual intereſt. It is neceſſary, therefore, as the principal cannot be paid to them on demand, that the intereſt ſhould be ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and ſatisfactorily ſecured, as to enable them if they incline, to transfer their ſtock at its full value. Secondly; if the funds be ſo firmly conſtituted as to inſpire a thorough and univerſal confidence, may it not be hoped, that the capital of the domeſtic debt, which bears the high intereſt of ſix per cent. may be concel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by other loans obtained at a more moderate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? The ſaving by ſuch an operation, would be a clear one, and might be a conſiderable one. As a proof of the neceſſity of ſubſtantial funds for the ſupport of our credit abroad, we refer to paper No. 4.</p>
                        <p>"Thus much for the intereſt of the national debt: for the diſcharge of the principal within the term li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, we rely on the natural increaſe of the revenue from commerce, on requiſitions to be made from time to time for that purpoſe, as circumſtances may dictate,
<pb n="547" facs="unknown:027132_0555_0FD3537EC5709400"/>
and on the proſpect of vacant territory. If theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources ſhould prove inadequate, it will be neceſſary, at the expiration of twenty-five years, to continue the funds now recommended, or to eſtabliſh ſuch others as may then be found more canvenient.</p>
                        <p>"With a view to the reſource laſt mentioned, as well as to obviate diſagreeable controverſies and confuſions, Congreſs have included in their preſent recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a renewal of thoſe of the 6th day of September, and of the 10th day of October, 1780. In both thoſe reſpects, a liberal and final accommodation of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering claims of vacant territory, is an object which cannot be preſſed with too much ſolicitude.</p>
                        <p>"The laſt object recommended is, a conſtitutional change of the rule by which a partition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burdens is to be made. The expediency and even neceſſity of ſuch a change, has been ſufficiently enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the local injuſtice and diſcontents which have proceeded from valuations of the ſoil in every ſtate where the experiment has been made. But how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely muſt theſe evils be increaſed, on a compariſon of ſuch valuations among the ſtates themſelves! On what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſide indeed this rule be ſurveyed, the execution of it muſt be attended with the moſt ſerious difficulties. If the valuations be referred to the authorities of the ſeveral ſtates, a general ſatisfaction is not to be hoped for: If they be executed by officers of the United States traverſing the country for that purpoſe, beſides the inequalities againſt which this mode would be no ſecurity, the expence would be both enormous and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious: If the mode taken in the Act of the 17th day of February laſt, which was deemed on the whole leaſt objectionable, be adhered to, ſtill the inſufficiency of the data to the purpoſe to which they are to be applied, muſt greatly impair, if not utterly deſtroy all confidence in the accuracy of the reſult; not to mention that as far as the reſult can be at all a juſt one, it will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the advantage to the principle on which the rule propoſed to be ſubſtituted is ſounded. This rule,
<pb n="548" facs="unknown:027132_0556_0FD35324BA4D0C80"/>
although not free from objections, is liable to fewer than any other that could be deviſed. The only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difficulty which attended it in the deliberations of Congreſs, was to fix the proper difference between the labour and induſtry of free inhabitants, and of all other inhabitants. The ratio ultimately agreed on was the effect of mutual conceſſions; and if it ſhould be ſuppoſed not to correſpond preciſely with the fact, no doubt ought to be entertained that an equal ſpirit of accommodation among the ſeveral Legiſlatures, will prevail againſt little inequalities which may be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated on one ſide or on the other. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confidence of Congreſs, as to the ſucceſs of this propoſition, it is their duty to recollect that the event may poſſibly diſappoint them, and to requeſt that meaſures may ſtill be purſued for obtaining and tranſmitting the information called for in the Act of the 17th of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laſt, which in ſuch event will be eſſential.</p>
                        <p>"The plan thus communicated and explained by Congreſs muſt now receive its fate from their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. All the objects compriſed in it are conceived to be of great importance to the happineſs of this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated republic, are neceſſary to render the fruits of the revolution a full reward for the blood, the toils, the cares and the calamities which have purchaſed it. But the object of which the neceſſity will be peculiarly felt, and which it is peculiarly the duty of Congreſs in inculcate, is the proviſion recommended for the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal debt. Although this debt is greater than could have been wiſhed, it is ſtill leſs on the whole than could have been expected, and when referred to the cauſe in which it has been incurred, and compared with the burdens which wars of ambition and of vain glory have entailed on other nations, ought to be borne not only with chearfulneſs but with pride. But the magnitude of the debt makes no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>t of the queſtion. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that the debt has been fairly contracted and that juſtice and good faith demand that it ſhould be fully diſcharged. Congreſs had no option but between dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="549" facs="unknown:027132_0557_0FD352C57840B9F0"/>
modes of diſcharging it. The ſame option is the only one that can exiſt with the ſtates. The mode which has after a long and elaborate diſcuſſion, been preferred, is, we are perſuaded, the leaſt objectionable of any that would have been equal to the purpoſe. Under this perſuaſion, we call upon the juſtice and plighted faith of the ſeveral ſtates to give it its proper effect, to reflect on the conſequences of rejecting it, and to remember that Congreſs will not be anſwerable for them.</p>
                        <p>"If other motives than that of juſtice could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite on this occaſion, no nation could ever feel ſtronger; for to whom are the debts to be paid?</p>
                        <p>To AN ALLY, in the firſt place, who to the exertion of his arms in ſupport of our cauſe, has added the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of his treaſure; who, to his important loans, has added liberal donations; and whoſe loans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carry the impreſſion of his magnanimity and friendſhip. For more exact information on this point we refer to paper No. 5.</p>

For the claims and expectations of this claſs of creditors we refer to paper No. 6.</p>
                        <p>"Another claſs of creditors is, <hi>that illuſtrious</hi> and <hi>patriotic band of fellow-citizens,</hi> whoſe blood and whoſe bravery, have defended the liberties of their country, who have patiently borne, among other diſtreſſes, the privation of their ſtipends, whilſt the diſtreſſes of their country diſabled it from beſtowing them; and who, even now, aſk for no more than ſuch a portion of their dues as will enable them to retire from the field of victory and glory into the boſom of peace and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate citizenſhip, and for ſuch effectual ſecurity for the reſidue of their claims, as their country is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably able to provide. For a full view of their

ſentiments and wiſhes on this ſubject, we tranſmit the paper No. 7; and as a freſh and lively inſtance of their ſuperiority to every ſpecies of ſeduction from the paths of virtue and honour, we add the paper No. 8.</p>
                        <p>"The remaining claſs of creditors is compoſed partly of ſuch of our fellow-citizens as originally lent to the public the uſe of their funds, or have ſince ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted moſt confidence in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of thoſe whoſe property has been either advanced or aſſumed for the public ſervice. To <hi>diſcriminate</hi> the merits of theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcriptions of creditors, would be a taſk equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favour of ſome than of others, the voice of policy, no leſs than of juſtice, pleads in favour of all. A wiſe nation will never permit thoſe who relieve the wants of their country, or who rely moſt on its faith, its firmneſs and its reſources, when either of them is diſtruſted, to ſuffer by the event.</p>

                           <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and connected with the object of our preſent enquiries, was, the paſſing of a law on the 16th of March 1785. This law formed the revenues of the ſtate into an aggregate fund for ſeveral pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and among others for that of paying the ſtate's eſtimated quota of the annual intereſt of the debt of the United States contracted during the late war, and ſuppoſed to amount to £. 123,932. But ſuch payment was not to be made into the Treaſury of the U. S. for the benefit of all the creditors of the United States,
<pb n="553" facs="unknown:027132_0561_0FD352DCE9773FE8"/>
but it was ſpecially provided, that the ſaid eſtimated quota ſhould be for the ſole and excluſive benefit of ſuch creditors of the United States as were citizens of this ſtate—Theſe payments were directed to be made through the medium of the Continental Loan-officer; he was ordered to keep fair and proper accounts thereof, in order that this ſtate might have proper credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for in account with the United States; and the Act was to continue in force until the United States ſhould make and carry into execution other effectual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent proviſion for paying the annual intereſt and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of intereſt due on the debt of the United States to the public creditors thereof.</p>
                        <p>No comment can be at preſent neceſſary upon this Act; it ſpeaks for itſelf, and its language is that of perfidy—It was ſo conſidered by Congreſs, and on the 27th of September following they took meaſures which completely defeated its operation—on that day it was "reſolved that the commiſſioner of the Continental Loan-office in any ſtate, ſhould not on any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſettle or iſſue any certificate for the intereſt due on any Continental Loan-office certificate, or other certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of liquidated debts, unleſs as hereafter provided, until the ſtate for which he is Continental Loan-officer, ſhould have paſſed a legiſlative Act complying with this requiſition, (to wit, a requiſition from the ſeveral ſtates of their reſpective quotas) nor ſhall he iſſue any certificate or take any other meaſure whereby the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt may be paid by the ſtate in any mode not pointed out by this requiſition; nor ſhall the Commiſſioner of the Continental Loan-office in any ſtate, that ſhall have complied with this requiſition, iſſue any certificate or take any other meaſure, whereby a diſcrimination may be made by ſuch ſtate between the holders of Loan-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice certificates iſſued from his office, who are ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of that ſtate, and foreigners or the citizens of any other ſtate that ſhall have complied with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition"—And Congreſs on the ſame day, further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that if any ſuch commiſſioner ſhould diſobey or

                        <p>The clamours of the public creditors at home and abroad, who had been excluded from their juſt rights by diſcriminating Acts of legiſlation, in favour of a particular claſs of creditors, loudly demanded from Congreſs this firm tone of conduct, and by adopting it, they ſhewed their abhorrence of principles to which I will not give a name.</p>
                        <p>What I have hitherto dwelt upon, Mr. Speaker, may be conſidered but as the follies of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> when compared with that which is to follow. When ſhe found herſelf baffled, and her ſyſtem of diſcrimination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by Congreſs, ſhe in the fatal moment of ſome unpropitious influence, adopted the bold and deſperate meaſure of enacting the law to which I ſhall now turn —It could not be eraſed from her records in the year 1789, and there was no way of removing the diſgrace which it had brought with it, but by repealing its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and baneful parts—It was paſſed on the 1ſt of March 1786—and by it <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> aſſumed upon herſelf payment of the whole of the debt due to her own citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from the United States for monies loaned, ſupplies furniſhed or ſervices performed during the late war; ſhe provided for the payment of the intereſt thereof half yearly, until the firſt day of March 1796, and then for the payment of the principal; ſhe mortgaged for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the payment of the intereſt the aggregate fund provided by the Act of the 16th of March 1785; and that aggregate fund was made up in part of the very fund which ſhe had before veſted in the United States for the payment of her quota to all the creditors of the Union.</p>
                        <p>This Act was unconditional and it was without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation as to time—It therefore merits a very different conſideration from any of the former Acts, nor do I conceive any tolerable apology which can be fairly

made for the framers of it—That part of it indeed which contained the aſſumption, I am not diſpoſed to find fault with, and if I was, perhaps my objections would appear groundleſs; but that part of it which mortgaged the quota of this ſtate for payment to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In the year 1788 the Conſtitution of the United States was adopted and ratified—It provides that "The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes; to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the U. S.</p>
                        <p>"That no ſtate ſhall without the conſent of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs lay any impoſts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be abſolutely neceſſary for executing its inſpection laws, and the net produce of all duties and impoſts laid by any ſtate on imports or exports, ſhall be for the uſe of the Treaſury of the United States."</p>

                        <p>"That all debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of this Conſtitution ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under this Conſtitution as under the Confederation; and it concludes with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that</p>
                        <p>"This Conſtitution and the laws of the United States which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land."</p>
                        <p>On the 27th of March 1789 the Legiſlature of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> paſſed a law, which after ſome recitals, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be read at preſent, though they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be obſerved upon by and by, enacted that "the intereſt due and to become due and payable upon all and every the certificates iſſued by the Comptroller-General in purſuance of the ſaid recited Acts or either of them, ſhall be paid up, ſo as to complete the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intereſt to four years; and that ſo much of every Act or Acts of General Aſſembly, as directs or

ſecures the payment of the principal ſum or ſums in the ſaid certificates or any of them mentioned, or of the intereſt thereof, beyond the term of four years, ſhall be, and the ſame is hereby repealed, and made null and void."</p>
                        <p>The firſt poſition, Mr. Speaker, which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed maintaining is, <hi>That the New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States; and of courſe, were redeemable at the Treaſury of</hi> Pennſylvania;" and I have in an early ſtage of my remarks ventured to ſtate as the ground of this poſition, that "the Act of the 27th of March 1789 was ſo far from aboliſhing the New-Loan debt created by the Act of the 1ſt of March 1786, as to leave it as it was before, with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only, that it was funded by the law of 1786, and unfunded by that of 1789, and left without the means of payment, until ſome new proviſion ſhould be made for that purpoſe; and I at the ſame time added, that it was the meaning and duty of the Aſſembly in March 1789 to repeal ſo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means of payment; as was originally founded on a breach of faith, and as was beyond the power of the Legiſlature to enact; but I denied that the Legiſlature of 1789 had either the power or the will to repeal that part of the Act which aſſumed the debt.</p>
                        <p>Moſt of the materials neceſſary to a deciſion of theſe queſtions are now before the honorable Senate. As I proceed in my argument I ſhall occaſionally have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the reſt of them.</p>
                        <p>The ground which I have hitherto taken is intended to ſhew, that the New-Loan debt as it is called, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the Act of 1786, continued to exiſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the law of 1789—If it did not continue to exiſt, I muſt admit that the New-Loan certificates were not ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States; and if it did continue to exiſt, it follows as a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that they were ſubſcribable—The eſtabliſhing of the point is therefore of ſo much importance to the defendant as to afford a ſufficient apology for my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<pb n="557" facs="unknown:027132_0565_0FD3530A4A1227D0"/>
to draw the attention of the honorable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to a ſhort review of the ground over which I have paſſed.</p>
                        <p>It has been ſhewn, that all debts due to foreign and domeſtic creditors of every deſcription, for monies loaned, ſupplies furniſhed and ſervices performed for the general defence during the late war, were contracted on the faith of the whole Union, and of courſe that each of theſe creditors whether foreign or domeſtic, and whether conſiſting of a nation or of a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, has both an equitable and a legal claim on all the ſtates for payment—It may have ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that nations in all the pride of power and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary omnipotence, have been ſo regardleſs of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and of the ſacred voice of juſtice, as to ſubſtitute <hi>that</hi> power as the only meaſure of right, and by adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conduct which in the humble walks of private life, would conſign an individual to deſerved diſgrace and infamy, have undertaken to cancel their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Admitting for a moment, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was willing to appear as a proſtitute among nations, yet ſhe had no authority to legiſlate for foreign nations or foreign citizens, and of courſe ſhe could not annul her obligations with them—Again, <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was but an Integral part of the United States, and ſhe could have no pretenſions to the right of annulling their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts or extricating herſelf from their binding obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on her.</p>
                        <p>It has been ſhewn, that the articles of Confederation were propoſed to, and ratified by all the ſtates; that every ſtate thereby bound herſelf to abide by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the United States in Congreſs aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, on all queſtions thereby ſubmitted to them; that each ſtate by a ſolemn compact declared that they ſhould be inviolably obſerved by every ſtate, and that no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration ſhould at any time be made in any of them, unleſs it ſhould be agreed to in a Congreſs of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and be afterwards confirmed by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures of every ſtate; that all the charges of war
<pb n="558" facs="unknown:027132_0566_0FD35383483FB990"/>
and other expences incurred for the common defence or general welfare, ſhould be defrayed out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Treaſury ſupplied by the ſeveral ſtates in ſuch proportion as ſhould be fixed by Congreſs, and that for the payment and ſatisfaction thereof the United States and the public faith were thereby pledged; that the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was fixed in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the articles of Confederation, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs a part is greater than the whole; unleſs the power of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſingly, is greater than that of all the ſtates collectively; unleſs ſhe had a right to legiſlate for foreign citizens and foreign nations, and unleſs ſhe could at pleaſure withdraw her faith and cancel her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, her quota could not be applied by her in favour of one claſſ of creditors, and to the excluſion of others.</p>
                        <p>It has been ſhewn that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by her law of 1783 granted her quota, which had been fixed and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for by Congreſs for the payment of the intereſt due to the public creditors until proviſion ſhould be made for the diſcharge of the principal, and that by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ratification of her former obligations ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came doubly bound to a faithful compliance with them.</p>
                        <p>It has been ſhewn that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by another Act of the 23d of September 1783 authoriſed Congreſs, when the other ſtates ſhould come into the ſame meaſure, for the term of 25 years to levy certain duties; and that ſhe herſelf provided for raiſing certain taxes; at the ſame time, and in the moſt explicit manner ſhe appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them to the diſcharge of the intereſt and principal of the debts contracted on the faith of the United States for ſupporting the war.</p>
                        <p>After all theſe engagements, ſurely no rational man will ſeriouſly contend, that the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was not irrevocably mortgaged to all the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, or that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had the power of leſſening the claims of any of them upon her for retribution— The Conſtitution of the United States is the ſupreme law of the land; it declares that "all debts contracted
<pb n="559" facs="unknown:027132_0567_0FD352F4BA1A6F78"/>
and engagements entered into before its adoption, ſhall be as valid againſt the United States as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Confederation; the ſovereign people of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> by adopting that Conſtitution, agreed that thoſe debts ſhould be ſo—Under the articles of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was bound and her quota was mortgaged for their payment; by her Act of March 1786 ſhe undertook to ſay, that the debts contracted and engagements entered into ſhould not be as valid againſt her as by the articles of Confederation they had been declared to be, and that her quota ſhould no longer be liable for the payment of them.</p>
                        <p>In what ſituation then did <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> find herſelf in the year 1789? She found among her records an Act ſtamped with the name of a law, but part of it disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by features which ſhewed that it rather merited the name of an arbitrary and deſpotic edict—<hi>That</hi> part ſhe conſidered as a monument of her diſgrace, and ſhe determined to repeal it, and by doing ſo to reſtore her credit and the rights of all the creditors of the Union; but ſhe ſaw another part of it, which infringed the rights of no one; interfered with no former engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhe had an unqueſtionable right to enact it; that ſhe had enacted it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe had thereby pledged her faith where ſhe had a right to pledge it, and that it could not be repealed without a breach of that faith; that part therefore ſhe determined not to touch, and with the delicate hand of a ſkilful ſurgeon, ſhe probed the wound; ſhe ſeparated the rotten from the ſound, and ſhe repealed ſo much of the Act of 1786 as funded the New-Loan debt on her quota, in favour of her own citizens only, when it belonged not to them alone but to them in common with every other claſs of creditors; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I have ſaid, Mr. Speaker, that ſhe had neither the power nor the will to repeal this part of the Act.</p>

                        <p>By the law of 1786, <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> propoſed to receive from ſuch of the creditors of the United States as were her own citizens, their Continental certificates, and to give them her own certificates in lieu thereof; ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this but ſhe did not command it; ſhe offered that it might be done, but ſhe did not enact that it ſhould be done; ſhe therefore appeared in the character of a perſon willing to contract with ſuch perſons as might accept of her terms—many perſons did accept of them; ſhe received their Continental certificates; ſhe iſſued new ones in lieu thereof, and through the agency of her Comptroller-General made as full and complete a contract, as can be expreſſed in any form of words.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>It has alſo been ſaid, Mr. Speaker by the honorable managers and the learned counſel, that "The clauſe in the Conſtitution of the United States, prohibiting the paſſing of <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> laws, and laws annulling the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of contracts, does not relate to ſtates, but to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons only." But before I ſhall attempt a <hi>ſerious</hi> anſwer to this <hi>ſerious</hi> objection, I muſt wait to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome of thoſe Gentlemen how <hi>"private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons"</hi> can paſs a law of any kind!</p>
                        <p>Again, it has been ſaid that "The clauſe in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not extend to the conduct of a ſtate towards her own citizens, but that it leaves her to act with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, as ſhe may think proper."—To this I anſwer,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. That the clauſe in queſtion, contains no ſuch exception, and that I am far from being ſatisfied of the gentlemen's right to add it to the Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. That, foreign citizens and foreign ſtates are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, and that therefore, if the propoſition were true, yet that the concluſion would be unwarrantable.</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. That the reaſon is much ſtronger, for the clauſe applying to the conduct of a ſtate towards her own ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, than towards any body elſe; ſince ſhe has no right to legiſlate, but for her own citizens, and the clauſe could not therefore be neceſſary to preſerve the rights of other citizens or foreign nations.</p>
                        <p>We are alſo told that "The clauſe refered to, only relates to contracts, and not to laws," but before I can poſſibly give any other anſwer to this objection, than by laughing at it, I muſt be informed how it is poſſible that theſe words, "NO STATE SHALL PASS ANY EX POST FACTO LAW, OR LAW IMPAIRING THE OBLIGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF CONTRACTS," do not relate to laws, but only to contracts.</p>
                        <p>Again, ſuppoſing the proproſition to be true; I aſk if it has not been inconteſtably proved, that a ſtate is as capable of making a contract as a private individual
<pb n="562" facs="unknown:027132_0570_0FD3532B395DA370"/>
can poſſibly be? If <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had not made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts? If they were not as binding on her, as they could be on an individual? and if ſo, need I to add, that ſhe could paſs no <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law, or law impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obligation of contracts, more eſpecially in <hi>her own caſe; in her own favor, and to the prejudice of her own creditors!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I conclude, that the Legiſlature of 1789 had not the power, even had it been ſo weak or ſo wicked as to have the will, of repealing that part of the Act of 1786 which aſſumed ſo much of the debt of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States as was due to the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Independent of the unconſtitutionality of ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it would have been ſo extremely unjuſt, that the intention is not fairly imputable, without much ſtronger proofs, than are furniſhed by the language of the law of that date.</p>
                        <p>We have, it is true, been told that "Conſidering the proceedings which took place under the law of 1786 as but merely an <hi>exchange</hi> of one certificate for another, a <hi>re-exchange</hi> might with great propriety be ordered by a ſubſequent law, ſince this would only be putting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as they were before, and leaving them in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> ſo that no harm could poſſibly be done"—But ſurely this kind of reaſoning is altogether inadmiſſible, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the merit of plauſibility—In the year 1786 the United States, with the beſt of wiſhes towards their creditors, were, owing to the delinquency of ſome of the ſtates; without the means of rendering them juſtice —This was ſo well known as in a great meaſure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all confidence in them, and a ſtate ſecurity was by moſt people deemed preferable to a continental one. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> therefore by aſſuming ſo much of the debt as was due to her own citizens, added confidence to them, enhanced the value of their claims, and ſtamped them with a curr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not ſo would have been the caſe, had ſhe undertaken to deſtroy the debt—The debt due from the United States was either not funded at all, or it was funded on the quotas of the ſeveral ſtates.— In the former ſituation, were the New-Loan creditors placed by the law of 1789, with the liberty, if they thought proper of being placed in the latter, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing their new certificates for the old ones. This far it was the duty of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to go, but ſhe could not have gone farther without a violation of that duty, and it will preſently appear that ſhe had no ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>It can hardly be neceſſary to again remind the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senate of the Act of the 23d of September 1783, whereby Pennſylvania, by a full and complete grant, authoriſed Congreſs to raiſe and levy the whole of her quota of the debt of the United States, to take effect as ſoon as the like powers ſhould be given by all the other ſtates. By the Conſtitution of the United States, the like powers were delegated to Congreſs by all the ſtates,
<pb n="564" facs="unknown:027132_0572_0FD352FDC2DB8D58"/>
and therefore by its adoption this grant became abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and irrevocable. In proof of this, I muſt again have recourſe to the following clauſe, "The Congreſs ſhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts and exciſes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States."</p>
                        <p>As this clauſe transfers to Congreſs the identical du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon which the New-Loan debt had been funded, it may with more propriety be ſaid, that it became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded by the adoption of the Conſtitution in 1788, than in by the law of 1789, ſince that law only renders the one of 1786 conformable to it.</p>
                        <p>That may idea of the New-Loan debt continuing as a debt of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> though it ſhould become unfund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not a novel one, I will now afford the moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable proof, and my authority ſhall be no leſs than that <hi>of the ſame Legiſlature which by the Act of</hi> 1786 <hi>created that debt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It muſt be freſh in the memory of every man who hears me, that when the delinquency of ſome of the ſtates in their federal duties, had ariſen to ſuch a height, as to almoſt menace a diſſolution of the Union, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſtood firm at their poſt, and exerted every nerve to preſerve, or rather to reſcue the tainted honour of the country—On one of theſe trying occaſions, they ſent a committee conſiſting of Mr. <hi>King</hi> and Mr. <hi>Monroe</hi> to confer with the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> This event took place in the year 1786, and the Journals of the Aſſembly of that year ſhew what took place on that occaſion.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> then read the report, which ſee page 319, 320.)</p>
                        <p>By this it appears that a report was made by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the ſame Houſe of Aſſembly that paſſed the law of 1786; it was adopted by the next ſucceeding Houſe, compoſed of nearly the ſame members, and it recognizes ſeveral of the principles which I have advanced—"It conſider the debt of the U.S. in one aggregate point
<pb n="565" facs="unknown:027132_0573_0FD352FF4F77D6C0"/>
of view"—It ſtates that the "principles of juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, like payment of every part, whether the ſame be due to foreigners or citizens"—It appears that the <hi>Legiſlature of</hi> 1786, as well as that of 1787, thought that a "compliance with the requiſition would involve a breach of the faith of this ſtate pledged to her own citizens, UNLESS AT THE SAME TIME SOME FURTHER AND OTHER FUNDS WERE PROVIDED FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE INTEREST DUE AND WHICH SHOULD BECOME DUE TO THEM"—And this ſurely implies that when <hi>ſuch other funds were provided, it would be no breach of faith to take away thoſe which had been ſubſcribed</hi>—This clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeparates the aſſumption of the debt from the fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it—By the Conſtitution of the United States, ample means of other funds were provided, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legiſlature of 1789 diſtinguiſhed, as thoſe of 1786 and 1787 had done, <hi>between the aſſumption of the debt and the funding of it;</hi> and as <hi>they</hi> had propoſed, permitted the <hi>former to remain,</hi> but took away the latter.</p>
                        <p>This report ſtates the neceſſity which the State had been under of "aſſuming the debt," and it ſpeaks of the aſſumption as being unconditional in its nature, and unlimited in point of time; but it aſſumes a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language when ſpeaking of the funding of the debt, for the expreſſion there is, that "This Houſe cannot divert the funds until ſuch ſolid proviſion be made for all the public debts, as that the annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt payable to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> will be a certain and ſufficient fund for diſcharging thoſe ſums, which ſhe is bound to pay to her citizens"—By the Conſtitution of the United States ſuch "ſolid proviſion" as is here ſpoken of was amply ſecured, and therefore the law of 1789 is in this particular conformable to what the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature in 1786 conſidered as proper under the like circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>To determine however, whether there is any thing in the letter or ſpirit of the Act of 1789, ſhewing an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> deſtroy the New-Loan debt, a nearer view of the ſubject muſt be taken. When the bill was before the
<pb n="566" facs="unknown:027132_0574_0FD353898A1DA538"/>
Houſe in its original ſhape, it propoſed no more than to repeal ſo much of the law of 1786, as directed the payment of the intereſt half yearly, and had it retained this form it would hardly be contended that the debt itſelf was deſtroyed—The cauſe of the alteration may however be eaſily traced, and when that is known, there will appear no more reaſon for concluding the intention to have been to deſtroy the debt, than if no alteration had taken place. That cauſe was as follows —As the intereſt was funded upon and made payable out of the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> and as it was proper to repeal this part of the Act, the Legiſlature at firſt propoſed to do nothing more—It was however in the progreſs of the bill obſerved, that the principal was receivable at the Land-office, in order to form a charge againſt the United States, and to be deducted from the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Hence this part of the Act was alſo exceptional, and a very proper object for a repealing clauſe. Theſe circumſtances certainly afford ſtrong grounds for the concluſion, that in 1789 no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was intended than to prevent any part of the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> from being applied to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial purpoſes, and to leave to her future conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what funds ſhe would provide for the payment of theſe debts, or indeed whether ſhe would provide for them at all.</p>
                        <p>We have been told, Sir, that "The long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured preamble to the law of 1789, ſhews the anxiety of the Legiſlature to afford a juſtification for what was about to be done, and that this proves a total deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the debt to have been intended." But were I to admit, that it is not the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> but the <hi>length</hi> of the preamble, which affords a key for the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enacting clauſe, yet a very ſtrong conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might fairly be drawn in favour of my conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince not one world is to be found in any part of the preamble, in favour of deſtroying the debt, while every ſentence of it, is calculated to ſhew the propriety of rendering it an unfunded one.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="567" facs="unknown:027132_0575_0FD352CAF74AB190"/>The preamble ſays, "And whereas Congreſs having the power to provide for the payment of the debts of the United States, no doubt can be entertained but they will with all convenient ſpeed make due proviſion for the ſame"—and this has been relied on to ſhew, that the intention was to deſtroy the New-Loan debt altogether, but to me it appears that a very different inference is deducible.</p>
                        <p>The preamble recites that "Congreſs have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts and exciſes; to pay the debts of the United States; that no ſtate can without the conſent of Congreſs lay any impoſts or duties on imports or exports, and as that part of the aggregate fund created by the Act of March the 16th 1785 which ariſes from the duties and impoſts therein mentioned, will ſhortly ceaſe to come into the Treaſury of this ſtate, it is reaſonable and juſt that the temporary relief which by the ſaid recited Acts was granted, &amp;c. ſhould alſo ceaſe."</p>
                        <p>In theſe recitals we diſcover no intention to annul the debt, but we ſee very ſtrong ones for withdrawing the funds and providing no others at that time; Congreſs had the power, and therefore, there could be no doubt of their having the will;—the proper funds were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the ſtate and veſted in Congreſs;—the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was reſtored to the proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and therefore the plain language of this preamble is, that as we are under no obligation to provide other funds, we will not do it at preſent, but we will give you an opportunity of receiving back your old certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, in order to apply to your original debtor for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before you ſhall look to us who are but the guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee.</p>
                        <p>Again, the preamble after reciting the law of 1786 and ſome former ones, ſays "It is reaſonable and juſt that the <hi>alterations</hi> of the ſaid recited laws herein after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſhould be made." Can any thing ſhew more clearly than this, that they were to be <hi>altered,</hi> not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; amended,</hi> not <hi>repealed?</hi> and if ſo, that part was to
<pb n="568" facs="unknown:027132_0576_0FD353144FD81F30"/>
remain, and <hi>that</hi> part is ſo much thereof as was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed debt.</p>
                        <p>But further ſays the preamble; "It is reaſonable and juſt that the <hi>temporary</hi> relief granted by the ſaid recited Acts ſhould ceaſe." Let us ſee, Mr. Speaker, what this temporary relief was, and when we know this we ſhall have the Legiſlature's own declaration of what was deemed reaſonable and juſt to do—The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal was made payable at the end of ten years, but it was not ſecured on any grounds; this was hard upon the creditors, who had long ſought in vain for their juſt rights—The finances of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> did not admit of her promiſing payment of the principal at an earlier period, nor of fixing on any funds even for that time; —but in conſideration of their diſtreſſes, ſhe granted them <hi>temporary relief,</hi> and that temporary relief was,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. The payment of the intereſt half yearly during ten years but no longer; and,</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. As ſhe wiſhed to diſpoſe of her back lands, and found much difficulty in doing it, ſhe agreed to receive New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in payment for her back lands.</p>
                        <p>And ſhe provided that both of theſe ſhould be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the United States and be deducted from her quota—We now ſee what this <hi>temporary relief</hi> was, which it <hi>was reaſonable and juſt ſhould ceaſe;</hi> we find that it had no relation to the validity of the certificate; that it was confined to payments out of the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> and after this, the conſtruction muſt be a very ſtrained one indeed, which ſuppoſes that the Legiſlature thought it reaſonable and juſt that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates <hi>ſhould be cancelled and the debt aboliſhed!</hi>—Had ſuch been the intention, would not the preamble have ſaid ſo? Or could ſuch be the intention, when the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is ſo very different?—To <hi>ceaſe,</hi> and to <hi>aboliſh,</hi> are different things, in the one caſe the thing which ceaſed may begin again: in the other it is deſtroyed and gone forever.—But if this were not ſo, yet it is only the <hi>temporary relief</hi> which was to ceaſe, and we
<pb n="569" facs="unknown:027132_0577_0FD35300BA095C60"/>
we have ſeen what that temporary relief was. The words temporary relief, can with no kind of propriety be applied to a debt made payable <hi>at the diſtance of ten years,</hi> without any funds being provided for its diſcharge at that time, or means of compelling the Legiſlature to provide them at all. The words <hi>future</hi> relief might be applicable to ſuch a caſe, but I have not a very clear idea of that kind of temporary relief which I muſt wait ten years for, and I therefore conclude that it was not intended to aboliſh the debt itſelf. The reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for repealing certain parts of the Act of 1786, may be a good one, but it is no reaſon for a total ſilence reſpecting that part of the law of 1786, which aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the debt, if a repeal of it was really intended.</p>
                        <p>I ſay a <hi>total ſilence,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>aſſumption,</hi> for I can find nothing at all reſpecting it, in the clauſe in queſtion.—Let us, Mr. Speaker, pay a little more minute attention, to theſe <hi>all-powerful</hi> words,— "So much of every Act, &amp;c. as <hi>directs or ſecures</hi> the <hi>payment of the principal ſum or of the intereſt,</hi> beyond the term of four years, ſhall be, and the ſame is hereby repealed, and made null and void."</p>
                        <p>Unleſs theſe words deſtroy the debt, it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that there is any thing in the Act of 1789 which can have that effect—The words "ſo much as <hi>directs the payment of the principal or intereſt,"</hi> can with no kind of propriety be ſaid to have the leaſt operation in the way contended.—<hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by her Act of 1786 <hi>directed</hi> her proper officer, to pay the intereſt half yearly, until the end of the ten years, out of her quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta of the debt of the United States; ſhe alſo directed her proper officer to pay the principal out of the ſame quota at her Land-office, to ſuch perſons as might be willing to accept of payment in that way; but ſhe <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi> no other payment to be made, nor did ſhe make any proviſion for it. In 1789 ſhe <hi>directed</hi> that theſe payments ſhould ceaſe, and ſhe did this with great propriety, becauſe theſe payments in the manner <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> and out of a fund not <hi>at her diſpoſal,</hi> were at
<pb n="570" facs="unknown:027132_0578_0FD3534A0633A968"/>
all times ſo improper, that no Act of hers could render them legal.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore clear that this part of the clauſe, does not afford even the ſemblance of reaſon, for the ſtrange ſuppoſition that the law of 1789 meant to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the debt, or to do any thing more than to <hi>unfund</hi> it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if the expreſſion be allowable, it had been <hi>fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> on <hi>funds,</hi> which ſhe had no right to <hi>fund</hi> it upon.</p>
                        <p>But it is ſaid, that the Act of 1789, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed ſo much of the Act of 1786, as <hi>directed</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. but alſo ſo much of it as <hi>ſecured</hi> payment; and it is contended that whatever the conſtruction may be of the former expreſſion, that the latter will admit of nothing leſs than an abſolute annihilation of the debt.</p>
                        <p>This ſeems, Sir, to be conſidered by our enemies as their ſtrong ground, but I nevertheleſs believe that they may without difficulty be driven from it by regular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and fair argument, and I ſhall proceed in this way, with full confidence of ſucceſs and of complete victory.</p>
                        <p>"SO MUCH AS SECURE PAYMENT"—What do theſe words imply? Why that ſo much of the Act of 1786 as provided the means or afforded ſecurity for payment ſhould be repealed. But how far did it provide the means or afford ſecurity or give a pledge for payment? Why it gave and it pledged as ſecurity for payment of the intereſt for ten years, the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> of the debt of the United States—The repeal of this part of the law of 1786 which only related to the intereſt, has ſurely nothing to do with the deſtruction of the principal—But it may be ſaid, that it alſo gave as a pledge or ſecurity for redeeming the principal, the right of paying the New-Loan certificates at the Land-office in exchange for vacant lands.—Admitting that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the principal was in this manner not only <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,</hi> but <hi>ſecured,</hi> what is the conſequence of a repeal of this proviſion of ſecurity? Why ſurely not an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of the debt; or any thing more than a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative declaration that however juſt, legal and laſting
<pb n="571" facs="unknown:027132_0579_0FD352CC3A860A58"/>
the debt may be, the payment of it ſhall not be <hi>ſecured</hi> in this particular way, becauſe it was not in the power of the Legiſlature of 1786 to ſecure the payment out of her quota, and therefore ſo far as that Act ſecures the payment we repeal it becauſe it ſecured payment from funds not belonging to or at the diſpoſal of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Did the Act of 1786 ſecure payment in any other manner than has been mentioned? ſurely not—It muſt I think be admitted, that an aſſumption of a debt by a ſovereign and independent ſtate, without funding it, or providing any means for payment, does not ſecure its payment; ſince there is no office to apply to for payment;—no officer directed to make payment;—no funds provided from which payment is to be made;— no means of compelling the commonwealth to provide ſuch funds; no proceſs by which ſhe is ameanable to her own citizens; or in ſhort any poſſible mode whereby the creditor can, independant of the will and pleaſure of the ſtate, be ſecure in his payment under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. If this is really the caſe, and I can perceive no room for doubting it, the concluſion neceſſarily follows, that the payment of the New-Loan debt was only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the law of 1786 on the quota of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and that the withdrawing of that ſecurity did not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the debt, altho' it was left without the means of payment until ſome other means ſhould be provided— Whether ſuch means were afterwards provided or not, will be a queſtion of ſubſequent enquiry.</p>
                        <p>If the payment of the principal and intereſt of the New-Loan debt was ſecured, <hi>other than has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi> it muſt have been ſecured in <hi>ſome particular way or manner;</hi> for to ſay that a <hi>thing is done,</hi> but that it is <hi>not done in any particular way or manner;</hi> would be to talk a language which no rational man will do.—We very well know in <hi>what way and in what manner,</hi> the payment of the intereſt was ſecured; and we alſo know in <hi>what way,</hi> and in <hi>what manner</hi> the payment of the principal at the Land-Office was ſecured; but we know
<pb n="572" facs="unknown:027132_0580_0FD3532DA946DD30"/>
of no other way or manner in which either of them was ſecured, and of <hi>courſe they were not ſecured at all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is contended indeed, that the iſſuing of the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, was ſecuring the payment of them; and we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of of the poſition ſo far as funds were provided and pledged for that purpoſe, but beyond this we ſay it is not tenable. There is ſurely a wide difference between <hi>evidence</hi> of a debt, and <hi>ſecurity</hi> for its payment, and the one may exiſt without the other. This doctrine may be well exemplified by caſes which have been determined under the ſtatutes of limitation. If I have a note of hand of ſo long ſtanding, as that a recovery is barred by any of theſe ſtatutes, it is evidence of my debt, but it does not ſecure the payment, becauſe I can have no remedy to enforce a recovery. The debt is not however deſtroyed under theſe circumſtances, but ſtill exiſts, and if the debtor by his will provides a <hi>fund</hi> for the payment of his debts <hi>generally,</hi> and directs his executor to pay them out of that fund, without making any particular mention of ſuch as are barred by lenghth of time, I am now intitled to payment. Juſt ſo it is, I apprehend, with reſpect to certificates in the caſe put by our opponents. The certificate is evidence of the debt, and if it be a funded one, it is <hi>ſecurity</hi> for its payment; otherwiſe not, until future means of payment are provided, becauſe until then there is no poſſible mode of <hi>compelling payment,</hi> and without this, it is idle to talk, of, <hi>the certificates ſecuring payment!</hi> —Juſt ſo was the caſe with reſpect to the <hi>unfunded</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates— It is admitted that they were evidences of a debt, altho' they did not <hi>ſecure the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of that debt, for the reaſons mentioned. Juſt ſo was the caſe too with reſpect to the old paper-money or bills of credit if they were not funded; and juſt ſo it is with reſpect to all unfunded debts of every deſcription. The debt exiſts and the certificate, &amp;c. is evidence of it, but it does not ſecure its payment.</p>
                        <p>It has been relied on, Sir, as a concluſive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable
<pb n="573" facs="unknown:027132_0581_0FD3538AC9DE2368"/>
argument againſt the defendant, "That the Act of 1786 authoriſed the doing of but three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">"1ſt. The receiving the certificates of the United States upon loan.</p>
                        <p n="2">"2d. The iſſuing of State certificates in lieu of, or exchange for them; and,</p>
                        <p n="3">"3d. The payment of the New-Loan debt, or the ſums mentioned in the State ſecurities.</p>
                        <p>"And that as the firſt and ſecond of theſe things had been done, there was nothing for the Act of 1789 to operate upon, but the deſtruction of the New-Loan debt, and therefore that its deſtruction muſt have been intended."</p>
                        <p>Whether this reaſoning is ingenious or not, is not worth an enquiry, ſince if it is not <hi>valid,</hi> it cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the defendant, and his counſel have no objection to yielding the palm of ingenuity to their learned friends but adverſaries.</p>
                        <p>That it is not ſolid, and I wiſh to prove nothing elſe, will I think appear from the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—However true it may be, that the Act of 1786 directed but three things; yet it is equally true, that it directed and ſecured the laſt of them to be done in a way which it had no right to do, and therefore, the Act of 1789 with great propriety repealed ſo much of the Act of 1786 as directed or ſecured payment; ſince <hi>that</hi> direction and <hi>that</hi> ſecurity, were founded on a breach of faith, and were beyond the power of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> to give.</p>
                        <p>Nor is it true, that in the year 1789 the Legiſlature had nothing to do, but to deſtroy the New-Loan debt altogether, or to permit its continuance, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering payment to be made in the manner, and out of the funds provided by the Act of 1786—In 1789 the following queſtions preſented themſelves to the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature:</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. Shall the payments <hi>directed</hi> and <hi>ſecured</hi> by the Act of 1786, our of a fund which did not belong to
<pb n="574" facs="unknown:027132_0582_0FD35315DC970BC8"/>
                           <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to be continued, <hi>out of that fund?</hi> And the anſwer was; <hi>no.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2d. Shall ſuch payments ceaſe for the preſent, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they can no longer be made out of that fund, which by her voluntary Act ſhe is now deprived of? and the anſwer was <hi>yes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3d. Shall ſo much of the debt as ſhall remain due in the year 1796 be now funded and provided for? and the anſwer was that as Congreſs have the power and the means of payment, there can be no doubt of their compliance, and therefore, that <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe is, of the revenues ariſing from impoſts, on imports and exports, will ſtop payment at preſent, and conſider in future the propriety of its revival, or final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Shall the debt be cancelled and deſtroyed?</p>
                        <p>This laſt; this bold and deſperae; this ſcandalous and perfiduous; this unconſtitutional and impious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Legiſlature of 1789, did not dare, nor was it ſo currupt as to adopt—but it adopted a meaſure not only free from perfidy and impiety, but in ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with its federal duties;—<hi>that</hi> of withdrawing the <hi>ſtolen</hi> funds provided for payment, and it carefully avoided the commiſſion of a new breach of faith, by cancelling the aſſumption, at the very moment of atton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a former one, by reſtoring the pilfered property.</p>
                        <p>Had the Legiſlature of 1789 contemplated the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> nefarious deſign, its language would have been plain and explicit, and the abolition of the New-Loan debt, would (in caſe of a non re-exchange) have been declared in terms clear and unequivocal; unleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are to ſuppoſe the Legiſlature of 1789, to have been no leſs corrupt than one branch of the preſent Legiſlature, ſeems to ſuppoſe the Legiſlature of 1786 to have been—but of this hereafter.</p>
                        <p>In order to prove, that a total deſtruction of the New-Loan debt was intended by the Act of 1789, and that this was within the power of the Legiſlature, it has been warmly urged, that the Act of 1786 was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<pb n="575" facs="unknown:027132_0583_0FD352DE4AAF07F8"/>
intended to be, of but ſhort duration; and to give colour to this doctrine, the words <hi>"temporary relief,"</hi> which appear in the Act of 1789 have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being underſtood, been perverted to anſwer this purpoſe. The gentlemen tell us that theſe words fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Legiſlative conſtruction in their favor, and that this being the caſe, the honorable Senate have nothing to do but to abide by that conſtruction; a conſtruction ſay they, which ſhews that <hi>Pennſylvnnia</hi> meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the right of <hi>aboliſhing</hi> the New-Loan debt at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and of <hi>demanding</hi> the new certificates in exchange for the old ones.</p>
                        <p>I am ſorry, Mr. Speaker, to have occaſion for obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that white the Repreſentatives of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> affect ſo much anxiety for her rights, as to give daily attendance here, they are ſo careleſs of her honor, as to remain <hi>unmoved,</hi> while that honor is ſo deeply wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their honorable managers and learned counſel! Do theſe words appear in the law of 1786? They do not. Is not the conſtruction of a law to be ſought for in the law itſelf? It certainly <hi>is.</hi> Would not this kind of reaſoning authoriſe the paſſing of "an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law, of law impairing the obligation of contracts on every occaſion? It certainly would, by declaring the former one, to have been intended but as a <hi>temporary one!</hi> Does the law of 1786 contain a ſingle word which can poſſibly lead to ſuch a conſtruction? It does <hi>not.</hi> Does every certificate iſſued under that law, contain an abſolute and unconditional promiſe for payment, at all events? and does that law expreſsly direct that they ſhall contain ſuch a promiſe? Theſe things <hi>cannot be denied.</hi> Are not all ſuch certificates transferrable and made payable to bearer? They <hi>are,</hi> If <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> meant to reſerve the rights contended for under the <hi>benign auſpices</hi> of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, was it honourable? was it candid? was it fair? or to make uſe of more proper language; if ſhe had ſuch <hi>covert views,</hi> was it not fraud; perfidy; baſeneſs in the extreme! to direct the iſſuing of certificates, which
<pb n="576" facs="unknown:027132_0584_0FD3534BC7099320"/>
on the face of them contained an abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſe for payment? Let thoſe who counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſuch a conſtruction anſwer theſe queſtons! But the words <hi>"temporary relief,"</hi> uſed in the Act of 1789 <hi>only</hi> relate, as has already been ſhewn, to the <hi>temporary</hi> payment of intereſt, and the <hi>temporary</hi> diſcharge of the principal and intereſt at the Land-office. This <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief only,</hi> was to ceaſe; no other temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was afforded; and therefore nothing can be more clear, than that every thing beyond this temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was to continue.</p>
                        <p>But the gentlemen tell us "That the Act of 1786 was but a ſubſtitute for the Act of 1785, and as one was temporary ſo was the other."—This kind of logic may perhaps do very well in the Houſe of Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives, when Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is the object, but it will not go down here—If it ſhould prevail it will prove that no ſubſequent law can be of longer duration than a preceding one! It will prove that the law of 1785, being a ſubſtitute for that of September 1783, could be of no longer continnuance! It will prove, that the law of Sept, 1783, being a ſubſtitute for that of March 1783, could be of no longer continuance! and of courſe that the law of 1786 only granted one years intereſt! The truth is, Mr. Speaker, that all new laws on the ſame ſubject, are intended to make different proviſion, of ſome kind or other from the former ones, and it generally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the firſt law is limited to a ſhort period, but that after experience has manifeſted its utility, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is taken off, and it is, with the neceſſary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, made perpetual. On this principle we find that when <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> meant to afford temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief <hi>only;</hi> ſhe ſaid ſo; but that when ſhe meant that her law ſhould be <hi>perpetual,</hi> ſhe did not think proper to <hi>limit it,</hi> as ſhe had formerly done.</p>
                        <p>The ſame kind of logic, Sir, makes its appearance again, and we are next told, "That as the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors had no more merit in the year 1786, than they had in the year 1785, there could be no reaſon for
<pb n="577" facs="unknown:027132_0585_0FD3532F687C49D0"/>
granting them greater relief in the laſt year, than in the former one, and that it may be therefore fairly conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not intended."—To this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they had no more merit in the year 1786 than they had in the year 1783, and that therefore this argument, if it proves any thing at all, proves that the law of 1786 was only intended to make proviſion for one year's intereſt! If <hi>all</hi> Legiſlatures, at <hi>all</hi> times, thought <hi>preciſely alike,</hi> on the ſame ſubject; and if the ſituation of the country, the finances of the State, and <hi>all other</hi> circumſtances, were at <hi>all times</hi> the ſame, this argument might claim ſome attention; but as this is not the caſe, it would be but a waſte of time to enter upon its ſerious refutation.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> only contemplated the payment of ſo much of the debt of the United States, as was due to her own citizens, but her finances did not admit of it; ſhe therefore at firſt afforded tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief, and in the year 1786 made an abſolute engagement; and that abſolute engagement remained, although from the circumſtances already mentioned, the holders of the certificates were deprived of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief provided for them.</p>
                        <p>(Here Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> read ſeveral paſſages in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the Aſſembly of the 24th of December, 1784, page 97-8-9-100-1, in order to prove that <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> at that early period, contemplated the aſſumption of the debt due to her own citizens; and then proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as follows)—</p>
                        <p>We have alſo been told, Sir, that the Act of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1780, making up the depreciation, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the old certificates to be given up, as the Act of 1786 did, and that therefore it was intended in 1786, that the old certificates ſhould be delivered to the State, to be held until ſhe might think proper to demand a re-exchange; but to this the anſwer is eaſy and muſt ſatisfactory; that the Act of December 1780 did not aſſume the debt, but only provided for making up the depreciation, and of courſe, the certificates ought
<pb n="578" facs="unknown:027132_0586_0FD3533147869320"/>
to remain in the hands of the holders, and could with no propriety be aſked for by the State.</p>
                        <p>Only one argument more, Mr. Speaker, connected with the preſent queſtion, remains to be anſwered, and a moſt extraordinary one it is.</p>
                        <p>In February 1793, when the game had been ſtarted, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives were in full chace, they, if the manager's conſtruction be right, provided themſelves with an inſtrument of deſtruction, and a dreadful one it will be, unleſs we can diſarm them of it. At that time they paſſed a law, proving as the managers ſay, that the New-Loan debt was aboliſhed by the Act of 1789, and no longer exiſted as a debt due from <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> This was long after all the tranſactions had taken place on which the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is found, it was after they had commenced their enquiries and the charges; it was at a time when they were maturing them for his conviction; and this act of his accuſers is now brought forward as a Legiſlative conſtruction in order to inſure his conviction! Had ſuch an Act been paſſed by any other ſet of men than his accuſers, and if ſuch was their intention, it might have been imputed to the wantonneſs of power merely; but when it is conſidered that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> could not know that ſuch a law would paſs; that it is ſufficient for a man to ſquare his actions according to the exiſting law; that this Act was paſſed by his accuſers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; after the accuſation had commenced, and is now relied on by them, in order to enſure his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> language affords not a name for ſuch a proceeding.</p>
                        <p>The Roman hiſtory is a hiſtory of the <hi>tyranny</hi> of <hi>tyrants;</hi> of the <hi>deſpotiſm of deſpots;</hi> but it is ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for them, that they were unacquainted with liberty, and that ſlavery appeared in a form leſs haggard from being familiar to than from the cradle. But in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> law is a rule <hi>preſcribed,</hi> commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is wrong; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>preſcribed</hi> but <hi>promulgated</hi> made known. <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula</hi>
                           <pb n="579" facs="unknown:027132_0587_0FD352DFC131C170"/>
wrote his laws in ſmall characters, and hung them on high pillars to enſnare his people, yet with trouble a knowledge of them might be obtained; not ſo with reſpect to an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law, interpreting that to be a crime, which at the time of the commiſſion was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent—againſt ſuch weapons, prudence is no ſecurity; circumſpection no ſafeguard; innocence no ſhield— The placing ſuch a weapon therefore in the hands of the honorable managers and learned council, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the purpoſe for which it has been uſed, can only be equalled by theſe champions of juſtice and of law, voting one of the articles of impeachment, upon <hi>being told of what a perſon had ſaid when not under oath!</hi> When doubts aroſe upon the conſtruction of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> laws, the caſe was ſtated to the emperor for his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and his anſwers or reſcripts had in <hi>ſucceeding caſes,</hi> the force of laws—This, ſays Doctor <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> was certainly a bad method. To interrogate, (ſays he) the Legiſlature to decide particular diſputes, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endleſs but affords great room for <hi>partiality and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was aboliſhed by the Emperor <hi>Macrinus,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our opponents doctrine we now ſee it revived in <hi>Pennſlyvania,</hi> even in a criminal caſe; after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; and by the accuſers!</p>
                        <p>If, Mr. Speaker, my principles are hitherto ſound, it will I think follow as a neceſſary conſequence, <hi>"That the New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribable to the loan of the</hi> United States, <hi>and of courſe were redeemable at the Treaſury of</hi> Pennſylvania."</p>
                        <p>It is ſtated, I think, by one of the Managers, that the Act of Congreſs of the 8th of May, 1792, is but a continuation of that of the 4th of Auguſt, 1790, ſo far as relates to the preſent queſtion, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of both muſt be the ſame—That of the 4th of Auguſt 1790, enacts that "The ſums which ſhall be ſubſcribed to the loan, ſhall be payable in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt of the certificates, or notes, which prior to 1ſt of January laſt, were iſſued by the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective
<pb n="580" facs="unknown:027132_0588_0FD352CEE3CFC150"/>
ſtates, as acknowledgments or evidences of debts by them reſpectively owing, (except certain ones of the ſtate of <hi>North-Carolina)</hi> with a proviſo, that none ſuch ſhould be received, but ſuch as had been iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued for compenſations and expenditures towards the proſecution of the late war."—What were the New-Loan certificates? Surely they were iſſued by <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> as evidences or acknowledgements of debts.</p>
                        <p>But, ſay the gentlemen, however true this may be, yet that they were not iſſued for compenſations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures towards the proſecution of the late war, but in lieu of other certificates.</p>
                        <p>What argument can be more fallacious than this? were they not iſſued for payment of ſuch compenſations in lieu of other certificates, on which payment could not be obtained? and do they not therefore come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the letter and the ſpirit of the Act of Congreſs? The debts of the deſcription already mentioned, were due from the <hi>United States;</hi> they were unable to pay them, and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſaid to her citizens; give us your cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, that we may be reimburſed, and we will give you new ones for the payment of your compenſations, and expenditures during the late war.—This was only a change of the ſecurity and of the perſon who was to pay; but the debt was the ſame; it was due to the ſame perſons, and from the ſame cauſe, and the only altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which took place was, that payment was to be made by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> inſtead of the United States. Does this alter the nature of the debt, or the cauſe from which it aroſe? ſurely not. Does one perſon becoming ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the debt of another, change the riſe or origin of that debt? No man of common ſenſe, will in the moments of ſerious reflection advance ſo wild a poſition.</p>
                        <p>If proofs in ſupport of this reaſoning are required, they are furniſhed by,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. The implied admiſſion of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and it is therefore reaſonable to conclude, that we are beholden to the <hi>ingenuity</hi> of their <hi>ingenious</hi>

                        <p n="2">2d. The opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſury, expreſſed in his circular letter to the Commiſſioners of Loans throughout the U. S. (See p. 272-3) in the moſt clear, pointed and unequivocal terms, in our favour on this ſubject,—Great as that illuſtrious character is, I do not quote his opinion as any evidence of the law; but as it appears that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> knew of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and as criminality of intention, is eſſential to the commiſſion of a crime, it is certainly material to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that he knew that he was acting conformably to the opinion of the diſtinguiſhed head of an important department; who in addition to his <hi>great law</hi> abilities, ſeems to embrace a large portion of the circle of ſcience, at a ſingle glance, and as it were by intuition to penetrate, develope, comprehend, and to be able in a moment to elucidate every minute part of each of them. —If however opinion is to be reſorted to; I aſk of what weight can the opinion of the whole Houſe of Repreſentatives be, when weighed againſt that of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Hamilton? Alexander</hi> the copperſmith, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, would not form ſo ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contraſt.</p>

Congreſs by their law of the 4th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1790, expreſſed themſelves in ſuch clear and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed language in this particular, as muſt entirely obviate the objection and force conviction, even on the minds of infidels—In declaring what debts ſhould be ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, they by the 13th ſect. of that law enacted, that "The ſums which ſhould be ſubſcribed to the ſaid loan, ſhould be payable in the principal and intereſt of the certificates or notes, which prior to the 1ſt day of January laſt, were iſſued by the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive ſtates as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments or evidences of debts by them reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively owing, for compenſations and expenditures, for ſervices or ſupplies towards the proſecution of the late war, and the defence of the United States;" with an exception as to certain ones, iſſued by the ſtate of <hi>North-Carolina;</hi>
                           <pb n="582" facs="unknown:027132_0590_0FD35317499D97F8"/>
but, (17th and 18th ſect.) as certain ſtates had reſpectively iſſued their own certificates, in exchange for thoſe of the United States, whereby it might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that intereſt might be twice payable on the ſame ſums; it was further enacted, that the payment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whether to ſtates or to individuals, in reſpect to the debt of any ſtate, by which ſuch exchange ſhould have been made, ſhould be ſuſpended, until it ſhould appear to the ſatisfaction of the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury that certificates iſſued for that purpoſe by ſuch ſtate had been re-exchanged or redeemed; or until thoſe which ſhould not have been re-exchanged or redeemed ſhould be ſurrendered to the United States."</p>
                        <p>Could language be more explicit than this? Were theſe certificates not <hi>iſſued as acknowledgments or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of debt?</hi> Were they not iſſued, in lieu of others, for ſuch <hi>compenſations</hi> and <hi>expenditures</hi> as are here mentioned? Or if not; are they not ſuch as were ſpecially provided for by the 17th and 18th ſections of the law juſt read? And yet ſay the gentlemen, they were not ſubſcribable, even independent of the repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act of 1789! But why not ſubſcribable? Why ſay our opponents, becauſe the 17th and 18th ſections were inſerted leſt a <hi>very few</hi> of the New-Loan certificates, might be ſubſcribed <hi>by miſtake.</hi>—But is any ſuch reaſon aſſigned, or can any thing like it be diſcovered in either of theſe ſections? Surely not; but on the contrary, the reaſon, the letter and the ſpirit of the law are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and there is nothing but ingenuity to reſtrain it, to a <hi>very few caſes happening by miſtake.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it is objected, that none were ſubſcribable but ſuch as were <hi>recogniſed</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> by the ſtate, and it is added, that theſe were rejected by the law of 1789, and could not therefore be ſubſcribable, <hi>even though that Act were void.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer; that in no part of the Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, do we find, that to render a ſtate debt ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the loan of the United States; it muſt be <hi>recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> by the ſtate. The words are,
<pb n="583" facs="unknown:027132_0591_0FD3534E138E64B8"/>
"Shall be payable in certificates, iſſued by the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive ſtates, as acknowledgments and evidences of debts by them owing"—Theſe certificates were iſſued by the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as <hi>acknowledgments and evidences</hi> of debts by her owing, and if theſe debts ſtill continue, they are <hi>acknowledgments</hi> and <hi>evidences</hi> thereof, and of courſe are ſubſcribable, whether ſhe now chuſes to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> them or not. Can a debtor, by refuſing to <hi>recogniſe</hi> and acknowledge a debt, alter the nature of that debt, or leſſen his obligation to pay it? Let us, Mr. Speaker, examine this doctrine a little further—The gentlemen ſay, that theſe debts were not ſubſcribable, <hi>even though the law of</hi> 1789 <hi>were void;</hi> becauſe the paſſing of it, ſhewed, that it was not the <hi>will</hi> of the ſtate to <hi>recogniſe</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> them— The <hi>law of the ſtate</hi> is the <hi>will of that State.</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>ſhort of that law, can manifeſt that will.</hi> The law is the only <hi>organ</hi> by which the ſtate can expreſs her will, and ſhe cannot do it in any other way—ſhe can <hi>recogniſe</hi> nothing; ſhe can <hi>acknowledge</hi> nothing, but by her law—By the law of 1786 ſhe <hi>recogniſed;</hi> ſhe <hi>acknowledged</hi> the New-Loan debt, and her <hi>will</hi> being manifeſted upon that occaſion, cannot be withdrawn, nor can her <hi>recognition</hi> or <hi>acknowledgment</hi> ceaſe, unleſs ſhe had <hi>power to repeal,</hi> and actually <hi>did repeal</hi> the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the New Loan debt—yet we are told that the Act of 1789 <hi>even if null and void, and not the law of the State, manifeſted the will of the State!</hi>—It has been added, Sir, "That the late Houſe of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by voting, that the law of 1789 rendered the New-Loan certificates no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt due from <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhewed that <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> did not acknowledge the debt, and that therefore it not ſubſcribable:" If, Sir, that Houſe <hi>(but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle branch of the Legiſlature)</hi> paſſed that vote, with the intention, that this uſe ſhould be made of it, the guilty Members ought to have ſtood, where Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> now does, and received at leaſt as heavy a puniſhment as can be demanded upon him—I freely aquit them
<pb n="584" facs="unknown:027132_0592_0FD352D24CC827E0"/>
however of any ſuch intention, while I muſt expreſs my aſtoniſhment, at the attempt which has been made!</p>
                        <p>But we are told that "The Governor and the other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of government do not recogniſe the debt, and therefore the debt was not ſubſcribable."—What ſtrange doctrine, Sir, have I now to encounter! What right has the Governor, or any officer of government, to <hi>recogniſe</hi> or to <hi>reject</hi> any thing, but what is <hi>recogniſed or rejected by the law?</hi>—If by a ſolemn exiſting law, the debt is recogniſed, can that be prevented by the Governor's will?—Suppoſe his will, and the will of the ſtate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by her law, to be different, which muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail? If the doctrine contended for is true, the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſhould have been impeached, for acting, not againſt law, but againſt the opinion or will of the Governor— or perhaps, againſt the opinion or will of the Attorney-General, which in queſtions of law, directs the opinion or will of the Governor, and who is now of counſel againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us next, Sir, examine the opinion of the late Attorney-General of the U. S. ſince it has been given in evidence, and relied on by the proſecutors. (See p. 81-2.)</p>
                        <p>Without taking the objection, as I certainly might, that in point of law, this opinion is not legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I ſhall wave the objection; ſince it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appear, that the opinion is ſo <hi>harmleſs,</hi> as to be of no conſequence either way—The public diſcuſſion of the propriety of an opinion, of a brother practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is an unpleaſing taſk, but when it is given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in order to ſhew what the law is, it becomes as fair an object of free examination, as the opinion of a Judge when under examination upon a writ of error.</p>
                        <p>The late Attorney-General <hi>was</hi> "of opinion that the New-Loan certificates were aboliſhed by the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and the 20<hi>th of March,</hi> and 1ſt of April, 1790," but as no Act of any kind was paſſed on the 20<hi>th of March,</hi> 1790, except one for the ſale of the barracks at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and another for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the tax upon writs, it is fair to conclude, that
<pb n="585" facs="unknown:027132_0593_0FD352F7CFA31CE0"/>
this opinion was given, without much <hi>enquiry, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but very little conſideration.</hi> This ſuppoſition is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more than probable, when we conſider, that in the courſe of the trial, it has been often ſtated and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied, that the ſame gentleman afterwards gave and I preſume on more mature reflection) an opinion on the ſame point, on the other ſide of the queſtion! The laſt opinion, tho' often called for, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.—We have traced it to the hands of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of impeachments, and as it is ſtated without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be in favor of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> it may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been thought <hi>worth preſerving.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the opinion which does appear, he begins with ſaying—"What may be the reſult of a conteſt between the holders of thoſe certificates, and the ſtate of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> I preſume not to determine—But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the United States, and that State I have no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in deciding," and he concludes by ſaying—"I am of opinion, that the Acts of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th of March, and 1ſt of April 1790, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed theſe certificates as debts of the ſtate, except for the purpoſe of being re-exchanged for Continental certificates, and therefore that the former, as wanting the due recognition from that State, cannot be legally received upon loan."</p>
                        <p>It is not eaſy to comprehend, and it is ſtill more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to reconcile the various parts of this opinion— Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> ſeems not to have been able to <hi>eſtabliſh the premiſes</hi> either way, but to have been very capable of <hi>drawing his concluſion,</hi> with great clearneſs. If a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion without premiſes, is to be regarded, the weight of his authority is againſt us, but if premiſes are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to a concluſion, it will be found that his opinion can be of no weight at all.</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid, Sir, that Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> drew his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion without determining on the premiſes, and that this was the caſe will ſufficiently appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks—"What may be the reſult," ſays he, "of a conteſt, between the holders of thoſe certificates,
<pb n="586" facs="unknown:027132_0594_0FD35332D397ABB8"/>
and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania, I preſume not to determine,"</hi> and I undertake to prove that without firſt determining this, or at leaſt forming an opinion of the law on the ſubject, it was impoſſible for him to give an opinion on the queſtion ſubmitted to him, or to draw any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatever. The queſtion of law was preciſely the ſame, between the then holders of the certificates, and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as it would be, between the United States, (ſhould they become the holders) and <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>—The certificates were transferrable and payable to bearer; if therefore they were <hi>valid</hi> in the hands of the then holders, they would be equally ſo, when in the poſſeſſion of the United States; but if they were not <hi>valid</hi> in the hands of the then holders, neither could they be ſo, in the poſſeſſion of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States. Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> however finds the queſtion ſo difficult, as between the then holders, and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> that he cannot, or will not preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, but he is nevertheleſs clear in his opinion in favour of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> on the queſtion between her and the United States, ſhould they become the holders or bearers of the certificates. Nothing can I think more fully expoſe the impropriety of this opinion than the caſe which I am about to put.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> a bond is transferrable by aſſignment; theſe certificates were transferrable by delivery. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have a bond from my debtor, who refuſes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ground of its having been already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged—This he alledges to be the caſe; as <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> does with reſpect to the certificates under conſideration, and I deny it, as is done by the certificate-holders.—If I am right, I have a legal claim upon him; and ſo have the holders of certificates if they are right, upon the ſtate; but if I am wrong, I have no ſuch legal claim; in like manner if the holders of the certificates are wrong, they have no ſuch legal claim—If I aſſign the bond, my aſſignee has as good a claim as I had, and in like manner, if the holders of the certificates transfer them to the United States, the United States cannot be
<pb n="587" facs="unknown:027132_0595_0FD3538C43886758"/>
in a worſe ſituation than the holders were—There are many caſes in the law, where the aſſignee or indorſee is in a better ſituation than the original payee was, but there is no caſe in which that ſituation can be worſe: yet Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> determines againſt the transferree, tho' he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to ſay, what the law may be between the original parties!</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir; he is of "opinion, that the Acts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, aboliſhed the certificates as debts of the State, except for the purpoſe of being re-exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," and yet he will not preſume to determine the queſtion! How can he be of opinion that they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, if he can give no opinion between the holders and the State! Since the queſtion of abolition, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether depends on a right opinion being formed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the holders and the State!</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, Sir, the different parts of this opinion are entirely at variance, and the learned gentleman who gave it, appears to have had <hi>"no difficulty in deciding"</hi> while he "could <hi>not preſume to determine!"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It concludes by ſaying, "and therefore the former, to wit, the New-Loan certificates, as wanting the <hi>due recognition</hi> from the State, cannot be legally received upon loan!"—What is meant by theſe words, <hi>"as wanting the due recognition from the State"</hi> I cannot poſſibly ſay, ſince the gentleman who made uſe of them, "will not preſume to give an opinion on the exiſting law of the State, as between her and the holders of the certificates—She cannot, as already obſerved, <hi>recogniſe</hi> them in any other way than by law, and without form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an opinion on the law, it is to me inconceivable how an opinion can be formed, that they want her <hi>due</hi> recognition—If the former parts of the opinion were at variance, this ſeems to be altogether incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!</p>
                        <p>Had the Secretary of the Treaſury been veſted with unlimited diſcretionary powers, to admit of, or reject ſuch ſubſcriptions as might be offered, and had this opinion been intended to direct a prudent exerciſe of
<pb n="588" facs="unknown:027132_0596_0FD353DE04E81A80"/>
ſuch powers, it might perhaps have been leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable—But no diſcretion was left to him; the law of Congreſs was <hi>expreſs and mandatory upon him,</hi> to admit of the ſubſcription of all ſuch debts as were within its meaning.</p>
                        <p>Caution in doubtful caſes was neceſſary, and the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of legal advice was prudent, but if he erred, and under any advice whatever, refuſed ſubſcriptions, which the law authoriſed, he would have been compelled by a <hi>mendamus</hi> from the Supreme Court of the United States, to admit of ſuch ſubſcriptions.</p>
                        <p>Nor had the State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> as has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, any thing to do with the New-Loan certificates being ſubſcribed or not; any more than a perſon, who ſubſcribes a note, or executes a bond, has the right of ordering, or preventing an aſſignment.</p>
                        <p>Wherever the ſecurity is by law transferable, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the holder of it, and to him <hi>only,</hi> if he can find a purchaſer, to ſay, whether he will part with it or not—If the ſuppoſed debtor means to conteſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he may do it after the transfer, as well as before, and in moſt caſes on the ſame principles. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of the the New-Loan debt, to the loan of the United States reſted entirely with <hi>them,</hi> and the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the certificates—If the debt was not due by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſuch ſubſcription could not affect her; if it was due, ſhe could not prevent the ſubſcription, and of courſe the reaſon aſſigned for the New-Loan debt not being ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States, becauſe it wanted the due <hi>recognition</hi> of the State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> is altogether unfounded. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think, that the opinion of the late Attorney-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may with great propriety, be thrown into the old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I ſhall take no notice Sir of the Act of the 1ſt of April, 1790, becauſe, tho' relied on by the late Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General, as one of the Acts which aboliſhed the New-Loan debt, I do not ſee how it can poſſibly affect the queſtion in the ſmalleſt degree. What he has ſaid
<pb n="589" facs="unknown:027132_0597_0FD353E01CF1ED68"/>
reſpecting that Act, as well as a ſuppoſed one of the 30th of March, 1790, ſufficiently ſhews however, that he did not think, the New-Loan debt was aboliſhed by the Act of 1789. His words are "I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Acts of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Aſſembly of the 27th March, 1789, and of the 30th March, and 1ſt of April, 1790, aboliſhed theſe certificates as debts of the ſtate, &amp;c."—This ſurely amounts to a declaration that they were <hi>not aboliſhed,</hi> as has been contended <hi>by the Act of</hi> 1789, <hi>only;</hi> for if they were aboliſhed by that Act, they could not poſſibly be aboliſhed by the three Acts taken together, nor could either of the two laſt operate in the ſmalleſt degree towards <hi>aboliſhing</hi> a thing which had been <hi>aboliſhed</hi> before—It follows then, that unleſs two laſt Acts operate in ſome degree towards <hi>aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the certificates, they are not, on Mr. <hi>Randolph's</hi> conſtruction of the Act of 1789, aboliſhed at this day; but as the only Acts which were paſſed on the 30th of March, 1790 related to the ſale of the barracks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the tax upon writs, they could have no effect in the way contended. The Act of the 1ſt of April, 1790 is altogether ſilent on the ſubject, and no man who reads the whole of it, can fix on any part, which tends in the ſmalleſt degree, to aboliſh either the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates or the debt. If then it is true, as admitted by Mr. <hi>Randolph,</hi> that the Act of 1789 did not <hi>of itſelf</hi> the debt, and if neither that of the 30th of March, nor of the 1ſt of April, 1790, came in aid of it, Mr. <hi>Randolph's</hi> opinion ſhould, on his own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, have been, that the certificates were not <hi>aboliſhed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It has in the next place been alledged, that "The New-Loan certificates, even tho' not aboliſhed, were not ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States," be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay the gentlemen, "They did not bear intereſt" but unfortunately for them, they are no leſs miſtaken here, than in any of their former points: The certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and the law under which they were iſſued declare, that they ſhall bear an intereſt of ſix per cent. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the law of 1789 prevented the holders from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="590" facs="unknown:027132_0598_0FD353E1424F7DE0"/>
the intereſt for the preſent, yet if it did not aboliſh the debt, the intereſt ran on, until means of payment ſhould be provided—a debt does not the leſs bear intereſt, becauſe whether owing to its not being payable till a future day, or to the inability of the defendant, or any other cauſe, the creditor cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure payment for the preſent, and is obliged to wait for both principal and intereſt, until ſome future day. Theſe certificates bore intereſt, and the intereſt as well as the principal would form a ſett-off between the United States, and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It has alſo been ſaid Sir, that no part of the New-Loan debt was ſubſcribed under the firſt Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and as the laſt Act is, in this particular, but a continuation of the former one, it has been concluded, that the debt is not ſubſcribable under either. To this I anſwer, that under the firſt Act, it was not the intereſt of any man to ſubſcribe the New-Loan debt, becauſe at <hi>that time,</hi> means of redeeming it at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> were not provided, and that therefore no one was ſo ſilly as to do an act from which he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no benefit; but that ſuch means of redemption were afterwards provided, and therefore ſuch ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions took place, when they were found to be beneficial. The concluſion, that the New-Loan debt, was not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable under the laſt Act of Congreſs, becauſe no part of it was ſubſcribed under the firſt Act, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then without foundation.</p>
                        <p>The honorable Senate have now Mr. Speaker, heard my reaſons for thinking that "THE NEW-LOAN DEBT WAS SUBSCRIBABLE TO THE LOAN OF THE UNITED STATES," and I proceed to prove, what ſeems to me to be a neceſſary conſequence;—namely,</p>
                        <p>That "IT WAS OF COURSE REDEEMABLE AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>

                        <p>I have ſaid, Sir, that <hi>"Pennſylvania</hi> might redeem theſe debts, without the ſmalleſt injuſtice to herſelf, or any thing more than juſtice to her creditors;" and ſhe herſelf ſhall teſtify to the truth of this doctrine—The United States had done much for their creditors, but ſuch were their arrangements, with reſpect to the ſit <hi>per cent.</hi> the three <hi>per cent.</hi> and the deferred ſtock, that they had not, at leaſt in the opinion of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> done ample juſtice.—<hi>Pennſylvania</hi> therefore by an Act of the 9th of April, 1791, after reciting; "That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs had by their Act of the 4th of Auguſt, 1790. propoſed a certain loan; that a compliance with it would greatly benefit this commonwealth, promote the plan of the general government, and facilitate the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement and liquidation of the accounts depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and the United States; and that in order to induce the creditors of this ſtate to ſubſcribe to the ſaid loan, and at the ſame time, to <hi>preſerve the faith and honor of the commonwealth, by indemnifying them for the injury which they might ſuſtain in conſequence of ſuch ſubſcription,</hi> IT SHOULD BE ENACTED AND IT THEREBY WAS ENACTED, that "Every creditor of this State, who ſhould ſubſcribe to the ſaid loan certificate whereon intereſt ſhould be by law payable annually, at the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhould, beſides the ſaid certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, which ſuch creditor was thereupon entitled to have and receive from the United States, in purſuance of the ſaid recited Act, be entitled to have and receive from the commonwealth, certificates purporting that the ſtate ſtands pledge from the firſt of January next, to pay ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt annually, on that part of the ſubſcribed debt, which is termed the deferred debt, until the United States ſhould make proviſion for the payment of the ſaid intereſt, and alſo that the ſtate ſtands further pledged to pay an additional intereſt of three <hi>per cent.</hi> annually, from the 1ſt of January next, on that part of the ſubſcribed debt, which bears an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="593" facs="unknown:027132_0601_0FD35412EC8CB578"/>
of three <hi>per cent.</hi> which ſaid three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſhould continue to be paid half yearly, unleſs the ſaid United States ſhould at any time thereafter increaſe the rate of intereſt of the ſaid three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock; in which caſe the intereſt to be paid by the ſtate ſhould be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably reduced; and ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt, on that part, termed the deferred debt, ſhould be continued to be paid, half yearly, until the United States ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the payment of the intereſt on the ſaid deferred debt."—I think nothing can be more evident, than the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> manifeſted by this law, that full juſtice ſhould be done to her creditors, by making up the deficiency, unprovided for by the United States; and that ſhe deemed it unjuſt for any of them, to be left without the right of participating in ſome ſhape or other, of the like advantages which this Act afforded— Thoſe of them who ſubſcribed the New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, to the loan of the United States, had this juſtice and no more. The ſuppoſition therefore, that <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> did not mean to afford them the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at her Treaſury, carries with it a high charge of partiality and injuſtice with reſpect to her own citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. If admitted, it would in fact amount to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration on her part, that although the pretenſions and the rights of her creditors were alike, ſhe meant to adminiſter juſtice to them by different weights, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal meaſures; and that while ſhe amply provided for a part of them, ſhe intended, that thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the ſecond loan, <hi>under her own invitation</hi> ſhould ſuſtain a heavy loſs.</p>
                        <p>But exclaim the gentlemen;—were theſe ſubſcribers to have the <hi>enormous</hi> ſum of twenty ſhillings in the pound! No Sir; they were not to have the <hi>enormous</hi> ſum of twenty ſhillings in the pound;—They were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the <hi>juſt</hi> and reaſonable ſum of twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the pound; and that <hi>that</hi> ſum was <hi>juſt</hi> and reaſonable, but not <hi>enormous,</hi> appears,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, From <hi>that</hi> ſum being originally and inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="594" facs="unknown:027132_0602_0FD353E681550C98"/>
due, and ſo acknowledged by <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by her Act which has juſt been read; and</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. From her making up by that Act, to a part of her creditors, the ſame meaſure of juſtice which we now claim for another part of them; <hi>all of whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are admitted to be the ſame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it follows, that on principles of equal juſtice, there is every reaſon to conclude, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intended by her Act of April, 1792, to render the New-Loan debts, ſubſcribed to the loan of the United States, redeemable at her Treaſury.</p>
                        <p>But the gentlemen exclaim again;—"Is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> really intended, by her Act of April, 1792, to put herſelf intirely within the power of the United States, by providing for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of <hi>every ſpecies of pretended debt,</hi> which they might think proper to aſſume!—I anſwer, that nothing can be more certain, than that ſhe did not; and I freely admit, that if the New-Loan debt was not <hi>a real,</hi> but only a <hi>pretended one,</hi> I ſhould be ſo far from contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it it was redeemable, that I ſhould have taken no trouble to prove its exiſtence, or that it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable.</p>
                        <p>We are again told Sir, that the objects of redemption are enumerated in the 2d ſection of the Act of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> of the 10th of April, 1792; and that, at the New-Loan debt is not among them, it is not within the proviſions of that Act, nor redeemable.</p>
                        <p>If the premiſes were admitted to be true, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion might perhaps be incontrovertable, but if they are falſe, it is certainly unwarranted. An examination of them is therefore neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>To me it appears, that THAT ſection of the Act of April, 1792, does not enumerate all the objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.—I admit that it enumerates all the objects of immediate redemption from the particular funds ſpecially provided by the early part of that Act; and I think that I may ſafely make this admiſſion, without weakening, or detracting from my opinion, that the
<pb n="595" facs="unknown:027132_0603_0FD353AD50084B38"/>
ſame Act makes eventual proviſion for caſes not enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in the 2d ſection:—At the time of that Act being paſſed, the firſt loan of the United States was cloſed, and it could not poſſibly be known whether it would or would not be opened again—<hi>eventual</hi> proviſion might therefore be very proper, but, <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> proviſion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt, muſt have been very improper at that time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> then knew that ſhe had <hi>certain debts</hi> to provide for at <hi>all events,</hi> and theſe ſhe enumerated in the 2d ſection and took care to make ſpecial and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular proviſion for;—but ſhe alſo knew, that ſhe owed certain other debts, which ſhe deemed it proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the payment of, or not, as the United States ſhould, or ſhould not open or extend the loan—If they ſhould not, ſhe did not think proper to provide for their redemption, but if they ſhould, ſhe deemed it proper, and I think that, if we carefully attend to the 2d and 6th ſections, it will appear that the firſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> proviſion for the diſcharge of certain debts; the latter to make <hi>eventual</hi> proviſion for certain others, if the loan of the United States ſhould be again opened—That the 2d ſection does not enumerate <hi>all</hi> the objects of redemption at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, is I think evident both from its letter and ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>After providing, in part, an aggregate fund for the immediate diſcharge of the enumerated debts, we find the preamble to the 2d ſection, to be worded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows—"And in order to provide effectually for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of CERTAIN public debts herein after ſpecified, upon juſt and reaſonable terms, "BE IT ENACTED," &amp;c. —The law then proceeds to encreaſe the funds and to direct the order in which <hi>certain</hi> debts ſhall be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Now, Sir, what is the meaning of theſe words, "In order to provide for the redemption of CERTAIN public debts?" Certainly not that <hi>all</hi> of them were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the ſection, which is introduced by theſe words, and the expreſſion clearly ſhews, that <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> acknowledge other ones, beſides the CERTAIN
<pb n="596" facs="unknown:027132_0604_0FD353B3FAC8A908"/>
ones referred to in the preamble, and enumerated in the enacting clauſe. Had not this been the caſe, the expreſſion would have been, In order to provide for the redemption of THE public debts, inſtead of providing for <hi>certain</hi> of them—The expreſſion; THE public debts, would have been the ſame with that of <hi>all</hi> of them, but the words CERTAIN of them have certainly a more confined meaning, and the uſing of this language, ſhews, that ſhe <hi>recogniſed</hi> and acknowledged <hi>other</hi> ones beſides thoſe enumerated in this ſection—But it is not pretended that ſhe owed any other debts than the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated ones, except the <hi>New-Loan debt,</hi> and the <hi>debt</hi> due on the unfunded depreciation certificates. If then the expreſſion uſed in this law, ſhews that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> acknowledged <hi>other</hi> debts, than the enumerated ones, it alſo ſhews, that ſhe acknowledged the New-Loan and unfunded Depreciation-Debts, to which, and to which only, they clearly implied, and ſtrongly marked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception could relate. The truth is, that all the debts enumerated in the 2d ſection, were originally contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and were due from herſelf—ſhe therefore by the firſt and ſecond ſection provided a fund for their <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> diſcharge, and by the 2d ſection, ſhe directs the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which they ſhall be diſcharged out of it; and this neceſſarily lead to their enumeration—But as ſhe did not intend that the New-Loan and unfunded depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation debts, ſhould be paid out of this fund, ſhe could with no propriety enumerate them, as coming within this proviſion, for immediate redemption.— Theſe debts ſhe conſidered as not being originally and properly ſpeaking her own debts, but the debts of the United States, and ſhe therefore thought proper to let them reſt as they were, until the United States ſhould extend or again open their loan, and that their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhould depend on this event taking place or not. This will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the 6th ſection of the ſame law—"Be it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted," ſays that ſection, "That if Congreſs ſhall on or before the firſt of July next, renew and again open
<pb n="597" facs="unknown:027132_0605_0FD353CDE4FC3748"/>
the ſubſcription to the loan heretofore propoſed to the State creditors, or ſhall in <hi>any other manner or upon any other terms,</hi> provide for the aſſumption of the non-ſubſcribed debts, owing to ſuch State creditors, the holders of any certificates, ſubſcribable to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſo renewed, or entitled to the benefit of ſuch other proviſion, ſhall be entitled to receive the nominal value of the ſaid certificates, from the ſtate Treaſurer, upon this condition that they ſhall and do ſubſribe to the loan ſo renewed, or acquieſce in the terms of ſuch other proviſion, and ſhall on or before the ſaid firſt of July next, transfer to the ſtate Treaſurer, for the uſe of commonwealth, every certificate which they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the United States in conſequence of ſuch ſubſcription, or all the intereſts and benefits to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſuch other proviſion, together with the proper evidences thereof."—Congreſs did within the time here mentioned again open their loan, and therefore this ſection which was at firſt but conditional, now became abſolute. If <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> did not acknowledge other debts, beſides theſe enumerated and provided for by the 1ſt and 2d ſections; what uſe was there in inſerting this clauſe? <hi>none at all.</hi>—Its inſertion however clearly ſhews, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> did acknowledge other debts, beſides the <hi>certain</hi> firſt enumerated ones, and that ſhe intended to provide for their redemption, if the loan of the United States ſhould be again opened—But ſhe owed no others, except the <hi>New-Loan and unfunded depreciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debts,</hi> and therefore, ſhe could not by this clauſe <hi>recogniſe</hi> or mean to provide for the <hi>redemption</hi> of any others but theſe.</p>
                        <p>It has been warmly contended, that "The ſecond ſection is equally extenſive with the ſixth, and that the latter does not embrace a ſingle object which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the former." Can any thing more clearly ſhew, the futility of this objection, than by conſidering that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>if it was true,</hi> there could be <hi>no occaſion for the ſixth ſection;</hi> nor can it <hi>poſſibly have any object in view;</hi> and by conſidering further, that the ſecond ſection,
<pb n="598" facs="unknown:027132_0606_0FD353A9E2EDB238"/>
makes <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>certain proviſion,</hi> for the caſes therein mentioned, and that the ſixth ſection only makes <hi>diſtant</hi> and <hi>conditional</hi> proviſion, for the caſes mentioned in it. <hi>Can therefore the caſes be the ſame?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again;—The words <hi>"certain</hi> debts," cannot by any juſt conſtruction, extend to <hi>all</hi> debts; but the words</p>
                        <p>"The holder or holders of <hi>any</hi> certificate or certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates," is the ſame with <hi>every,</hi> or <hi>all,</hi> without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a ſingle one; and that they were ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Legiſlature of April 1792, is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible, from their adding the ſixth ſection; which could not be neceſſary unleſs my conſtruction is right. —In anſwer to this it is true, Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> is brought forward to prove, that the ſixth ſection was intended as a proviſo to the ſecond, and to reſtrain, but not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it—He ſeems fond of appearing in the double ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of counſel and witneſs, but I think that neither his evidence nor his <hi>arguments,</hi> have anſwered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which he was called.—If the ſixth ſection was intended as a proviſo to the ſecond, it would have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a part of it, or at leaſt been attached to it, inſtead of being placed where it is—He tells us indeed that <hi>this was the caſe originally,</hi> but that before the paſſing of the bill into a law, the alteration took place—This may perhaps have been ſo, but if it was, it only proves that an <hi>alteration of intention alſo took place,</hi> and that it was finally concluded that inſtead of its being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo to the ſecond ſection, it ſhould be a ſeparate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, enacting clauſe. What Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> meant or intended, or indeed what one branch of the Legiſlature meant or intended, is immaterial at preſent—The law muſt ſpeak for itſelf, and if this were not the caſe, we might have as many claſhing conſtructions, as there are branches of the Legiſlature.—We have heard much; Sit, of Legiſlative conſtructions, but it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> to fix a conſtruction on this law, by proving what one branch of the Legiſlature, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what <hi>he himſelf</hi> intended! If this be admiſſible, we muſt look, not into the ſtatute book to know what
<pb n="599" facs="unknown:027132_0607_0FD328311785FCE8"/>
the meaning of the law is, but muſt endeavour to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the hidden receſſes of Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> mind, and there grovel for it in the dark!</p>
                        <p>The buſineſs of a proviſo, Sir, is to <hi>reſtrain</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> that which has gone before, but there is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle feature of this kind, in any part of the ſixth ſection. It is not the buſineſs, Sir, of a proviſo, to <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>extend,</hi> but the ſixth ſection is a new, independent clauſe, <hi>enlarging, extending</hi> and making <hi>further</hi> proviſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle condition, or reſtriction, on any thing which had been before enacted—If intended as a proviſo, upon the ſecond ſection; and if intended to relate to the objects contained in it, and to no others, proper terms of reference would have been made uſe of, to connect them together, and to ſhew the dependance of one upon the other—The language of the ſixth ſection would not have been that the "Holders of any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates" ſhall, &amp;c. but it would have been the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>ſaid</hi> certificates; or of the <hi>aforeſaid</hi> certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates; or the certificates <hi>herein before mentioned,</hi> or ſome expreſſion of the like import and meaning, would have been made uſe of, ſo as to confine the proviſions of the ſixth ſection, to the caſes mentioned in the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>Nor is it poſſible, Sir, for that to be a proviſo, which <hi>is more extenſive than the enacting clauſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo that the ſixth ſection has never been conſidered as a proviſo upon the 2d ſection, nor confined to the caſes mentioned in it, is clear from what I am now about to ſay—It is admitted that the unfunded depreciation cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, are not included in the ſecond ſection, and that <hi>that</hi> ſection makes no proviſion for their redemption at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and yet it is in proof, that it has been the conſtant practice, for them to be <hi>ſo redeemed</hi> under the ſixth ſection.</p>
                        <p>Among others who have underſtood the law as I do, and whoſe old unfunded depreciation certificates, were redeemed in this way, were Mr. <hi>Rittenhouſe:</hi> The late Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> Speaker of the Senate, at the time when the redemption law of April, 1792, was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
<pb n="600" facs="unknown:027132_0608_0FD35439F53B6548"/>
and Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> and Judge <hi>Yeates,</hi> who were very competent to the true interpretation of the law;— The Regiſter-General certified the payment to be due; the Governor drew his warrants for payment, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were actually made by the State Treaſurer—Why then is criminality imputed to the Comptroller-General and to <hi>him only?</hi> and why do not theſe mighty aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the law, direct its ſword againſt all theſe other officers of government!</p>
                        <p>They perhaps have not the misfortune to <hi>have fallen under the diſpleaſure of the Houſe of Repreſentatives!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But further Sir; it is in evidence, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> himſelf, in a converſation with Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> expreſſed his opinion, in clear and pointed terms, that the old unfunded depreciation certificates, were, under the 6th ſection, <hi>redeemable at the Treaſury</hi> of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>— He therefore, at leaſt at that time, thought the 6th ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>more extenſive</hi> than the 2d; that the one was <hi>not a proviſo</hi> on the other; and that <hi>other</hi> caſes than thoſe mentioned in the 2d ſection were intended to be provided for by the 6th.</p>
                        <p>But ſay the gentlemen, is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, that the State meant to ſacrifice her three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock, in order to redeem the New-Loan debt, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the debt of the United States?</p>
                        <p>Whether ſuch a ſuppoſition is poſſible or not, I do not think worth conſidering, ſince we have made no ſuch ſuppoſition, nor is it at all neceſſary to our conſtruction —The 2d ſection directs the ſale of the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock, for the redemption of the debts enumerated in that ſection, and we admit, that the New-Loan debt is not enumerated in it, nor entitled to redemption out of the fund which it provides.</p>
                        <p>We have been told Sir, by the learned counſel, "That if the 6th ſection is not to be taken as a proviſo to the 2d one, or if it is interpreted to extend to a ſingle new object, it muſt extend <hi>to all the debts, due from all the ſtates in the Union, to their own citizens!</hi> and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
<pb n="601" facs="unknown:027132_0609_0FD3543C0322CF88"/>
to our conſtruction, Pennſylvania <hi>has provided for their redemption at her own Treaſury!"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is to be ſure a fine flight in the regions of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and imagination, and ſuppoſing it to have been ſo intended. I ſhall reſt ſatisfied with gazing with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wonder at the pleaſing phantom!</p>
                        <p>I have done with this point Mr. Speaker, and ſhall proceed to the</p>
                        <p>Second poſition;—Namely, THAT THERE WAS AN AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROPRIATION MADE BY LAW, FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES, AT THE TREASURY OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
                        <p>The Conſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> provides, that "NO MONEY SHALL BE DRAWN FROM THE TREASURY, BUT IN CONSEQUENCE OF APPROPRIATIONS MADE BY LAW." and one of the articles charges, that the defendant "with a view to his own emolument, did under colour of his office, certify to the Governor, that certain debts, including the ſaid certificates, but not naming or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the ſame, were redeemable and payable when, <hi>no fund was by law provided for paying the ſame."</hi>— This charge is certainly a pretty high one, but if it ſhall appear, as I truſt it will, to be without foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it muſt fall.</p>
                        <p>The Act of March the 1ſt, 1786, created the New-Loan debt and funded it as to part.</p>
                        <p>The Act of the 27th of March, 1789, unfunded it altogether.</p>
                        <p>An Act of the 7th of April, 1791, for "appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating certain funds and revenues for the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the payment of the public debts," after making certain ſpecific appropriations, provides by the 12th appropriation, that the reſidue of the aggregate fund therein mentioned, ſhall be applied "to pay all warrants thereafter to to be drawn for <hi>claims</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, by virtue of <hi>any law or laws of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth."</hi>
                        </p>

<pb n="604" facs="unknown:027132_0612_0FD353C3E9F754F8"/>
the caſes certified to the Governor by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> which has the ſmalleſt ſemblance to what has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, nor which warrants in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, any one of the aſſertions on which I at preſent animadvert.</p>
                        <p>That the New-Loan debt was payable by the Act of April 1792, and not by the Act of April 1791, will clearly appear when we conſider, that after the paſſing of the firſt, and until the paſſing of the laſt, it was <hi>not payable at all.</hi> It was a claim againſt the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth it is true, but as payment of that claim had been ſtopped by a former law, it could not take place, until it was directed by a ſubſequent law. This was directed by the Act of April 1792, and not before, and of courſe it was by this Act and by no other that it was payable.</p>
                        <p>Here, Sir, it is material to recollect, that in every inſtance of the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> certified to the Governor in <hi>the ſame words</hi> as he has done with reſpect to the New-Loan debt; that the Regiſter-General joined with him in certifying in like manner; that warrants were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon iſſued by the Governor, and payments were made by the Treaſurer, to <hi>able law judges,</hi> without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuppoſing it to be wrong, until the diſcovery was made by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. The queſtion as to an appropriation having been made by law, or not, was preciſely the ſame in both caſes, and what was right in one of them, cannot be wrong in the other.</p>
                        <p>But we are told "That the Act of the 26th of March 1789, ſet apart only £. 10,000 annually for <hi>claims</hi> and improvements, and as <hi>that</hi> ſum was too ſmall to ſatisfy the New-Loan debt, the fund could not be intended for that purpoſe." This I admit to be true, and I have no objection to furniſhing our opponents with a much ſtronger reaſon in ſupport of their argument. <hi>That</hi> law was paſſed the very day next preceding the paſſing of the law which ſtopped payment of the New-Loan debt, and while the bill for that purpoſe was before the
<pb n="605" facs="unknown:027132_0613_0FD353AEBB029528"/>
Houſe, ſo that payment could hot have been then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>out of any funds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This does not however operate againſt us, ſince inſufficient to this purpoſe, the annual ſum of £. 10,000 may have been in March 1789, when <hi>all the New-Loan certificates were in circulation,</hi> the reſidue of the aggregate fund ſet apart for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Act of April 1791, was abundantly more than ſufficient. At this time there were but <hi>few</hi> of the New-Loan certificates in circulation, and the ſum ſet apart by the 12th appropriation for claims and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, was ſo great, as, among many other things, to furniſh the <hi>whole of the State ſubſcription to the</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>bank.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is further objected, "That the law of April 1791, did not contemplate the payment of the New-Loan debt, ſince in none of the enumerated appropriations is that debt mentioned." This may perhaps be true, ſince I can hardly ſuppoſe, that the Legiſlature of 1791, could contemplate providing for the payment of a debt, which was not at that time payable at all, nor until more than one year after, and this ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for there being no ſpecial appropriation for that purpoſe. There is not however a ſhadow of pretence for the objection, ſince the clauſe ſpecially appropriates all the reſidue of the aggregate fund "To pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by virtue of any law or laws of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth"—This ſurely ſupercedes the neceſſity of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appropriation upon every occaſion, for claims then due and payable, but not otherwiſe provided for, or which ſhould be made due and payable by ſubſequent laws. The Conſtitution does not require a ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation on every particular occaſion, mentioning the object and the fund at the ſame time: or if it does, the whole of the 12th appropriation is unconſtitutional, inaſmuch as it mentions no particular object to be provided for, but creates a fund for the payment of all warrants iſſued under any law for claims and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—In
<pb n="606" facs="unknown:027132_0614_0FD3543ECF862EA0"/>
1791 <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> owed certain debts, and the Legiſlature provided for their payment, and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated certain funds for that purpoſe; but ſhe alſo owed many others, of various deſcriptions, and ſhe knew that ſhe would, under her future laws, be liable for their payments—She therefore by the 12th appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provided a fund "To pay all warrants to be drawn for claims and improvements by virtue of any law or laws." What the then exiſting claims were, ſhe did not think it neceſſary to determine; what claims might be due under any future law or laws, ſhe left to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future Legiſlatures, but ſhe provided and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated a fund for the diſcharge of all ſuch claims as were then payable or ſhould be made ſo; "By virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth.— By a law of March, 1786, the New-Loan debt was created; by a law of the 10th of April, 1792, it was made payable, and of courſe it was payable out of a fund provided "to pay all warrants drawn for claims by virtue of any law of this commonwealth."—Unleſs therefore the Act of the 10th of April, 1792, is <hi>not a law of this commonwealth;</hi> the law of the 7th of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 1791, provides and appropriates a fund, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is payable under that of April, 1792.—The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution only requires, that there ſhould be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation; but there may be one appropriation, for ten thouſand purpoſes;—as well for the future, as the preſent, and it may be left to future Legiſlatures to ſay, what debts ſhall be contracted or made payable, but when they are contracted and made payable, it will be from this <hi>previous appropriation,</hi> without an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional one being made. If any thing need be added on this ſubject, permit me to remark, that if a ſufficient appropriation has not been made in the manner alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy contended for, I am at a loſs for language which can be more clear or expreſſive of an appropriation, than that to which I have endeavoured to draw the attention of the honourable Senate.—A fund, ſays the law of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 1791, "To pay <hi>all warrants hereafter to be drawn
<pb n="607" facs="unknown:027132_0615_0FD353C5F71F86C8"/>
for claims or improvements by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth!"</hi> By virtue of a law of the 10th of April, 1792, the claims of the holders of the New-Loan certificates were, as we ſay, entitled to be paid —could I ſuppoſe, Sir, that any Legiſlature after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, 1791, had thought that the Legiſlature of that time, had made uſe of language not ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of an appropriation, and to have wiſhed to make uſe of language more clear, pointed and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than this; "To <hi>pay all warrants hereafter to be drawn for claims and improvements, by virtue of any law or laws of this commonwealth;"</hi>—I aſk what expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more clear;—what terms more perſpicuous; what language more ſtrong and expreſſive of an appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could poſſibly have been uſed!—If our language affords them, I have no conception of it, nor can I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how an appropriation could by any ſubſequent law have been made, if it was not already done.</p>
                        <p>I have admitted, Sir, that the Legiſlature of April, 1791, may not have contemplated the New-Loan debt, but if this proves any thing, it proves what has not, and I am ſure will not be contended;—namely, that nothing made payable by any law, ſubſequent to that time, and not then in the contemplation of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, was payable out of the 12th appropriation: The queſtion is not, whether it was in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Legiſlature of April, 1791; but of the Legiſlature of April, 1792. What adds conſiderable weight to the idea that the Legiſlature of April, 1791, intended the 12th appropriation as a fund for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the un-enumerated debts of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whether funded or not, ſo ſoon as the latter ſhould be by law made payable, is a report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ways and means, on the 8th of February, 1791, adopted by the very Houſe which paſſed the law of April, 1791. In that report I find theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;—"They have taken into their ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſituation of this commonwealth, with reſpect to the various engagements for which the <hi>faith of the

government ſtands pledged,</hi> and the reſources to ſatisfy the ſame. They conceive that at this period, it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly incumbent upon the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> by <hi>reforming what has hitherto been erroneous,</hi> in her policy, and by introducing what may <hi>hitherto have been wanting in her meaſures, to reſtore and to eſtabliſh upon a pure and permanent baſis, public credit, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of political proſperity!</hi>—"That the preſent <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments</hi> of the finances of the commonwealth, <hi>chiefly croſe from her large unfunded debt;</hi> the whole amount whereof is an actual demand againſt the Treaſury; whilſt her internal reſources can only ſupply it by ſlow degrees. A queſtion therefore aroſe in their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether the State ought to ſubmit to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and mortifications of an emberraſſed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and <hi>depreciated name,</hi> or reſort to her general cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and the ſecurity claims which ſhe poſſeſſes againſt the Union for the neceſſary relief from her dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. The <hi>neceſſity of reſtoring public credit;</hi> the juſtice due to the creditors of the State, and a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the diſgrace in which a free nation involves herſelf, that either directly or indirectly forfeits her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, were conſiderations too obvious and too forcible to permit your committee to heſitate in their deciſion." "The large amount of public ſecurities of the United States, which are the property of the State, obliged your committee to take into conſideration, the terms of the loan propoſed by Congreſs to the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic creditors, in the Act, "entitled an Act making proviſion for the debt of the United States."

                        </p>
                        <p>This report, Sir, having been adopted by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, is not only indicative of its ſentiments, but is expreſſed in its own words and language.—I read it for ſeveral purpoſes. The ſhameful imputation has been made againſt <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> that ſhe only meant to free herſelf from her embarraſſments; and as ſhe was not embarraſſed by her unfunded debt, ſhe did not mean to provide a fund or make an appropriation for its diſcharge.—If the anſwers already given to this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not ſufficient, I hope that they are afforded by this report—It was adopted in February 1791 by the <hi>ſome Legiſlature,</hi> which in April 1791, created and ſet apart the fund out of which we ſay the New-Loan debt is, under the law of April 1792, payable, and it is therefore worthy of peculiar attention. In it we find nothing in ſupport of the aſſertion, that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> only intended to free herſelf from her embarraſſments, by providing for the diſcharge of her funded debts—on the contrary we find her ſaying, that "The embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of her finances, chiefly aroſe from her large un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded debt, the whole amount whereof was an actual demand againſt the Treaſury." What was this large unfunded debt? Nothing that I know of, except the <hi>New-Loan Debt,</hi> and the debt due upon the old Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded Depreciation certificates. Is not this therefore a full acknowledgment of the New-Loan debt? But how it may be aſked could ſhe be embarraſſed by it? <hi>In promptu eſt reſponſio;</hi> and that anſwer is, that as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt was accumulating and pay-day muſt come, ſhe felt herſelf as much embarraſſed by the proſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evils as by the exiſtence of preſent ones.</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir;—ſhe felt an embarraſſment from her faith being proſtrated and her honour tainted, and from this
<pb n="610" facs="unknown:027132_0618_0FD35416A2CB45B8"/>
embarraſſment ſhe wiſhed to be freed. That I may avoid repetition I will not again read any part of the report, nor be guilty of uſeleſs quotations from it, but ſhall reſt ſatisfied with aſking, if its great; nay, its principal object does not appear to be, to reſtore public faith, by making either immediate or eventual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the diſcharge of the unfunded debt? If this queſtion is anſwered in the affirmative, how futile muſt the objection be, that ſhe only wiſhed to free herſelf from her embarraſſments by providing for the funded ones! That ſhe did not make immediate and certain proviſion for its payment is true, becauſe ſhe did not know whether the loan of the United States, on which that proviſion was to depend, would or would not be again opened. But ſhe nevertheleſs <hi>provided a fund and made an appropriation</hi> for the payment, if it ſhould be opened, and the Act of April 1792 fixed the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that fund and appropriation, upon the terms and conditions contained in the laſt mentioned Act.</p>
                        <p>The adoption of this report proves,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. An acknowledgment of the exiſtence of the New-Loan debt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. The obligation and the will of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to diſcharge it, if a future Legiſlature ſhould ſo direct under a loan of the United States; and,</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. That the 12th appropriation of the Act of April 1791 was intended to anſwer <hi>all claims</hi> againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, not particularly provided for, which were or ſhould be by law payable. I ſay to anſwer <hi>all claims,</hi> except as I have already excepted, for in the report are theſe remarkable words—"To form all the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the State into one aggregate fund, <hi>charged with all the public debts and engagements."</hi> This report was as has been already obſerved, adopted by the ſame Houſe, which very ſoon after, paſſed the law of April 1791, and if it is not clearly expreſſive of the will of that Houſe, that the 12th appropriation ſhould be for the diſcharge of <hi>"all the public debts and engagements
<pb n="611" facs="unknown:027132_0619_0FD35444042F22F0"/>
of the commonwealth,"</hi> I am really at a loſs to know in what words that will could be expreſſed!!!</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, the moſt important part of this report re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be mentioned—It offered, for the adoption of the Houſe, a reſolution <hi>which was adopted by the Houſe</hi> in the following words, to wit: That the reſidue of the aggregate fund ſhould be appropriated to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcharge of "THE ARREARAGES OF INTEREST NOW DUE ON THE NEW-LOAN CERTIFICATES."</p>
                        <p>This reſolution was paſſed before the tranſactions took place which are imputed to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> as cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
                        <p>It was paſſed by the ſame Houſe, which paſſed the law of April 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>, making the 12th appropriation, out of which we ſay the New-Loan debt was by the law of April 1792 made payable.</p>
                        <p>It ſhews that <hi>that</hi> Houſe was ſo far from being of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt had been abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Act of March 1789, that it not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged its exiſtence, but thought that the intereſt due upon it, ſhould be paid independent of the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It ſhews that the 12th appropriation was intended for this purpoſe, and although the law paſſed ſoon after by the ſame Houſe, left the ſame appropriation to ſatisfy <hi>all claims</hi> which future Legiſlatures ſhould make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>After all this, can it be neceſſary to ſay any thing more to prove, that when by the Act of April 1792, the New-Loan debt was made payable, the Act of April 1791 contained an appropriation for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</p>
                        <p>Yes! ſay the gentlemen; for that the words "To ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all <hi>claims"</hi> are not deſcriptive of the New-Loan certificates, ſince they formed no <hi>claim</hi> againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but were only receipts for the return of the certificates at the pleaſure of the commonwealth." With what dexterity do the gentlemen ſhift their ground? In order to get rid of one difficulty, they
<pb n="612" facs="unknown:027132_0620_0FD353CADF2E2D80"/>
warmly contended, that the New-Loan certificates did not create a <hi>debt,</hi> but only a <hi>claim</hi> againſt the State. Lord <hi>Coke</hi> was our authority that the word <hi>claim</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>debts</hi> and is of more extenſive meaning than the word <hi>debt.</hi> They now abandon their former ground, and ſay that the New-Loan certificates were only in nature of <hi>receipts</hi> for the old Continental ones, but that they <hi>did not amount to a claim againſt the State.</hi> They are driven to this ſubterfuge, by our ſhewing, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the 12th appropriation is for the payment of all un-enumerated <hi>claims</hi> againſt the commonwealth; and they can find no way of getting rid of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but by contending, that <hi>that</hi> which they had before ſaid <hi>was a claim</hi> againſt the commonwealth, is <hi>not a claim</hi> againſt the commonwealth!</p>
                        <p>It may therefore I think be fairly concluded, that there is not a ſhadow of ground for this charge, of <hi>a violation of the Conſtitution;</hi> and that if the Houſe of Repreſentatives had underſtood the law but half as well as Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> did, they would hardly have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves by making it. If <hi>they</hi> were impeached for this part of their conduct, there is perhaps <hi>one ground</hi> on which they might be acquitted.—I will proceed, Sir, to my</p>
                        <p>Third and laſt poſition; namely—THAT NO CRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINAL OFFENCE IS SUFFICIENTLY CHARGED AND PROV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED AGAINST MR. NICHOLSON.</p>
                        <p>I ſay <hi>charged and proved,</hi> becauſe <hi>neither</hi> is material if the other is <hi>inſufficient,</hi> and they muſt <hi>both</hi> come home to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant in his <hi>official conduct,</hi> or the proſecution muſt fail. The evidence muſt ſupport what is ſufficiently charged, and it will not be ſufficient for it to ſupport any other matter. I need not take much trouble to prove, that there is no ground for the impeachment, unleſs an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence has been committed by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> in his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial capacity. <hi>"The Governor,"</hi> ſays the Conſtitution, <hi>"and all other civil officers under this commonwealth, ſhall be liable to impeachment for any miſdemeanor in office."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="613" facs="unknown:027132_0621_0FD3541B553FE548"/>This ſurely excludes all ideas of an impeachment, for what was done in any other capacity. If this is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, many of the charges muſt vaniſh, and unleſs his certificates are ſtated and proved to have been given under colour of his office, and of matters relating to his official duty he muſt be acquitted.</p>
                        <p>The firſt article charges that the defendant "Did under <hi>colour of his office recogniſe certify and declare, the ſaid certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be ſubſcribable, as debts due and owing by the State of</hi> Pennſylvania," to the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Did under colour of his office.</hi> It is ſurely not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſtate that he did it under colour of his office, without alſo ſtating, that it belonged to his office to certify one way or the other, or at leaſt ſhewing it, by ſome public law, of which the Senate can take notice. But the truth is, the certifying in the manner he did, had no connection whatever with the duties of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and it will preſently appear, that neither he nor any body elſe, ever ſuppoſed that it had—It is not ſtated to have been any part of his official duties to certify at all, and unleſs the managers can ſhew that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his official duties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he Senate muſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſorting to evidence, know that the proſecution is without foundation.</p>
                        <p>Was there any law of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> which impoſed this upon him as a duty? It will not be pretended. Was there any law of the United States which required it of him? No ſuch laws can be ſhewn, and if there could, and he had abuſed his truſt, he would be amean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a tribunal of the United States; but not in the tribunal of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If this is the caſe ſay the gentlemen, here is a bold and daring uſurpation of power, and of courſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is doubly guilty! It ſeems to be their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I think, that whether he is guilty or not, he ſhall if poſſible be convicted, but it is rather too much to expect that he is to be convicted without a charge. If he is guilty of uſurping power, why is he not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
<pb n="614" facs="unknown:027132_0622_0FD3541C5516F8B8"/>
for it? or if this diſcovery was neither known nor thought of before, why do not his honorable accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers retire to their own room and vote an additional article againſt him?—They might do it in <hi>a few minutes</hi> on the <hi>information</hi> of ſome one of the managers, and without waſting time in <hi>ſwearing</hi> the witneſſes, or even in <hi>examining</hi> them—would not this be better than to condemn a man without a previous accuſation. It is better that there ſhould be an accuſation, though made in the moſt irregular manner, than a condemnation without a charge.</p>
                        <p>But if I admit for a moment that the defendant had certified in the manner alledged againſt him, that the New-Loan certificates were <hi>ſubſcribable</hi> to the loan of the United States, what has <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to do with this or how could ſhe be thereby injured? we are told that they were not redeemable at the Treaſury of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> If this is the caſe, and if the United States truſting, which it is in proof that they did not, to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi>'s certificate, admitted of ſubſcriptions not by law admiſſible, the United States might be injured though <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> could not—The proſecutors muſt therefore admit of the redeemability, or give up this charge—If the certificates were redeemable they muſt of courſe have been ſubſcribable, becauſe no certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates were redeemable that were not ſubſcribable. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the accuſers will find ſome difficulty in extricating themſelves from this dilemma.</p>
                        <p>The crime imputed to the defendant by this article is, that of <hi>recogniſing, certifying and declaring</hi> the ſaid certificates to be redeemable—To <hi>recogniſe,</hi> is to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,</hi> but what offence is it againſt law, for a man to <hi>acknowledge</hi> any thing? But ſuppoſe it to be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to <hi>recogniſe, certify</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> this to ſome <hi>proper officer,</hi> yet to conſtitute the offence, the impeachment muſt ſtate this to have been done to that officer; but it is not charged that he did it to any body, and of courſe no criminal charge is made againſt him by the firſt article—But if there is, yet there is no
<pb n="615" facs="unknown:027132_0623_0FD3282285EC6738"/>
evidence in ſupport of it—The committee of impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments knew, or might have known, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> did not certify in his <hi>official</hi> capacity;—they alſo knew, or they might have known, that he did not certify to <hi>any officer</hi> whatever, that the ſaid certificates were ſubſcribable—If they did know theſe things, it is really too bad, to charge it to have been done <hi>under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his office;</hi> and if they did not know theſe things, they were guilty of a culpable neglect of duty, when the means of information were at hand by enquiring of Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe, Sir, are not objections to mere form, but they go to the very eſſence of the firſt article. If they are ſolid, that article is inſufficient, and no weight of evidence could authoriſe a conviction;—or if it could, it will be found, that the evidence brought to ſupport it, cannot poſſibly affect the defendant.</p>
                        <p>It appears in evidence, to be an <hi>uniform practice</hi> with Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> to authenticate his <hi>official</hi> acts, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his name at length, where he tranſacted buſineſs with any other officers. It appears that in all the caſes which this article ſtates to have been done by him, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of his office,</hi> he did no more than write on the back of the New-Loan certificates, theſe words <hi>"Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable,"</hi> with the initial letters of his name ſubſcribed, and without adding the words "Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General's office." This ſufficiently ſhews, that he did not conſider theſe acts as being <hi>official,</hi> and it will next appear, that no body elſe conſidered them ſo.</p>
                        <p>But why, it is aſked, did Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> certify at all, if it was not in his official capacity, and intended as an authentic document in the proper offices, to ſhew that the New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States? The gentlemen who have aſked the queſtion, have heard the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and cannot I am ſure be at any loſs for the proper anſwer. This young gentleman is the ſon of the late Commiſſioner of Loans, and his evidence is ſo clear and ſatisfactory, that if all prejudices, either in
<pb n="616" facs="unknown:027132_0624_0FD353EA0FA76688"/>
favour of or againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> are laid aſide, as I truſt they are, it will appear, that the evidence adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if any there is, againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> under this charge, is no leſs inſufficient, than the charge itſelf. He ſwears, that "it was thought for the benefit and ſafety of individuals, that, they ſhould firſt apply to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> for their certificates, leſt they might be locked up until the end of the loan in 1793, when the Secretary of the Treaſury was to decide, and if any ſhould be rejected, as not being ſubſcribable, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might have lain out of the intereſt in the mean time; and for this reaſon if they brought their certificates to the Commiſſioner, without being firſt ſhewn to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> they were ſent to him for examination, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his certification was of no conſequence to the Commiſſioner; the receipts given by him for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates being purpoſely ſo worded, as that the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the State offices might be examined at the end of the loan, and that from them he might learn whether the certificates were <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable</hi> or not;"— but he expreſsly declares, "That <hi>his father took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Mr.</hi> Nicholſon<hi>'s certification, as to what reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf."</hi>—We have here, Sir, a full and complete ſtatement of this <hi>"certifying, recogniſing and declaring"</hi> by Mr. <hi>Nicholſon, "under colour of his office, and to promote and procure his own emolument,"</hi> and I now aſk, if ever a charge was more groundleſs! an imputation more ſcandalous! If the honourable accuſers voted this article of impeachment without enquiring into its truth or falſity, <hi>their</hi> criminality is not leſs than <hi>that</hi> which they are pleaſed to impute to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon!</hi> And if they voted it after enquiring, and knowing that it was not true, they have ſinned in a ſtill greater degree. In the one caſe, ignorance is no excuſe; in the other, knowledge aggravates the crime. What can be more clear than that the Commiſſioner of Loans, neither wiſhed for any information from Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon that which he gave to the certificate hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? What can be more clear than that it was reſerved
<pb n="617" facs="unknown:027132_0625_0FD353CEF6EB6708"/>
for the Secretary of the Treaſury to determine, at the cloſe of the loan, in the year 1793, whether the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates were ſubſcribable or not; and this too, not from Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi>'s certification, but from authentic documents in the proper offices? and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of Loans purpoſely gave his receipts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly? What can be more clear, than that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of Loans ſent the certificate holders to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> for no other purpoſe, than that he, being an experienced and well informed perſon, ſhould examine their certificates, left at the cloſe of the loan in the year 1793 they might ſuſtain a loſs by lying out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the mean time, if the certificates ſhould then be rejected? <hi>Nothing, I apprehend;</hi> and yet for theſe manifold, but diſintereſted acts of <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> flowing from a heart of benevolence, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to oblige, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is impeached for a <hi>high crime and miſdemeanor!</hi> On the ſame principles might the charitable man, whoſe good deeds are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>holy writ,</hi> be impeached for helping the claud! directing the blind! comforting the widow! cheriſhing the fatherleſs! or relieving the beggar at his door! The motives of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> appear to have been equally free from ſordid views or private gain.</p>
                        <p>I have not approved of his politics, Sir, but his well known kindneſs and benevolence of diſpoſition are virtues which command my reſpect, and I cannot but feel for the degraded honour of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> when I find theſe <hi>amiable virtues converted into a crime!</hi> If this has ariſen from a diſregard or culpable neglect of duty, by an omiſſion of proper enquiry, it merits ſevere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion;—if from the more ignoble cauſe of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party purpoſes, that animadverſion ſhould be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by no reſtraint.</p>
                        <p>If Sir, the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſtood in need of ſupport, which will not be alledged, it is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the form of receipts conſtantly given by his late father, the former commiſſioner of loans—"RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION." What form of words could have
<pb n="618" facs="unknown:027132_0626_0FD353B6F6963E40"/>
been uſed to ſhew more clearly than theſe do, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi>'s certificate was not conſidered as an <hi>official</hi> act or regarded as ſuch by Mr. <hi>Smith? ſurely none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again; That the Secretary of the Treaſury, who at the cloſe of the loan, was finally to decide on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribability of all certificates that might be offered, had no idea of taking the leaſt notice of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s little memorandum, given for the ſatisfaction of individuals, appears from his letter of the 8th of June, 1791, to the Commiſſioner of loans. (See page 273) In it he ſays, "It will not be proper that you commit the examination, and checking of the certificates of the aſſumed debt, to any perſon, who does not actually belong to your office. It cannot be deemed a legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of your duty, to rely upon any perſon not duly authoriſed. You will receive theſe certificates, and give on the delivery of them to you, and before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the checks, a deſcriptive receipt for them, which will amount to no more than an acknowledgment that ſuch certificates are placed in your hands, with a view to the loan. The ſubſcribers will be ſenſible, that the receipt cannot be deemed final, becauſe the ſubſcriptions may exceed the aſſumption, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates may prove counterfeit or forged," After hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, will any man ſuppoſe that the Secretary of the Treaſury, was ſo little mindful of the truſt repoſed in him, as to commit it to others, or to have a ſingle thought about Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi>'s memorandum? After hearing the evidence of young Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> will any man ſuppoſe, that his father did not act in exact conformity with thoſe directions; or that the Comptroller-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ever imagined, that he was doing any more than <hi>obliging individuals in his private capacity?</hi> and not <hi>under colour of office and with a view to his own emolument, endeavouring to defraud the public?</hi> That he did not act with a view to his own emolument, will if poſſible, appear ſtill more clearly when we conſider</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. That he <hi>did not in a ſingle inſtance of his own, certify at all;</hi>—and</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="619" facs="unknown:027132_0627_0FD328380BB4BFF8"/>2d. That he certified <hi>in like manner under the firſt loan, when no body ſubſcribed the New-Loan certificates, becauſe it was not their intereſt ſo to do.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence I conclude that the firſt article contains no criminal charge, and if it did, yet that it is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a ſhadow of evidence.</p>
                        <p>But, Mr. Speaker, I have ſtrong grounds of defence againſt this article, ſtill to bring forward, and which would be abundantly ſufficient to enſure an acquittal, even if the firſt charge were admitted to be ſufficient in point of law, and if it ſhould be further admitted, that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had in his <hi>official</hi> character, certified the New-Loan certificates to be ſubſcribable, when they <hi>were not ſo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The article under conſideration charges that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>recogniſed, certified</hi> and <hi>declared,</hi> &amp;c. corruptly, and illegally, <hi>"as he the ſaid</hi> John Nicholſon <hi>well knew."</hi> His accuſers knew this to be eſſential, to the conſtituting of the offence, and it has been admitted that proof of it is equally eſſential.</p>
                        <p>Guilt can only flow from the corruptions of the heart, not from the errors or miſtaken opinions of the head. The former are eſſential to guilt; the latter never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute it where the intention is pure. It it incident to man to err, and therefore the law makes allowance for the frailty of human nature. The honorable accuſers may in <hi>ſome things</hi> have miſtaken the law, and this rule might perhaps be very applicable in their caſe. The learned judges upon the bench frequently differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion—The moſt upright and the moſt enlightened of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of government may miſtake the true conſtruction of confuſed, claſhing, contradictory and ill penned laws, which in the buſineſs of his office he may have occaſion to act upon—If however be acts honeſtly and uprightly —if he acts according to what he really believes the law to be, he at moſt commits an error not a crime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Did Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> then really believe the New-Loan debt to be ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States? If he did, an acquittal muſt be the conſequence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that opinion was <hi>right or wrong.</hi> We undertake
<pb n="620" facs="unknown:027132_0628_0FD353EB87147448"/>
to prove, not only that he was of this opinion at the time of his certifying, &amp;c. but that it was uniformly held and avowed by him from the commencement of the firſt loan in September 1790, up to the cloſe of the ſubſcription to the ſecond loan in July 1792, and that it is not changed.</p>
                        <p>It has appeared in evidence, Sir, that on the 30th of April 1790 the Commiſſioner of Loans wrote a letter to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> deſiring to be informed of the ſeveral kinds of State certificates then in circulation, as books were about to be opened for the receiving of ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the loan, and alſo deſiring to be furniſhed with ſuch checks as would enable him to do the buſineſs with ſafety to the United States (ſee page 271.) It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> made this application to Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon,</hi> as being the perſon moſt capable of furniſhing the neceſſary information, and not as a perſon, who in his official capacity, was to give directions to be followed by Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſays, <hi>"Such checks as will enable me to do that buſineſs with ſafety to the United States."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And it has further appeared, that on the ſame day, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in anſwer, "Until I can give you a complete check, have encloſed herewith a blank form of a depreciation certificate, and one of funded debt, the only two kinds receivable by you, under the funding law of the United States granted by this State, <hi>as it is not preſumable the New-Loans will be offered, ſubjected to the reſtrictions in that law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed"</hi>—You will be able to check thoſe left with you more particularly hereafter."</p>
                        <p>This letter fully proves, that he had no idea of the right of checking or determining on the aſſumability of the certificates himſelf, ſince he ſpeaks in unequivocal terms, of that being done hereafter by others, and it alſo proves the opinion of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> at that early period to have been, that the New-Loan debts were ſo far <hi>from being aboliſhed by the Act of</hi> 1789, <hi>as that they were ſubſcribable to the firſt loan of the United States;</hi>
                           <pb n="621" facs="unknown:027132_0629_0FD353B2874B5328"/>
which differs not in this particular from the ſecond one —It was not at that time the intereſt of the holders of New-Loan certificates to ſubſcribe them, ſince <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> had not paſſed, nor was it known that ſhe would paſs the law for making up the loſs on the three per cent. and deferred ſtock. Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> aſſigned this as his reaſon for not ſending to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> the blank form of a New-Loan certificate, and he alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned this as a reaſon for its "not being preſumable that the New-Loans would be offered, ſubjected to the reſtrictions in the Act of Congreſs preſcribed."—This ſhews his opinion of the exiſtence of the New-Loan debt notwithſtanding the Act of 1789; it ſhews his opinion that, the New-Loan debt, though at that time <hi>unfunded,</hi> to be of greater value than an equal ſum in ſix per cent. three per cent. and deferred ſtock would be; and from his thinking it <hi>not preſumable that the New-Loans would be offered, ſubjected to the reſtrictions preſcribed;</hi> and it is evident, that he believed other people judged of the exiſtence of the New-Loan debt, and of its being ſubſcribable, as he himſelf did:—If theſe were his ſentiments, as they unqueſtionably were, he cannot, whether they were right or wrong, have committed any offence, by acting conformably to them.</p>
                        <p>But, ſay the gentlemen, "This was mere pretence, a copy of his countenance only, and intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive." But why mere pretence; why a copy of his countenance? Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> offered none of the New-Loans for ſubſcription under the firſt loan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conduct accorded with his language expreſſed in his letter, and this ſurely ſhews that he expreſſed his real ſentiments—Nor could he poſſibly have any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for deception—He could not poſſibly know in September 1790 that <hi>another</hi> Legiſlature would in the year 1791 make up the loſs on the three per cent. and deferred ſtock; nor that the loan of the United States would be extended or again opened in the year 1791; —nor that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> would in the year 1792 pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the redemption at her Treaſury of the New-Loan
<pb n="622" facs="unknown:027132_0630_0FD3541DD2040B98"/>
debt, which ſhould at a future period be ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and transferred—And yet without his poſſeſſing the power of looking into futurity, and having a pre-ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all theſe things, there is no room for talking of a mere pretence in the year 1790, or ſuppoſing that he had any intention to deceive!</p>
                        <p>The gentlemen finding the opinion of Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> at a time when he could have no inducement for diſguiſing his real ſentiments to be, that the New-Loan debt was not aboliſhed by the Act of 1789, and that it was ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States.— Exclaim what have we to do with his private opinions! If this exclamation has not received a ſufficient anſwer already, it is certainly afforded by the firſt article, which charges, that the New-Loan debt was aboliſhed and that it was not ſubſcribable as he <hi>the ſaid John Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſon well knew;</hi> and yet when we prove that he was ſo far from knowing or believing this to be the caſe, that he was really of a contrary opinion they exclaim;— what have we to do with his opinions! If this anſwer will not ſatisfy the managers and the learned counſel, they themſelves have afforded, one, which they cannot, without the moſt palpable inconſiſtency now controvert. It muſt be freſh in the recollection of the honourable Senate, that it has been fully admitted, that if Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> has acted <hi>conformably to his opinion of the law, he cannot be guilty, even though that opinion may be wrong;</hi>—and yet, when we prove what his opinion really was and that he has acted in conformity with it, the ſame gentlemen exclaim;—what have be to do with his opinions!</p>
                        <p>But "out of the defendants own mouth," ſays bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dexter</hi> "ſhall he be condemned," and he then produces, what he calls a condemnation, not from the defendants <hi>mouth,</hi> but from his <hi>pen.</hi> It is contained in a report, made in October 1790, (ſee page 389,) by the Comptroller General, to the General Aſſembly, on the funds of the ſtate, and the debts to be provided for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In that report he brings into view, <hi>all the debts of the
<pb n="623" facs="unknown:027132_0631_0FD3541F520B2018"/>
ſtate,</hi> as well the <hi>unfunded</hi> as the funded ones; as well thoſe which were <hi>redeemable</hi> by the then laws, as thoſe which had been excluded from redemption, and of courſe would not be redeemable, until they ſhould be made ſo. He ſhews what funds were then provided, and what further ones would be neceſſary to defray the expences of government and diſcharge ſuch debts as were <hi>then</hi> redeemable at the Treaſury—In doing this, he makes a deduction of the old unfunded depreciation certificates, becauſe they were not then <hi>redeemable,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have ſince been made ſo, and alſo, of the remainder of the New-Loan debt, becauſe that alſo was not <hi>redeemable.</hi> He of courſe did not propoſe providing funds for the payment of either of them; and it would have appeared ſtrange indeed if he had, ſince neither of them was at that time payable at all. To diſtinguiſh them however and to point out ſuch as were then redeemable, and as it would require funds to be provided by the Legiſlature, he mentioned the ſituation of the old depreciation certificates, and he then mentioned the amount of the New-Loan debt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on hand, and <hi>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789;"</hi> and theſe words we are told contain <hi>his ſentence of condemnation.</hi> If they do, it is expreſſed in language which looks more like a decree of acquittal. The New-Loan debt had by the Act of 1786 been made <hi>redeemable</hi> at the Treaſury and at the Land-office. By the Act of 1789 it was no <hi>longer</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable at either of theſe offices, or at any other office, and of courſe was in the Comptroller-General's own words, <hi>"excluded from redemption by the Act of March 1789."</hi> This being the caſe, no proviſion was then neceſſary for the payment of that, which was not then payable at all, and the defendant, therefore, with great propriety brought into one view, all the debts of the State, but at the ſame time, with equal propriety diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed between their various ſituations.</p>
                        <p>His conduct upon this occaſion therefore, inſtead of affording his condemnation, affords the moſt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="624" facs="unknown:027132_0632_0FD353D0774A3490"/>
grounds for his acquittal, ſince the <hi>bringing of the New-Loan debt into his report and ranking it among the debts of the State,</hi> clearly ſhews, that he conſidered it as a ſtill exiſting debt. If he did not; why would he have brought it into view at all, and been ſo particular as he was, in ſhewing by calculations the amount of it, which ſtill remained on hand? Why ſhould he, an any other principles than thoſe which I have ſtated, have taken any more notice of it, than of any of the former debts of the State which had been aboliſhed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged? Or if he conſidered this debt as aboliſhed, why did he not ſay <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> by the Act of 1789, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of EXCLUDED FROM REDEMPTION by it?</p>
                        <p>The next piece of evidence to which I ſhall advert is, the letter of the 6th of June 1791 (page 272) from the Secretary of the Treaſury to the Commiſſioner of Loans, in which, he ſays, <hi>"In conſequence of an enquiry made of me,</hi> I think neceſſary to inform you, that I conſider the <hi>holders of certificates, received from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any State, in lieu of certificates of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral debt, as having a right to ſubſcribe thoſe certificates to the loan of the aſſumed debt,</hi> and I conſider the State, as having a right to ſubſcribe the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which, they have obtained by the exchange, to the loan propoſed by the Act of the 4th of Auguſt, 1790; but no intereſt is to be paid on the aſſumed debt of the State, either to the State, or <hi>to individuals,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you ſhall be informed that I am ſatisfied, that all the certificates ſo iſſued by the State, have been <hi>re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed</hi> or redeemed, or that all thoſe, which which ſhall not be <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or <hi>redeemed, have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the U. S.</hi>—And in order, ſays he, "to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in a clear and ſtriking manner, <hi>this deſcription of N. L. certificates,</hi> from all others, I have determined to have a hole, of about one fifth of an inch, cut through a part, near the centre." He then directs, that when the ſtock <hi>repreſented in theſe certificates, ſhould be transferred from and to the Loan-office or the Treaſury,</hi> the transfer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates ſhould have this central hole, cut or punched
<pb n="625" facs="unknown:027132_0633_0FD35420F7DCA4D8"/>
through them in like manner." And he concludes with ſaying, that "in order to full information on this ſubject, I requeſt you to tranſmit to me a copy, or ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient extracts from any laws paſſed by the Legiſlature of the ſtate in which you reſide, relative to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes of Federal certificates, for thoſe of the ſtate, and to <hi>the re-exchange of thoſe of the ſtate for federal certificates;</hi> in doing which, you will be careful to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect whatever there may be."</p>
                        <p>The words in the beginning of this letter, <hi>"In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an enquiry made of me,"</hi> ſufficiently ſhews, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had applied to the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury for information, reſpecting the ſubſcribability of the New-Loan debt, and it can hardly be preſumed, that ſo induſtrious and well informed an officer, as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary is, in all things relating to the duties of his office, was not at this time in poſſeſſion of the Act of March 1789. That he was in poſſeſſion of it, is more than probable, from what he ſays in this letter reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of certificates—An <hi>exchange</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates took place under the law of March 1786, but there could be no <hi>re-exchange</hi> of them, but under the Act of March 1789. The Secretary could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have known, nor would he have talked of the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of certificates, had he not known of a law for that purpoſe; but he did ſpeak of a <hi>re-exchange,</hi> and therefore he muſt have known of the law of 1789— But he went further, Sir, and ventured to act upon that law, for he tells the Commiſſioner of Loans that <hi>no intereſt was to be</hi> paid on the New-Loan certificates until he ſhould be ſatisfied, that all of them had been <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or redeemed, or that all ſuch as were not <hi>re-exchanged</hi> or redeemed, had been ſurrendered to the United States." and as they could only be ſurrendered to the United States, by being ſubſcribed, theſe laſt words ſhew, <hi>as clearly as he had before expreſſed himſelf in the ſome letter, that</hi> HE THOUGHT THEM SUBSCRIBABLE.</p>
                        <p>But, Sir, in the latter part of this letter, he calls upon the Commiſſioner of Loans, to tranſmit to him,
<pb n="626" facs="unknown:027132_0634_0FD353D1FA673F88"/>
a copy, or ſufficient extracts, from all the laws of the State relative to the <hi>exchange</hi> of Federal certificates for thoſe of the State, and to the <hi>re-exchange</hi> of thoſe of the State, for Federal ones. This call would hardly have been made, had he not known that there was a law for <hi>re-exchange;</hi> which law he was probably poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, but as there might poſſibly be further laws on the ſame ſubject, containing alterations or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he very prudently called for copies or extracts of <hi>all laws relative thereto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If however it ſhould be thought, that there is not ſufficient proof of his knowing at this time, of the law of 1789, it muſt I think be admitted, that before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his next letter, he had received it from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner of Loans—We find him by the laſt letter, calling upon that officer, for all laws on the ſubject;— <hi>in order to full information thereon.</hi> The great accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy and unwearied attention of that officer, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever related to the duties of his office, are ſo well known, as to forbid the idea, of his not having ſhewn the moſt prompt compliance with this call from the head of the department.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th of the ſame month, the Secretary again wrote to the Commiſſioner as follows;—(page 274) "I do not conſider you as juſtifiable, in refuſing the certificates of the State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which are in all other reſpects aſſumable, becauſe they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the State, in lieu of Continental certificates. It will not however be improper, to uſe your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, to perſuade the holders to exchange them, but you cannot, if they perſiſt to offer, refuſe to receive them." In addition to the reaſons already given for believing, that the Commiſſioner as early as poſſible furniſhed the laws which had been called for, permit me to remark, that after Secretary <hi>Hamilton,</hi> had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for all the laws, &amp;c. "in order to full information on the ſubject," the ſuppoſition, that he decided in the very poſitive manner, which appears from this letter, without having received the law, and all the neceſſary
<pb n="627" facs="unknown:027132_0635_0FD353A1F333FC88"/>
information for forming a deciſion, is too improbable, to be admiſſible. That Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had written or ſent to Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> in anſwer to the firſt of theſe letters, before the ſecond was written, appears from a clauſe in the letter, approving of Mr. <hi>Smith's</hi> propoſal, of ſtamping the certificates, inſtead of <hi>punching a hole near the centre,</hi> as Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> had propoſed. If ſo, can it be imagined, that the laws which had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, did not accompany the meſſage? or that, as the opinion now given, does not vary from the former one, it was not given on the ſame law?</p>
                        <p>But we are told that "Theſe letters were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the defendant, and as it is not in proof that he knew of them, they furniſh him with no apology." By the death of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> we are deprived of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or this objection would not have been made.— It may nevertheleſs be anſwered.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. That the habits of intimacy, which prevailed between the Comptroller-General of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and the Commiſſioner of Loans of the United States, as well as their daily intercourſe in buſineſs, between <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> and the U. S. and which in a great degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to certificates of various kinds, furniſh ſtrong proof of the defendant's knowledge of theſe letters;—or,</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. If they do not; yet, by proving that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was not ſingular in his opinion, but that many other well informed perſons were of the ſame opinion, we have no room for a criminal intention being imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him—That this was really the caſe, I ſhall find no difficulty in eſtabliſhing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of the T. it is true, tells us, that he cannot now ſay, whether at the time of writing theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he did or did not know of the Act of 1789; but as he alſo tells us, that he has not an accurate recollection of what paſſed in the early ſtages of the buſineſs, his want of recollection does not weaken the force of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intended to ſhew, that he muſt have then known of that Act. Or if he did not then know of it, yet if there is ſufficient reaſon for believing, that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> knew of
<pb n="628" facs="unknown:027132_0636_0FD353ECF8F07E08"/>
theſe letters, without knowing that they had been written, without a knowledge of that law, the caſe is not altered.</p>
                        <p>I believe, Sir, that I omitted to anſwer in its proper place, an objection which has been made; "That if in June 1791, the Secretary of the Treaſury did know of the Act of 1789, yet that the queſtion did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent itſelf to him, in "a prominent point of view."— This I can readily believe, ſince I can hardly conceive, that he ſaw much difficulty ariſing from it; or if he did, how could the defendant, or any body elſe know, of the degree of <hi>prominency,</hi> in which the queſtion had preſented itſelf to the Secretary, but from his letters, in which he expreſſed himſelf with great clearneſs and deciſion?</p>
                        <p>It is ſeriouſly contended, Sir, "That the defendant, in <hi>violation of his duty,</hi> and in <hi>violation of his oath,</hi> neglected to inform Col. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of the Act of March 1789."</p>
                        <p>If this were the caſe, let the defendant, <hi>for the ſake of juſtice,</hi> be impeached for this offence, before he is condemned! The objection however proves one thing, and that is, that no arguments are too deſperate and groundleſs to be made uſe of, in order to affect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's deſtruction! Will thoſe who make uſe of this argument, venture to tell us, that it was the official duty of the Comptroller-General; <hi>an officer of</hi> Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, to inform the Secretary of the Treaſury; <hi>are officer of the United States, of the laws of</hi> Pennſylvania! or that the defendant, <hi>had ever taken an oath to do ſo!</hi> —If not, will they have ſo much of the hardihood of veterans as to gravely contend, that a man can violate a duty, <hi>which never exiſted;</hi>—or an oath, which <hi>was never ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

certificates, before their ſubſcription was offered to the loan of the United States.</p>
                        <p>It is further objected "That if the Secretary of the Treaſury was once of the opinion, that the New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States, yet that he afterwards altered his mind."—I ſhall in the ſequel have occaſion to examine into the truth of this objection, and I will therefore only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at preſent, that were this the caſe, it militates, naught againſt the defendant, who could not poſſibly know, that ſuch a change would ever take place.</p>
                        <p>By anſwering theſe objections, I have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure been diverted from my regular chain of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intended to ſhew, that the defendant really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and that many others, moſt likely to know, alſo believed, the New-Loan certificates to be ſubſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the loan of the United States; and of courſe, that no criminality is fairly imputable to him, even if that opinion were wrong. This chain of argument ſhall now be reſumed and in tracing it I hope to prove, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> opinion was as already mentioned, upon all occaſions candidly, openly and uniformly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed; that it was recogniſed by others, whoſe acquieſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or explicit approbation confirmed him in it, and that if there has been any omiſſion, in not giving the neceſſary information to the Secretary of the Treaſury, it is not imputable to the defendant, but to a man much higher in office.</p>
                        <p>It is in evidence; that on the 27th of June, 1791, the Secretary of the Treaſury wrote to the Governor, (page 275-6) that "The United States had directed, that the payment of intereſt ſhould be ſuſpended, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the debt of any ſtate, which might have iſſued its own certificates for thoſe of the United States, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it ſhould appear to the ſatisfaction of the Secretary of the Treaſury that certificates iſſued for that purpoſe by ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and requeſting his attention to the ſubject;" concluding by ſaying, that "It would give certainty to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Treaſury, and might prevent delays inconvenient to the public creditors, if the Governor would direct the proper officers, to cauſe the ſtate of the fact as it regarded <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to be made appear to the Secretary."—This is the firſt call that appears to have been made by the Secretary of the Treaſury, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any officer of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> for information reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of her New-Loan certificates, and if the Governor believed, that ſuch of them as had not been <hi>re-exchanged</hi> were aboliſhed by the Act of 1789, he had nothing to do, but <hi>at once to ſay ſo,</hi> to the Secretary of the Treaſury, unleſs by his high office, he was exempt from an obligation, to be acquainted with thoſe laws which he was ſwore to execute. In this letter, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury, ſpeaks of the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, as being evidence of a debt of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> which might be ſurrendered to the United States, or in other words, ſubſcribed to their loan, and if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor thought the debt was aboliſhed, he had nothing to do but to ſay ſo. Did the Governor at all contradict this idea, ſo clearly expreſſed by the Secretary of the Treaſury? certainly not; but rather gave countenance to it, as appears by a letter written on the 1ſt of July, in the ſame year, by Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> to the defendant (page 276)—"It is written," ſays Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> "In obedience to inſtructions from the Governor,"—a "Copy of the letter from the Secretary of the Treaſury was tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it," and it requeſted, that the defendant would "with all convenient ſpeed, make a report upon the ſubject to the Governor, accompanied with ſuch ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he ſhould deem neceſſary, to ſatisfy the enquiry of the Secretary of the Treaſury, and the object of the law to which he referred."</p>

from the Secretary of the Treaſury, calculated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him in it—It contained no directions to ſend the law of 1789 to the Secretary of the T. or to inform him, that by that law the New-Loan debt was aboliſhed. On the contrary, as the Secretary's letter admitted the New-Loan debt to be ſubſcribable, and as that written by Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> in obedience to the Governor's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ſo far from contradicting this idea, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a report, as to what part of the New-Loan debt had not <hi>been re-exchanged,</hi> and might therefore be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered to the United States, it was ſurely confirmatory of the defendant's opinion. What did the defendant do in conſequence of theſe two letters? why he on the next day reported to the Governor, that he had "Through the Secretary of the commonwealth, received a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Treaſury, on the ſubject of certificates of ſtate debt, iſſued in lieu of Continental ones, and relative to the aſſumption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;" and the report then proceeds as follows, "As the regulations and proviſions of this ſtate, enable <hi>ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> to re-poſſeſs themſelves of continental certificates, received for them by the United States, I apprehend, the <hi>caſe of ſuch certificates of</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>are fully provided for.</hi> However, if the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury wiſhes to be informed of the quantity iſſued by <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and now out, of this kind, and your excellency <hi>ſhould chuſe to lay the ſame before him,</hi> I beg leave to repreſent, that the whole quantity ſo iſſued was 5,167,695 33/99 dollars, of which 316,864 30/90 were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtate, and upwards of two thirds of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder have been returned in exchange for the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates, and that the <hi>reſiduary ſum is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing daily by further applications and exchanges."</hi> Here we find the defendant in his report made in his <hi>official capacity</hi> to the Governor, declaring in the moſt explicit terms, as he had before done, that the New-Loan debt ſtill exiſted, as a debt of the commonwealth. The Secretary of the Treaſury, had endeavoured to call the attention of the Governor to the ſubject; <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

at the ſame time, that the New-Loan debt was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable to the loan of the United States,</hi> and alſo deſiring that he "would direct the proper officers to cauſe the ſtate of the facts mentioned in his letter to be made appear to the Secretary." This the defendant did in his <hi>official capacity,</hi> in ſuch clear and pointed language, that the Governor could not poſſibly miſunderſtand his meaning. At the ſame time he expreſſed his reaſon for being ſo particular to be, leaſt "the Governor <hi>ſhould chuſe to lay the ſame before the Secretary of the Treaſury.</hi> Whether this report was or was not communicated to the Secretary of the Treaſury, does not I believe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. If it was not, the <hi>violation of duty and of oath,</hi> which has been mentioned, is not imputable to the defendant, ſince he was not called upon by the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury, and if he had, the call would have been improper. The Secretary called upon the Governor; <hi>he</hi> called upon the Comptroller-General, and the Comptroller-General immediately anſwered that call in ſo particular a manner as to give the fulleſt information. This was the proper channel in which the buſineſs ought to be conducted; the Comptroller-General when called upon by his ſuperrior, paid obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that call, and if his anſwer was not made known by <hi>that</hi> ſuperior, to the Secretary of the Treaſury, upon whom ought this heavy charge to fall? If upon either, certainly not upon the defendant. This evidence, Sir, muſt not only acquit the defendant of the imputed charge of <hi>"a violation of his duty and of his oath,"</hi> has it muſt do much more;—The Secretary of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had in his letter to the Governor, taken it for granted that the New-Loan debt ſtill exiſted, and was ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to the loan of the United States,—the Governor had acquieſced in this opinion by not controverting it; the Comptroller-General had, in his report to the Governor openly avowed it; this avowal did not meet with the Governor's diſavowal, and as one of the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers tells us, that the Governor is an <hi>extremely attentive and vigilant officer,</hi> the defendant had ſurely reaſon to
<pb n="633" facs="unknown:027132_0641_0FD353F010EF8688"/>
ſuppoſe, that he was not guilty of ſo <hi>extraordinary a neglect,</hi> as not to communicate to the Secretary of the Treaſury, that report which had been called for, and which in conſequence of that call, the defendant had ſent to the Governor. The defendant had therefore every reaſon for ſuppoſing, that the Governor alſo thought, that the New Loan debt ſtill exiſted and was ſubſcribable. If he was of that opinion, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant is guilty of no other offence, than that of being of the ſame opinion; and if the Governor thought otherwiſe, but remained ſilent, and without expreſſing any diſapprobation, either to the defendant, or to the Secretary of the Treaſury, the fault ſhould reſt with him, <hi>attentive and vigilant as he is.</hi> Be this as it may, the Comptroller-General had every reaſon for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that his opinion was confirmed by that of the Governor, as well as by that of the Secretary of the Treaſury, and there is ſurely no room to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>former</hi> was ignorant of the law of 1789, ſince at the time of that law being paſſed, he filled an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtation in the councils of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>—In obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Inſtead of doing either of theſe things, he on the 23d of December, ordered Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> (page 220) to ſend to the defendant the letter from the Secretary of poſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make a full report to the Governor, <hi>on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which it referred."</hi>—What was the ſubject to which It referred? ſuerely not the law queſtion of the New-Loan debt being aboliſhed or not, for that queſtion would have been ſubmitted to the proper law officer.

S. without any fault on the part of the original ſubſcribers or the preſent holders, would not pay the intereſt they had iſſued their obligation for, in which they promiſed payment. It appeared to me, that if ſuch were the law, <hi>the public credit of the U. S. might be ſhaken by it,</hi> and rendered precarious, but on turning to the law it will appear, that the proviſion for returning the certificates of the U. S. was to prevent the U. S. from <hi>paying the intereſt twice on the ſame debt,</hi> and that in conformity thereto, if any of the New-Loan certificates of this State, had been before the 1ſt of October laſt, when the loan cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſubſcribed to the ſaid loan, it would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, before the ſtock had iſſued therefor, that an equal ſum ſhould have been ſurrendered by the State as aforeſaid. <hi>The State would thus have redeemed her certificates, through the U.

<pb n="638" facs="unknown:027132_0646_0FD353F6C99D5978"/>
remainder <hi>ſome part is exchanged almoſt every day,</hi> and if the loan ſhould be opened by Congreſs, the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>would be encreaſed thereby."</hi> Every part of this letter is ſo material to prove, the opinion of the Comptroller-General, that the New-Loan debt was in exiſtence and ſubſcribable to the loan of the U. S. that had I not read it, I ſhould have been under the neceſſity, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to draw the attention of the honorable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to its various parts, by obſerving upon them at large, but this will now be unneceſſary, ſince no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can place theſe truths in a ſtronger point of light than the letter itſelf does. If it were poſſible, as it certainly was not, for the Governor to have miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the defendant before, it cannot be alledged, that he could do it now—This report was made near three months after the firſt loan was cloſed; it was made more than five months before the law for opening of the ſecond loan was paſſed; it was made more than three months before the law for the redemption at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was enacted, and it is therefore impoſſible for even credulity itſelf to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it does not expreſs the defendant's real opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                        <p>What is it natural to ſuppoſe, the conduct, of the Governor on receiving this report would have been, if he was not clearly ſatisfied that the defendant's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was right? Why he would, have put an end to the buſineſs, by telling both the defendant, and the Secretary of the Treaſury, that the <hi>New-Loan debt was aboliſhed,</hi> by the Act of 1789, but inſtead of this, he transmitted to the Secretary of the Treaſury, "That part of the report, which ſtated the amount of the New-Loan certificates iſſued, and redeemed, and the probable balance of the unexchanged certificates." (Page 277.) Why do this, if he thought <hi>that</hi> balance no longer a debt? Or why keep back the reſt of the report, if he thought it at all queſtionable, whether <hi>that</hi> balance was a debt or not? Surely no other reaſon can be aſſigned for either than that he had no doubt of
<pb n="639" facs="unknown:027132_0647_0FD35422363B29D8"/>
the exiſtence of the debt. That he really did think ſo, appears from his "giving inſtructions to the defendant on the 27th of the ſame month (page 277) to confer with the Secretary of the Treaſury, in hopes that the difficulty ſuggeſted might be removed, without claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the interpoſition of the Legiſlature." The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſuggeſted aroſe from the danger of intereſt being twice payable by the U. S. that is to ſay, once on the New-Loan certificates, <hi>which could not be, if they were aboliſhed,</hi> and alſo on the Continental certificates, which the State had received in exchange for them; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Treaſury had ſuggeſted different modes of obviating that difficulty, and he thought it worthy of the attention of the Legiſlature. The Governor knew, that if the <hi>New-Loan debt did not exiſt, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ſuggeſted could not exiſt,</hi> and therefore, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the defendant to confer with the Secretary of the Treaſury, in hopes that <hi>that</hi> difficulty might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, he certainly expreſſed the ſame opinion, to the defendant, which the defendant had expreſſed to him.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with thoſe inſtructions from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the defendant, on the 29th of the ſame month, wrote to the Secretary of the Treaſury, propoſing a conference with him on the ſubject contained in his letter to the Governor. A conference took place, and the defendant in a letter to the Governor of February 29th, 1792, after informing him that all obſtacles were removed, expreſſed himſelf as follows;—(page 223) "The ſubject was an important one, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Continental certificates from <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> while the New-Loans for which they were given, <hi>were out,</hi> and the State <hi>reſponſible for,</hi> without theſe means of redemption, would have placed her in an unpleaſant ſituation. To take off the appearance of this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it was ſuggeſted that in caſe the New-Loans, not exchanged, would <hi>not be ſubſcribed to the loan of the U.

ſum from the Union, to meet the <hi>intereſt due to theſe creditors.</hi> But to this it was objected, that this receipt of intereſt by the State, would be temporary, and would ceaſe when the ſentiment of our accounts with the U.

                        <p>We have been told, Sir, that if this were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant's real opinion, he ought to have made it known to the Governor; that he concealed it from him, when it ought to have been communicated, and that he is therefore <hi>at all events</hi> criminal. If I were to make the extraordinary admiſſion, that it is the duty of <hi>every</hi> officer of government, to tell the Governor his opinion, on <hi>all</hi> the laws of the State, and that <hi>every</hi> one who does not, is guilty of a criminal neglect! Yet, after this piece of evidence and ſeveral others which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded it, the objection, though <hi>ſtrongly urged</hi> by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentleman, would be <hi>unworthy of a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here then, Sir, we have the fulleſt evidence, of an opinion, uniformly held and openly avowed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, on all occaſions, in his public and private capacity, from the commencement of the buſineſs, up to the period at which I have arrived; and at times too, when it was impoſſible for him to be intereſted either way, or to have the leaſt inducement to expreſs ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were not his own. We find this opinion, not only acquieſced in by the Commiſſioner of Loans, but we find him during all this period, countenanced and confirmed in it by repeated acts, both of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
<pb n="641" facs="unknown:027132_0649_0FD3544C731EAF68"/>
of the Treaſury and the Governor of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                        <p>I will now go further and ſhew, that he not only continued to be of the ſame opinion, but that he was candid, open, and even <hi>aſſiduous</hi> in making it known to the Governor, and to the members of both branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Legiſlature, while the law of April 1792, for the redemption of the ſtate debts was under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. In doing this, I ſhall alſo ſhew, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

If I do this, I may add, that it is almoſt a crime, to impute criminality to him.</p>

                           </gap>d among others we find the New-Loan debt, placed in a conſpicuous point of view. It is entitled "A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> for modifying the preſent debt of <hi>Pennſylvania,"</hi> and the 8th enumerated debt (page 280 and 284) is ſpoken of in the following words,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>"The New-Loan certificates and arrearages of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, about, ſay</hi> £. 20,000</p>
                        <p>It is propoſed that theſe certificates ſhould be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the arrears of their intereſt, on the ſame terms on the other preceding debts of the ſtate. The holders nevertheleſs to be continued in the priviledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing them as at preſent. But it would ſeem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that after due notice, ſo as not to extend to the period of the next loan by Congreſs, a limitation ſhould by law be put to ſuch power of exchanging, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, the Continental certificates ſhould be ſubſcribed for the uſe of the ſtate, and that the ſtate, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="642" facs="unknown:027132_0650_0FD353F98BDBC440"/>
for the redemption of ſuch as might remain un-exchanged, unſubſcribed to the loan herein propoſed, or <hi>unſubſcribed to the aſſumption of the ſtate debts,</hi> ſhould declare, that intereſt ſhould thenceforth ceaſe thereon, unleſs payment were demanded. No ſum is extended in this caſe, as the Continental certificates will be in the poſſeſſion of the ſtate, to be appropriated to this debt, as far the ſame may be ſubſcribed as herein propoſed."—That this propoſed plan of finance was laid before the Governor, appears by a letter to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant from Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> of the 21ſt of March 1792, (page 286) in which, after mentioning the plan, he ſays; "The Governor has conſidered the ſubject, and will probably determine to-morrow, how far it would be proper, to tranſmit the plan to the Legiſlature." At this time another plan of finance was before the Houſe, it was ſo far advanced, and ſo nearly matured, and the end of the ſeſſion was ſo near at hand, as to account for no interference, for we do not find that any took place, on the part of the Governor; but however this may be, it certainly appears, that at this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant criſis, the defendant <hi>again avowed</hi> the opinion which he had uniformly held, and the propriety of which the Governor did not upon this, any more than upon any former occaſion, think proper to controvert.—Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> indeed tells us, that he never had an idea, or heard an idea, for I do not recollect which was his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, of the New-Loan debt being ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States, until June 1792, when he learned that it had been ſubſcribed by the defendant. This may be true for ought that I know, and yet if he had any ideas at all I can hardly conceive it poſſible, ſince it has appeared, that he was privy to the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence between the defendant, the Governor and the Secretary of the Treaſury, in which this opinion was clearly expreſſed and openly avowed without the leaſt contradiction. He wrote and he tranſmitted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant the Governor's directions on that ſubject; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the letters of Secretary <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and I
<pb n="643" facs="unknown:027132_0651_0FD354271EDE67A0"/>
ſuppoſe him to have had the copying, and recording of all the correſpondence on that occaſion—If other proof be neceſſary, it is amply afforded by his letter to the defendant of the 21ſt March 1792 (page 286) in which he ſays, "I find from conſulting <hi>Mr. Gallatin,</hi> and ſeveral other gentlemen, that your plan would not at this time, meet with any chance of ſucceſs, <hi>though its principles appear to me to be good."</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If Mr. <hi>Dallas,</hi> in whoſe hands this plan of finance was, never read it, how could "its principles appear to him to be good!" If he did read it, how is it poſſible, that until he heard of the New-Loan debt being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the defendant in June 1792, he never had an idea, or heard of an idea of its being ſubſcribable! This is not however worth dwelling upon, and I ſhall therefore proceed to what is much more material.—It is in evidence Sir, that copies of this plan of finance were, at about the ſame time communicated to ſeveral active and intelligent members of each branch of the Legiſlature. The evidence has been heard, and I will not waſte time in an uſeleſs enumeration of a long ſtring of names, but I muſt remark, that not <hi>one,</hi> of them, ever ſignified the ſmalleſt <hi>diſapprobation of that part of it, which propoſed a proviſion for the redemption of the New-Loan debt.</hi> Hence the concluſion was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable on the part of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> that <hi>they too,</hi> as well as the Governor, had no doubt of the exiſtence of the New-Loan debt, and of the obligation of the ſtate to redeem it.</p>
                        <p>I am now arrived Sir, at a moſt important ſtage of the buſineſs;—At the time when the bill for, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption law, as it is called, was pending before the Houſe, and we find at this time the defendant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to each branch of the Legiſlature as he had upon all former occaſions done, the exiſtence of the New-Loan debt, that it ought to be redeemed, and ſo far are we from finding any diſapprobation of this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from any one of them, that we find it <hi>acquieſced in by all, and condemned by none.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="644" facs="unknown:027132_0652_0FD353BE8553B560"/>Their evidence is before you, Sir, and without ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time in repeating it, permit me to remind the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Senate, that, it is as full as evidence can poſſibly be, not only to ſhew the real opinion of the defendant, but the pains taken by him to make that opinion fully known, and that wherever it was known it was approved of, ſince we do not find it contradicted by any one of thoſe, whoſe peculiar province it was to do ſo, if its propriety was at all queſtioned.—Nay the honorable Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> of the Senate tells us, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> in a converſation with him, objected to the plan of finance then before the Houſe, becauſe it would injure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by opening a door for ſpeculation at her expence, and we find him at the ſame time offering another which was ſo plain; ſo ſimple and ſo eaſy to be underſtood, as to preclude every thing of this kind.— Was this alſo cant and hypocriſy too? was it alſo a mere copy of his countenance, and intended to deceive, when it is well known, that the law for extending the loan, did not paſs until the 8th of May following! And yet Sir, the defendant is again charged with ſecrecy and covert views! But upon what grounds is he ſo charged? why ſay the gentlemen; we do not know what deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſpeculation, at the expence of the public, were concealed under this plan of finance!" And if after ſo may months of laborious induſtry, they have not been able to find them out, will they ſeriouſly ſay, that the honorable Senate are to preſume them, and on preſumption only, without either a charge, or evidence, to condemn the defendant! Forbid it virtue! forbid it juſtice! forbid it patriotiſm! or to include them all, forbid it law!</p>
                        <p>But ſay Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> accuſers; "he never thought of the New-Loan debt being ſubſcribable, until after the paſſing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792."</p>
                        <p>Need I after all which has been ſhewn, anſwer this objection? Certainly not; unleſs it be to obſerve, that of itſelf, <hi>if true,</hi> it does away all his former <hi>imputed</hi> ſins
<pb n="645" facs="unknown:027132_0653_0FD353B1347F1A28"/>
and iniquities, ſince in that caſe every thing which had been imputed to him before, muſt be groundleſs.</p>
                        <p>Again, Sir, we are told, "That while the bill for the redemption law of April 1792 was depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legiſlature, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> ſatisfied himſelf with mentioning <hi>little, trifling objections,</hi> but that he never told any body that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it."—To this I could, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, give many anſwers; but I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with obſerving,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. That had he made no objections whatever, he would not have been liable to impeachment on that account, any more than thoſe who ſtate this objection are, and that if this is a criminal omiſſion, <hi>they</hi> are no leſs liable to puniſhment for it, than he is, ſince they were under no leſs obligation than he was.</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. That at the time of the objections, which are now called trifling, being made by the defendant, a report of a committee (ſee Journals of Congreſs of the 2d April 1792) was under conſideration, which if it had been adopted by Congreſs, would have rendered the old unfunded bills of credit ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States. When the bill for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion law was before the Houſe, the defendant very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly objected, that ſhould that report be adopted in its full extent, and ſhould the bill then paſs in its then form, theſe bills would be redeemable at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> However trifling this objection may now be thought, it was conſidered as of ſo much weight at that time, that this part of the report was rejected, and if it had not, the law of April 1792 was ſo framed as in its then form to admit of their redemption. And,</p>
                        <p n="3">3d. That if the defendant did not ſtate as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the propoſed law of April 1792, that the New-Loan debt would be redeemable under it, it was becauſe he then did, and always had believed in the exiſtence of that debt; becauſe his own plan of finance propoſed its redemption;—becauſe he had every reaſon for believing that the Governor and each branch of the
<pb n="646" facs="unknown:027132_0654_0FD35393604ACCC8"/>
Legiſlature thought as he did in this reſpect; and that therefore, it would have been madneſs in the extreme for him, to object to what he himſelf propoſed in his own plan of finance, and which he not only highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, but had every reaſon for ſuppoſing to be equally approved of by others.</p>
                        <p>I will not, Sir, attempt any further anſwer to this objection, leſt in combating ſuch ground, I may be led into an intemperate warmth.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid, Sir, that "The Governor could not have been of the opinion, that the New-Loan debt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> or that it exiſted at all, ſince in none of his addreſſes to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, one or more of which have been read, has he mentioned this debt to be provided for, although he has particularly enumerated all that were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for." This argument, though much relied on, will be found to be altogether fallacious. The New-Loan debt was not redeemable at all, until the paſſing of the redemption law of the 10th of April 1792, nor then, unleſs the loan of the United States ſhould be again opened—It was not again opened until the 8th of May 1792, and of courſe no proviſion for its redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could be required before that time. The addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which have been read, were all anterior to this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod—Their object was to enumerate the amount of the <hi>debts which were redeemable,</hi> and of courſe demandable at the Treaſury, and to call upon the Legiſlature, to <hi>furniſh the neceſſary means;</hi> but as the New-Loan debt was not <hi>then redeemable nor demandable,</hi> at the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, it would have been ſtrange indeed, if our <hi>vigilant</hi> Governor, had ſo far forgotten himſelf, as to call for <hi>means to be provided, for redeeming a debt,</hi> which <hi>at that time was not redeemable at all!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of a ſimilar nature is another objection which has been made; "That in no inſtance have the committee of ways and means propoſed any proviſion for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the New-Loan debt," from which it is inferred, that it had been aboliſhed, or if not aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="647" facs="unknown:027132_0655_0FD353D4F7452B80"/>
that it was not redeemable." To this the anſwer muſt certainly be ſatisfactory, that the reports of this committee were, like the addreſſes of the Governor, made <hi>before the New-Loan debt was redeemable,</hi> and of courſe the propoſing of <hi>ways and means</hi> for its <hi>redemption</hi> would have been folly in the extreme—It is the buſineſs of that committee, as appears from its very name, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>ways and means,</hi> for diſcharging ſuch debts as are <hi>redeemable,</hi> but it would be a great departure from its duty, to propoſe a law for any other purpoſe, unleſs under a particular reference from the Houſe. It is the buſineſs of that committee, to find out <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>ways for the redemption of funded debts,</hi> not <hi>unfunded ones!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Equally unſubſtantial is another objection, which has been made; namely, "That the defendant could not believe the New-Loan debt to be redeemable, becauſe his own ſtatement, made at, or ſoon after the paſſing of the Act of the 10th of April 1792, mentioned ſo ſmall a ſum, as a propoſed eſtimate, of what would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the redemption of the public debts, as ſhews that it was not intended to provide for the diſcharge of the New-Loan debts." <hi>Nor was it;</hi> and this I freely admit, without allowing that there is any weight in the objection. Theſe eſtimates bear date the 28th and 30th of April 1792 (page 224-5) and mention a "ſum eſtimated to be neceſſary for the redemption of the State <hi>debt, according to law."</hi> But the New-Loan debt was not redeemable until the 8th of May follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Act of Congreſs for opening the ſecond loan was paſt, and therefore, when theſe eſtimates were made, the New-Loan debt was not payable <hi>"accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law,"</hi> nor would it ever have been payable under the then exiſting laws, had that loan not again been opened. If this is not a complete anſwer to the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I hope the following one will be—It will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that the ſecond ſection of the Act of the 10th of April 1792 provided for the payment of certain debts therein enumerated, and we have admitted that the New-Loan debt was not one of them, although it
<pb n="648" facs="unknown:027132_0656_0FD353D81F411558"/>
was, as we ſay, within the proviſion of the ſixth ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eventually became payable under the 12th ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of the Act of April 1791. The 2d ſection of the Act of April 1792 provided funds for the debts enumerated in that ſection, and in order thereto, it enabled "The Comptroller-General and Regiſter-General, under the direction of the Governor, to fell ſo much of the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock as ſhould be neceſſary to pay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the debt in that ſection mentioned." On the 13th of April 1792 (page 232) Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> by order of the Governor, wrote to the Comptroller-General and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter-General as follows—"The Legiſlature contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the payment of <hi>certain</hi> debts on <hi>the firſt of July next,</hi> by the ſale of <hi>three</hi> per cent. <hi>ſtock,</hi> at a certain rate, with a power however, to ſuſpend the ſale until the ſtipulated price can be obtained, you will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore, to take that Act into immediate conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and report what arrangements will be neceſſary in your opinion, for carrying the redemption of the debt into effect."</p>
                        <p>The three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock was not directed to be ſold for the payment of the New-Loan debt, nor was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for the payment of that debt <hi>on the firſt of July next, nor at all,</hi> unleſs the loan ſhould be again opened; the Governor could only call for an eſtimate of what would be neceſſary to diſcharge the debts, which were payable on the firſt of July; the eſtimate furniſhed was confined to that object, and could not be extended to any other; the three <hi>per cent.</hi> ſtock could not be ſold to ſatisfy any other object. When gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are driven to ſuch objections as this, their ſituation muſt be deſperate indeed!</p>
                        <p>Oh! but ſay the gentlemen, "The defendant did not inform Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> as he ought to have done, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable under the Act of April 1792." If I admit for a moment, that there was ſomething ſo peculiar in the character of Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> as to entitle him to more information than
<pb n="649" facs="unknown:027132_0657_0FD3544DCF056DB0"/>
other members could juſtly claim, let us ſee how well the objection is ſupported by facts.</p>
                        <p>We find Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi>'s letter to the defendant of the 21ſt of March 1792, that he found on conſulting <hi>Mr. Gallatin,</hi> and ſome other gentlemen on the <hi>defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's plan,</hi> that it would not at that time meet with any chance of ſucceſs, "though its <hi>principles appeared to be good,"</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> was therefore informed of the defendant's opinion while the bill for the redemption law was pending, and if he thought it wrong, he ought to have ſaid ſo, and guarded againſt it.—Let us now ſee what took place after the law was paſſed?—It was paſſed as we have ſeen on the 10th of April 1792 —the Houſe probably roſe on that or the next day, as no law was paſſed after that day, in the ſame ſeſſion; and as Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells us, that he remained in town but about eight or ten days after the riſing of the Houſe, the converſation which I am about to mention, muſt have taken place within that time—It is related by Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon,</hi> who ſwears "That ſhortly after the Houſe roſe, Mr. <hi>Gallatin,</hi> the defendant and himſelf, had converſation together, in which <hi>they all agreed,</hi> that the Act of the 10th of April 1792, embraced the <hi>Unfunded Depreciation debt,</hi> and the defendant then ſaid, it would extend to the old bills of credit if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhould aſſume them, upon which Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ſaid the 6th ſection was more extenſive than he had intended. And Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> tells us, that on reading the 6th ſection he agreed with the defendant in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of it as to its including the Unfunded De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation debt—If this was ſo, it could not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo to the ſecond ſection, ſince it is admitted on both ſides, that <hi>that</hi> ſection does not include that debt; of courſe we have here the opinion of Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> in our favour, be it of the importance or not, which upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other occaſion has been contended for. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> does not at preſent recollect any thing having been ſaid about the old bills of credit being redeemable, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſhould aſſume them, but Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon,</hi> who

ſpeaks affirmatively, ſwears that the defendant did ſay, that they would be within the ſixth ſection if Congreſs ſhould aſſume them, and that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> then ſaid, the ſixth ſection was more extenſive than he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which certainly looks very much like aſſenting to what the defendant had ſaid—Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> does not, it is true, remember, that the New-Loan debt was ſpoken of, and the defendant has been pretty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely handled for not mentioning that alſo; but to this it may be anſwered, that Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> having heard of ſome objections to the Act, went to learn what they were, and to endeavour to obviate them—This being the caſe, the defendant mentioned only ſuch things as he deemed exceptionable, and it would have been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful indeed, if he had mentioned as an objection to the Act, that it might <hi>eventually</hi> provide for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the New-Loan debt, when <hi>he himſelf</hi> had juſt before propoſed a plan, which provided for its <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> redemption, and which he had every reaſon for believing, was approved of by the Governor and the members of both branches of the Legiſlature. To ſhew that he has been candid and uniform in every thing relative to this buſineſs, it is but juſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that while the Act of April 1792 was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before the Legiſlature, he thought it his duty to give it every decent oppoſition, and that he did ſo, by mentioning his objections in the fulleſt manner to many members of each branch of the Legiſlature, and more eſpecially as it would in its then form, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions then under the conſideration of Congreſs had been adopted in their full extent, have put the ſtate in the power of the United States, by making her liable to redeem whatever Congreſs might chuſe to aſſume. To prevent this, his plan enumerated the ſpecific articles of redemption, and ſurely nothing could be better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated than this, to preſerve the rights of the State, and to preclude all opportunity for ſpeculation—To the honorable Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> be objected "to the bill as it ſtood, (page 287) becauſe it would admit of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="651" facs="unknown:027132_0659_0FD353C0DA758770"/>
that would open a door for ſpeculation, and for ſpeculations injurious to the State." To the honorable Mr. <hi>Montgomery</hi> he mentioned nearly the ſame thing; (page 290) and if after this, the Legiſlature choſe to leave the door open, every man had a right to enter at it, and none more ſo than he, who had adviſed that it ſhould be ſhut.</p>
                        <p>If the law left it open, the law gave a free paſſport of entrance to every man, and it is an affront to common ſenſe to ſuppoſe that for availing himſelf of it, any man can be puniſhable!</p>
                        <p>We are told, Sir, "That at all events the defendant was highly culpable for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certificates, becauſe Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> had told him that it was not <hi>his</hi> intention when the law of April 1792 paſſed, that they ſhould be redeemable." Be it ſo; but if it is, what is the conſequence? Was the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to conſtrue the law agreeably to what a <hi>ſingle member</hi> of a <hi>ſingle branch</hi> told him was <hi>his meaning</hi> at the time, or according to what appeared on a <hi>view of the law,</hi> to have been the <hi>meaning of all the members of both bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and of the Governor!</hi> Mr. <hi>Gallatin's</hi> conduct, and where he happens to be right, I have no objection to quoting him, forms a ſufficient anſwer to this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—It is in evidence, that he ſaid, he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the ſixth ſection of the Act of April 1792 ſhould be more extenſive than the ſecond ſection; but that on peruſing it, he found that it was, and that it included the Unfunded Depreciation certificates.—He alſo tells us, that finding this to be the caſe, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the redemption of one for his friend <hi>Ephraim Douglaſs</hi>—He adds with much good ſenſe, that if he had known that agreeably to the true conſtruction of the law, the New-Loan debt was redeemable, he ſhould, let the intention of the Legiſlature be what it might, have done the beſt that he could for his friend—All this is paſt over as perfectly innocent, ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

who is the author, and the fautor of this proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and yet, the defendant is held up as a great criminal, for certifying to the Governor in favour of the holders of the old Unfunded Depreciation certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, although that member, and the Regiſter-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal had agreed that it was right! although that member had procured a certificate of this kind in favour of his friend; and although it was <hi>firſt done,</hi> in favour of the Speaker of the Senate at the time of paſſing the law, and afterwards in favour of able law judges!</p>
                        <p>But, ſay the gentlemen, "Let the defendant's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have been one way or the other, it was <hi>imprudent</hi> in him to ſubſcribe the New-Loan debt, without firſt informing the Governor of his intentions." The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor may perhaps be a very proper perſon to conſult in a caſe of prudence, but if he is ſo, and if, which I am far from admitting, prudence required that he ſhould have been conſulted; is a mere act of imprudence a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for an impeachment? If it is, I am afraid that a thouſand articles would be maintainable againſt the beſt man among us, and that even ſome of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers might ſtand high on the liſt of criminals! If the accuſers are obliged to have recourſe to this ground, the defendant ſhould not have been impeached for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the laws of the State, but for tranſgreſſing the rules of prudence!</p>
                        <p>But, ſay the proſecutors, "Whatever may have been the defendant's opinion, the commonwealth has ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained much damage by the ſubſcription of the New-Loan debt, and that he is therefore reſponſible." Even if this poſition were true, it could at moſt but apply in a civil action and not in a criminal proſecution, where the rule is, <hi>actus non ſit reus niſi mens ſit rea.</hi> But I deny the truth of the aſſertion altogether. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings in the pound were juſtly due? <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by the Act of March 1786 was ſolemnly pledged to pay twenty ſhillings in the pound, and that right and juſtice required that this ſum ſhould be paid, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the Act of April 1791 for making up

                     <p>In order ſtill further to ſhew, that the defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his conſtruction of the law to be right, and that he believed other gentlemen to be of the ſame opinion, permit me now to remind the honorable Senate, of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Secretary of the Treaſury. He ſwears that <hi>"all the difficulties on which he ſo often wrote to the Governor;</hi> on <hi>which the Governor ordered the conference,</hi> and on <hi>which the conference was held and conducted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aroſe on the ſuppoſition, of the New-Loan debt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſcribable,</hi> and that they <hi>could not have exiſted, but on this point being acceded to."</hi> That in the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> appeared to be of this opinion, and the Governor afforded abundant reaſon to ſuppoſe that he was of the ſame opinion.</p>
                     <p>After hearing this evidence, no man can doubt of what the opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſury was; —no man can doubt what the opinion of the Governor was, no man can doubt what the opinion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was, nor, but that he believed theſe gentlemen to be of the ſame opinion, ſince if they had not, as the Secretary tells you, the difficulties could not have ariſen, nor could the conference have been neceſſary. The defendant muſt have perceived this as clearly as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary did, and unleſs, which is not preſumable, he ſuppoſed the Governor to be deſtitute of common ſenſe, or totally regardleſs of all ſenſe of duty, he could not imagine that he would <hi>have called for reports, talked of calling the Legiſlature, or directed a conference without being of the ſame opinion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, again, Sir, it appears, that Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> had applied to have a New-Loan certificate ſubſcribed and redeemed, and that the defendant from mere kindneſs undertook to get it done for him—That while that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was depending, Mr. <hi>Dallas</hi> objected to the defendant, that it was not authoriſed by law, and this was the firſt time of ſuch an idea being ſuggeſted by any one. The defendant anſwered him, that he <hi>was ſure he was right;</hi> and what clearly proves that he
<pb n="655" facs="unknown:027132_0663_0FD35429E9CF9148"/>
thought ſo is, that as Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> was going out of town, the defendant, after <hi>this objection had been made,</hi> paid him the full amount of his certificate, as if it had been actually redeemed, and this too, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction for his trouble, or <hi>aſking for an indemnity.</hi> Can there be a ſtronger proof than this of conſcious inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity? Or can it believed, that if he thought the matter at all doubtful, he would have voluntarily taken the riſk upon himſelf? This ſurely ſhews, that he conſidered Mr. <hi>Dallas's preſent</hi> opinion, ſo contrary to what it had <hi>formerly</hi> appeared to be, as not worthy of the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, when oppoſed by a conviction in his own mind of the propriety of a contrary one, and that too, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by opinions entitled to much more reſpect.</p>
                     <p>I have already given an anſwer ſo much at length, to the objection "That the defendant did not, as he ought to have done, conſult the Regiſter-General or the Governor," that I ſhall only take notice of it at preſent, for the ſake of drawing a well warranted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in favour of the defendant. The active, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and diſcerning mind of the Regiſter-General is too well known to be queſtioned, and it is alſo well known, that circumſtances have occurred, which leave no room for the ſuppoſition, that he has much partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for the defendant; or if he had, it will not be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, that he would be ſwayed by it on the preſent occaſion. He tells you, Sir, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the defendant did tell him and Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin,</hi> that the old Unfunded Depreciation certificates, were redeemable under the Act of April 1792, and that on peruſing it they were both of them of that opinion —He tells you, that from the certifications made to the Governor, and which paſſed through <hi>his</hi> office, in the caſes of the old Unfunded Depreciation debt, it might, both from the amount of the intereſt, and the time of its commencement, be eaſily known, that the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations related to that debt, and could not poſſibly relate to any other. Thus far then, there was no want of due communication, both to the Regiſter General and
<pb n="656" facs="unknown:027132_0664_0FD353FA8B4C8078"/>
to the Governor. It alſo appears, that the defendant had in his letters and reports repeatedly informed the Governor, that the New-Loan debt was ſubſcribable, and if it was ſubſcribable, no man can doubt of its being redeemable. Here then the objection again fails —But in addition to all this, the Regiſter-General tells you, that <hi>after knowing of the objection made by Mr.</hi> Dallas, and after <hi>conſidering the law,</hi> he was of the ſame opinion with the defendant, and joined with him, in making ſeveral certificates to the Governor, in caſes of the <hi>New-Loan debt,</hi> in order that warrants might iſſue for its redemption at the Treaſury, and that as he had no doubt at all about the law, he did not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſpeak to the Governor on the ſubject—Hence it appears, that there is not the leaſt ground for any part of the objection—Oh! but ſay the gentlemen, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> defendant did not in his certifications to the Governor, in caſes of the New-Loan debt, deſcribe it in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it could be known, that the certifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to that debt." To this I anſwer, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications were exactly, as appears in evidence, agreeably to the form ſettled and eſtabliſhed by the different of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as proper to be obſerved under the Act of April 1792, and that they did not differ, from the form made uſe of on other occaſions; and further, that the Regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-General uſed the ſame form in caſes of the New-Loan debt which the defendant did.</p>
                     <p>But we are told that "That this buſineſs <hi>originated</hi> with the defendant; that he tranſacted it <hi>privately,</hi> and that it was unfair in him, not to inform others of the ſame ſpeculation!" This objection puts me in mind of a ſtory, which I have heard related by my friend Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Wayne.</hi> Early in life, he was engaged in ſurveying lands in <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> On one Sunday morning, he ſaw a large flock of wild ducks in a pond near to his cabbin, and immediately took up his gun, in order to get a ſhot at them.—An Indian who ſaw the ducks, and wiſhed to have the <hi>ſpeculation</hi> to himſelf, came running to the General, and aſked him, what he was going to
<pb n="657" facs="unknown:027132_0665_0FD35396009673A0"/>
do?—Upon the General telling him, that he intended to have a ſhot at thoſe ducks, the Indian exclaimed with uplifted hands;—ſhame! ſhame! for you white men, to ſhoot on the Sabbath;—we poor ignorant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are not ſo bad as you, for we would not do ſo.— Struck with this ſeemingly ſerious admonition from a ſavage, the General almoſt concluded to return back and lay aſide his gun—While the Indian was detaining him, and endeavouring to prevail upon him to do ſo, he heard the report of a gun, and ſaw ſeveral of the ducks knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over; upon which the Indian, leaping from the ground, and laughing very heartily, exclaimed again; —you white people think we ſavages are fools, but you are not ſo cunning as we are—That is my ſquaw, who has ſhot the ducks, and I came to keep you back, till ſhe ſhould get the firſt ſhot!—I believe, Sir, that this is pretty much the caſe with moſt people, who ſee an opportunity for a fair ſpeculation, and that but few are ſo ſilly, as to cry roaſt beef, until they themſelves are ſatisfied.— We find that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> objected to the bill, becauſe it would afford an opportunity for ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It did not enumerate all the articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>as his plan of finance did;</hi> ſeveral of theſe articles, might be unknown to the people at large, while they would be well known to ſome. This would give to a few, advantages for ſpeculation, which many would not have. This the defendant had endeavoured to prevent, but could not; and if the law left a door open for ſpeculating in the New-Loan debt, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant ſhould at moſt have been impeached for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating <hi>according to law!</hi> not <hi>againſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a further anſwer to this objection, we have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many other people knew the ſame thing, and ſpeculated in the ſame way, and that among them, were men of unblemiſhed character. Upon hearing this, the gentlemen immediately ſhift their ground and ſay, that "The buſineſs originated with the defendant, <hi>and that be led others into it,</hi> to the great injury of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth." How is this objection reconcilable with
<pb n="658" facs="unknown:027132_0666_0FD3539786698678"/>
the laſt one? If he <hi>did the buſineſs privately, and did not inform others of it,</hi> how could <hi>he lead others into it?</hi> Or if he <hi>led others into it,</hi> how is it poſſible, that he did <hi>not inform others of it?</hi>—In ſhort, the accuſers advance <hi>contrary</hi> poſitions, <hi>either</hi> of which if true, is a <hi>refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other,</hi> and yet they contend, that he is guilty on <hi>both</hi> grounds!</p>
                     <p>But it is not true, that the buſineſs originated with him, or that he led others into it. Every man who thought of the matter, judged for himſelf, and acted accordingly—By the evidence of Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> it appears, that he found, upon reading the law, that the New-Loan debt was redeemable. By the evidence of Mr. <hi>Boggs</hi> it appears, that he diſcovered it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Mr. <hi>Rittenhouſe</hi> and others alſo ſubſcribed the New-Loan debt and had it redeemed. They derived no information from the defendant, nor did he take a ſingle ſtep to conceal any thing from them—So far was he from intending to conceal any thing, that he did the whole of the buſineſs <hi>in his own name,</hi> although he well knew, that at the end of the ſecond loan, a ſcrutiny would take place, as there had at the end of the firſt, and that if he had acted wrong, he would be detected, and compelled to refund. If his views were improper, how eaſily might detection have been prevented, by making uſe of the names of others? Criminality has been imputed to him, but a deficiency of intellectual faculty has not, and yet without ſuch deficiency, it is impoſſible to account for his not making uſe of a cloak for his views, if any he had, which would have afforded ample ſecurity, without coſting him any thing. The charge in one of the articles, <hi>that the defendant acted in the ſecret manner therein mentioned, in order to avoid diſcovery and detection, until he ſhould get the money into his poſſeſſion,</hi> muſt excite our indignation;—not againſt the accuſed, but at the accuſation. To avoid detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>until he ſhould get the money into his poſſeſſion!</hi> He knew that at the end of the ſecond loan a ſcrutiny
<pb n="659" facs="unknown:027132_0667_0FD353FC17CDC3E8"/>
would take place, as there did at the cloſe of the firſt; he knew that on that ſcrutiny, all certificates which were not by law ſubſcribable would be rejected; he knew that if he was acting illegally, he would on that ſcrutiny be detected, and compelled to refund with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace what he had wrongfully received. Let me aſk then, Sir, if it was poſſible for any one of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's accuſers to believe, that the paltry conſideration of a temporary poſſeſſion of the money, could have prevented him, as the article charges, from conſulting the Regiſter-General or communicating to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>until he ſhould get the money into his poſſeſſion?</hi> It is impoſſible for them to have believed this, unleſs they alſo believed, that he intended to run away with the money, before the ſcrutiny ſhould take place, at the end of the loan! His ſituation and circumſtances in life ſufficiently prove, that a mere temporary poſſeſſion of the money could be no object with him, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the diſgrace attending the detection, which he knew muſt await him, and yet as if guilt muſt always be proportionate to the colouring, or the want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be ſupplied by a wanton exaggeration of the charge, we find this paltry motive gravely imputed to the defendant! If I expreſs myſelf with ſome warmth, the occaſion demands it, and I cannot be ſo obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the honorable accuſers, as to ſuppreſs my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on conſidering this charge.</p>
                     <p>But further, Sir; it is impoſſible that when the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant certified the New-Loan certificates to be genuine and aſſumable, he could have been influenced by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives imputed to him. The United States had taken no riſk upon themſelves. A ſcrutiny was to take place at the end of the loan, when all certificates not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable would be rejected. Nor did <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> run any riſk under the law of April 1792—That law only provided for the redemption at the Treaſury, upon transfers being made to the State-Treaſurer for the uſe of the commonwealth, of the <hi>certificates which the ſubſcribers ſhould receive from the United States, in conſequence of
<pb n="660" facs="unknown:027132_0688_0FD3282391A1AFE8"/>
ſuch ſubſcriptions.</hi> Had this law been obſerved, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed debt could have been redeemed at the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> until the ſubſcription had been approved of by the United States, and of courſe, no improper redemption could have happened—Some difficulties attended the execution of this law, and the Governor made an arrangement (page 97-98) for <hi>the redemption before the iſſuing of certificates,</hi> in conſequence of the ſubſcription, and of courſe ſubjected the ſtate to all loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ariſing from any of the certificates which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited with the Commiſſioner of Loans, being forged, counterfeited or not ſubſcribable from any other cauſe. Although there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor did not intend well, yet it muſt be admitted, that this arrangement was unauthoriſed by law. When the defendant certified the certificates to be genuine and aſſumable, he could not know, that any ſuch arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be made. Without it, no payment could have been made at the Treaſury, until the Secretary of the Treaſury ſhould have decided on the ſubſcribability of the certificates, and it is therefore impoſſible, for any rational mind to ſuppoſe, that the defendant could have had the motives for concealment which have been imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>But ſays the ſame article, "The defendant did not conſult the Regiſter-General touching the above tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, nor communicate the ſame to the Governor, nor diſcriminate," &amp;c. "and thereby all the checks of office, provided by law were deſtroyed." What were theſe checks of office? They were the Regiſter-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and the Governor, and no other checks were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by law.</p>
                     <p>If he has deſtroyed them, he ſhould have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for murder;—not impeached for a miſdemeanor.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman tell us, that "The Secretary of the Treaſury, on ſeeing the law of 1789, altered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and determined, that the New-Loan debt was not ſubſcribable to the loan of the United States, and that he rejected it accordingly."</p>

                        <pb n="661" facs="unknown:027132_0669_0FD353FD8F6106E8"/>If this were really ſo, I do not ſee how it could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the queſtion at preſent, but the fact is otherwiſe. When an objection was made on the part of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> the Secretary of the Treaſury conſidered the queſtion on its true ground, to wit—Is the New-Loan debt a ſtill exiſting debt? If it is, it is ſubſcribable; if it is not, it is not ſubſcribable—This queſtion he did not determine either way, but wiſhed it to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the ſtate—The time for receiving ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the loan of the United States, elapſed without any ſuch determination taking place, and of courſe the New-Loan certificates were excluded; not becauſe the Secretary determined that they were not ſubſcribable, but becauſe the time for receiving them had expired and they could not be received whether they were otherwiſe ſubſcribable or not. This appears partly from his letter of the 8th of February and 21ſt of Auguſt 1793 (page 76-7-8, and 218) but more fully from the evidence given by him in the courſe of the trial.</p>

                        <head>FIFTH AND SIXTH ARTICLES, which charge,</head>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. That the defendant did by himſelf or his agents, purchaſe a number of the New-Loan certificates, as well from perſons who came to exchange the ſame at his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as from others; and</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. That the defendant received of ſundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, certain New-Loan certificates to be exchanged, whereby the ſaid certificates became the property of the commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Regiſter-General, in order to be cancelled; yet the defendant, well knowing the ſame to be the property
<pb n="662" facs="unknown:027132_0670_0FD353FF26ABD378"/>
of the commonwealth, ſubſcribed them to the loan of the United States, in his own name and for his own uſe and benefit.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two articles appear to me to depend on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſolution of the following queſtions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. Was it criminal in the defendant to buy New-Loan certificates out of his office, in like manner as other perſons might? and,</p>
                        <p n="2">2d. Was it criminal to buy ſuch as were brought to his office to be exchanged, but which the holders of them concluded not to exchange but to ſell?</p>
                        <p>The firſt of theſe queſtions has been very properly given up by the worthy gentleman who ſpoke laſt, but as his colleagues have been ſo far from ſhewing an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree of candour, as to warmly contend, for the affirmative of the queſtion, I am obliged to enter upon its diſcuſſion.</p>
                        <p>The ground which has been taken in order to ſhew, that it was criminal in the defendant to purchaſe New-Loan certificates, at <hi>any place</hi> or from <hi>any perſon</hi> is this —although ſay the gentlemen, the holders of ſuch cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates had not brought them to be exchanged, they might perhaps have done ſo, if the defendant had not bought them, and as his buying them, may poſſibly have prevented their being offered for exchange, it muſt be criminal—and one of the gentlemen has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—What! will the defendant's counſel contend, that what is lawful for other perſons is alſo lawful for public officers? and they have concluded by amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much at large, on the duties of public offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in order to ſhew that there is one law for them, and another for other people.</p>
                        <p>"There are," ſays Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> "ſome poſitions ſo plain and clear in themſelves that nothing can make them more ſo, and therefore one is greatly at a loſs how to reaſon upon them." The truth of this obſervation will be admitted by every man who attempts to reaſon in ſupport of a ſelf evident propoſition, ſince he can make uſe of no arguments more clear, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="663" facs="unknown:027132_0671_0FD35451F4263458"/>
is, which they are intended to maintain. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in this ſituation do I find myſelf when called upon to ſhew, that it was no leſs lawful for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant than for any other perſon, to purchaſe the New-Loan certificates. They were by the law of 1786 made payable to bearer, and there is no exception in that law, or in any ſubſequent law, to prevent the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant or any other perſon from becoming the bearer. If the clauſe is general, no perſon is excepted, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that it extends to all perſons. It at all times reſts with the Legiſlature to ſay, whether any particular officer ſhall or ſhall not bargain or deal in commodities, which may have ſome kind of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his office—In ſome inſtances it is prohibited by expreſs proviſion made for that purpoſe, but theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are but few, and until now, no man ever dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that without ſuch prohibition the dealing was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                        <p>In order however to prove it to be unlawful, without any ſuch expreſs prohibition, the gentlemen have ſaid that there are caſes of ſuch prohibition and excluſion being ſpecially made, both by the laws of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and of the United States, and under the former, they have inſtanced vendue maſters;—under the latter, the Secretary of the Treaſury.—But to me it appears, that theſe inſtances of expreſs prohibition, afford the fulleſt refutation of the doctrine, which they are quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to maintain; ſince a ſpecial proviſion muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely uſeleſs, if without ſuch ſpecial prohibition on particular officers, there is by law <hi>a general prohibition on all officers.</hi> The Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> has not thought fit to prohibit the officers of the Land-office from dealing in land, and they have done ſo as freely as other people without any body ſuppoſing it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. What the law <hi>does not forbid,</hi> it <hi>permits,</hi> and where the law has not diſtinguiſhed, the judges have no right to do ſo. Without taking particular notice of the many handſome things which have been ſaid on the duties of public officers, theſe duties may be ſummed
<pb n="664" facs="unknown:027132_0672_0FD353DC87158D88"/>
up in a few words to be;—<hi>to diſcharge with fidelity, whatever the law enjoins;—to abſtain from whatever it forbids.</hi> A public officer muſt learn his duties from the laws of his country, and where he can find no prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in them, he has a right to ſay that none exiſts. I have ſaid, Sir, that one of the gentlemen has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, What! will the defendant's counſel pretend, that what is law for other perſons, is alſo law for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers? To this I anſwer, that they certainly will and boldly too, <hi>in all things</hi> where the law does not <hi>impoſe certain reſtrictions,</hi> or enjoin <hi>certain duties upon them.</hi> In all other caſes, the public officer and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate citizen are alike; their rights and their obligations are the ſame, and there is not <hi>one law for the one and another law for the other.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh! but we are told, "It was indelicate in Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> to be concerned in the purchaſing of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates," and on this ground too, has his conviction been warmly urged. If he has not acted up to the nice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of delicacy, which the accuſers poſſeſs, they ſhould have given us their creed of delicacy at length; they ſhould have impeached him for indelicacy, and not for a violation of law, and inſtead of bringing him for trial before a tribunal bound to determine according to law, the managers ſhould have been erected into a court of honour, to determine according to the nice feelings of your pretty, delicate gentlemen, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, one <hi>puiſne judge</hi> would have appeared to as much advantage, as he does in the character of a manager— If the defendant acted indelicately, the Governor might have diſmiſſed him, but in this tribunal, no European ſyſtem, formed out of the fanciful reveries of delicate, viſionary men, can form the rule of deciſion.</p>
                        <p>If Sir it was criminal in the defendant to purchaſe New-Loan certificates out of his office, becauſe the holders of them <hi>might perhaps,</hi> have brought them to his office to be exchanged, it was from the paſſing of the law of 1786 equally ſo in him, to purchaſe Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, ſince his office was the proper place for exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I do not mention this as an anſwer to the objection, for I think it deſerving of none, but merely to ſhew, that as on the ſame principles, the defendant has ſined from the beginning, his accuſers may have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring forward an additional article againſt him.</p>
                        <p>The next queſtion is;—Was it criminal in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to purchaſe certificates brought to his office to be exchanged, but which the holders of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concluded to ſell.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth article ſtates, that "The New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates by being brought to the office to be exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by virtue of the Act of March 1789, became the property of the commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Regiſter-General to be cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led," yet that the defendant ſubſcribed the ſame in his own name and to his own uſe, to the injury and loſs of the commonwealth." If theſe certificates upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the office to be exchanged, became the property of the commonwealth, <hi>without any exchange being made,</hi> the defendant has acted againſt law, but if they did not ſo become the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, this objection does not differ from the one laſt mentioned—Before adverting to the evidence, it will be proper to conſider the law, ſince if it has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely miſtaken by the honorable accuſers, this charge alſo, muſt loſe its ſting.</p>
                        <p>They ſay that the certificates, immediately upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the officer, became the property of the commonwealth, and we ſay, they did not until the New-Loan certificates were delivered to the ſtate by the holder, the balance of intereſt ſettled, that balance paid and the old Continental certificates delivered up by the ſtate, and that until all theſe things were done, it was but a propoſal, not an exchange, and of courſe there could be no change of property. That it may be ſeen which of us is right, I muſt turn to the law of the 27th March 1789.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="666" facs="unknown:027132_0674_0FD3539A073D68A8"/>It has already been obſerved, that <hi>that</hi> Act was not compulſory on the holders of New-Loan certificates, to exchange them for the old Continental ones, but that it was left at their election to do it or not, as they might think proper. Although this is a material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at preſent, I will not at this time make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations to prove it. It is a matter to which I have already ſpoken pretty much at large, and if my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were ſound, repetition cannot be neceſſary;—if unſound it would be uſeleſs. The third ſection of the Act, after mentioning that "difficulties might ariſe in equalizing the intereſt paid by this ſtate, to the holders of the New-Loan certificates, with the intereſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ſtate from the United States, authoriſed the Preſident or Vice-Preſident in Council, to cauſe the New-Loan certificates, on the holders thereof apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefor, to be returned through the office of the Comptroller-General, provided that no certificates ſhould be ſo returned, until the intereſt paid by this ſtate on the New-Loan certificates, ſhould be equalized, and the overplus or balance, beyond what had been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this ſtate from the United States, ſhould be repaid in indents of the United States, to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, for the uſe of this ſtate, and in every caſe, where this ſtate ſhould have received more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from the United States, than ſhould have been paid on the New-Loan certificates, the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould pay ſuch overplus in indents to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch certificates.—After attending to this part, and on this queſtion it is the only material part, of the law of March 1789, it is difficult to conceive, on what principles the honorable accuſers, in all their laudable zeal for accuſation, could have imagined, that the New-Loan certificates became the property of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth immediately on their being offered for re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and without any of thoſe requiſites being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; and what muſt greatly increaſe our wonder is, that we ſee their honorable managers and learned counſel throwing down the gauntlet, and appearing as
<pb n="667" facs="unknown:027132_0675_0FD35453CBCE4B08"/>
champions in vindication of the poſition! Our armour conſiſts of the defenſive weapons of argument only, but we hope not to be found recreant.</p>
                        <p>Although there might perhaps have been a very few exceptions, yet very generally ſpeaking, the ſtate had paid to the holders of the New-Loan certificates, more, frequently much more intereſt than ſhe had received from the United States—She therefore very prudently provided by the law of March 1789, that no re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſhould take place nor return of certificates be made, until the intereſt paid by this ſtate on the New-Loan certificates, ſhould be equalized and the overplus or balance be repaid—By this proviſion ſhe declared, that her right and property in the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſhould not ceaſe or be diveſted, until New-Loans to an equal amount ſhould be delivered to her, and until the intereſt paid and received by her, ſhould be equaliſed, and the balance paid to her—If then the right and property of the ſtate in the certificates which ſhe had received upon loan, was to continue until all theſe things ſhould take place, is it poſſible to imagine, that the right and property of the holders of the New-Loan certificates, could be diveſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> before that period had arrived! If it is, it follows, that the ſtate was at the ſame time owner of both the old Continental and the New-Loan certificates, and that the humble indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual was owner of neither! What, would the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this doctrine be? Why that a holder of a New-Loan certificate, who had no other property in the world, might be told that it would be beſt for him to have it re-exchanged for the old Continental one. He believed ſo and carried it to the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for that purpoſe—The Comptroller-General tells him, it ſhall be exchanged, but as you have received one, two or three year's intereſt from the ſtate, more than the ſtate has received from the United States, you muſt pay the difference before an exchange can take place—The individual replies, I have no property in the world ſave this certificate, and I therefore cannot
<pb n="668" facs="unknown:027132_0676_0FD3542E43A07398"/>
do it; give me my certificate that I may do with it, as well as I can; no, replies the Comptroller-General, by offering your certificate for exchange, your property in it is diveſted, and it now belongs to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Give me then ſays the other my old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental one in lieu of it.—No replies the Comptroller-General I cannot do that, until the balance of intereſt is equalized and paid—This ſays the individual I ſhall never be able to do, becauſe I have no other property, and if you keep both certificates, I am reduced to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.—It is ſo, muſt the defendant, on his accuſer's principles, reply, but I cannot help it; your property in one certificate is diveſted by your offering it for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, while you are property in the other is not reveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe you are not able to comply with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary terms!—I now aſk, Mr. Speaker, if any thing can be more true, than that theſe conſequences reſult from the doctrine contended for? I further aſk, if the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contended for is not a very high <hi>article of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> on the honour and integrity of <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi> If an anſwer to both theſe queſtions muſt be given in the affirmative, it will be an ample refutation of the objection. Exchange is the act of giving and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reciprocally; it is traffic by permutation; it is the giving of one thing for the ſake of another, and to talk of an exchange without a mutual transfer of property, is to miſconſtrue the meaning of a word, which no ſchool-boy is at a loſs to comprehend—In a good old book of the law, in which nothing but truth is to be found, it is recorded that "In every exchange there are two grants, for that each party granteth to the other in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;" and yet the defendant's accuſers have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that there may be an exchange, although one party parts with nothing, and although the other, does not comply with the terms on which ſuch exchange had been propoſed! I might dilate on this ſubject, as I might at the meridian hour of a clear day, to prove to a man of perfect viſion, that the ſun ſhines, but leſt I might become the object of ridicule, I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.
<pb n="669" facs="unknown:027132_0677_0FD3282ACD7DB470"/>
So much for the law, and now for the evidence relating to this queſtion.</p>
                        <p>It appears that ſeveral perſons, whoſe names or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it would be uſeleſs to mention, withdrew their New-Loan certificates, after carrying them to the defendant's office to be exchanged. A change of mind in the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them, was occaſioned by various circumſtances, which have been given in evidence, and which it is needleſs to relate. The acquieſcence of the defendant in that change of mind, nevertheleſs proves, that he thought the right of re-exchanging or not, reſted with the party, until the re-exchange was completed—nor was this the opinion of him, only, but of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor alſo. It is neither ſtated in the charge nor proved by the evidence, that the holders of the certificates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be exchanged, tendered the balance of intereſt due from them. It is neither ſtated nor proved that they were prepared with indents for that purpoſe. If this was not the caſe, an exchange could not be made agreeably to the terms of the law, nor was the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant authoriſed to make ſuch exchange.—But ſay the gentlemen, when terms offered by one party, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to by the other, the bargain is compleat, and that, as the ſtate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones, a change of property took place, the moment the latter were brought to the office for that purpoſe. I may admit the firſt part of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be juſt, without conceding the latter, ſince it is not true, that the ſtate offered to exchange the old certificates for the new ones; but for the <hi>new ones and the balance of intereſt due from the holders of them.</hi> By a letter of the 24th of December 1791, (page 221) the defendant informed the Governor, that a number of exchanges to the amount of forty or fifty preſented, were pending for want of the parties paying the indents due, and by the ſame letter he mentioned, that the holders of the new certificates were, on preſenting them, and liquidating the intereſt received thereon, entitled to receive back their former ones or an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent;
<pb n="670" facs="unknown:027132_0678_0FD35400993BE278"/>
and it alſo appears, that by another letter, he informed the Governor, that ſome certificates brought to be exchanged, had afterwards been withdrawn by the parties. This the Governor very well knew, cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Save on ſome ſubjects, on which I preſume not to ſpeak, becauſe I am incapable to judge, I might almoſt obſerve, that naught bur truth ever came from the pen of this great man. He tells

in favour of the integrity of an old, faithful and long-tried ſervant. It has without contradiction been ſtated, that within that period more than thirty millions of pounds have paſſed through his hands— The late Supreme Executive Council were authoriſed and required, and they once a month did by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or a committee, examine his books, his papers and his vouchers, reſpecting the exchange and re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of certificates. Though monthly weighed in the balance, he was never found wanting. The ſame books, papers and vouchers, as well as all others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his official conduct, have from time to time been examined with the ſearching eye of ſevere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny by different committees of the honorable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and what has been the reſult? <hi>No diſcovery of fraud of any kind.</hi>

Their report may therefore be conſidered as ſtrong evidence of innocence in all other reſpects. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Sir, another committee were buſily employed during a long receſs of the Houſe, with powers to ſend for perſons and papers, if ſuch powers could be given by a ſingle branch of the Legiſlature, in beating up every buſh and cover, where it was poſſible for fraud to lurk, or guilt to be concealed;—And what have they diſcovered? Not a <hi>filchered mite,</hi> from all the glittering millions entruſted to the defendant's care, if he is innocent of this charge.—His character then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been, without blot or blemiſh; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on all former occaſions, free from diſhoneſty of ever kind—If this is the caſe, is not <hi>the incredibility of the fact, ſufficient to invalidate the charge,</hi> and could <hi>we believe ſuch a ſtory were it told us by Cato?—A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious appropriation of property, in violation of a ſacred truſt, and in violation of his oath!</hi> No juvenille ſinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

no raw, unfledged ſtripling in the paths of vice, would begin the career of villany with ſo bold a leap!—It is not in human nature, for the human heart to become ſo corrupt at once! It begins with little things and proceeds gradually, as it becomes more hardened, to greater ones, until it reaches that deſperate length when it boldly ſpurns all laws, human and divine. It ſtarts back with horror at firſt from thoſe crime which, when long hackneyed in iniquity it is prepared to perpetrate with eagerneſs. If ſuch be the nature of the mind of man, it is almoſt a violation of the law of nature, to ſuppoſe the defendant guilty of the crime imputed by this charge, ſince we do not find his mind prepared for it, by thoſe of a leſs grade—Reaſoning on theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I can ſee no ſufficient ground for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's conviction, even if I ſhould admit Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan's</hi> memory to be ſo perfect as that it could not fail him. His integrity is unqueſtionable, and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of this charge, I believe the defendant to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo. The defendant cannot be guilty without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of his oath, and I know of no rule by which it could be determined, whether the defendant or the witneſs conſiders the obligation of an oath as more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. The probability is, that they hold it in equal veneration, and that no conſideration could lead either of them to its violation. The defendant cannot how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be guilty, unleſs he has wilfully violated his oath; but he may be innocent, although the witneſs has paid the moſt ſacred regard to his. That this is the caſe, I ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh by many additional cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, tending to ſhew, that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> memory has failed him. That the defendant ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own name, and for his own uſe and benefit, ſuch a certificate, as is mentioned in this charge, is not denied; but it is denied that he received it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the uſe of the commonwealth. On this the whole charge depends.</p>
                        <p>It is peculiarly worthy of conſideration, Sir, that the certificate mentioned in this charge, was ſubſcribed in
<pb n="675" facs="unknown:027132_0683_0FD35406B17A07E8"/>
the defendant's own name—He knew that at the end of the loan a ſcrutiny would take place; he knew that <hi>that</hi> ſcrutiny, together with ſuch as had been ſet on foot by the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> would lead to his detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his diſgrace and his puniſhment, if he ſubſcribed the property of the commonwealth in his own name, and for his own uſe and benefit; he knew that this might eaſily be prevented by the ſubſcription being in ſome other name. The wicked flee when no man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, while the righteous is bold as a lion.—Is it then credible that the defendant, whoſe intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot be called in queſtion would, if he was a guilty man, have furniſhed the certain means of his conviction, when they might have been ſo eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? Certainly not, and hence ariſes a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of his innocence.</p>
                        <p>If my recollection is right, Sir, the evidence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords another ground of defence, which muſt, I think concluſively ſhew the defendant's innocence, and the inaccuracy of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> recollection—There does not I think appear, to be any deficiency in the amount of New-Loan certificates, received by the ſtate, in exchange for Continental ones. If I am right in this, and I think the contrary has not appeared in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nothing can be more clear, than that this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate did not belong to the ſtate, elſe a want of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to a like amount, belonging to the ſtate, muſt have appeared, which I think is not the caſe.</p>
                        <p>But the evidence of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> like the club of <hi>Hercules,</hi> is relied on to beat down all oppoſition. It is, "That he never ſold any certificates to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, or exchanged any with him, in his private capacity."—The character of integrity, deſervedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through life by this good man, forbids an idea of his ſaying what he does not believe. There are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions however, in which ſomething more than inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity is required, to entitle a witneſs to full credit. If he is in all things hurried and confuſed; if his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is at all times remarkably defective; if he deals

largely, without keeping any accounts or memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum; if he ſpeaks negatively; if he relates a ſtory, <hi>not to be believed, though told by Cato;</hi> if he ſpeaks doubtfully on many things, where accuracy and poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That he is a gentleman of this deſcription cannot be denied; that his memory is ſo extremely defective as to diſable him to give an accurate account of even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tranſactions is equally true; and that his evidence is liable to all the other objections which have been mentioned will preſently appear. Our adverſaries rely on his integrity, and we admit that his integrity may be relied upon, although his evidence <hi>cannot</hi>—If he really ſold the certificate in queſtion to the defendant, it would be rather extraordinary if he ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; quite natural for him to forget it. But inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of what has been ſaid, there are many ſtrong grounds for the ſuppoſition, that he is miſtaken—In the firſt place he ſpeaks not affirmatively but negatively, and this amounts to nothing more, than that he does not remember it, and this I can readily believe.</p>
                        <p>When a man of integrity ſpeaks affirmatively, we are induced to believe him, however bad his memory may be, although we muſt ſuſpect his relation to be inaccurate; when negatively, his evidence can amount to but little, either way.</p>
                        <p>That theſe obſervations apply with great force to the evidence of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> will appear, when it is conſidered, that he dealt very largely in certificates of various kinds, for a number of years, but never kept any account or memorandum of them, becauſe, as he himſelf tells you, it was of no conſequence of whom he bought them, nor to whom he ſold them—If then
<pb n="677" facs="unknown:027132_0685_0FD354092E85ED68"/>
he conſidered it as of no conſequence from whom they were bought, nor to whom they were ſold; if he never kept any account or memorandum of their quantity or amount, nor of the names of the perſons with whom he exchanged; from whom he bought, nor to whom he ſold; and if he dealt in them for a number of years and to a prodigious amount, does it follow, that he did not part with this certificate to the defendant, becauſe he cannot recollect it? And is it not more probable, that he has forgotten, than that a man of fair character, has committed the <hi>black crime imputed to him?</hi>—He is not able to tell from whom he bought, nor to whom he ſold other certificates, and why may not his memory have failed him with reſpect to this as well as to others? He does not remember from whom he bought this certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and why ſhould he remember to whom he fold it? He does not remember that he ever had it, and why ſhould he remember any thing about it? He does not remember any thing about it, and how can he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect exchanging it with, or ſelling it to the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant! The honorable managers and learned counſel very well know, that the proſecution muſt fail, unleſs they prove, that this certificate became the property of the ſtate, by being received in exchange from Mr. <hi>M'Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachan;</hi> but his memory is ſo treacherous, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to the neceſſity of calling upon Major <hi>M'Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> and the State-Treaſurer to prove that it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him;—they prove this, but they prove no more, and is it to be expected, that theſe gentlemen ſhould be able to prove all the tranſactions which ever took place between Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> and the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant? <hi>It is not;</hi> and if there ever was cruelty in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, it certainly exiſts, where thoſe who conduct it, on finding that he who muſt ones have known every thing reſpecting its grounds, has now forgotten them altogether, endeavour to ſupply his defect of memory by witneſſes, who cannot be ſuppoſed to know any thing which might operate in favour of the defendant. That Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> once owned this certificate is in full
<pb n="678" facs="unknown:027132_0686_0FD3540C6BA1AD80"/>
evidence from two gentlemen of reſpectable character; from him the honorable Senate can learn nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it. Is it then extraordinary, that he who once owned this certificate, but does not recollect it; nor is able to tell from whom he received it; nor to ſay one word about it; ſhould forget parting with it to the defendant? Nay, would it not be more extraordinary, if a man who does not recollect to have ever had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, ſhould tell you, that he recollects parting with it to the defendant!</p>
                        <p>Innocence of conduct, Mr. Speaker, I have always been taught to believe, afforded ample ſecurity, but on the principles contended I find, if they are found, that <hi>that</hi> ſecurity does not depend on innocence, but on the ſcanty portion of the faculty of memory, which may have been beſtowed on an individual.—Again, Sir, what aſpect will this buſineſs wear, if I make the extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> is remarkable for his retentive memory, and accuracy of relation; and if I go further and admit, that he never did ſell this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to the defendant, nor exchange it with him in his private capacity? Not any aſpect unfavorable to the defendant, becauſe all ſuch certificates were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bearer and transferrable by delivery. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dealt largely in them, but does not know from whom he bought nor to whom he ſold.—Although he does not recollect it, he received this certificate from Major <hi>M'Connel,</hi> as appears by the evidence of that gentleman. That Mr. <hi>M'Clenathan</hi> not only bought, but ſold certificates, appears from his own teſtimony. Whether he ſold this certificate to ſome other perſon or not, he cannot tell, ſince he has forgot that he ever had it. May it not then be, that if he did not ſell it to the defendant, yet that he ſold it to ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? And if ſo, may it not have come fairly into the defendant's hands in the courſe of his extenſive deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in certificates? It ſurely may, nor can any thing be more likely. Mr. <hi>M'Clenathan</hi> was we find, in the habit of ſelling certificates, but he cannot ſay to whom,
<pb n="679" facs="unknown:027132_0687_0FD354553664E570"/>
or this certificate might perhaps be eaſily traced to the defendant's hands. If he cannot ſay to whom he ſold, why are we to expect that the defendant can prove, from whom he bought? Becauſe ſay his accuſers, "He is an accurate man."—That he is an accurate man, in matters wherein accuracy is required, or can be uſeful, is admitted; but what occaſion could there be for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy in keeping an account of the names of perſons, from whom he bought, or to whom he ſold certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates? Or how could it be uſeful? Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> ſays, he kept no ſuch account, becauſe it was of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Moſt other people reaſoned I believe in the ſame way, and I very much doubt, if many inſtances can be ſhewn, of ſuch accounts being kept by dealers in certificates. Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> was aſked if he could tell the names of all the perſons from whom he bought, and to whom he ſold certificates, but he deemed the queſtion ſo unreaſonable, that he refuſed to anſwer it, and yet the guilt of the defendant is ſtrongly urged, becauſe he cannot prove from whom he got this certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate. On the ſame principles might he be called on to prove, from whom he received every certificate, of every kind and deſcription which he ever owned; on the ſame principle it might be concluded, that where-ever he could not furniſh ſuch proof, he had ſtolen them; and on the ſame principle, might the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be made againſt every other man under the like circumſtances! But ſay the gentlemen, the defendant kept a diary of all his tranſactions, and if he had bought this certificate, an account of it would appear in that diary. Sir that diary lies on the table, and if the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will permit it to be read, it will be found, that it does not contain an account <hi>of all his tranſactions,</hi> nor of any ſingle tranſaction of any kind whatever, except of the public buſineſs of his office, tranſacted by him for other people as Comptroller-General. If the gentlemen will permit the diary to be read, they will find this to be the caſe, and if they will not, its contents ſhould not be miſrepreſented. The defendant thought it of no
<pb n="680" facs="unknown:027132_0688_0FD3282391A1AFE8"/>
more conſequence than Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> did from whom he bought, nor to whom he ſold certificates, nor <hi>did he ever keep any accounts thereof</hi>—On the ſame ground, then, might he be impeached on account of every other certificate ſubſcribed by him, and which had been iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in any other name than his own; on the ſame ground, might all other perſons, under the like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be impeached; on the ſame principles might their guilt be preſumed. This doctrine would alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Continental certificates, ſubſcribed under the firſt loan, ſince with equal propriety it might be urged, that the ſtate had received them in exchange for New-Loan certificates, as it is now urged that this New-Loan certificate was received in exchange for a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental one. I believe I have already obſerved, that a ſtrong preſumption of innocence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>riſes, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant having ſubſcribed this certificate in his own name, ſince he muſt have known, that if he had pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it from the ſtate, a deficiency in the New-Loan certificates to the ſame amount would appear, and alſo, that he had ſubſcribed this certificate, the property of the ſtate, in his own name and for his own uſe. But few men, when in the commiſſion of crimes, are ſo careleſs of conſequences, as not to take ſome pains to avoid detection; none ſo ſilly, as to furniſh evidence againſt themſelves—The defendant, if he be really guilty, forms a ſtrange exception to the rule, ſince he might have avoided detection, by ſubſcribing in the name of ſome other perſon, or fixing on other certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, received from perſons who are ſince dead, or from ſtrangers who could not now appear againſt him.</p>
                        <p>The great doubt with which Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered many of the interrogatories, his total forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſeveral things, which he muſt once have known, and which are of ſuch a nature, as to be not eaſily forgotten, and his own account of his manner of tranſacting buſineſs relating to certificates, will beſt ſhew, how far his memory is to be relied on, when ſpeaking negatively.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="681" facs="unknown:027132_0689_0FD3540D3853B550"/>He tells you, that he did not make out any account or liſt of his certificates, when he delivered them to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to be exchanged, nor can he ſay whether he received their full amount in return, as he did not know the amount of either, though the amount was very conſiderable. Was ſuch a careleſſneſs in buſineſs; ſuch an indifference about property ever manifeſted by mortal! (vide page 26) and is the negative teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſuch a witneſs after a long lapſe of time, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove that a thing did not happen becauſe he does not remember it? He tells you that it is probable that he had a certificate of that amount, but he cannot be certain thereof—If he cannot be certain, that he had it, he cannot be certain that he gave it to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to be exchanged, and if he does not know, nor pretend to ſay this, how can the honorable Senate learn it from him? It is not in proof that he ever had the certificate after March 1790, and if ſo, it cannot be in proof that at a period long after, he delivered it to the defendant to be exchanged. He was in the habit of ſelling certificates; but what certificates or to what amount or to whom he cannot now inform you, and why may not he have ſold this as well as others?</p>
                        <p>When called on to give an account of his tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with <hi>Matthew M'Connell,</hi> he ſays, that he never, to the beſt of his knowledge, either ſold or lent to, or depoſited with <hi>Matthew M'Connell</hi> a certificate to the amount of £. 3275:19:4 and that as he did not lend him ſuch a certificate he could not receive it from him in return.</p>
                        <p>This is not ſaying it is true, that he never received one from him to that amount, but when called upon to relate, what had paſſed between them in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in certificates, it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe, that a man of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> fair character, would have played upon words in this manner, or endeavoured to conceal the truth, if he had remembered receiving ſuch a certificate from Mr. <hi>M'Connell,</hi> and yet, that he did receive ſuch a certificate from him on the 23d of April
<pb n="682" facs="unknown:027132_0690_0FD3539D92B90F70"/>
1788 is proved by that gentleman and by his books. Here then is full evidence of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory failing him, as to the buying of this very certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate from one gentleman, and is it more extraordinary for him to forget the ſelling of it to another?</p>
                        <p>He ſays Sir, that he lent Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> a number of <hi>ſmall</hi> certificates, amounting in the whole to upwards of £. 3000—and that he made a memorandum of them in a book. This entry of them in the book was, becauſe they were to be returned—It has ſince been produced, and among theſe <hi>ſmall</hi> certificates we find, beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral to a larger amount than £. 200 each, one to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of £. 328:9:9 another to the amount of £. 398:8:9 and another to the amount of £ 1350:0:0—Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the witneſs would not have called the laſt one, a <hi>ſmall</hi> certificate, if he had recollected it. He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have forgotten, notwithſtanding the entry made in his book. Had it not been for that entry, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the whole tranſaction would have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and that his memory, though aided by it before giving his evidence, was ſo extremely treacherous as to fail him, when giving it without having the books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes at the very moment of doing ſo. Here he ſpeaks <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that they were all ſmall. He is miſtaken, and why not ſo, when ſpeaking negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without the help of a memorandum to refreſh his memory? Another very extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance attending the evidence of this gentleman is, that although from the help of his memorandum, he is enabled to recollect, lending to Mr. <hi>M'Connell</hi> on the 30th of March 1789, certificates amounting in the whole to upwards of £. 3000—yet when called upon to give an account of all their dealings in certificates, he mentions no others (page 251) although Major <hi>M'Connell,</hi> when aſked whether, the certificates for £. 3275:19:4 was paid or ſold to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan;</hi> tells you, "That it was delivered to him agreeably to an engagement or contract. That Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> delivered him ſome certificates, for which he was
<pb n="683" facs="unknown:027132_0691_0FD3540EB8372CA0"/>
to deliver him a certain quantity of another kind, and that he delivered him more certificates beſides this at the time alluded to, and afterwards." This tranſaction happened in April 1788, (page 250) and it cannot therefore be the ſame with that which Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> entry enables him to recollect having happened (page 254) in March 1789. It proves that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> parted with certificates to Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> beſides theſe mentioned by him to more than the amount of £. 3275:19:4 and that in April 1788, he was partly repaid by one certificate to that amount, and partly by more certificates at the ſame time, and fully by more certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates afterwards—yet every trace of this tranſaction is entirely eraſed from the memory of the witneſs—Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made on his mind by objects of diſtreſs, or a ſenſe of religious or moral duty are laſting; all others are but momentary, and like a bird in the air leave not a trace behind.</p>
                        <p>If this is not ſufficient to prove, that no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is to be drawn from Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan's</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to recollect a fact, than that he has forgotten it; demonſtration of its truth will afforded by that which is to follow—The whole amount of certificates which he mentions, as having been receive by him from Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> is upwards of £. 3000, which was returned to him in conſequence of the loan of March 1789—I have already ſhewed, that beſides that ſum, he received from him to more than the amount of £. 3275:19:4. Let us now attend to the evidence of Major <hi>M'Connell,</hi> ſupported by an accurate liſt made at the time, and furniſhed from his books—It amounts to no leſs a ſum (page 191) than £. 16035:11:5 in certificates delivered by him to Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan!</hi> It follows that the ſum of £. 13000 or thereabouts has eſcaped the witneſs' memory, beſides much more than £. 3000 parted with by him to Major <hi>M'Connell</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 1788!</p>
                        <p>After ſuch aſtoniſhing proofs of a treacherous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, permit me to aſk, if it would not be cruelty in
<pb n="684" facs="unknown:027132_0692_0FD35410AC6B8178"/>
the extreme; barbariſm almoſt unexampled, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn even a rat to be ducked, becauſe ſuch a witneſs may not remember, that the poor animal had counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led its companions, againſt an invaſion of our ſtack, or our mow!</p>
                        <p>In ſhort, Sir. notwithſtanding the large dealings in the certificate buſineſs, which took place between the witneſs and Major <hi>M'Connell,</hi> the mind of the former is a mere blank, except where his memorandum made an impreſſion, but even that impreſſion was ſo fugitive, as to be gone, the moment the book was out of his hands!</p>
                        <p>I have ſaid, Sir, that he expreſſes himſelf on many occaſions, as to be ſure an honeſt man who doubts would do, with ſo much heſitation as to ſhew, that he is certain of nothing. His anſwers afford ample teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of this, and I need not go through them to prove it. It has been objected, that as Mr. <hi>M'Clena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> tells you, "He took all the New-Loan certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates that he poſſeſſed, and which were to a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable amount, to be exchanged." This muſt have been amongſt them. To this I anſwer, that this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can only apply to the certificates which he then had, not thoſe which he had parted with, and of courſe it proves nothing at all, ſince it does not appear that he then had the certificate in queſtion.</p>
                        <p>"I took no account," ſays Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> "of either the number or value of the certificates, nor of the rime of delivering them to be exchanged." How little muſt he then know reſpecting them!</p>
                        <p>Whether the certificate in queſtion was exchanged or not, or whether the witneſs received Continental ones in lieu thereof, he cannot tell (page 255-6.)</p>
                        <p>Whether he received Continental certificates in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his New-Loan ones altogether and at one time, or at different times he does not remember (page 256)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> obliged Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt at different times with indents, but to what amount the witneſs cannot ſay (page 257.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="685" facs="unknown:027132_0693_0FD3539FC3924A98"/>On a final ſettlement of the account of the witneſs with the ſtate, a balance appeared againſt him, of 4446 dollars and 24 cents, which at his requeſt the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant paid in the ſummer of 1793 (page 257.)</p>
                        <p>I might perhaps Mr. Speaker, with great ſafety to my client, cloſe my obſervations here, but I ſtill reſt on one ſtrong ground of defence, ſurrounded by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable ramparts of truth and ſafety, from which it will never be in the power of the well organized and arranged, the well trained and diſciplined band of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran aſſailants to diſplace me. The charge is, that this certificate had been received in exchange for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other one, and it thereby became the property of the ſtate—If this is not proved, there is no evidence of the defendant's guilt and he muſt be acquitted. It is not incumbent on him to prove, than it was not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſtate, but on the ſtate it is incumbent to prove, that it was. What is the proof which the ſtate afford of this? Why that in March 1790 it was owned by Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan,</hi> and that at a ſubſequent period, he cannot tell us when, he delivered all the certificates which he then had, without being able to mention their amount or number to the defendant to be exchanged; that he received in exchange, certain others, the amount or number of which he cannot tell; nor did he ever know, whether the certificate in queſtion was among them or not;—he cannot ſay nor does be know that he ever ſaw it. Although we cannot learn it from him, we learn from others, that he owned it in March 1790, but as he was in the practice of buying and ſelling cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, upon a very large and extenſive ſcale, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keeping any accounts whatever reſpecting them, he may have parted with this certificate, in April, May or June of the ſame year. Upon whom then does the burthen of the proof lie? The proſecutors tell us that when ſtolen goods are found upon a man, he can only be acquitted, by proving that he came honeſtly by them, and they have endeavoured to apply that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nciple to the preſent caſe. The principle is certainly a
<pb n="686" facs="unknown:027132_0694_0FD35458799DA628"/>
good one, but before it can be applied, it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the goods were ſtolen—Before an enquiry reſpecting the thief can take place, it is neceſſary to prove that a felony was committed, and until that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the party accuſed may ſafely remain ſilent—So here; until it is proved that this certificate became the property of the ſtate by being received in exchange, the defendant is under no neceſſity of proving that he did not purloin it from the ſtate. If it never belonged to the ſtate, it is impoſſible for the ſtate to be defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its abſtraction. It is therefore incumbent on the ſtate before this charge can be maintained, to eſtabliſh a property in this certificate. Of this, though eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a conviction, and without which it is impoſſible where truth and law prevail, for a conviction to take place, not a particle of proof has been offered—It has only been ſhewn that Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan</hi> owned it in March 1790, and that more than two years afterwards he delivered all the certificates which he then had, to the defendant to be exchanged;—but as he had been in the habit of ſelling certificates, and knows nothing at all about this, there is no more evidence, of his having parted with it to the ſtate, than to any private individual whatever. Unleſs this ground is ſupported by evidence, the proſecution muſt fail, but in ſupport of this ground there is no evidence.—Evidence in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of its truth muſt be home againſt the defendant, or he has a right to demand an acquittal—The evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence adduced for that purpoſe, is in the language of an antient orator, no leſs feeble than would be an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to put but the ſun, by fanning in his face with a peacock's feather.—Here then, Sir, permit me to pauſe and to make a ſerious and determined ſtand;—a ſtand on ground ſo ſure and ſolid as to afford perfect ſafety wherever evidence is attended to;—truth reſpected; law regarded or innocence preſumed until guilt appears.</p>
                        <p>I ſaid, Sir, in an early ſtage of my remarks, that to a conviction on a charge of perjury, the evidence of two witneſſes is required. The law is the ſame on a
<pb n="687" facs="unknown:027132_0695_0FD3545A81868890"/>
charge of high treaſon, becauſe an oath of fealty is ſuppoſed to have been taken, even though owing to age or ſex it was not by law required. Having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned my reaſons and quoted my authorities then, they ſhall not be repeated now. I only requeſt that they may be remembered, and that it may be ſeriouſly conſidered, whether the ſame principle is not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the preſent occaſion.—The conſequence of a conviction will be a removal from office;—it may be a "diſqualification to hold any office of honour, truſt or profit under this commonwealth." Of this I ſhould not have taken any notice, had not the ſuppoſed mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the puniſhment, been ſtrongly urged as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for conviction.—Let your men of <hi>delicacy,</hi> who urge a conviction, becauſe to their <hi>delicate</hi> feelings it appears, that the defendant has not acted delicately ſay whether to a man of honour ſuch a puniſhment is not worſe than death!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Honorable Senate,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Circumſtances, of which my preſent appearance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords too ample a proof, have entitled me to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, but I have received it in ſuch a degree, that I will not abuſe it by taking up time in a recapitulation.</p>
                        <p>Before you, appears a man in the open and erect form of innocence;—a man whoſe integrity was till now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtioned;—a man in whom <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> for a ſeries of years, repoſed more confidence than ſhe ever did in any one of his accuſers;—not leſs than in any one of his honorable judges;—a man whoſe benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and kindneſs of diſpoſition are converted into crimes! And you ſee him charged with not only the ſummit of human, but the depth of infernal wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! and this too upon the evidence of a man, who is not able to relate with accuracy to day what happened yeſterday.</p>
                        <p>To what or to whom ſhall the defendant under theſe circumſtances appeal, in vindication of his abuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence?
<pb n="688" facs="unknown:027132_0696_0FD3549215C808D8"/>
Not to his honorable judges, <hi>as benign diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of mercy;</hi>—for her favours he diſdains. The feelings of conſcious integrity, will not permit a man, who has not ſinned; to accept ſo degrading a boon.— But his appeal is to juſtice, and he is too proud to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any thing elſe;—to juſtice not in the haggard form, in which ſhe appeared in another place; where upon a <hi>ſale</hi> related by one man, of what had been told him by another, a very high charge was made and vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be true! Where this was deemed ſufficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the information was ſaid to have come from one of the officers of government; where it was not thought worth while to ſend for that perſon before the Houſe, and to examine into the truth of falſity of the charge? But the juſtice to which he appeals, is that which reigns ſupreme within theſe walls;—in form celeſtial;— in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture divine. Her ſmiles he will not court;—her frowns he does not dread—She is the protectreſs of innocence; and if that has appeared, juſtice will pronounce WILL DONE THOU GOOD AMD FAITHFUL SERVANT.</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE honorable but arduous taſk of concluding the arguments falls to my lot. I have to lament the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between my abilities and the magnitude of this buſineſs; the latter circumſtance I doubt not however will ſecure me your beſt attention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="689" facs="unknown:027132_0697_0FD354C2CA7AE450"/>There are circumſtances in this <hi>cauſe</hi> ſufficient to excite the curioſity of the moſt dull, and to affect the feelings of thoſe leaſt attentive to the intereſt of the community.</p>
                     <p>More than 60,000 dollars have been iſſued from your Treaſury, in ſtock of the United States. The expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compenſation cannot be obtained; and if it could, it would be on terms that would render the acquiſition, no gain; and the Comptroller-General, your confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial agent, has gained more than £. 5000 by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
                     <p>A tranſaction ſo injurious to the commonwealth and derogatory to the character of the defendant, requires a diſcuſſion. The reputation of the ſtate, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the defendant, are implicated in this inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; the enquiry is of great importance, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the defendant, or the conduct of the Aſſembly. If the Houſe of Repreſentatives made uſe of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons authoriſing what has been done, let their intention have been what it might, the fault is imputable to them <hi>alone.</hi> It is neceſſary, the import of their language ſhould known; or, if the Comptroller-General ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged his official duty with art and deſign, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued laws to ſerve his private emolument, he ought to be the object of public diſapprobation.</p>
                     <p>Whether, therefore, you conſider the defendant, or the nature of the ſubject, no place can be ſo proper for the inveſtigation as the Senate, inaſmuch as character and ſtation can have no weight before this high tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The reſult of experience induced our anceſtors, in another country, to prefer trials by impeachments to the ordinary tribunals, to prevent a defect of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as the influence of the accuſed often bias and ſway the minds of a jury. Some pains have been taken by the counſel for the defendant to prejudice the Senate againſt this mode of proceeding. They ſay this ought to be referred to courts of juſtice! One gentleman ſaid, "popular bodies are eaſily warped by an artful indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, when he meditates the ruin of his neighbour."
<pb n="690" facs="unknown:027132_0698_0FD3545BFAFC6B08"/>
And the gentleman who ſpoke laſt attributes it to a gratification of humour.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect in <hi>England</hi> any abuſe of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; a ſalutary uſe hath been made of it in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the United States, and in the different ſtates, we find, when they reject bills of attainder, they adopt the mode of trials by impeachment.</p>
                     <p>I preſume every Senator hearing me perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the different kinds of debts.</p>
                     <p>Funded debt includes certificates iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies on Continental account, not including De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation certificates iſſued for the depreciation of the pay of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> line. The Act of the 21ſt of March 1783 makes the diſtinction between <hi>funded</hi> and <hi>unfunded</hi> depreciation certificates. When the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation certificates were originally iſſued, they were only funded in the Land-office, and on forfeited eſtates; theſe funds were found inſufficient to keep them from depreciating; the exciſe was therefore per Act laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, appropriated to thoſe not alienated. Hence the diſtinction. Now, the unfunded debt is an object of our enquiry. This debt, ſtrictly ſpeaking, originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lately, had been iſſued on Continental account, and unconnected with this cauſe, being contracted between the individuals and the ſtate; and although contracted on Continental account, they were ſtate debts; the creditors had no other debtor but the ſtate, and being poſſeſſed of 3 per cent. ſtock of the United States ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to redeem and pay off this debt, the law of the 10th of April 1792, whoſe meaning we are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſcertain, was paſſed.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo be proper here to mention that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of the New-Loans was about five millions of dollars, that £. 118,470:6:6 had been redeemed, and that the remainder had been reduced by exchanges to the ſum of £. 50,000. and no doubt had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but that the whole would be exchanged without the expence of a ſingle farthing to the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>The firſt great queſtion of the cauſe now offered for
<pb n="691" facs="unknown:027132_0699_0FD354C140488A50"/>
conſideration: What debts were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer in the words of the law, 1ſt. Certificates on which an intereſt of 6 per cent. was payable annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: 2d. 6 per cent. purparts. 3d. 3 per cent. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; and, 4th. Dollar-money. As matter of explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I muſt here imitate the example of the counſel for the defendant, by referring to the Journals to aſcertain the law. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the report of the committee of ways and means of the 22d of February 1792, page 157, in which the debts to be redeemed are ſtated; and that thoſe under the ſixth ſection were only to be redeemed on condition Congreſs ſhould again open the loan. Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> alſo enumerated the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates on which the ſtate were paying intereſt; that New-Loans were none of thoſe mentioned in that ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was contrary to the defendant's poſition, page 161. The committee contemplate the event of opening the loan, and declare on what grounds they will place unfunded depreciation. In page 160 the amount of the debt ſubſcribable is carried out £.73,935 3:2. Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the report of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General of the 30th November 1791; in which he mentioned the debt which was entitled to purparts, and which excludes Unfunded Depreciation and New-Loan certificates; and obſerved that it was clear that the committee of ways and means did not conſider the New-Loans as a ſtate debt, and they did not forget all the debts, for they enumerated the ſeveral kinds.)</p>
                     <p>In page 188 of the ſame minutes the report was read the ſecond time, and no alteration was made. The ſame idea is preſerved in the Act as it is in the report. It is apparent the Legiſlature did not contemplate New-Loans as a ſubſiſting debt. I will only refer to the rules for conſtruing and expounding ſtatutes. It is a maxim in the conſtruction, <hi>haeret in litera, haeret in cortice,</hi> that the life of a ſtatute does not conſiſt in the words but in the ſenſe and meaning of it; that general words of ſtatutes ſhall receive a particular interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

when the intent of the maker is particular; that things out of the letter may be within the intent, and things within the letter may be without the intent; that the intent is to be collected ſometimes; by conſidering the cauſe of making the Act, ſometimes by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one part of the Act with the other, and ſometimes by foreign circumſtances. General words in an Act are not to be, conſtrued to extend to what is repealed or annulled by previous Acts, ſuch conſtructions ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be made, that one part of the Act may agree with another: Finally, an Act of Parliament as a laſt will is to be conſtrued by the intention of the maker, that one part of it is to expound and explain the other.</p>
                     <p>I will ſhew that all their arguments refer back to a literal meaning, and that it is, as improbable that the ſick ſailor mentioned in 1ſt volume of <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> (page 61) ſhould be entitled to the property as that the New-Loan certificates ſhould be within the proviſion of the law of the 10th April 1792. It is univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the ſhip and lading did not in the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance belong to the ſick paſſenger, nor could it be within the meaning of the ſtatute. So we ſay in this caſe, the New-Loans could not be within the purview of the Act, ſo that they muſt be eventually paid. The idea was never ſuggeſted that intereſt muſt have been paid at the Treaſury on five millions of dollars, of which there remained about fifty thouſand pounds unexchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No man entertained a doubt but that the whole ſum ſhould have been exchanged in a ſhort time. Why then ſhould an expence of 20 or 25 per cent. be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, when the whole might be exchanged and in a very little time no New-Loans would be remaining?</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſtated by Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> that if the Act was to have been conſtrued literally, <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> would have to redeem all the debts of the ſeveral States in the Union. True; but does not this ſhew that a literal conſtruction is inadmiſſible, for then the debt of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> not owing on continental account would
<pb n="693" facs="unknown:027132_0701_0FD354A590796C28"/>
be alſo redeemable. This ſhews the words <hi>State debt</hi> were uſed in an appropriate, &amp; not a general ſenſe. How then are the New-Loan certificates noticed? Is there a law or reſolution of the General Aſſembly? Is there a report of the Committees of ways or means? Is there an addreſs from the Governor to the Legiſlature? Is there a report from the Comptroller-General himſelf, recogniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a debt or giving any intimation that the State meant to redeem them, from the paſſing of the Act of March 1789 to the paſſing of the Act of 10th April 1792? If therefore the Legiſlature had received no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for three years of the ſtate of the exchanges on what proportion of them were out: When, then, the whole ſyſtem is changed, without a line written or a word ſpoken on the ſubject by the Comptroller or Regiſter-General, the whole buſineſs being unknown to the Aſſembly, what have they done?</p>
                     <p>Thus far we agree, that on the 27th of March 1789 the Legiſlature declared, ſaying, we will not pay the New-Loan certificates, we will return the continental ones, you muſt look to Congreſs for your pay. The Legiſlature of 1789 made this declaration, when did they declare a different ſentiment? Why, Sir, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the defendant allege, that all on a ſudden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſingle word ſaid or written about it, on the 10th of April 1792, the Legiſlature provided a fund commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate with the objects to be redeemed? Is it to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they would extend the redemption without <hi>enlarging</hi> the fund? Would they abandon their prudent plan to open their arms ſo wide as to embrace even old Continental bills of credit, and this even without being furniſhed with an eſtimate of the coſt?—(Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the 2d ſection of the Act of 10th of April.)</p>
                     <p>As it appears the firſt leading motive with the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was to get rid of their debts, what reaſon can be given why we ſhould not purſue the ſame idea thro', and apply the ſame motives? The Legiſlature did not undertake to redeem all that are ſubſcribable—In the law of the 9th April 1791 the State debts are aſſumable, altho' not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable,
<pb n="694" facs="unknown:027132_0702_0FD354D9363ADFA0"/>
the unfunded debt is mentioned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee on ways and means as ſubſcribable, altho' not redeemable, and it is payable at 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. in the pound, while its only receivable at 16<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>.;—Their only intent was to compel a ſubſcription of the debt they meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, and therefore they impoſed it on the holders as a conſideration, that they ſhould ſubſcribe. Therefore if our conſtruction is adopted, the ſyſtem is complete and conſiſtent; if on the other hand the defendant's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould prevail, there is a fund in one, and none in the other. Here was a condition impoſed as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a redemption, you ſhall ſubſcribe to the loan, and aſſign to the ſtate treaſurer for the uſe of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; the legiſlature preſuming that they had provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fund, directed an order to be drawn by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor on the Treaſurer who ſhall immediately pay, &amp;c.—</p>
                     <p>Conſider for a moment the conſequences. If the New-Loans were included, the amount indefinite, what a predicament would the Legiſlature be involved in. Their plea is extravagant, their only reſource is the fund for claims and improvements, this fund was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to £. 10,000 and £. 5000 of that were annually appropriated for the improvement of roads. They have therefore put a conſtruction on this act that would diſhonor the State, diſhonor the firſt Magiſtrate; the conſequences of redeeming the New-Loans without providing funds would manifeſt the extreme ignorance and inconſideration of the Legiſlature—Why adopt a conſtruction whoſe conſequences are ſo abſurd, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant? They ſay, the State ſhall redeem whatever Congreſs will aſſume, ſhall Congreſs aſſume, becauſe the ſtate will redeem? Does Congreſs aſſume the debts, which the ſtate will not pay? <hi>They will not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It cannot be pretended that the redemption law of the 10th of April, 1792, created a debt; the New-Loans were excluded from redemption by the Act of 27th March 1789, there the Legiſlature declare the New-Loans ſhall never be redeemed by us; we will not redeem them otherwiſe than by an exchange; does
<pb n="695" facs="unknown:027132_0703_0FD354DB9FF993D0"/>
Congreſs ſay, they will aſſume, what <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> ſays, ſhe will not redeem. If the New-Loans are not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the State, they are not aſſumable by Congreſs. Their conſtruction will not do, except they can ſhew the will of the Legiſlature fully expreſſed ſince the 27th of March 1789; at that time no diviſions of parties prevailed, as they did when the Act of the 10th April, 1792, was paſſed. Is it to be imagined, that they would leave it to Congreſs to ſay, what debts <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> was to pay?</p>
                     <p>No, Mr. Speaker, we are to take it upon the exiſting acts; from the complexion of the houſe at that time, it is preſumed that they would not throw themſelves into the power of Congreſs. In the official ſtatements of the Comptroller-General to the Legiſlature, in which he included all the debts of the commonwealth, he expreſsly ſtates theſe New-Loans as excluded by law from redemption. I confeſs, I thought theſe few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations would have been ſufficient for minds open to conviction, in as much as all parties acquieſced in the Act of 1789, no objections were made to it, nor were any difficulties ſtarted; all parties concurred, when the ſtate had declared her will, and none referred to the New-Loans—ſtrange, to hear curious diſputes about the conſtitution,—for in Auguſt the ſame year the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors applied to Congreſs as to their only hope. As much pains have been taken to obſcure what is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf plain and ſelf-evident, and left I ſhould be thought to have neglected my duty, I am obliged to be more particular, I will therefore proceed to ſhew—</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MY <hi>firſt poſition is, that the New-Loan certificates were not aſſumable;</hi> and it is worthy of attention to conſider the manner in which it hath been brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senate. The Comptroller-General, a principal officer of government is endeavouring to bring forward a law conſigned to everlaſting oblivion; to aſſiſt his views, he is trying to give a conſtruction to the Act of 10th of April, 1792, a conſtruction which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail at that time, and it is but of late that the diſcovery was made.</p>
                     <p>If laws are to be conſtrued in this manner the beſt plan may be rendered abortive; but it hath been ſhewn that the Legiſlature have left on their records an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable evidence that they conſidered the Act of 1789 as perfectly annihilating the certificates in queſtion. They bore an intereſt of 6 per cent. for four years, if they were State debts they muſt have borne intereſt until paid off; why then were they omitted in the enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the debts of the ſtate? Why were they omitted in the ſixth ſection if they were ſubſcribable as a debt of <hi>Pennſylvania?</hi> Would it then be contended as an operation of the law, or was this inferrable from the Comptroller-General's report of December 1790— Wherein he adds that he was then ſtating all the debts of the commonwealth on which intereſt was payable by the ſtate, and adds 600l. intereſt on the New-Loans being a part of the four year's intereſt—That the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General is wrong, it is ſufficient to ſay, that if
<pb n="698" facs="unknown:027132_0706_0FD354C5CBA8D148"/>
they are aſſumable they muſt be within the aſſumption of Congreſs. If I can ſatisfy the Senate that theſe debts are not within the aſſumption of Congreſs, if ſo, and the Comptroller is defeated, is it a ſufficient apology for him to ſay? <hi>"Such was my opinion. I was miſtaken."</hi> A public officer ought to tread on ſure ground; groſs negligence and inattention is fraud; extravagant raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ought to be checked in any well regulated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
                     <p>Although it is his fault then if it ſhall paſs unnoticed now, the blame will reſt elſewhere. How does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; is it not clear proof that they are not aſſumable? The Secretary of the Treaſury hath declared to the world they are not aſſumable, the commiſſioners for ſettling the accounts of the United States with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual States, have declared the ſame opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the New-Loans are not charged to Congreſs in the account of this State, therefore not conſidered as certificates iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies, <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> cannot obtain certificates from Congreſs, if ſhe could, ſhe muſt refund the amount in continental certificates, and pay the ſame in addition; the United States do not undertake to aſſume and charge the ſtate with debts, which they have refuſed to pay. The Attorney-General of the United States declared them not aſſumable, but that firm texture of mind which one of the counſel for the defendant hath attributed to him is hardly a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient apology. If this had taken place, the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription would have been loſt to the ſtate, I will ſhew this to mathematical demonſtration. The amount of the ſubſcription of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was 2,200,000 dollars, when the ſtate had ſubſcribed her quota 65,000 dollars, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> ſubſcription would have been charged to her until ſhe had delivered continental certificates to that amount, beſides the difference between 16 and 20 ſhillings in the pound. But it will be aſked, why does not this miſtake happen in all the other ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> previouſly charged the ſame amount to Congreſs, and the only difference to <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi>
                        <pb n="699" facs="unknown:027132_0707_0FD354C8013FB7A8"/>
is the difference between the balance of caſh and ſtock; but we are told that we can charge Congreſs with every thing of this kind, I anſwer, let any gentleman look at the books, and there is not a ſingle New-Loan certificate charged to them, but the whole is ſunk at the loſs of this ſtate. Either the Comptroller-General knew this would not be received, or what is moſt probable that he knew it was not payable out of the public Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, or if payable, it muſt have been ſunk as before.</p>
                     <p>But, again, it may be ſaid that all theſe miſtakes might be rectified, and the time for the ſettlement might be extended by Congreſs, I anſwer, that it is not expectable that ſuch an indulgence could be granted, ſuch a privilege might be obtained by an humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Congreſs. In this critical ſituation ſhe could not obtain a ſingle farthing of ſtock until ſhe lodged her continental certificates for it.</p>
                     <p>But if it is neceſſary to recur to the words of the law, we will ſee if Congreſs had countenanced this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant idea, we will ſee that Congreſs did not aſſume the debts of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> which ſhe did not determine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, they ſay, they will aſſume the debts of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates, but will they determine for the ſtates their debts, or ſay, they'll pay what the ſtates ſay <hi>they'll</hi> not pay, (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the 13th ſection of the law of Congreſs, of Auguſt 4,1790.) Here, ſir, is certainly no intimation that Congreſs meant to determine what that debt was. (The letter page 81-2 was then read and commented on.) This is perfectly conſiſtent with the law, and the Attorney-General of the United States conſtrues the Act exactly as I do. If any diſpute ſhould ariſe between an individual and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> Congreſs will not undertake to determine. <hi>"It is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, ſettle it among yourſelves, we will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle."</hi> From the character and ſituation of the writer of this letter we muſt acknowledge that he determines the queſtion of aſſumability, not redeemability. Now, Sir, we have the opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſury, and the declaration of the Attorney-General, the firſt
<pb n="700" facs="unknown:027132_0708_0FD354DD95BE7B88"/>
law-officer and the United States, that if there be an Act <hi>in form of a law,</hi> declaring them not payable, they are not aſſumable. Have any diſpute ariſen that there is ſuch a law? The law is dated 1 April 1790, page 790, this ſhews the Legiſlature did not conſider the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentale certificates the property of the ſtate, until the New-Loans were redeemed. But again, we are told that Congreſs ſpeaks of the New-Loans as aſſumable; this is ſtrange, is it improper that Congreſs ſhould provide not to aſſume twice the ſame debt? therefore they have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a clauſe which the Secretary by his conſtruction hath rendered intelligible. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the 18th ſection of the Act of Congreſs of Auguſt 4, 1790.)</p>
                     <p>Now, Sir, there is not a ſyllable in this ſection about ſurrendering up the counterparts to the United States; therefore agreeably to the literal common conſtruction, had a New-Loan holder ſubſcribed 6d. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> muſt reſtore the ſame, or the ſubſcription on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be ſuſpended; it is however true, that the Secretary of the Treaſury hath put a much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſtruction on the Act. If you ſubſcribe £.100 of New-Loans to the loan, an hundred pounds of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates muſt be ſurrendered to the United States, both certificates being evidences of one debt. But is that determining what are ſtate debts, and what not? that would be to encourage the New-Loan hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to controvert the Secretary's conſtruction. If there are New Loans iſſued and are ſubſcribed, then you muſt deliver up an equal amount of Continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates. The Secretary of the Treaſury tells you in his letter (page 76-7-8-9, which Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> read and commented upon.) It was preſented to the Secretary as if the Act of 1786 had not been repealed. No doubts were ever ſuggeſted <hi>to him</hi> that there had been any law declaring them no debt.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs lay in this manner until Auguſt 21, 1793, when the Secretary wrote to the Governor (page 218-9, which was likewiſe read and commented upon by him.) Here were ſix months at leaſt, from Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
<pb n="701" facs="unknown:027132_0709_0FD354DE80FD4FA8"/>
to Auguſt, a ſufficient time to make up their mind, and then the New-Loans were rejected totally as not ſubſcribable. It was the cloſing of the account with the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> which excluded them, and not the lapſe of time. Now, what doubt remains? It ſaid, that it was not ſtated to Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent point of view, that the law of 1789 was paſſed after the Federal Conſtitution was adopted. I aſk, would it affect the buſineſs if it had? O heavens! had we no principles of legiſlation until 1788 and 1789? Were we born yeſterday? Were we novices? Let us not entertain an idea ſo degrading. If we entered into a contract before that period, could we abrogate that contract? It is true the United States in this as well as in other reſpects decline to meddle with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; but, Sir, were not the ſame principles held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time? Yes; they were argued at the bar, and in the Houſe of Repreſentatives; and the Houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided they might conſtitutionally repeal the law of 1786. The Secretary of the Treaſury ſays, if you have a difference, ſettle it between yourſelves. The Judiciary of the United States have no right to decide between <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and her own citizens; I cannot ſee with what good reaſons they adduce a compariſon reſpecting the ſuability of ſtates but in regard of their being exiſting debts. Mr. <hi>Randolph</hi> tells us, it is enough that your laws do not recognize them as debts. But to put this in a more prominent point of view, the Secretary of the Treaſury, a member of the Grand Convention, a gentleman ſo acute and enlightened, can it be ſuppoſed that it eſcaped <hi>him?</hi> Nay, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-General and the Commiſſioners of accounts!</p>
                     <p>Does not the hiſtory of the aſſumption ſhew their ſenſe? The reaſons no more apply to the New-Loan certificates than the moſt remote ſubject which the mind of man can contemplate. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read 3d vol. debates of Congreſs, page 41, 485.) Were the New-Loan holders clamorous at the door of Congreſs? What was it to the New-Loan creditors in <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
                        <pb n="702" facs="unknown:027132_0710_0FD354C9912D7218"/>
that <hi>Shays</hi> made his appearance in <hi>Maſſachuſetts?</hi> Were not the five millions exchanging without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and reduced to fifty thouſand pounds? Was the principal or intereſt then payable? We have it from our learned opponents themſelves that the funds were withdrawn. We will by and by conſider that that debt was never to be paid by this ſtate, and unleſs they ſhould be loſt or by ſome other caſualty, not a New-Loan would have been out in the courſe of time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for exchanging them. There is no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Congreſs ſhould be induced to pay the New-Loans, for the United States do not any where ſay, we will pay that debt whether <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will redeem it or not; but in caſes where the creditor could call on the ſtate, it never entered into their contemplation to aſſume ſuch debts. No idea is ſuggeſted that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would pay leſs than that mentioned on the face of their contract, and of courſe no reaſon to believe Congreſs would aſſume them. But we have it in proof that all the confidential officers of the United States were directed to keep clear of them, if they wanted the due recognition of the ſtate as exiſting debts.</p>
                     <p>Then, Sir, the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> are the teſt to determine whether they were or were not ſubſcribable. I will therefore aſk, whether the New-Loans are recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized as an exiſting debt on or about the 10th of April 1792, and whether they were payable at that preſent, or at a future period, or at an indefinite time? This brings me to the laborious taſk of ſhewing by tracing through the laws, what I think the Senate have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, that the law of 1789 rendered them no longer a debt or evidence of a debt.</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſaid, and I ſubſcribe to it, that ſtatutes muſt not be judged of by the opinions of members, but muſt be expounded by the common and uſual rules. Adhering then to this principle, it will not be difficult to demonſtrate, that after the paſſing of the Act of March 27, 1789, they were no longer a debt or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a debt due by the ſtate. In the firſt place it
<pb n="703" facs="unknown:027132_0711_0FD354E0AE349148"/>
is neceſſary to know what the law meant; then let us try it by the Conſtitution, and ſee whether it will abide that teſt. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the title.) The title of this law is prepared, and affixed after the whole ſcope is gone through, and the law is for repealing a former one, and by that, to repeal the payment of principal and intereſt. Paſſing on then, in order to know the reaſons, and of conſequence the extent of the repeal, we muſt ſuppoſe the law conſonant with the intention and declared views of the Legiſlature without examining them. If the law of 1786 was not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and this law ſays ſo, it is a coincident circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and muſt be ſo taken. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the preamble.)</p>
                     <p>The aggregate fund was the foundation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and the leading circumſtance; now the motive comes—"It is reaſonable and juſt;" this is putting the Acts of 1785 and 1786 on the ſame footing, and all agree that the former proviſion was temporary. Having aſſigned theſe reaſons they proceed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting clauſe (firſt ſection then read.) This, it is ſaid was only withdrawing the funds. Were there any funds by the Act of 1786? The funds were created by the Act of 1785: No. Therefore, there is ſomething more; they ſpeak of more Acts than one. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſigned by the counſel for the defendant, the moſt inapplicable of all others, that is, ſuſpence and delay. Was this a time to ſeek for ſuſpenſion, when the ſtate was receiving the ſums due her from the Continent? She then had the immenſe fund of a Land-office, the arts, manufactures and agriculture flouriſhing, this fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>y! If ſhe was impreſſed with an idea ſo baſe as to have no other motive for ſubtracting the funds, which we muſt never ſuppoſe, and unleſs ſhe was infatuated, ſhe muſt inſtantly have ſubſtituted other funds in lieu of them taken away. I have ſaid that the recital if true, was in fact what repealed this law. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="704" facs="unknown:027132_0712_0FD354937665DB88"/>
for my purpoſe, if in their underſtanding they entertained the ſame view, it had the ſame effect on them, whether well or ill founded. When they ſpeak of repealing the law of 1785 as well as the law of 1786, they apply it to the principal and intereſt; when they make the proviſion temporary, they apply that to the intereſt only, but it is not ſo; there is not a ſingle let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the law which makes the diſtinction. I think it ſafer to take their view from the Acts themſelves, than at ſecond hand. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the ſection.) As the funds were temporary the proviſion ceaſed alſo. If the proviſion will ceaſe, will not the funds alſo ceaſe? Is it poſſible to wink ſo hard as not to ſee? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is to remain if the funds eſtabliſhed by the Acts of 1785 and 1786 are to ceaſe? If the tedious road ſo often trod muſt again be travelled over, although I do not think it neceſſary, I think theſe plauſible reaſons for withdrawing the funds; foreign as well as domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic creditors were to be paid. This Houſe cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the difference between that and the preſent day. A diſſolution of the Confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or at leaſt not until a very diſtant period, each ſtate to take care of its own people. Under this aſpect of public affairs, the Act of 16th of March 1785, the firſt law on this ſubject, was paſſed, to continue until Congreſs ſhould provide; notwithſtanding theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions, it reflect eternal honour on the authors of it. She uſed the funds which were not applied to the creditors generally. This was not her fault— it was attributable to ſome of the eaſtern ſtates, but <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was never the original debtor; ſhe was only ſurety for the United States. Why not hunt the lion more generouſly? Why ſearch up theſe ſleeping Acts?</p>
                     <p>The Legiſlature of 1785 inſtead of ſeeking an excuſe to evade the requiſitions of Congreſs, contributed every farthing required of them. It can be ſhewn by the ſtatements of the defendant himſelf, that there was a
<pb n="705" facs="unknown:027132_0713_0FD35480F19EA300"/>
balance in her favour in ſpecie, and in indents, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily poſſeſſing as ſhe did ſo large a portion of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates; the law of 1785 provides for creditors of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> and alſo for the requiſitions to Congreſs. The manner how this payment was made thro' the agency of the continental officers hath been already ſufficiently explained. Congreſs was afraid leſt the exciſe would be ſuſpended, and for fear of offending foreign ſtates or foreign creditors in Sept. 1785, for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, paſſed their reſolution, 11 Volume, page 328-9, to defeat the operation of that law, it will appear that it was not a complaint that the requiſitions were not complied with; but that notwithſtanding they ſhould not pay the citizen creditors of any State in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the foreign creditors: The honorable Senate, no doubt, recollect the difference between that time and the preſent day.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, altho' I do not think it neceſſary, that the Act of 1786 was intended as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary relief only. To underſtand theſe laws, it is neceſſary to be reminded of the ſituation of the United States, the debilitated State of the confederacy, and the diſtreſſed ſituation of the public creditors. A diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the confederacy was apprehended, that the debts of the Union would never be diſcharged, or, at leaſt until a very diſtant period.</p>
                     <p>Under this aſpect of public affairs the firſt law of this ſubject was paſſed on the 16th March 1785, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until Congreſs ſhould provide; this Act provides for the annual requiſitions of Congreſs, beſides taking care of its own people, the creditor citizens of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> Notwithſtanding the reflections againſt this law, it reflects eternal honor on the authors of it, ſhe uſed the funds which went not to the creditors generally, the delinquency was not attributed to her, but to the Eaſtern States; ſhe never was the original debtor, ſhe was only ſurety, and not the principal; it was her duty to bring it forward in ſome manner to make it a charge againſt the United States, the object was conſidered
<pb n="706" facs="unknown:027132_0714_0FD35496A311E3D8"/>
the ſame, altho' the mode of obtaining it was different, then when the principal had been ready to pay why ſhould we hunt up theſe ſleeping Acts with a view to embarraſs this buſineſs? Altho' Congreſs admitted the purity of the motives which actuated <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> ſhe nevertheleſs reſolved that any intereſt which ſhould be paid after the firſt of January, 1786, ſhould not be allowed.</p>
                     <p>But as Congreſs defeated the operations of the Act of 1785, it became neceſſary to carry that law into effect, in ſuch a manner, as to make it a charge againſt the United States; this, Sir, was the whole motive, altho' the mode of doing the buſineſs was different, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was the ſame; and the better to ſave appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, the certificates purported to be for ſo much money received on loan; did this bring the New-Loans within the term of State debts? <hi>State debt</hi> has a definite meaning, including debts on a continental account, and debts contracted on her own proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Yet, as every perſon well knew, a definite meaning, when the creditor had only recourſe to the ſtate, and not to Congreſs. The defendant's counſel have been diametrically oppoſite on this ſubject; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would never have complained of the law of 1786 had the Legiſlature confined themſelves to the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their proper ſtate debt, and yet we find them deputing a committee from their body to endeavour to effect the deſtruction of the law of 1786, (ſee report, page 319, 320 of this.) What was the reaſoning of the ſtate on that occaſion? The Legiſlature had no deſign to ſeparate the contract from the fund, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the fund as the eſſence of the contract, they ſay, we are ready to pay our quota, and to comply with our requiſitions, and until that is done we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the funds, the law of 1786 muſt remain until a general proviſion is made by Congreſs—When the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod had arrived, mentioned in the Act of 1785, ſo far as it reſpects the payment of principal or intereſt of the New-Loan debt, a repeal took place; this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="707" facs="unknown:027132_0715_0FD354B4842EA5F0"/>
had extinguiſhed the debt, our opponents inſiſt it only withdrew the funds.</p>
                     <p>This ſhews the compact was not to be final and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete until all the ſtates ſhould agree. Here are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in which we and our opponents agree; let us ſee how far. Can't you, ſays Congreſs, withdraw the funds? <hi>"Withdraw the funds,"</hi> ſays the Aſſembly ſpurning at the idea, and leave our contract a <hi>caput mortuum;</hi> at preſent we cannot withdraw theſe funds without ſubſtituting others in their place, but when halcyon days will come, then we will withdraw them; you will know that taking theſe funds would be leaving our own creditors diſappointed; this is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, and agreeable to our conſtruction, the meaſure is not precipitate; (other paragraphs of the report was then read.) I will not proſtitute the dignity of my profeſſion by evaſion, had I underſtood it as the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's counſel, I would not have attempted to reconcile it with the conſtitution, or the eternal rules of juſtice. I admit the intention of the ſtate was to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion commenſurate with the funds.—But I contend here as I did elſewhere, that they did not ſeparate the contract from the fund, nor did the ſtate continue to owe after they were diſcharged from the payment.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I contend, that when the period had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and Congreſs were under an efficient government, it then became neceſſary for <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to "modify the payment." Grant me this and it leads to all that I contend for; for it is neceſſary to ſhew that the funds made uſe of on this occaſion were not taken after they had been given up to Congreſs. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read ſome paſſages from the 8th volume or the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Congreſs, page 187, to ſhew that the execution of the reſolutions were expreſsly ſuſpended until they ſhould be acceded to by every ſtate in the Union.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in September 23, 1783, complied with the requiſition, with a proviſo that the Act was not to take effect until each ſtate in the Union had paſſed ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws. In page 194, <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by a long addreſs
<pb n="708" facs="unknown:027132_0716_0FD354E17990C930"/>
ſympathized with Congreſs, and as Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe copied the reſolution into her Act, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it ſhould be ſuſpended until the twelve other ſtates ſhould comply with the ſame. Now where is the foundation for reproach? How did the ſtate by the Act of 1786 paſs an Act which was void? No funds were taken away from Congreſs; no requiſitions were neglected; but they were anticipated. The Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller's own ſtatements for December 6, 1786—No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 3, 1787, and November 4, 1788, ſhew that the ſtate complied punctually with all the requiſitions of Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>On the 27th July 1786 there remained a balance in the Treaſury of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> of above ſixty thouſand dollars, and the Comptroller adds, that a balance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 30,000 dollars remained due to her in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1787; not to mention the amount of indents, of which I need not take up your time to ſhew it; for ſhe always had indents enough. It is however true, there was another requiſition then made, but never complied with, that is, two year's intereſt to the foreign credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and one year's ditto to domeſtic creditors, who were citizens. This I will diſmiſs, as no other ſtate complied, the requiſition being unreaſonable.</p>
                     <p>Is <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> then criminal? ſhe was eminently in advance before 1786. Surely there is no reaſon for ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting that the law of 1786 was void with reſpect to the funds. (Mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> the Speaker of the Senate, interrupted Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll,</hi> and ſuggeſted, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was, whether "the form of the certificates binds the ſtate, and if it is admitted a debt by the Act of 1786, whether it makes the obligation permanent, this ſtate conſenting by that Act to be a creditor of the Union, no doubts could preclude the creditors from their rights." Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> replied, My anſwer to that will be this, If I receive an obligation payable to bearer, I agree, that I am not to look farther than the face of the writing, but theſe certificates refer to the Act, and it is as much an intimation to the holders of the
<pb n="709" facs="unknown:027132_0717_0FD35498CEA65208"/>
nature of the contract, as if the whole Act had been tranſcribed and embodied into them, becauſe they are referred to the Act. Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate, ſee page 317.)</p>
                     <p>As to the obſervations made reſpecting the minutes of Council of Feb. 3, 1785, theſe refer to the law of 1785, which is clearly of a temporary nature, and the law itſelf expreſſes it ſo. It contradicts the defendant's leading principles and contends that unfunding the debt is a violation of the contract; the one cannot ceaſe, unleſs the other ceaſes; the fund and obligation muſt go together; theſe, Sir, are ſome of the arguments appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Act of 1785, and yet that law ſpeaks a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which no ſophiſtry can confound. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the 18th ſection of that law, page 467.) Now, Sir, theſe reaſonings of the Supreme Executive Council deſtroy the idea, that contracts may exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out funds. I do not know why theſe were read unleſs to paſs cenſure on the Aſſembly of 1785.</p>
                     <p>How does this agree with the reaſoning imputed to the Aſſembly of 1789? The funds are withdrawn, and no others are ſubſtituted; but I have ſaid, and it muſt be again noticed, altho' they have given a reaſon for withdrawing the funds at March 1789, yet no reaſons are given for cancelling the debt, was it not for <hi>not paying</hi> the debt? A CURIOUS DEBT INDEED! It is agreed, that the funds were withdrawn, no other funds were ſubſtituted or promiſed, and the ſtate were not compellable to give any, depending altogether on will and pleaſure, not obligatory in conſcience, neither moral nor political obligation, <hi>a ſtrange debt!</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract never to be executed cannot be a debt. This puts me in mind of <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Crambe;—Crambe</hi> ſwore that he could frame a conception of a Lord-Mayor not only without his horſe, gown and gold chain, but even without ſtatute, feature, colour, hands, head, feet, or any body, which he ſuppoſed was the <hi>abſtract</hi> of a Lord-Mayor.</p>
                     <p>A certificate remains as blank paper, is it obligatory
<pb n="710" facs="unknown:027132_0718_0FD3548253EC6338"/>
becauſe it enables the poſſeſſor to come to the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General and to get back his continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? Is it a debt payable at the preſent time, or at any future period? Does not a debt exiſt <hi>ex vi termini?</hi> Does it not imply an obligation? True it does, if "deſirous" or optional, a choice; yes, the law gives a choice, but it is <hi>Hobſon's</hi> choice, that or none, and when one ſays, it is not to be paid, it is in other words, ſaying <hi>"I am not indebted;"</hi> in name, optional; in effect, obligatory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"Directs</hi> and <hi>ſecures,"</hi>—directing and ſecuring were included in the aſſumption, it was that and more too, the certificate itſelf ſecured the debt, as they allege, but the debt was not ſecured, there exiſted no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to provide a fund, what aſſume a debt not paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? that is, in other words to ſay, that the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is not in debt.</p>
                     <p>It was attempted to diſtinguiſh between princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt, and that temporary funds only apply to intereſt. Does the Act ſhew it in this manner? Do the reſolutions point it out thus? hath this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance eſcaped the notice of the Aſſembly?— No—But the minutes ſhew that the buſineſs was pointedly brought before them; firſt, the intereſt was only attended to, then it was poſtponed, and the clauſe was added, every Act or Acts directing or ſecuring the payment of principal and intereſt. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the motion, page 184.) Here then the Aſſembly have brought the principal and intereſt fully into view, this ſhews the Legiſlature meant the principal alſo, as they did not deſign to diſtinguiſh. Now as to the intereſt not to be perpetual, it was to be temporary, if Congreſs ſhould provide; if not, it was to be final. Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> obſerved that <hi>temporary</hi> was meant to be <hi>partial;</hi> but no words are leſs ſynonymous than <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> and <hi>partial.</hi> They meant the payment of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt until Congreſs ſhould provide.</p>
                     <p>Much reliance hath been placed on the word <hi>"many,"</hi> this word was introduced without any pointed attention,
<pb n="711" facs="unknown:027132_0719_0FD35483EA1F4B70"/>
there was no uſe for it, the clauſe firſt ſtood without it, and regarded only the intereſt. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the minutes to the Act of 10th April 1792.) This was only neceſſary as it regarded the equalizing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and the exchange. Another reaſon offers for conſideration, this funding ſyſtem in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was the ſymbol of party, and was looked upon by ſome as ſound policy, by others it was looked upon the very reverſe. At the time this law paſſed, Congreſs had not begun to paſs their laws, many ſuppoſed the Act of 1789 might be repealed, and of conſequence the law of 1785 might be revived with all the debt, of courſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> they provided for the exchange, and with a view to get rid of the queſtion left the choice with the party, it being then not known what proviſion Congreſs would make.</p>
                     <p>But, theſe things, like general rules, have their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: Bills of credit are barred by particular Acts to come forward as contracts, which the ſtate cannot controul. Contracts are deſtroyed when the party is excuſed from carrying it into effect; therefore the New-Loan holders on agreeing to the Conſtitution of the United States, and withdrawing the funds, diſcharges the ſtate from the performance of the contract. There is no analogy between theſe and the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> certificates; there they were iſſued in colluſion, and not for Continental certificates; there they are not binding on that ſtate; reaſons of that kind may occur here, where the certificates are only temporary in their duration. How will the contracts of the United States ſtand this teſt? Are not the continental bills contracts? Are New-Loans contracts? Are they not continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing by exchanges? Are the bills of credit of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> to revive as contracts? Theſe particulars ſhew that the principle was eſtabliſhed, and as old as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that contracts muſt be abided by, and held ſacred, and that ſome of them can be controuled?</p>
                     <p>If I enter into a contract with my neighbour, and he prevents me from doing part, ſhall I by that be compelled to do another part? Was there ever a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="712" facs="unknown:027132_0720_0FD354E2F71C8540"/>
where the party is excuſed from carrying it into effect, if the contract remained irrevocable? The contract ceaſes wholly, or remains altogether to be carried into effect. How were we circumſtanced in 1789? Why, the ſocial compact takes out of the hands of the ſtate certain funds. The New-Loan holders repreſented in Convention, and acquieſcing to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Federal Conſtitution, agreed to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and excuſed the Aſſembly from a performance of their former agreement; and it is conceded that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> by good faith might ſurrender theſe funds, and were under no obligation to ſubſtitute others. Is this faith? Is this juſtice? Is this a good principle? Where is the ſubſtance or reaſon for this procedure? Why! either the funds are pledged for ever, or the contract is temporary. I mean by this, either theſe funds muſt remain or others muſt be ſubſtituted in their room.</p>
                     <p>If I had underſtood the Act of 1789 as contended for by the defendant, I would never have appeared here. To ſay that the Act of 1786 was perpetual and not temporary, and yet to ſay <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> may take away thoſe and not ſubſtitute others, is imputing to her ſuch fraudulent inconſiſtency, that I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
                     <p>Either the debt ceaſed to be ſuch by the Act of March 1789, or the Aſſembly was bound by every principle of honour and juſtice to ſubſtitute other funds immediately.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſhort teſt to try this. If the funds are taken away, the intereſt at your Treaſury is not paid half yearly. If the contract is not affected, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may always draw the intereſt. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the form of a New-Loan certificate.) But they ſay the obligation remains; then let them turn to page 63, Act April, 1791, where they will find that the certificates come within the purpart law of that date. (Part of the law then read, and a repetition of the calculation of the parts of ſtock as in page 329 of this.)
<pb n="713" facs="unknown:027132_0721_0FD3545E49CCA6D8"/>
If they were evidences of debt, they were payable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Act of April 9, 1791) although it was never attempted to introduce them thereunder as redeemable. The Act for the relief of <hi>Sarah Caldwell</hi> only autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes a ſubſcription of the Continental certificates in truſt, in the domeſtic loan of Congreſs; and only amounts to putting her in the ſame ſituation as if ſhe had New-Loans. There is no analogy between this caſe and that of the certificates of <hi>North-Carolina.</hi> Re-iſſuing the paper money was for the purpoſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the exchange. It is diſagreeable to have an obligation abroad, though it be paid. The hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of New-Loan certificates naturally wiſhed not to exchange, as this was their intereſt; for £. 100 in New-Loans produced 6 per cent. intereſt; but if exchanged it only produced 3 per cent. This of courſe introduced the practice of encouraging the New-Loan holders to exchange their New-Loans for the Continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the preamble and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry paſſages of the law of the 7th of April 1791, to enforce his arguments, that the obligation was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged although outſtanding, and although it was not obligatory, the ſtate wanted it to ceaſe being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, in order to have the care and cuſtody of her own property.)</p>
                     <p>It hath been ſuggeſted, that the ſtate paid intereſt on certificates between September 1777 and March 1778, calculated on a reduced value, and charged Congreſs at the ſpecie value. Trace the circumſtances of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, and you will find the repealing law was founded not on affected, but real neceſſity, and ſee if the period had not arrived, when the law of 1786 ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>The grand convention ended the 17th September 1787. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> adopted the conſtitution the 13th December ſame year. The ninth ſtate adopted it on the 21ſt of June 1789, and in July 1789 Congreſs paſſed a law impoſing duties to operate the 1ſt of Auguſt; of conſequence, they might well ſay, it <hi>"would ſoon ceaſe."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It it true the Aſſembly might have waited until the
<pb n="714" facs="unknown:027132_0722_0FD354CB398F7940"/>
funds were actually taken out of their hands by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that they did not, was the principal cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint with the New-Loan holders. Therefore the New-Loan debt ceaſed, and was no longer operative, but to get back the continental certificates, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears of intereſt.</p>
                     <p>But, let us turn to the Act of 1786, and ſee what part of it will remain after the repeal. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then went over the different ſections and clauſes of that law, to point out the import of the words and the meaning of the Act, and concluded by obſerving that it was indifferent to him what time the Senate would adjourn to, but earneſtly requeſted to have the privilege of finiſhing that evening.)</p>
                     <p>Adjourned to four o'clock ſame day.</p>
                     <p>In the minutes of the Houſe of Repreſentatives the following entry is recorded:—</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Senate,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In addition to the obſervations made by me this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, by which I have ſhewn that the debt was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, a debt never to be paid principal or intereſt, and that this debt was not aſſumable, nor ſubſcribable to the loan, after the paſſing of the Act of March 27, 1789, it will be recollected that the queſtion for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral enquiry and conſideration, will be, whether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe circumſtances was or was not this law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional? Congreſs will not conſider the conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the law; it is a diſpute between the holder and the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> She neither could nor will determine ſuch diſputes; it is ſufficient that they ceaſed to be a debt; they are not aſſumable; the defendant is unwilling to meet the queſtion; his counſel now urge that the law is unconſtitutional: It is agreed the ſtate might ſuſpend the payment of intereſt, withdraw the funds and modify the payment of the principal.</p>
                     <p>The funds were a part of the contract, they acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the credit, <hi>they induced the loan.</hi> The counſel for the defendant have conceded a principle which leads to all the conſequences we deduce. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> can alter the terms of her contract; the principles are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed from which they can never retrieve themſelves. The ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> has the ſame rights as a private perſon. My creditor preſcribes an alteration on agreement; I cannot do it nor can he do it ſingly. If the ſtate authoriſes to alter the contract, ſhe may
<pb n="716" facs="unknown:027132_0724_0FD354E6D6036040"/>
authoriſe the abolition of it. Will the gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that a conference had been held between the ſtate of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and the holders of New-Loan certificates? The ſtate ſpeaks only by her laws, where the contract might be altered. The degree and extent of alteration muſt be left at diſcretion, ſubject only to a ſenſe of right and wrong, and is therefore not a caſe within the Conſtitution. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> read the 10th ſection of the firſt article of the Conſtitution.) The New-Loans are out of the ſpirit and letter of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the United States; the law of 1789 im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs no contract. If it is but of the reach of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it cannot be in the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Let us recollect the comments of my learned col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league from <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> (Mr. <hi>Dexter)</hi> on the eternal principles of right and wrong obviouſly oppoſed to the principles of "perfidy," fraud and chicane, and I will not pretend to ſay how far it might ſtand in a court of judicature.</p>
                     <p>The limitation and diſcretion relative of ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are never to be aſcertained by the conſtitution. The Comptroller-General's own plan of finance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a limitation that would not be conſonant to the conſtitution. Shall my creditor ſay, unleſs I call at a certain time I cannot have payment at all, this is ſurely more repugnant to the conſtitution than any thing in the Act of 1789. Congreſs is alſo reſtricted in the exerciſe of their legiſlative power, a variation from the original contract is propoſed by the Secretary of the Treaſury in his plan for the redemption and fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public debt, inſtead of whole 6 per cents. ſome are at 3 per cent. The ſame ſpirit of variation has induced the ſtrained conſtruction of the Act of the 10th of April 1792. The New-Loan creditors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing the Act as we do, had applied to Congreſs and remonſtrated againſt the conduct of the Secretary, I do not deſign to caſt any reflections on the Secretary, I am ſatisfied, he was impelled by the pureſt motives for the public good. To excuſe therefore the conduct of
<pb n="717" facs="unknown:027132_0725_0FD354B5F725B8B8"/>
an individual, which is at leaſt excuſable, ought to be our duty; but I expect to be able to ſhew that the New-Loan holders remonſtrated to Congreſs againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the original contract.</p>
                     <p>But it ſhould be remembered that the Comptroller as a member of the community, a holder of New-Loan debt, and a creditor of the United States diſſolved in part the contract between <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> and her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors by acceding to the adoption of the conſtitution of the United States; he has alſo acted for years as a ſervant of the public in the execution of this very act —no matter whether a man ſhews his mind from words or actions.</p>
                     <p>Auguſt 2, 1789, (ſee debates of Congreſs, 2 vol. page 280) the New-Loan holders applied to Congreſs, and in ſtrong language they call them <hi>"our only hope."</hi> Here, Mr. Speaker, you may preceive their ſilence, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence, O charming infancy! their ſilence firſt, then their application to Congreſs, and all this correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be no proof of their acquieſcence! Five mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars were all exchanged except fifty thouſand pounds. The defendant purchaſed of perſons who had waved their claims as they had acquieſced in the law; witneſs <hi>Biddle</hi> and <hi>Oldden;</hi> by their conduct they waved it; it is therefore poſſible they transferred their rights to the defendant, or that he derived it from them. The meaning of the law of 1789 cannot be doubted, but at any rate it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that thoſe who have acted under a title for a courſe of years in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity can impeach it. Is the agent at liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the commiſſion under which he had acted ſo long?</p>
                     <p>If, therefore, the New-Loans ceaſed to be a debt, they were not aſſumable, and there was no neceſſity for the certification of the defendant. Why then did the Comptroller-General certify them <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and then recognize them as debts, and paſs them as aſſumable and redeemable? It is denied that the Comptroller-General certified New-Loans to be aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or if he did, it was but in a few inſtances, not
<pb n="718" facs="unknown:027132_0726_0FD3546441CB6D48"/>
in his own caſe, and not in his character as Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General. It is alſo ſaid, that it is not alleged, he certified them <hi>ſo;</hi> that therefore the proof is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and the charge unſupported. I will ſhew that the articles of impeachment are ſufficient in ſubſtance and form, and ſupported by the evidence. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the firſt article.) I have given notice to the defendant's counſel, that I would refer to obſervations well expreſſed by <hi>Federaliſt,</hi> 2d vol. page 210, on the propriety of impeachments—What is not criminal on an indictment is not ſo on an impeachment; the leſs certainty is requiſite in the latter than in the former. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying in a few inſtances is as really criminal as in many, although not injurious in the ſame degree. If he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to any, he is criminal. It hath been ſaid, that he is not charged in the articles, to whom he certified, whether to the Loan-officer, to a private perſon, or to a man in the country; he is excuſed by not ſigning officially! If the Comptroller-General, not <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon</hi> acting as ſuch, certified New-Loans to be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and aſſumable, he well knew it was to the loſs and riſque of the commonwealth. It is ſaid, that he did not add the title of his office, but only the initials of his name. I am ſorry to find the defence of the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller General reſting on ſuch flimſy ſubterfuges. Has not the ſubſcribing the initials the ſame effect? is not the object the ſame? If ſo, is it different whether the initials are written or the whole name? Are not the reports to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Aſſembly ſigned in the ſame manner? And if he ſhould have miſled them he would be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p>But it hath been ſaid, that the evidence do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the charge, and that he did not ſign his own ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable:</hi> If he certified for any one it is ſufficiently proved. Let us examine how his own buſineſs was managed, a long roll in his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and intended to make the ſame impreſſion as if he had certified it <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable;</hi> How would Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> reaſon on this? Would he ſeparate thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts
<pb n="719" facs="unknown:027132_0727_0FD35465B65FD878"/>
which were certified <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable</hi> from that in the Comptroller's own hand-writing? We find ſome circumſtances in his ſubſcription of a bad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which do not alleviate the charges, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in blank in the month of June, how was this filled up? Is he to ſit on the watch in his office, that this blank ſubſcription continues open to the 7th or 8th of July, then the blank is filled up and the receipt anti-dated to the 30th of June? Is not this conduct moſt exceptionable? Was not this done in his official capacity? If this is denied his correſpondence on this ſubject muſt be forgotten! (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read the letter, page 215-6; ditto page 217; ditto page 96-7; ditto page 97-8 of this work, commenting as he went along, to prove that the defendant acted in his official capacity when he certified the abſtracts <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine</hi> and <hi>aſſumable.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>It can therefore admit of no controverſy that the Comptroller-General acted in his official capacity, we have proved he violated the law, the excuſe muſt come from him, if no other excuſe comes from them, but an error of judgment, <hi>Humanum eſt errare,</hi> an error of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is certainly no ground for an impeachment; but if facts are ſtrong, and evidence concluſive, however painful it is to pronounce the ſentence, it is inevitable; he muſt be declared guilty. We conſider him as acting from improper motives, and it ſhould be remembered that when we probe the ſecret motives, and fathom the ſentiments of the heart, truth does not appear in matters of evidence which muſt neceſſarily end in probability only, with that reſiſtleſs conviction with which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the mathematical ſciences, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it ſhould operate with reſiſtleſs force.</p>
                     <p>But if after 1789 he ſtates nothing of the New-Loan certificates as being a <hi>State debt,</hi> which before the paſſing of the Act of 1789 he uniformly and repeatedly did; if to go farther, from motives of private intereſt he has endeavoured to defeat the operations of a law, has taken money out of the treaſury upon a pretended
<pb n="720" facs="unknown:027132_0728_0FD354674FE588C8"/>
conſideration, then no one can heſitate and his guilt cannot be denied.</p>
                     <p>Did not the Comptroller-General know, that the ſtock of the U. S. could not iſſue, unleſs the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental certificates the counterparts of the New-Loans or an equal value was previouſly ſurrendered to the United States; Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon,</hi> the Regiſter-General you find, thought ſo. In his letter to the Governor (page 220-1-2) he repeats the ſame idea. I have but little to ſay on this point; Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> firſt heard of this out of doors, and concurred in opinion with the defendant, he was never conſulted; he paſſed ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts after he knew them to contain New-Loans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed further, he acknowledged that he delivered one to Judge <hi>Addiſon</hi> in a miſtake; there is no law of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> authoriſing the ſurrender of the continental certificates, the whole amount would be loſt as the New-Loans could not be charged againſt the United States.</p>
                     <p>I aſk how will <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> get the ſtock back, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it will not be ſaid that the Comptroller will give it up. Suppoſe now an Act was to paſs this ſeſſion, it is too late. The accounts between the United States and the individual ſtates are now ſettled, they cannot be again opened; but it was hinted and but hinted by the Comptroller to the Regiſter that he had or would ſettle that buſineſs with the Secretary of the Treaſury of the United States. What! and no law on the ſubject! The ſubſcription was prevented by the interpoſition of the Governor. Had the ſubſcription of the New-Loan cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates been received, not only the difference between the ſtock and 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. in the pound would have been a gain to the Comptroller-General, but the whole ſum of 65,000 dollars ſubſcribed, would be a loſs to the commonwealth; and this was well known to the Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>But it is aſked, why not pay 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. in the pound? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for many reaſons—1. the New-Loans were not a ſtate debt. 2. It was a debt of Congreſs. 3. If Congreſs deviated from their contract, we ought not to ſuffer, nor
<pb n="721" facs="unknown:027132_0729_0FD3282CCB755D68"/>
ought their creditors to trouble us, when Congreſs was ready to pay them? there was a time when they might have had more than 20<g ref="char:shilling">ʃ</g>. in the pound from Congreſs. 4. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had ſaid ſhe would not pay them, and it is hard and humiliating that the Comptroller ſhould controul the Aſſembly. And 5. Becauſe Congreſs did not intend to aſſume any certificates but what had iſſued for ſervices or ſupplies towards the proſecution of the late war, and the defence of the United States; and the New-Loan certificates are not charged by the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller in the account.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, the Aſſembly is not to deal in ſtock— This is a miſtaken idea of the dignity of government; I conceive that even the difference between the value of ſtock is not unworthy of Legiſlative interpoſition; that Legiſlature which diſpoſes of a ſingle dollar but to what it thinks to the beſt advantage of the public weal, betrays the truſt of its conſtituents, whether it be ſtock or caſh, property of one ſpecies or another. We are now on ſure ground, our Treaſury is full and overflowing, but there are difficult times in view, and probably the time is not far diſtant when we may want every ſhilling, and all our reſources may be required to ſave the ſtate from further taxes.</p>
                     <p>I will take the liberty to draw the attention of the Senate to the ſtatement made by the defendant in 1788, this mentions the New-Loan debt. <hi>That</hi> being the year preceding the annihilating Act; but from the year 1789 the Legiſlature and Comptroller concur that the New-Loans were no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt; whereas they were a part of the ſtate debt the year before. Whatever may be ſaid of the views or the objects of the committee on ways and means, the duty of the Comptroller-General was as much to lay the ſame ſtatements before the Aſſembly after the Act of 1789 as it was before, except ſo far as the ſame was varied by the repeal. On the 4th of November 1788, in the Comptroller's ſtatement, page 7, we have the following entry:—</p>

                        <p>In his ſtatement, November 4, 1787, he mentions the New-Loan debt, but we find no charge of this debt in the ſtatement of the finances from this officer to the year 1790—Then the Governor in his ſpeech to the Legiſlature, page 43, December 28, gives a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is not confined to demands requiring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment, but for all the debts for which the ſtate ſtands pledged, and mentions <hi>"balance of intereſt on the New-Loan certificates."</hi> Here can be no pretence, the whole aggregate of the debts of the commonwealth and only the <hi>balance of intereſt on the New-Loan debt.</hi> Where is the defendant's letter to the Governor inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of his miſtake? This ſuppoſes his acquieſcence as he did not contradict it; but in a few days after the Comptroller made his report to the Aſſembly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Aſſembly under the conſtitution, he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated all the debts and gave a hiſtory of the finances; if the Governor had made a miſtake was it not the Comptroller-General's duty to rectify it? In page 389 of the minutes, the New-Loans are ſtated expreſsly as excluded from redemption, except for the purpoſe of being re-exchanged; the Comptroller does not think it of importance to ſtate what quantity had been re-exchanged, becauſe he did not conſider the ſtate as liable for them.</p>
                        <p>The Legiſlature could not ſuppoſe that the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller thought the law of 1789 to be void, or the law
<pb n="723" facs="unknown:027132_0731_0FD354CE80C7CC70"/>
of 1786 to be in force, except as to the funds, as he mentions all the items, funded, unfunded, &amp;c.—and yet with regard to the New-Loan certificates, he ſtates them as excluded from redemption, except the arrears of intereſt.</p>
                        <p>On the 8th of February 1791 the committee on ways and means reported a ſtatement of all the debts of the commonwealth, in which they mention all the <hi>claims</hi> and <hi>demands,</hi> an univerſal expreſſion embracing every ſpecies of debt; yet where that is expreſſed, neither the committee nor the Legiſlature conſider the New-Loans as included. The Comptroller-General muſt have been acquainted with the Governor's ſtatement in December 1790; and with the report abovementioned in February 1791; and if he differs in his ſtatement therefrom, it is a proof that we are right. On the 30th of November 1791 there was a joint report of Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Donnaldſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Febiger,</hi> upon a reference to which <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> proceeded when ſhe prepared the law of the 10th of April 1792. (See appendix to the minutes of that year, the laſt page but one.) Here all the claims againſt the commonwealth are enumerated, and only the balance of intereſt on the New-Loan debt. If we are not determined againſt conviction, we muſt believe this to be the true ſtate of the caſe.</p>
                        <p>I confeſs for my own part I am at a loſs to think how language could be leſs doubtful and more plain or explicit. A very long courſe of correſpondence was brought forward to ſhew, that whether ill or well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Comptroller thought them ſubſcribable in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1791; what circumſtances might have induced a change, I cannot tell, ſufficient it is that they were not mentioned the 30th November 1790. And on the 30th of December 1791, he ſhews the Legiſlature he was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I will diſmiſs this ſubject with a few remarks on the conference. Perhaps the attention of the Governor and fiſcal officers were never called to the point becauſe
<pb n="724" facs="unknown:027132_0732_0FD3282E34413E38"/>
no New-Loans were ſubſcribed under the firſt loan; under this Act then, the queſtion was not fairly litigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as none were ſubſcribed. True it is, that the Comptroller in ſome converſations ſpoke of them as being aſſumable, but it is ſufficient to obſerve that had he communicated the Act of 1789 to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his mind would have been clear, and all his doubts would be ſolved. He never ſuggeſted to any body, neither in writing nor converſation, that the New-Loans were redeemable under the Act of the 10th of April 1792.</p>
                        <p>He had ſome converſation with Mr. <hi>Evans,</hi> in which he ſtated that the ſtock was to be ſold; but never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him that the New-Loans were redeemable. Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> ſays he went no farther than to ſay the Act included unfunded depreciation, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they were ſubſcribed, he was ſurpriſed. This ſhews he deſigned to ſhelter himſelf under the letter of the law, contrary to what he knew to be the deſign of the Legiſlature.</p>
                        <p>Surprizing, that when he heſitated about the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaton certificates, he did not heſitate about the New-Loans! I will diſmiſs this point, and proceed to the charge which concerns—WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM THE TREASURY WITHOUT A PREVIOUS APPROPRIATION, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This is proved beyond all poſſibility of controverſy, the correſpondence between the Comptroller-General and the Governor reſpecting the debt to be redeemed, and the ſtock to be ſold prove this, for he furniſhes an eſtimate of the whole; here he prevaricates, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called upon in a general manner he anſwers in a reſtricted ſenſe, ſurely it was his duty to render a juſt ſtatement, but that rendered by him was covert and deceitful, the Governor's proclamation of the 16th of May 1792, which had been ſhewn to the Comptroller-General, founded on his eſtimate which enumerated the debts to be redeemed by the Act of 1792, and his not mentioning the error, is a proof that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſtatement to be right.</p>

By the Act of the 4th April 1792 the Comptroller is directed to certify to the Governor out of what fund the Money is to be drawn. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then turned to the Act page 219) when there are ſeveral funds in the ſame Act, it is neceſſary to ſpecify the fund, but when there is but one fund, the practice is only to certify payable under ſuch or ſuch an Act. When the Governor draws his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he purſues the words of the certificate, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by implication makes it payable accordingly, then what is the neceſſary reſult? Why! If the Comptroller and Regiſter have not drawn their eſtimate accurately, the warrants of the firſt magiſtrate muſt be diſhonoured, for juſt ſo much as 60,000 dollars take from that fund, juſt ſo much it falls ſhort; and how do they get over this? Why! Forſooth no other way than, by the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme</hi> and <hi>monſtrous,</hi> I would ſay, abſurdity, by taking the greater from the leſs, then apply this to the preſent caſe, it will be ſhewn that the Comptroller certified them to be payable out of the fund provided by the ſecond ſection of the Act of 10th April, 1792, and it was acknowledged on all hands that there was no fund appropriated under that Act; then the Governor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this as payable out of the fund provided by the ſecond ſection, if then the funds were not provided by the Act, the Governor's warrants muſt be diſhonoured. —The funds for claims and improvements which have been ſtated, only contained £.10,000 and £.5,000 of that were annually appropriated for roads, then as I ſaid before, the greater muſt be taken out of the leſs— Surely this is ſo big with inconſiſtencies, ſuch conduct cannot be reconciled with the duty of the Comptroller-General. (Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> then read paſſages from the
<pb n="726" facs="unknown:027132_0734_0FD354698A38BEB8"/>
law of the 26th March, 1789, which created the funds for claims and improvements, and obſerved that it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent an alteration by the ſubſequent Act of the 7th April 1791)—from this time to the preſent, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in every inſtance when they directed payment of any claim, always appropriated or created a fund for the purpoſe.

                        <p>(The articles laſt mentioned being read, Mr. <hi>Ingerſoll</hi> proceeded, ſaying.)—</p>
                        <p>Here, Sir, as in the conſideration of the article juſt paſt, are no circumſtances to raiſe a doubt, no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to unconſtitutionality under the maſk of patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Whatever arguments may be brought up to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the redeemability of the New-Loans, here is no pretence; the evidence is ſo clear that it has forced an acknowledgment. Whenever the holder was willing to ſurrender to the commonwealth, the Comptroller-General could not deem it improper. When he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the truſt he knew the terms of it; he was bound to do it under all the ties and ſolemnities of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. What are the facts? There are inſtances, <hi>Biddle's</hi> and <hi>Oldden's.</hi> No doubt can be entertained but his conduct here diſappointed the ſtate of the exchange, which ſhe intended and wiſhed to make.</p>
                        <p>Purchaſes in the market would in a degree interfere with the ultimate deſign of his agency. This perhaps would be carrying the rule too far. (Then Mr. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſoll</hi> went over the teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Oldden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> which ſee pages 243-4, and 230-40-41.)</p>

There is no ſtatute on the ſubject, but an indictment is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. The property was veſted in the ſtate on its delivery to the Comptroller-General; neither party could be off, the indents being tendered or not could make no odds, while the price was uncertain no perſon could tell what he had to tender, until the Continental were brought out and the intereſt calculated, when they were returned, they were to be cancelled. It was not neceſſary to pay the indents to complete the exchange and to veſt the property in the commonwealth. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the gentlemen preſent, and affirm, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of <hi>Oldden</hi> could not be recovered from the Comptroller-General by an action of trover, and if burnt or deſtroyed whilſt in his cuſtody, would they not be loſt as the property of the ſtate? The moment they were returned, the commonwealth became a truſtee for him, and Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> was the officer to carry the agreement into execution. (2 <hi>B. C.</hi> 447.)</p>
                        <p>I might enlarge on this argument by putting many caſes relative to the exchange of horſes, bonds, &amp;c. This I will decline, and muſt acknowledge that I am glad to find myſelf ſo near the end.</p>

                     <p>IT falls to my lot to add a few obſervations on the teſtimony adduced to prove the charges againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholſon;</hi> and I truſt that it will appear to every clear headed man, that theſe charges are amply ſupported, and that the exchange was negociated for <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> by his agent. It claims peculiar attention, as it confirms one of the moſt ſerious charges, in which the official delinquency is aggravated by the extreme confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence repoſed by the ſtate in the defendant.</p>
                     <p>I muſt recal the attention of the Senate to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the preliminary introduction of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the learned manager, in which it had been ſtated from the New-Loan book A, (page 129,) that three certificates, No. 4,151, for £. 11:16:0; No. 4,152, for £. 268:0:0; and No. 4,153, for £. 242:7:6, were iſſued by the Comptroller-General under the Act of March 1786, in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the book of Continental certificates received in exchange for New-Loans (page 230) it appears that ſundry Continental certificates were received in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for them, agreeing exactly with the total amount of the three former certificates.</p>
                     <p>It appears by the certificate of the Regiſter of the Treaſury of the United States, dated March 4, 1794, that the Comptroller-General ſubſcribed each of thoſe identical certificates and individual numbers for, and in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> It likewiſe appears from the large abſtract, No. 262, that theſe identical New-Loan certificates were ſubſcribed by Mr. <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> for his own uſe.</p>
                     <p>It therefore followed from the firſt impreſſion, that the property of the ſtate had been violated, that as ſhe muſt have a property either in the New-Loans emitted, or in the Continental certificates received, as it never could be in <hi>abeyance,</hi> but if it ceaſes in the one, it muſt at the ſame time commence in the other. Either her New-Loans or her Continental certificates had been converted to private purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="731" facs="unknown:027132_0739_0FD35470820E0FE0"/>Time has been applied for and granted, and I truſt the Senate will ſee, that the depoſition of <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> will be found to clear up the depoſition, and to prove not how far the defendant is innocent, but in what manner he is guilty. It will be proved beyond a controverſy, not that neither of them were the property of the commonwealth, but that the New-Loans were. That they were ſo rendered by an Act which he could only have performed by being Comptroller-General; it will be ſhewn, that preciſely in the terms of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth article of impeachment, her New-Loans have been fraudulently converted by the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to his own private uſe and emolument.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By depoſiting Continental certificates under the Act of March 1786, the ſtate acquired a qualified property in them—1. For ſafe-keeping. 2. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive indents, this property might become abſolute by the holders of New-Loans purchaſing lands.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, After the 27th of March 1789 the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of New-Loans had a right to, and acquired a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the identical Continental certificates depoſited by them. But this was not always practicable on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the practice of exchanging, conſolidating or cutting up certificates. To remedy, therefore, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, other certificates, as the ſtate had a large ſhare of her own, were allowed to be returned in ſuch caſes. This was implied by the Act of March 27, 1789. Like optional powers were given in the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Supreme Executive Council, (ſee page 267) and by an Act of the firſt of April 1790. But where the New-Loans originally iſſued, and continued the ſame, where the Continental certificates originally depoſited had not been delivered out to others, and where one remained to meet the other, the law and the inſtructions required the exchange to be ſpecific; and it will not be diſputed that where there exiſted no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of giving others, the Comptroller-General was to give the ſame, and no fair purpoſe could be anſwered by making it otherwiſe.</p>

                        <pb n="732" facs="unknown:027132_0740_0FD354D0993D9FC8"/>In the preſent inſtance they correſpond preciſely; the original certificates iſſued by the United States were depoſited by <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> He <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had received New-Loan certificates in lieu of them. I truſt then, there can be no doubt under this point of view, but the New-Loan certificates became the property of the commonwealth. (The anſwers to the 1ſt and 2d interrogatories were then read.) If a commutation had been meditated it could be done immediately; How then is this commutation effected? <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General takes the identical continental certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which were depoſited with the ſtate, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her coffers, and ſubſcribed them in the name of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> Then, Sir, this was an <hi>unlawful</hi> or a <hi>lawful</hi> act. If it was intended to be ſubſcribed for his own uſe, and not with a view to effectuate the re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, which <hi>Hamilton</hi> deſired, it was an unlawful and attrocious depredation of public property.</p>
                     <p>His counſel deny this.—</p>
                     <p>Then it was lawful; it was done as Comptroller-General, regularly, officially and conſiſtently with his duty, to effectuate the exchange, as the obliging friend of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> and the public ſervant of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania!</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This would have been the reſult if only the value or amount in other certificates had been ſubſcribed, but when the ſame continental certificates originally loaned are ſubſcribed, and that too, after the holders come down to exchange them, and when the Comptroller-General was in poſſeſſion of the New-Loans. (The anſwer to the 1ſt interrogatory then read.) This anſwer ſhews that tranſaction was ſo viewed by <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> himſelf, he viewed no private bargain to veſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his New-Loans in <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> and not in the commonwealth. He conſidered it as the effectuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="733" facs="unknown:027132_0741_0FD3547277424938"/>
the exchange, under the law of 1789, which he had not time to carry thro' himſelf, and little did he, or would any other plain and unſkilful man conceive the monſtrous idea that by delivering up the property of the ſtate, a property in the New-Loans could be acquired by the officer.</p>
                     <p>This appears not to have occured to the Comptroller-General until April 1792. If then the property depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> actually belongs to the ſtate, it cannot be the property of <hi>John Nicholſon</hi>—What! my ſervant to take my property for the purpoſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of my engagements, and then allege it belongs to him? Notwithſtanding all the technical difficulties of the ſtatute of frauds, if my money is employed to buy a houſe it belongs to me altho' the deed may be in my agent's name; then moſt aſſuredly the property in the certificates in queſtion is in the ſtate. As an agent he received them from <hi>Hans Hamilton;</hi> but as Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, as depoſitory of the commonwealth he ſubſcribed them; or if it is admitted that his ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Comptroller-General was illegal, he exchanged them as Comptroller-General, and ſubſcribed them as the friendly agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> We are not to be entangled by the acts of the Comptroller-General, he is not to be the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> whilſt he is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Comptroller-General of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> this double aſſumption of qualities is improper, but it was only as Comptroller-General he had acceſs to the certificates, and the Comptroller-General was very remiſs indeed, if he permitted the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> to put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into the public coffers of the ſtate; in relation to the New-Loans he ceaſed to be the private agent as ſoon as the continental certificates were ſubſcribed, for if <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had no more right, his agent had not, he had no other duties to perform in regard to them than as Comptroller-General.</p>
                     <p>What are his duties and powers? They are defined in the Act of the 1ſt April 1790. It was his duty to deliver them over to the Treaſurer to be cancelled; as
<pb n="734" facs="unknown:027132_0742_0FD354D1D23C3A68"/>
Comptroller-General, he had no power but to deliver them over for the above purpoſe; what has he done? They remain with him till, April 1792, when <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> came to town and applied to his agent for the funded debt. (The defendant's 3d interrogatory and anſwer then read) I will not aſk, Sir, why during this interval, the New-Loans were depoſited with the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller-General, after the continental certificates had been funded and were not delivered to be cancelled, why the indents were not adjuſted, nor in ſhort, why he did not perform his official duty in reſpect to them. The New-Loans, as well as the funded ſtock remained in his hands during this period; he confirms the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by receiving the intereſt; the continental certificates had been taken out of the trunk of the Comptroller-General—two things were then done.—1. <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> loſt his right to the New-Loans.—2. <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> loſt her continental certificates.—What did <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> receive? Funded ſtock. What did the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth receive? A blank.</p>
                     <p>(Seventh article then read.) I ſay, this teſtimony is fuller than that of Mr. <hi>M'Clenachan. Hans Hamilton</hi> is an honeſt man; but we find the depoſition turns out different from what they expected. I do not find that they prevailed in obtaining an expoſition to their mind. Anſwers come out which the defendant did not expect. In all his interrogatories to the deponent, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing of <hi>an agent</hi>—he mentioned an <hi>obligation</hi>— and what became of it? Yet we find that <hi>Hamilton</hi> calls it an agency. <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> had anſwered honeſtly. The <hi>exparte</hi> depoſition did not corrupt him. All his anſwers fully confirm the charge, and come literally within the ſeventh article. I will add no more; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doubts may be entertained elſewhere, here are no judicial ſpeculations;—Acts of Aſſembly have been violated—the law is clear—and the facts are well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tilghman</hi> roſe in reply, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>I AM glad the counſel who ſpoke laſt hath not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed
<pb n="735" facs="unknown:027132_0743_0FD354ECC2F0A7B0"/>
the queſtion to bring us to anſwer a charge brought againſt us by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. There is a way of attempting a thing, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it in a gentle manner, when a man is willing to ſtrike. I will leave it to the Senate whether the hint that is intended for the defendant, is worthy of thoſe who brought it forward. Mr. <hi>Nicholſon's</hi> conduct has ever been open and manly, and he muſt be acquitted of any deſign derogatory of that character.</p>
                     <p>Then I take the queſtion ſolemnly to be, whether Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> acted in the line of his official duty, and whether he received thoſe certificates from <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> for the purpoſe of being exchanged? I take this to be a naked queſtion of fact. I agree that a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may act in two capacities. It hath been ſaid that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> acted in two capacities. Was he leſs ſedulous for acting in the two-fold capacity of <hi>John Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon,</hi> and Comptroller-General? That he acted for <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> as <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> and not as Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-General, and his doing or acting as agent for <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> could not become a crime as <hi>Comptroller-General;</hi> no man could be prevented from acting as an agent for another unleſs reſtrained by poſitive laws. While he acted as Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> he is not liable to impeachment, I call upon the gentlemen to ſtate where he acted as Comptroller-General in this affair? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it was lawful for him to act as a private citizen, without being impeachable before this honorable tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. I will not take the time to run over the anſwers of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> he did not act in his official capacity, but he had been friendly, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſaid, "all I want is ſtock of the United States, I leave theſe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates with you for that purpoſe," while he acted as Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> he is not liable to impeachment, I will take it for granted that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> was the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> even, I will take it for granted, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> was miſtaken—ſo far I take it for granted, that he has paid <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> what <hi>Hamilton</hi> wiſhed to have; by lodging thoſe very certificates with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                        <pb n="736" facs="unknown:027132_0744_0FD354EEE8489770"/>
the continental Loan-officer, which <hi>Hamilton</hi> afterwards received. Here then is the candor of the defendant. Nay more, he received double the amount; and, here is venality charged againſt him in profuſion! This does not favour their arguments, that he uſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental certificates improperly, but it is what the logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians call a <hi>non ſequitur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He applied to Mr. Nicholſon as a friend not as an officer; does he come to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> and ſay, I wiſh to unite the characters of Agent and Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral? No, Sir, he negatives all official communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—But again the gentlemen ſay, how could the Comptroller be in poſſeſſion?</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen themſelves have ſtated, that it was not eſſential to have the very identical ones, and the laws and inſtructions point out that their co-relatives could not always be at hand, that the practice was otherwiſe, at which many were much agitated, nay, offended, becauſe they could not have their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to them.</p>
                     <p>I muſt beg the indulgence of the Senate, whilſt I'll obſerve, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> was a holder of New-Loans to a conſiderable amount, why then as it is agreed that it is a ſpecies of criminality, if a doubt remains reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting theſe certificates, Why does not the doubt operate in favour of the defendant? Why not preſume him innocent in ſome of theſe inſtances? Why not preſume, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> obtained them ſome other way, by ſome exchange, or purchaſe of ſome other perſon? In either caſe Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is far from guilt. Does <hi>Hans Hamilton</hi> ſay his continental certificates were returned? No.</p>
                     <p>The gentlemen have aſſumed the baſis and reaſoned ingenuouſly and ſubtilly that theſe continental certificates were in the coffers of the ſtate, they have not trod ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly on the Act of 1786; but let them not collect cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality from ſurmiſes, let them prove it, if the fact is capable of proof; that it was the property of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> at that time, then one of two things muſt be the
<pb n="737" facs="unknown:027132_0745_0FD328300EF49530"/>
conſequence, either it follows that the Comptroller-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was exceſſively blameable by affecting to act as Comptroller-General; but in the mean time made uſe of his official advantages, and acted ſo as to be highly criminal.—Or that diſrobing himſelf of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, intruded his raſh and ſacrilegious hands into the coffers of the ſtate! One or the other of theſe muſt be the caſe!</p>
                     <p>Has the proſecution altogether reſted with the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller-General? Have they a right to impeach the Comptroller and not to arraign <hi>Hans Hamilton?</hi> Do they not conſider him charged? The evidence being that the tranſaction was of a private nature, and that he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the agent of <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> Where the Senate can make a favourable conſtruction it is their duty nay it is not only their duty, but it is agreeable to their ſenſations. But when it appears from <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> depoſitions, that no continental certificates were ever delivered to him, how is the inference to be drawn without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſupport it? But the caſe ſtands ſimply thus, We are charged with taking the New-Loan certificates of the ſtate which had been exchanged by the ſtate and applying them to our uſe.</p>
                     <p>What is the proof? Is there a particle of evidence in <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> depoſition to ſhew that theſe were ever exchanged? <hi>No.</hi> Is there even a ſhadow of proof to ſhew that they had ever been preſented for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to the ſtate? <hi>No. Hans Hamilton</hi> did not do it as he tells you upon oath, nor did he direct it to be done, and <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> teſtimony is full and clear in our favour: Here we might reſt the cauſe without replying to any charges not in the impeachment.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, if this was not done, we muſt have taken the continental certificates, for which theſe had originally been loaned, for that, on turning to the book of continental certificates loaned which we have kept, and the abſtract of continental certificates in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury office of the United States and comparing the one with the other, they agree in dates and ſums, altho'
<pb n="738" facs="unknown:027132_0746_0FD354F1D49D11B0"/>
we are not bound to reply to this aſperſion until we are charged by the Houſe of Repreſentatives with <hi>ſequeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring continental certificates the property of the ſtate,</hi> yet I will obſerve, 1. That to this compariſon of dates and ſums ſhould be added another book, that of their re-exchange, whereby the ſtate became diveſted of theſe continental certificates; here, you will find exchanges entered which were made for Mr. <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding in dates and intereſt as ſufficient to identify the re-exchange, as the former doth the exchange; for the dates of intereſt, their amounts, and numbers are all that were recorded in either caſe, in theſe books which were directed in their form, by, and occaſionally ſubmitted to the Supreme Executive Council. Nor is this all, there are other exchanges the ſums and dates of intereſt of which would apply to theſe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> might have bought them of others, who had previouſly exchanged them, but it is difficult to account for any tranſaction without a motive, and here there was no motive of intereſt to urge the Comptroller to lay his hands on theſe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates, the property of the ſtate, they were no better than a like amount of any other ſuch continental cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, and yet he was obliged to account for every dollar of theſe certificates in his hands, and pay over to the State-Treaſurer ſuch amounts as were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, ſo that, as the ſtate could not loſe on the one hand he being reſponſible, ſo neither could he have gained on the other.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly. If it ſhould be imputed to us that we have dealt unfairly by <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> for our conduct will bear the teſt in every view, either as an officer, or as an individual, we ſhew clearly from his teſtimony, that he was fully ſatisfied and hath got what he aſked for, the certificates he thus wanted and received from Mr. <hi>Nichol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> were not granted by the Comptroller-General, but by the United States. In this tranſaction therefore, we not only did not act officially, but the buſineſs was not
<pb n="739" facs="unknown:027132_0747_0FD3549A383A5920"/>
to be tranſacted at all in the office where the mal-practice is charged.</p>
                     <p>In concluſion I beſeech the Senate to conſider, that miſerable and wretched indeed muſt be the condition of officers it impeachments can be found where there is no offence againſt the law. A book of high eſtimation ſays, NO LAW, NO TRANSGRESSION.</p>
                     <p>Permit me to read the following paſſages from one of the moſt excellent of all books on prophane hiſtory, where he treats of the doctrine of conſtructive treaſon. <hi>Hume's</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> vol. 6, page 340.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> roſe, and replied—</p>
                     <p>I DO not wonder that the Comptroller-General ſhould be defended with ſo much ingenuity, and I am willing to juſtify his counſel for combining every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification and in ſelecting all the pathetic paſſages; and am alſo willing to do juſtice to my own feelings at the expence of my judgment; for I think we have nothing to do with the laſt, but I will leave him to that ſingle plank oh which he is to be ſaved from total ruin. There is but one main argument, and that is, Who is impeached? and whether the Compt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roller is of a moral or a civil ſpecies of exiſtence? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpecies of offence is committed by the man; yes, by the man who holds the office. How then is a line to be drawn, between the man and the officer? The man has offended, and the officer is innocent! One of thoſe offences come in virtue of his holding the office, therefore it did not become him to purchaſe. If he had been a private individual, another tribunal would be the proper one, and as ſuch he could not be entitled to ſuch a ſolemn trial as the preſent. (Mr. <hi>Rawle</hi> then
<pb n="742" facs="unknown:027132_0750_0FD3282CC7371B60"/>
read ſome paſſages from 2 <hi>Woodiſon,</hi> page 602.) Here the Lord-Chancellor of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> was found guilty of bribery, one of the moſt exalted judges; agreeably to the arguments of the learned counſel for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, he ſhould not be impeached as Lord-Chancellor, but as a man. If Judges, if Privy-Counſellors and a Lord-Chancellor—and he too, a confidential adviſer of his ſovereign, is impeached, and theſe circumſtances are not unlike the preſent, how much more proper it muſt be here, where trials by impeachment are embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died into our Conſtitution. When Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> was applied to officially, he anſwered, that he applied pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to be his agent. Had he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> to make the exchange, he would no doubt have done it; there is no law on this ſubject, it would be a wholeſome thing to make a law for ſuch a purpoſe. It would eaſe a great deal of this embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment.</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid that as a private man, Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> is not liable to impeachment. That remains unproved. It is not to be preſumed that he acquired a right by any ſubſequent tranſaction;—we have no light to guide us in theſe particulars, but <hi>Hamilton</hi> employed <hi>Nicholſon</hi> his agent—it was for his uſe and for his benefit;—Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> made uſe of his naked authority as an agent. Hence the offence of acting as Comptroller-General for the commonwealth, and acting as agent for <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> is inferred.</p>
                     <p>Let us now put this in the moſt favorable point of view, and admit, that Mr. <hi>Nicholſon</hi> owned theſe New-Loan certificates, or that he purchaſed them before they had been owned by <hi>Hans Hamilton.</hi> If he tranſacted the buſineſs which he afterwards did, laying <hi>Hans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> entirely out of the queſtion, ſtill the heavy char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges remain. Let us then hear no more of <hi>Hans Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> let us infer from no preſumption; we will take <hi>Hans Hamilton's</hi> teſtimony and the official tranſaction. The gentleman hath ſuggeſted nothing to prove that
<pb n="743" facs="unknown:027132_0751_0FD354F80605AFE0"/>
the Continental certificates were out and ceaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the property of the ſtate in September 1791.</p>
                     <p>A ſingular and romantic co-incidence of ſums and dates, that it ſhould again have come round, the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Continental certificates were the property of the commonwealth in 1786, and of <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> in 1791. We have proved that they were depoſited in 1786; then if once in the cuſtody of the ſtate, on whom is it incumbent to ſhew, that they did not remain ſo? From whom is the information to come? From none, but from himſelf!</p>
                     <p>Are we then under all theſe circumſtances to prove that they remained in the cuſtody of the ſtate? It is not by the aid of preſumption, not by getting a ſtride of probability and galloping off, that we prove this. But we are told by <hi>Hans Hamilton,</hi> that they were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed. But it is ſaid, that exchange may inadvertently be taken for commutation, that in any dictionary you would find them convertible terms, and that their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is the ſame. Take it either way it is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the ſame: By that exchange it was to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Comptroller-General into debt of the United States. Let us ſuppoſe it either way, let us ſuppoſe it to be converted to ſtock of the United States pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly ſubſcribed.

                     <p>One more word about preſumption, and that is, in favour of innocence. They ſay, <hi>"Why do you not prove him criminal?"</hi> We deem it fully ſo. Here is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

certificates with which he is charged were more or leſs than thoſe brought to him for the purpoſe of being exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is ſufficient for us that he is charged with thoſe, the tranſactions are traced and the accuſation is proved, theſe bloody and myſterious volumes of arbitrary and let our proof be oppoſed to his matter of defence. It is not to be conſidered that he did ſo with all others.</p>
                     <p>I will detain the Senate no longer, I have concluded my arguments—the gentleman has advanced the caſe of lord <hi>Strafford</hi>—How is that like the preſent caſe? What analogy? He was one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed and amiable of men without an imputation of vice; Is it upon conſtruction of municipal laws which are not generally known that the preſent impeachment is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is this a law concealed, is it a law unknown, as <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> treaſons? No, we have this law in our nature, it is a monitor, which no man can eſcape, as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it, <hi>Lex.non ſcripta, ſed nata, quam non didicimus, ſed accepimus</hi>—not received at ſchool, but grew with life, againſt that law there is no ſtatute. It is in poſitive teſtimony that the Comptroller-General had offended, and I appeal to this honorable court, that were there no other charge againſt him, and all other accuſations for the injured intereſt of the commonwealth done away, he ought to be held up as a public example, that no ſtation in life ſhall deter the hands of juſtice, nor no labours will be ſpared, that others may be deterred from violating her truſts in ſimilar ſtations, and that the virtue and integrity of this republic will not bear official treachery.</p>

                     <p>"AT the time of the ſaid reſolution being agreed to, the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> ſtood impeached by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, <hi>in their name, and in that of all the People of Pennſylvania,</hi> of certain high crimes and miſdemeanors in the diſcharge of his official duties; and as no judgment had been rendered, the ſaid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment was ſtill depending, and within the power of the Senate: We therefore conſider the adoption of the reſolution at that time as an infraction of the law, no leſs oppreſſive to the defendant than dangerous to the ſecurity of individuals; as derogatory to the juſtice and dignity of this Houſe, and as highly diſreſpectful to the Senate and Governor of the Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"As an infraction of the law, no leſs oppreſſive to the defendant than dangerous to the ſecurity of individuals,</hi> becauſe their ſafety and ſecurity depend on the pure and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice; and every thing which has a tendency to prejudice the public mind or to bias the Judges while a cauſe is depending, poiſons the ſprings of juſtice, warps their ſteady and even courſe, and undermines the moſt valuable bulwark of ſecurity, which innocence can have. Hence it is that all publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, touching a cauſe depending, which are calculated to give a bias either way, are highly criminal.</p>
                     <p>"If anonymous publications are conſidered as of this dangerous tendency, we conceive that a ſolemn vote by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, <hi>"in their name, and in that of all the people of Pennſyvania,"</hi> muſt be of a tendency equally dangerous. It is true, it may not have all the intended effect, yet ſince that is owing to the virtue and firmneſs of others, it affords no apology for the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch a meaſure. Whatever might be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, its tendency certainly was to prejudice the public mind while a proſecution was depending, and to bear down and oppreſs the accuſed, by aſſailing the minds of his judges with all the weight and influence of the moſt numerous branch of the Legiſlature; and, as if this was really intended, care was taken to introduce
<pb n="767" facs="unknown:027132_0775_0FD354B1D029A260"/>
the reſolution, with a declaration that <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> had, by conduct unworthy of his truſt, forfeited and loſt the confidence of the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> thereby rendering it highly improper that he ſhould any longer continue to enjoy any office of truſt or profit in this commonwealth. As publications of this nature by an individual, while a proſecution was depending, would be highly criminal; and as the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives had fulfilled their conſtitutional duty by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching and proſecuting the Comptroller; and as it remained for the ſenate to diſcharge their conſtitutional duty by determining on that impeachment, and for the Governor to diſcharge his conſtitutional duty by diſplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Comptroller, or continuing him in office, at leaſt till judgment ſhould be given by the Senate, we can conceive no apology for paſſing the reſolution at that time. For theſe reaſons we cannot but conſider the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as an infraction of the law, no leſs oppreſſive to the accuſed than danegerous to the ſecurity of others.</p>
                     <p>"We alſo conſider it as derogatory to the juſtice and dignity of this Houſe. Derogatory to its juſtice for the reaſons already mentioned; and to its dignity, from the ardor and precipitancy with which it was hurried through the Houſe. We ſay ardor and precepitancy, becauſe, during the debate, a communication was received by the Speaker, from the Clerk of the Senate, that on the next day judgment on the impeachment would be pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet without waiting even till the meſſage was read, or announced from the chair, the reſolution was by ſpecial order taken up, read a ſecond time, and paſſed in oppoſition to all endeavours for a ſhort delay. This we believe to be unexampled in Legiſlative bodies; and it appears to us to be the more exceptional, ſince a decent regard for the opinions of men ſeemed to require that the Houſe of Repreſentatives, being the accuſers and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Comptroller, ſhould have manifeſted their moderation and impartiality, by declining to uſurp the province of judging on their own charges, at leaſt until conſtitutional judges had determined on them. On the
<pb n="768" facs="unknown:027132_0776_0FD3547DAE41FAE0"/>
contrary, as no time for conſideration or enquiry was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, there is too much reaſon to believe that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding will be viewed by impartial men, as partaking more of ſudden or diſappointed reſentment, than of that juſt and dignified diſpleaſure which becomes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of a great Republic.</p>
                     <p>"We have ſaid of judging on their own charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe the anſwer, conveyed by the reſolution, is founded on the matters charged in the articles of impeachment. It is true it is expreſſed in ſuch general and indefinite terms, as to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſay whether it is grounded on them or indeed on any thing elſe, ſince it contains no ſpecification of facts, nor the leaſt hint of any particular matter to which it relates; but as the Comptroller has not been called upon to anſwer any other charges than thoſe which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the articles of impeachment, nor had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being heard in his defence, we are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuppoſe any member of this Houſe capable of condemning him without a charge, and unheard on any other grounds.</p>
                     <p>"We have ſaid that we conſider the adoption of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution at that time as highly diſreſpectful to the Senate and to the Governor. As highly diſreſpectful to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, inaſmuch as it relates to a proſecution depending before them, and is expreſſed in terms calculated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence their deciſion. <hi>The time, the manner and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hurry with which it was haſtened forward,</hi> muſt carry to the minds of the Senate too ſtrong evidence of a ſuppoſition prevailing in this Houſe, that the Senate or ſome of its members, were not to be truſted with a deciſion, until they were influenced by a ſolemn reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>"John Nicholſon</hi> had, by conduct unworthy of his truſt, forfeited and loſt the confidence of the citizens of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> thereby rendering it highly improper that he ſhould any longer continue to enjoy any office of truſt or profit in this commonwealth."</p>
                     <p>"And when we take into conſideration the time of paſſing the reſolution, we cannot but conſider it as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="769" facs="unknown:027132_0777_0FD354BE8962E888"/>
diſreſpectful to the Governor, ſince it ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies either that he had neglected his duty by not having already diſplaced the Comptroller, or that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended he would neglect it in future by continuing him in office. While we admit the rights of the Houſe to addreſs the Governor, to remove an unworthy officer, we are far from agreeing that the Governor was to blame in not removing the Comptroller after the charges were brought againſt him, and while they were depending; ſince this would have amounted to a declaration on his put, that the Comptroller was unworthy of truſt and confidence, before either his innocence or guilt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on a fair trial. If after a deciſion by the Senate the Governor had continued the Comptroller in office, this I looſe had thought him unworthy of it, there might have been a propriety in addreſſing for his removal; but to do this at a time when the Governor could not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety diſplace him, when it was known that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would on the next day be removed, appears too much like converting the right of addreſſing into a vehicle of general and unqualified cenſure, both upon the officer who may have incurred the diſpleaſure of the Houſe, and upon the Governor for not adding his weight to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure or cenſure, by diſplacing the accuſed before his modern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Under this view of the matter, we cannot but conſider the proceedings againſt which we proteſt, as an uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inconſtitutional and arbitrary power, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſfranchiſe a citizen, by voting him <hi>unworthy of any office of truſt or profit.</hi>

                     <p>"Mr. <hi>Benjamin Morgan,</hi> in behalf of himſelf and others, aſked and obtained leave to enter their Reply to the Proteſt of the minority of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt taking up by ſpecial order for a ſecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reſolution for the appointment of a committee to draft an Addreſs to the Governor for the removal of <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth, on the Journal of the Houſe; and preſented the ſame to the chair, which is follows, viz.</p>
                     <p>"Reply to the Proteſt of the minority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives againſt taking up, by ſpecial order, for a ſecond reading, a Reſolution for the appointment of a committee to draught an addreſs to the Governor for the removal of <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>"THAT at the time of paſſing the ſaid reſolution, the Senate had decided on the Articles of Impeachment againſt the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> Comptroller-General of this common wealth; and although they had neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced judgment nor convicted the ſaid <hi>John Nicholſon</hi> on any of the articles exhibited againſt him, yet ſo large a proportion as ten out of ſeventeen, (the whole number of Senators preſent) having declared him guilty on two of the moſt ſerious of the ſaid articles, it would have been highly improper in the Legiſlature not to have made uſe of every lawful means, to prevent him from continuing a moment longer in office. Had they acted otherwiſe, it would in their apprehenſion have been an unpardonable breach of the confidence repoſed in them by their conſtituents; nor could they have expected their vote on the ſaid reſolution would have any ſuch influence on the deciſion of the Senate, as is ſuggeſted in the ſaid proteſt; the ſaid deciſion having previouſly taken place; and though not directly communicated to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, muſt have been as well known to the minority as it was to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Houſe. On this ground alone, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="771" facs="unknown:027132_0779_0FD354B301263080"/>
the ſaid vote and reſolution not only juſtifiable but neceſſary, even had there been no other cauſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval than thoſe contained in the Articles of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>"Independently however of any thing contained in the ſaid articles, we conſider the Comptroller's refuſal to produce to the committee of inveſtigation, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laſt Houſe of Repreſentatives, any of the books, vouchers or papers relative to the certificates iſſued to the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> line for the arrears of their pay, a ſufficient cauſe of removal; and were any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aggravate his conduct in this inſtance, it was ſufficiently ſupplied by his ſubſequent refuſal to comply with the peremptory orders of the Governor on the ſame ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"There is ſome difficulty in reconciling the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent objections offered by the proteſting minority; the principal part of which reſt on the ſuppoſed influence the reſolution would produce in the deciſion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, when that minority ſtate in their proteſt itſelf, that before any vote had been taken on the ſaid reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, an official communication was received from the Senate, informing the Houſe of Repreſentatives that on the next day judgment would be pronounced on the impeachment, which could only be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a deciſion having previouſly taken place.</p>
