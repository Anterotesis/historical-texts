            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Fourth DIALOGUE Between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER.</head>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pariſhioner.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, three times I have been with you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, to get my child baptized; and I am now come to make you a fourth viſit, with the <hi>letter,</hi> lately printed at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> in my hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miniſter.</speaker>
               <p>I am willing, Sir, and ever have been, to oblige you in all things wherein I lawfully may. And particularly, I am willing to baptize your child, if you, really underſtanding the true import of the action, are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to offer your child in baptiſm; even, to <hi>dedicate it to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> in whoſe name it is to be baptized. But, if you do indeed love God ſo well, as that you are willing to give him your child, to be his for ever; why are you not as willing, to give him your ſelf? And why ſhould you not, firſt of all, give your ſelf up to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt; and then, after that, give your child to him? In this way God will become your covenant God and Father in this world, and your eternal portion in the next. This is all I wait for. And this is what I have, from the beginning, been urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon you, as your immediate, indiſpenſible duty. You remember what I ſaid to you in your firſt viſit,
<q>if you love God ſo, as to be willing to have him for your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if you love Chriſt ſo, as to be willing to deny your ſelf, take up your croſs and follow him; you may have your choice: you may do as you like: <hi>Come, for all things are now ready.</hi> And if you would now in fact make this choice, it would put an end to your preſent
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011566_0003_0F87261809B01270"/>
difficulties about your child. Nothing, therefore, can hinder the baptiſm of your child, but your continuing to reject God and the Redeemer, by which you practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally renounce your own baptiſm, and forfeit all the bleſſings of the covenant.</q>— And you remember my parting words in your laſt viſit,
<q>every circumſtance of your own ſoul, and every circumſtance of your dear offspring, calls upon you, without delay, to awake, and to turn to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, in ſincerity and truth.—O, what joy would it give me, e're long, to admit you into full communion with the church, on a profeſſion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in which you ſhould appear to act underſtandingly and honeſtly!</q>—And you are my witneſs, that, at all times, I am ready to inſtruct you, to pray for you, and, if need be, to rebuke you, with all tenderneſs and kindneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Inſpired by the ſpirit, which runs thro' the <hi>New-Haven letter,</hi> I muſt ſay, that I diſpiſe your rebukes, p. 4. and do not deſire your prayers, p. 18. "Could I ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſſemble, I ſhould <hi>give you joy,</hi> and gain a ſpeedy, eaſy admittance into your church." p. 10.—But, for my part, I look upon you, as little or nothing better than the very worſt of hereticks. For <q>your principles, Sir, are too near of kin to thoſe moſt ſhocking principles, lately broach'd in the land, by ſeveral who have a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for being authors; particularly, by Mr. Sandeman and Mr. Hopkins. Mr. Sandeman ſays, that <hi>faith is obtained, as the moſt remarkable diſcoveries have been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the uſe of the magnet, Jeſuit's-bark, and many chimical diſcoveries, i. e. not when theſe things, but ſome thing elſe was looked for.</hi>—Mr. Hopkins ſays, <hi>it is indeed, as great an abſurdity as can be thought of, to ſuppoſe that the corrupt, vicious heart does any thing towards becoming holy.</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>for all the exerciſes and volitions of the corrupt unregenerate heart are certainly the exerciſes of ſin.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Theſe principles, Sir, I look upon of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, of any that were ever broach'd in the chriſtian world, deiſm itſelf not excepted.</q> p 20.</p>
            </sp>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011566_0003_0F87261809B01270"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>My dear Sir, be cool, and think a minute or two, who you are, and what you ſay, and what you have been doing. You are my pariſhioner. In this character you have made me three viſits before this. In this character you are now talking with me. You knew my principles before you ever deſired me to baptize your child. And you knew that the church under my care profeſs to be in the ſame ſcheme of religion with me. And would you deſire, that your child ſhould be baptized by the worſt of hereticks! Or would you deſire to join with ſuch a church! Where is the honeſty or conſiſtence of your conduct! You are inſpired with a <hi>ſpirit</hi> indeed; but I fear, you <hi>know not what ſpirit you are of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to our ſentiments touching <hi>total depravity, works done by unregenerate men,</hi> and the <hi>ſovereignty of divine grace in the converſion of ſinners,</hi> we profeſs to agree with the <hi>aſſembly of divines at Weſtminiſter.</hi> And you know, that their <hi>confeſſion of faith,</hi> and <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>ſhorter catechiſms</hi> are adopted by the church of Scotland, as their teſt of orthodoxy; and are much the ſame with the <hi>Savoy confeſſien of faith,</hi> which is adopted, in general, by the churches in the Maſſachuſetts and in Connecticut.—But,</p>
               <p>Theſe public formulas declare, as to <hi>total depravety,</hi> that "we are utterly indiſpoſed, diſabled and oppoſite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil."—And as to <hi>works done by unregenerate men,</hi> that
<q>altho' for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good uſe to themſelves and others; yet, becauſe they proceed not from a heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word; nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore ſinful and cannot pleaſe God, or make a man meet to receive grace from God. And yet their neglect of them is more ſinful and diſpleaſing to God.</q>— And as to the <hi>divine ſovereignty in the converſion of ſinners,</hi> they ſay, that
<q>all thoſe whom God hath predeſtinated unto life, and thoſe only, he is pleaſed in his appointed and accepted time effectually to call,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011566_0004_0F8726181341CB58"/>
&amp;c.—This effectual call is of God's free and ſpecial grace alone, not from any thing at all foreſeen in man, who is altogether paſſive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to anſwer this call,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the famous Mr. Stoddard, in his <hi>treatiſe concerning the nature of converſion,</hi> ſays, p. 7. <q>If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do: they don't attend the will of God." And p. 9. "There is an oppoſition between ſaving grace and common grace—common graces are luſts and do oppoſe ſaving grace. Making his own ſalvation his end, is contrary to making the glory of God his laſt end: hating ſin, not becauſe it wrongs God, but becauſe it expoſes him, is reſiſting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: bringing every thing into ſubſerviency to his own ends, is oppoſite to the bringing every thing into a ſubſerviency to God's glory: The man that hath but common grace goeth quite in another path than that which God directs unto: When he goeth about to eſtabliſh his own righteouſneſs, he ſets himſelf againſt that way of ſalvation which God preſcribes. Rom. 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of ſuch men as have but common grace, to the ways that godly men take.</q> Thus Mr. Stoddard.</p>
               <p>And now, my pariſhioner, I appeal to you, to judge, whether theſe quotations, out of the confeſſion of faith and Mr. Stoddard,—<q>are not as near of kin to thoſe ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principles, which you look upon of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tendency, of any that were ever broach'd in the chriſtian world, deiſm itſelf not excepted,</q> as any thing I ever advanced from the pulpit or the preſs.</p>
               <p>And if ſome of the important doctrines of chriſtianity are more obnoxious to you than deiſm itſelf; that is, if you are nearer a deiſt than you are a chriſtian; certainly you are not fit to be a church member, or to offer your
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011566_0004_0F8726181341CB58"/>
child in baptiſm, or to partake of the Lord's-ſupper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own principles: For, you ſay, that men muſt be orthodox. And you cannot deny, that the church of Scotland, and the churches in New-England have as good a right to judge for themſelves, what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are agreeable to the word of God, and of importance to be profeſſed, as you have to judge for your ſelf. We are willing, that thoſe who look upon the doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our public formulas, as being worſe than deiſm, ſhould hold communion among themſelves, but we think it an inconſiſtence in them to deſire to be members of our churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <q>Unholy obedience is a contradiction in terms, for holineſs and obedience are the ſame thing.</q> p. 8.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>In ſaying this, you condemn Mr. Mather's ſcheme of an external graceleſs covenant, by wholeſale.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſtrictly ſpeaking, what you ſay, is true. And in this view Mr. Stoddard's words are exactly right, (ſpeaking of the unregenerate) 'There is no obedience to God in what they do.' And thus it is ſaid by the church of England in her 39 articles. <q>Works done before the grace of Chriſt, and the inſpiration of his ſpirit, are not pleaſant to God.—Yea, rather, for that they are not done as God hath commanded and willed them to be done, we doubt not but that they have the nature of ſin.</q> See article 13.—Do you, Sir, believe this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>No. Far from it. Rather I believe, that <q>all the obedience of an unconverted man is holy obedience.</q> Yea, I believe, that <q>the obedience of an unrenewed man, ſo far forth as it is obedience, is as holy as any, that a gracious man can yield.

               <p>If I underſtand you right, and you are in earneſt in this declaration, then you believe that the unconverted are, in a meaſure, really holy. And, therefore, are not totally depraved, as is aſſerted in the confeſſion of faith adopted by our churches. And if this be ſo, then you are not ſound in the faith. And thoſe who are not found in the faith have no right to church privileges, according to your own principles. You, therefore, cannot conſiſtently claim church privileges of any of our churches. — Indeed, you may think our confeſſion of faith not agreeable to the word of God, and you may think the ſame of the articles of the church of England: If, therefore, you would act a conſiſtent part, you ſhould join, neither with us, nor them; but, rather form a new church, on a new plan, with thoſe who think as you do. For, it is abſurd for thoſe, who differ in eſſentials, to walk together, as brethren. And to profeſs our belief of articles of religion, which we do not believe, for the ſake of church privileges, is as groſs diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in the laity among us, as it is in the clergy in England, who ſubſcribe the 39 articles of that church, in order to enjoy a benefice, when they do not believe them, as in the caſe with the Arians, Socinians and Arminians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.—In a word, if you really diſbelieve the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>total depravity</hi> and of <hi>divine ſovereignty,</hi> you can by no means conſiſtently join with us.</p>

               <p>So ſays Dr. Taylor, ſo ſays Dr. Whitby, ſo ſays Dr. Stebbins, and all other Pelegian and Arminian writers I ever read. They all agree, that the doctrines of <hi>total depravity,</hi> and of <hi>divine ſovereignty,</hi> as held by the Calviniſts, are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconſiſtent with moral agency. They have ſaid it a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011566_0005_0F872618CD317100"/>
thouſand times, and they have been anſwered as often.— Thus ſtands the controverſy.—"Becauſe I have no heart to love GOD, therefore I cannot be bound in duty to love him."—"Becauſe I am <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> and oppoſite to all good;" therefore that law which ſays, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> cannot juſtly reach me."— "Becauſe we all, with one conſent, excuſe ourſelves from coming to the goſpel feaſt; therefore we are not in a ſtate of probation."—"Becauſe GOD ſays, <hi>may I not do what I will with my own?</hi> Therefore, we may ſay, we are not in duty bound, to regard his law, or hearken to his goſpel."— Reaſoning, which, if it has weight in it, proves the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxims of the bible to be be falſe; for, that book teaches, that we may be <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> and yet <hi>deſerve to be damned</hi> for that ſin: That GOD is not <hi>obliged</hi> in juſtice, or by promiſe, to grant converting grace to any impenitent ſinner; and yet it is the duty of ſuch ſinners <hi>every where to repent.</hi>—But, you may, at your leiſure, ſee my ſentiments on theſe ſubjects at large, and my confutation of Mr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deman's ſcheme of religion, both at once, in a book lately printed at Boſton; entitled, <hi>An eſſay on the nature and glory of the goſpel.</hi>—However,</p>
               <p>I will readily grant, that there is an abſolute neceſſity, of denying total depravity, on the one hand; or, of giving up the covenant of grace, and ſubſtituting a graceleſs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in its room, on the other hand; in order to open a door for the unconverted, as ſuch, to enter into covenant with GOD, and join in full communion with the church, conſiſtently with truth and honeſty.—But, yet, ſo it happens, that, on either plan men cannot conſiſtently be admitted into our churches.—For, if they deny total depravity, they muſt be deemed not ſound in the faith, according to our approved ſtandard; and, therefore, muſt not be admitted. And if they ſubſtitute a graceleſs covenant in the room of the covenant of grace, they go off from the plan on which our churches were originally founded; and ſo, conſiſtantly, cannot be members of them.—We muſt have a new confeſſion of faith, and a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011566_0006_0F87261CEA853160"/>
new plan of church order, and form new churches, before either of theſe ways will anſwer the end.—Beſides, if the unconverted have a degree of real holineſs, and do, tho' in an imperfect manner, yet really comply with the covenant of grace, then the unconverted are, in fact, entituled not only to the ſeals, but alſo to all the bleſſings of the covenant of grace; even to pardon, juſtification, and eternal life. Than which nothing can be more contrary to the whole tenor of ſcripture, which every where declares all ſuch to be under the wrath of GOD, and curſe of the law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already liable to be ſtruck dead and ſent to hell at any moment.

p. 5.—You ſay, he cannot.—I ſay, he can.— Indeed, once, I was of your opinion; and this was the reaſon I did not join in full communion; but I am of another mind now. And I can, tho' I know I have no grace, yet make a profeſſion of a compliance with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as honeſtly as any man.—And to charge any one with wilful lying for this, is virtually to charge the miniſters and churches thro' the land with that horrid crime. p. 3.</p>

               <p>As this is a matter of importance, it deſerves to be thought of ſeriouſly, and to be thoro'ly looked into. And if you will be ſerious, only long enough to underſtand the propoſition, you will be forced to believe it.—For,</p>
               <p>By the covenant of grace, we mean, that covenant which promiſes pardon and eternal life, to thoſe who comply with it.—By a compliance with it, we mean, ſaving grace; i. e. ſuch gracious exerciſes as are infallibly connected with ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

Such as <hi>repentance toward God,</hi> and <hi>faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> which imply ſupreme love to God and Chriſt in their very nature, and a cordial diſpoſition to a life of ſincere obedience to all God's commands. <note n="‡" place="bottom">A ſaving compliance with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For altho' it implies ſaving grace, yet it does not imply perfect holineſs. Thoſe, therefore, who are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may make a profeſſion honeſtly; but thoſe who are not, cannot. —To ſay, that a true believer cannot make a profeſſion honeſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not perfectly holy, ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>When, therefore, it is ſaid, that "a man, who knows that he has no grace, cannot profeſs a compliance with the Covenant of grace, without wilful lying;" the truth of the propoſition is as evident, as when it is ſaid, that "a man who knows that two and two are but four, cannot ſay, that two and two are five, without wilful lying." And, therefore, as ſoon as the propoſition is underſtood, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be believed. There is no way to avoid it.—For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you explain down the covenant of grace, into a graceleſs covenant, with which a graceleſs heart may really comply, it will not help your cauſe in the leaſt. For if a graceleſs heart may comply with this graceleſs covenant, yet it ſtill remains a ſelf-evident truth, that a graceleſs heart doth not comply with the covenant of grace.—Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you repreſent an unconverted graceleſs men, as not being <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> and <hi>without ſtrength;</hi> but as really having a degree of ſpiritual life, and ſpiritual ſtrength, and ſpiritual ability to yield holy obedience to all GOD'S com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and ſo, as complying with the covenant of grace, in reality, tho' but in an imperfect degree: it will not help your cauſe at all. For, this graceleſs man, ſo called, is, in fact, a gracious man, and is intitled not only to the ſeals, but alſo to the bleſſings of the covenant of grace.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011566_0007_0F87261E1D46C810"/>
Becauſe, he does, in fact, comply with it.—Rather, it runs you into the abſurdity, of ſaying, that ſome unconverted, graceleſs ſinners, are real converts and true ſaints, and have a title to eternal life, i. e. of expreſsly contradicting your ſelf.—Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you ſay, "a graceleſs ſinner may comply with the covenant of grace, with moral ſincerity, tho' not with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſincerity:" it will not help your cauſe, For there is but one kind of real complying with the covenant of grace; and this entitles to eternal life. For he that really complies with the covenant of grace, doth, in ſo doing act graciouſly. Thus, he who loves God ſupremely, with moral ſincerity, does love God ſupremely, in reality; but this real ſupreme love to God is a gracious and holy love to God. And you have already ſaid, "that obedience to God is always holy"—"and the obedience of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, as holy as any, that a gracious man can yield." p. 8. But if ſo, then this obedience is performed with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſincerity, as really as the obedience of any gracious man is.—But, if your graceleſs man does comply with the covevant of grace, in a gracious manner, he will go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven along with true ſaints. And, therefore, that ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour is not true. <hi>Except a man be born again be cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains, therefore, that this propoſition muſt paſs for a ſelf-evident truth, which cannot but be believed, as ſoon as it is underſtood, viz. <q>A man, who knows he has no grace, cannot profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, without wilful lying.</q>—You may as well ſay, that <hi>black is white,</hi> or that <hi>a dead man is alive</hi> or that a <hi>graceleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is a real ſaint,</hi> as ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> "a man, who knows he has no grace, can profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, honeſtly and with a good conſcience."—And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a man muſt either not know what he is about, or his conſcience muſt be very much ſeared, or he will not dare to profeſs a compliance with the covenant of grace, while he knows he has no grace. Indeed, it is a full proof, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011566_0008_0F87261EDE8A92B0"/>
a man is to a great degree deſtitute of moral honeſty, if, with his eyes open, he dare to make ſuch a profeſſion. It is, at leaſt, as groſs wickedneſs, as that, which Annanias and Sapphira were guilty of, in ſaying, <hi>This is all the money,</hi> when they knew that, <hi>it was not all.</hi> They <hi>lied to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and this man flatters God with his mouth, and lies unto him with his tongue. Pſal. 78. 36.</p>
               <p>To be conſiſtent, therefore, we muſt vote the covenant of grace out, in our church, and vote in a graceleſs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in its room, or you cannot be admitted as a member. And, if we ſhould vote out the covenant of grace, &amp; vote in a graceleſs covenant in its room, we ſhould, ſo far as this vote ſhould have influence, ceaſe to be a viſible church of Chriſt. Nor ſhould we have a viſible right to baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper, which are ſeals of the covenant of grace, and of no other covenant. For there are but two covenants, which now take place between God and man, viz. The covenant of works, and the covenant of grace. Rom. 3.27.</p>

               <p>I am not able to think of this ſeriouſly and to anſwer it honeſtly.

                     <p>Obj. Baptiſm alone makes me a church member, or it does not. If it does, then I have a righr to the Lord's-table: If it does not, then the church have no right to diſcipline me.</p>
                     <p>Anſ.

               <p>Yes, indeed.

               <p>But one, who is, at heart, a deiſt, and who lives ſecretly in adultry, may, to anſwer political ends, "aſk for ſpecial ordinances," and there may be no "certain evidence" of his crimes. Therefore, according to this NEW DIVINITY, this infidel, this adulterer, "is as certainly qualified to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lord's-ſupper, as he is to breathe."</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>Shocking conſequence! However, this I lay down for an infallible truth, that all who have viſibly entered into covenant, as I have done, "to walk in all God's ways and to keep all his commands," are bound by their own vow to attend ſpecial ordinances. p. 10, 11, 12.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>What! Bound, tho' they know themſelves to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified? Is the abovementioned infidel and adulterer bound? What! bound in the ſight of GOD and a well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated conſcience, to come to the Lord's table, as he is? Pray, who bound him? GOD never did: nor does the vow he publickly made to "walk in all GOD'S ways and keep all his commands" bind him to come <hi>as he is.</hi> For, this, is what GOD <hi>never commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is equally evident, that GOD never commanded men to make a lying profeſſion, in any inſtance, either ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally, or practically. But to ſeal a covenant is (practically)
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011566_0009_0F87261FA664C410"/>
to profeſs a compliance with it. To ſeal a covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with which we know we do not comply, is what GOD <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commanded.</hi> Yea, it is what GOD has forbidden in every text in the bible, which forbids lying. So that, if the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to be ſealed in baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper is the covenant of grace, as you allow it is, then thoſe who know they have no grace are forbidden to ſeal it, by every text in the bible, which forbids lying. And, therefore, that command, <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> is, beyond all doubt, a command which reſpects believers, and them only; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the publickly profeſſed belief of the church of, Scotland, and the churches in New-England, held forth in their public formulas.—Indeed, it is the duty, the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duty of every one to whom the goſpel comes, and their higheſt intereſt, to comply with the covenant of grace, and that on the very firſt invitation. As ſoon as the glad tydings come to our ears, <hi>come, for all things are now ready, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will let him come.</hi> We ought not to delay a moment, we ought not to make one excuſe, we ought not to feel the leaſt reluctance: no, rather, on the contrary, we ought with Peter's hearers, <hi>to receive the word gladly</hi> that ſame day, and to make a public profeſſion and join with the church the firſt opportunity. Mat. 13.44.—And to neglect this, is a ſin ſo great and aggravated, as to expoſe the neglecters to be given up of GOD in this world, Luke 14.24. And to be caſt off for ever in the world to come. Mark 16.16. So that your mouth is ſtopped, and you ſtand guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD.—But, to return, to a conſideration of your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtanding.—Pray, ſir, was you eſteemed a church member, in full communion, in the town where you lived, before you moved into this pariſh?</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>No, ſir, by no body. I never looked upon my ſelf to be a church-member, in this ſenſe of the phraſe. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant to join with the church, nor did the miniſter or the church mean to receive me as a church-member, and accordingly I never met with the church when they had church meetings upon church buſineſs.—I never ſtayed,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011566_0009_0F87261FA664C410"/>
when the church was deſired to ſtay, as they ſometimes were, after worſhip on ſabbaths, and at other times. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver voted when the church were called to give in their vote in any matter whatſoever. Nor had I any right to go to the Lord's-table without making a public profeſſion over again, and thereby <hi>joining with the church,</hi> as the common phraſe was. No ſuch thing was allowed where I was bro't up. So that I did not think myſelf a church-member be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I moved into this pariſh, nor was I eſteemed and uſed as a church-member. Yea, it never entered into my heart, to pretend any ſuch thing, till my New-London patron taught me to ſay ſo, and to put in theſe high claims, and to deny my old principles, and contradict myſelf, and finally, even to deny my own name, and pretend to be another man. And ſince then I have felt "BRAVELY," and have looked down upon you with great contempt.</p>

               <p>The more men mock GOD in religion, the more proud, haughty and inſolent are they apt to be towards their fellowmen. A religion begun in ignorance like yours, and carried on and perfected in this ſhocking manner, if it may do to live with, yet will not do to die by.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Be this as it may. Yet to ſay, as you do, "better do nothing than lie," tends to increaſe the number of prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons, and prayerleſs families, to put an end to all means, and in the end to overthrow all religion. p. 20.</p>

               <p>Doth not GOD himſelf ſay, Eccl. 5.5. <hi>Better is it that thou ſhouldſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldſt vow and not pay.</hi> i. e. in other words, "better do nothing than lie." And will you condemn the Holy One of Iſrael? Either give up the bible, or abide by its ſacred maxims.—Beſides, there is a difference between <hi>covenanting tranſactions</hi> and <hi>common means.</hi> And, accordingly, Chriſt ordered his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to <hi>preach the goſpel to every creature;</hi> but he did not order them to <hi>baptiſe every creature.</hi>—For,</p>
               <p>Graceleſs ſinners may hear the goſpel preached, may hear all the truths and duties of it explained, proved and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and may attend; yea, may be very attentive, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011566_0010_0F872620EFCFC6D0"/>
meditate on them day and night, till they <hi>are pricked at the heart:</hi> they may forſake vain and vicious company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſober, ſerious, deeply diſtreſſed about their eternal welfare: They may ſpend much time in ſecret prayer, <hi>(and an awakened ſinner cannot fail to do it)</hi> and frequently ſpend whole days in faſting and prayer, as Mr. Brainerd uſed to do, under his terrors, when he was unconverted; pray read his life:—I ſay, graceleſs ſinners may do all this without making any profeſſion of Godlineſs. Yea, they may do all this, and yet, in all, profeſs that they have no grace, no love to GOD in their hearts, but are dead in ſin.</p>
               <p>You inſinuate, that the doctrines which I preached tend to licentiouſneſs.—I appeal to facts.—Look from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation down to this day—look thro' England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland—look thro' the Britiſh colonies in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and thro' our Weſt-India iſlands—and put the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—when—and where—and among whom—has there been, or is there now, the greateſt ſtrictneſs maintained, and the moſt conſtant, diligent and painful attendance on means? Either, among Calviniſts, who heartily agree with the Weſtminiſter confeſſion of faith and catechiſms, and where theſe doctrines are taught privately and preached public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?—Or, among Pelagians, Arminians, and Semi-Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who are conſtantly teaching and preaching in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrain?—While the aſſembly of divines ſat at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, compoſing the formulas, which I am now vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating; London, that great city, was full of ſermons, and prayers, and ſtrictneſs: but ſince theſe doctrines have been laid aſide, and contrary doctrines introduced, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very licentious and debauched. The more you flatter the ſinner, the farther will he run from GOD and all good. But tell him the truth, pierce him to the heart, and he will begin to cry, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>

               <p>But can an unconverted ſinner ſay the Lord's-prayer, and ſpeak true? i. e. Can he profeſs to GOD, that he hath all thoſe holy and pious affections in his heart, which our Saviour deſigned thoſe words to expreſs? p. 12.</p>

               <p>I alſo will aſk you one queſtion; anſwer me: And then, I will anſwer you. <hi>Is not the man, who thus ſays the Lord's prayer, entituled to pardon and eternal life?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>No doubt he is. For, our Saviour ſays, <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly father will alſo forgive you,</hi> with a deſign to explain in what ſenſe he meant that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition ſhould be made, <hi>forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.</hi> And beſides, in the ſame ſermon, he expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>every one that aſketh, receiveth.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>It therefore follows, that no unconverted man ever ſaid that prayer, in that ſenſe, unleſs you will own, what ſeems to be a neceſſary conſequence of the ſcheme you are pleading for, that ſome unconverted men are entituled to pardon and eternal life. Which is ſo contrary to the moſt plain and expreſs declarations of ſcripture, (Joh. 3.18.36. Gal. 3, 10.) that, as yet, you have not ventured to own it.</p>
               <p>Thouſands, no doubt, have, after a ſort, ſaid the Lord's prayer, who have fallen ſhort of eternal life. For the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay the Lord's-prayer oftner than proteſtants do, ten to one, and for every <hi>Pater-Noſter</hi> they count a bead. And while ſinners are ſecure in ſin, ſuch kind of praying, i. e. uſing words without any meaning, will quiet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. For they now think they have done their duty. <hi>For without the law ſin was dead: and ſo I was alive without the law once.</hi> But no ſooner do they fall under deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, but that they find ſomething elſe to do. Pray read Mr. Brainerd's Life, and there you may ſee how an awakened ſinner feels, and how he prays.</p>

               <p>Thus far, ſir, I have acted the part of a diſputant. I have paſſed over nothing in the New-Haven letter, that is new, and to the purpoſe. For this letter-writer has not ſaid one word for my old beloved ſcheme, <hi>the half-way.</hi> Now therefore, I beg leave, to aſſume the friendly, honeſt character, which I ſuſtained in my firſt viſit, For, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do as they will, I am reſolved to be an honeſt man. Wherefore to ſum up the whole,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011566_0011_0F8726210FBE4218"/>1. I believe, that there is but one covenant, of which baptiſm, and the Lord's-ſupper are ſeals: And that he that is qualified to offer his children in baptiſm is equally qualified for the Lord's-table: And therefore that the half-way practice is not according to ſcripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I believe, that any man, who ſeals any covenant, doth, in and by the act of ſealing, declare his compliance with that covenant which he ſeals: becauſe this is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the act of ſealing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I believe, that it is of the nature of lying, to ſeal a covenant, with which, I do not now, and never did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in my heart; but rather habitually and conſtantly reject.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4. I believe, that a man, who knows he has no grace, cannot ſeal the covenant of grace, honeſtly and with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I believe, that the only point, which needs to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, in order to ſettle the whole controverſy, is this, viz. Are baptiſm and the Lord's-ſupper ſeals of the covenant of grace, or of a graceleſs covenant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I believe, that there are but two covenants between GOD and man, called in ſcripture language, <hi>the law of work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the law of faith,</hi> but commonly called, the <hi>covenant of works,</hi> and the <hi>covenant of grace.</hi> And that the doctrine of an external covenant diſtinct from the covenant of grace, is not from heaven, but of men.—Thus, ſir, you have my creed.</p>

               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I hope the time will ſoon come, when you and all my other pariſhioners, thro' the country, will well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the controverſy, and be able to judge for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what is truth, and what is not ſo. In the mean time, remember, my friend, that <hi>he that knoweth his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Behold <hi>now</hi> is the accepted time, and <hi>now</hi> is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; therefore <hi>to-day,</hi> if you will hear his voice harden not your heart. Every moment in which you continue practically to renounce your baptiſm, by rejecting CHRIST
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011566_0011_0F8726210FBE4218"/>
JESUS and his goſpel, you hang over hell, ready to ſink under the curſe of the divine law, into eternal burnings: For <hi>he that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>repent and believe the goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſeem to think that baptiſm alone makes a man a Chriſtian, and brings him really into the covenant of grace, ſo as that he is no longer under the covenant of works, as the unbaptiſed are. But the apoſtle Paul did not think ſo. For he, ſpeaking to the baptized Galatians, among whom he feared there were ſome, who were ſelf-righteous, Chriſtleſs ſinners, he ſays. Gal. 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the law are under the curſe.</hi> "As many" be they circumciſed, and baptiſed too, "as are of the works of the law" as depend on their own works for juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſight of GOD, "are under the curſe," even <hi>they are under the curſe;</hi> for it is written, <hi>Curſed is every one,</hi> &amp;c. But if baptiſm delivers men from the covenant of works, they cannot <hi>any one of them</hi> be under its curſe. For no man is liable to the curſe of a law which he is not under. Beſides, in this Apoſtles view of things, it was peculiar to true believers to be really in the covenant of grace, and not under the law as a covenant of works. Rom. 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under law, but under grace.</hi> For according to this ſcheme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, every ſoul is either <hi>married to the law;</hi> and theſe <hi>bring forth fruit unto death;</hi> or <hi>married to Chriſt;</hi> and theſe <hi>bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> (chap. 7.) Wherefore, know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, that your baptiſm, altho' it increaſes your obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſo enhances your guilt; yet it, alone, gives you not the leaſt right to any one of the peculiar bleſſings of the covenant of grace, ſo as at all to exempt you from the curſe of the law; but you are now, this moment, in fact, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be ſtruck dead and ſent to hell, by the Divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; as any unbaptized ſinner in the land. And ſhould you die in the ſtate you are now in, you would moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be damned along with the unbaptized heathen: only your hell would be hotter than theirs. Mat. 11.20—24.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011566_0012_0F87262227622358"/>
For <hi>if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumciſion is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion.</hi> Rom. 2.25.—Wherefore, I adviſe you,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, immediately to repent of your ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, looking only to free grace thro' him for pardon and eternal life. For I teſtify unto you, that if you truſt in your baptiſm to recommend you to God, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. Gal. 5.2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; give up this, and all your other ſelf-righteous claims, and apply to the mere, pure, free grace of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, as all your hope. For, as to acceptance with God, <hi>there is no difference,</hi> between the circumciſed Jew and the uncircumciſed Greek, or between the baptized nominal Chriſtian and an unbaptized Indian. Rom. 3.22. If you will thus <hi>repent and believe the goſpel,</hi> and in this way, not in falſehood, but in truth, "avouch the Lord Jehovah to be your ſovereign Lord and ſupreme good thro' Jeſus Chriſt," you ſhall, in fact, have your choice, that is, have God for your God and portion in time and eternity. This, my dear Pariſhioner, this is the way to take upon you your baptiſmal covenant, and to get delivered from the curſe of the covenant of works, and to enter into the covenant of grace, in reality and in truth.—This therefore do without delay.—And having done this, then make a public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of religion, and join yourſelf to God's people, and bring your dear child and dedicate it to the ſame God to whom you have dedicated yourſelf. And let it be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of your life to bring up that, and your other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now as you travel thro' the country, for I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you are become a great traveller and gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into all companies, and among men of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations and character, I adviſe you to uſe your utmoſt influence, to diffuſe a friendly ſpirit every where, among all your acquaintance, in this controverſy. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, urge it upon pariſhioners of your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to treat their miniſters in a reſpectful manner,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011566_0012_0F87262227622358"/>
while they apply to them for light and inſtruction, or when they undertake to diſpute theſe points with them, eſpecially, wherever your influence extends, let no man, on our ſide of the queſtion, treat his miniſter ill, becauſe he is in the oppoſite ſcheme. It is not man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not chriſtian-like, it is not prudent to do it. For there is no way to promote truth ſo effectually, as to hold forth light in love; and to treat your oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents in a kind and friendly manner.—For my part, I have an high eſteem for many in the miniſtry, who differ in their practice in the admiſſion of perſons to ſealing ordinances for themſelves and for their children, from what I think is right. For it is a controverſy which has not been attended to, nor is it an eaſy thing, at once, to get rid of the prejudices of education, and in the face of a frowning world to eſpouſe the true ſcripture plan. I have great hopes, however, that, ere long, we ſhall think and act nearer alike, when there has been ſufficient time to underſtand one another, to weigh and deliberate, to get rid of the prejudices of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the mean time, I moſt earneſtly deſire, that the controverſy may be carried on, in the moſt open, fair, honeſt, cool, calm, friendly manner poſſible.</p>
               <p>Who this <hi>letter-writer</hi> is, is not know by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as he has ſecreted his name. And whether it was on deſign, or thro' inadvertance, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up the doctrine of total depravity, as held forth in ſcripture and in our public formulas, I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Perhaps, on ſecond thoughts, he will retract e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing he hath ſaid, which hath that aſpect. I wiſh he may. But if it ſhould come to paſs, as I fear it will, that in the courſe of this controverſy, numbers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011566_0013_0F87262296153E78"/>
ſhould openly fall off to the Arminian ſcheme, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to defend their lax manner of admiſſion to ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinances, I adviſe you, to keep by you, and to ſpread every where among your acquaintance, the Weſtminiſter confeſſion of faith, &amp; larger and ſhorter catechiſms: a book, which will be of excellent ſervice to teach people ſound doctrine, and to guard them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Arminian errors.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I ſhall always retain a moſt grateful ſenſe of your kind treatment of your miniſter, <hi>when acting yourſelf,</hi> and be always ready to do every kind office in my power, which either you, or any other of my pariſhioners ſhall need at my hands. I eſteem it among the great bleſſings of my life, that I live in a pariſh, and among a people, ſo well diſpoſed to treat a miniſter with that reſpect which is due to his office. And I hope you may never find me wanting in any inſtance of kind and friendly conduct towards you.— I wiſh you the beſt of heaven's bleſſings.—My dear pariſhioner, adieu.</p>
