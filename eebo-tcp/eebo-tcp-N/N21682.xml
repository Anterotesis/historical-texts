            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM LIII. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, <hi>There is</hi> no God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE folly of practical atheiſm is the ſubject propoſed for preſent conſideration. The fool is not here ſuppoſed to deny the being of a God, conſidered as a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> truth, but as it relates to <hi>practice;</hi> or the idea of a God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as moral Governor, to whom he muſt give account. His practice declares the language of his heart to be this: <hi>No God: I would there were none.</hi> What influence his wiſh may poſſibly have on his opinion, we ſhall not tarry to enquire. It hath been much doubted, whether there ever was a ſpeculative atheiſt. Be this as it may, the folly of another kind of atheiſm is to be laid open in the enſuing diſcourſe. It is to be ſhewn that the practical atheiſt is a fool. His life declares the wiſh of his heart to be that expreſſed in the text. He is thus deſcribed in the following part of the pſalm: <q>Corrupt are they, and have done abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inable iniquity. God looked down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028529_0004_0FD93531F2B41270"/>
upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand, that did ſeek God. Every one of them is gone back, they are altogether become filthy: There is none that doth good, no not one.</q> St. Paul applies the paſſage to the body of the Jewiſh nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Romans, iii. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,—19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>According to this deſcription of the atheiſt, he either neglects the worſhip of God, altho he may acknowledge his exiſtence: Or he lives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, altho he attends to the externals of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Or he uſeth religion as a cloke to his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns. Let us examine each of theſe caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To what end is the exiſtence of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, if his worſhip is neglected? To deny him our worſhip, is to all intents to ſay, There is no God. What could a ſpeculative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt ſay or do more? <hi>He</hi> doth not call upon God, becauſe he maintains that no God exiſts. He acts conſiſtently. For <hi>he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is.</hi> But the practical atheiſt admits that he is, and yet doth not come to him. Where is the material difference between deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him religious homage, and denying his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>The ancient Epicureans profeſſed to believe a God, but denied his moral perfections and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. They deſcribed him as a God at eaſe, indifferent to, and even ignorant of, the conduct of his creatures. Their own voluptuouſneſs was but an imitation of their god. They who reſtrain
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028529_0005_0FD93537FA652C48"/>
prayer, caſt off fear. They may poſſibly ſay, "We do not deny that God is to be worſhipped, any more than we deny his being." May we not reply, as an apoſtle did in another and ſimilar caſe? "Shew thy faith by thy works. The devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is one God, and tremble," and blaſpheme.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do any pay God an external worſhip, whoſe general courſe of life is a denial of his perfections and providence? Applicable to ſuch are the words of St. Paul, "Be not deceived, for God is not mocked." Their religious performances declare one thing; their uniform practice, another. From which are we to determine whether they own or diſown a God? Their actions ſay that they have no awe of God, no deſire of his approbation, or fear of his diſpleaſure. What leſs can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude than this, that, might they have their choice, there would be no God?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such as uſe religion as a pretext to their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter ends, may conceal their real character in a great meaſure from the world, and even from themſelves. But is there more impiety in avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed atheiſm, than in making uſe of God and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to patroniſe hypocriſy, and crimes which ſhock humanity? While men would be thought to do God ſervice, yea, while they have thought themſelves in the firſt claſs of his favorites, they have faught againſt him. In the judgment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, the higher any one's pretenſions, while the inward temper is moſt repugnant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028529_0006_0FD9354B84AEC2D0"/>
the higher indignity is offered to God; the more are his perfections and exiſtence denied and reproached.</p>
            <p>Is there a God of all perfection? Should we not then ſet him always before us? Should we not, in a ſteady courſe, ſolemnly recognize his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perfections and providence? Should we not be habitually impreſſed with the contemplation of him in his works, his word, and his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Should not our hearts and lives, as well as our lips, expreſs our faith in him? If there is a God of all perfection, of what high concern is it, that we be conformed to him, and the objects of his ſpecial love?</p>
            <p>From the general view we have taken of the practical atheiſt's character, let us proceed to ſhew that he is deſervedly pronounced a <hi>fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Were there no God, according to his wiſh, ſtill the exiſtence of a God is greatly to be <hi>deſired,</hi> and therefore it is folly to wiſh there were none.</p>
            <p>The being of a God includes a wiſe, univerſal and perpetual providence, a moral government, the immortality of the ſoul, and future ineffable rewards for them who diligently ſeek him. It is the foundation of ſerenity and hope amidſt all the trials of life, and in the view of death. In the moſt favorable circumſtances which we can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on earth, man is conſcious to deſires and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to which no external things are adapted— deſires and capacities of a far ſuperior nature to the animal appetites and affections. At his beſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028529_0007_0FD9353CE0DA0CA8"/>
ſtate, he <hi>walks through dry places, ſeeking reſt,</hi> but not finding it, unleſs he hath imbibed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion—is eſtabliſhed in the belief of a God, who made and governs the world, conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately bleſſed in himſelf, and all-ſufficient, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect moral rectitude, who delighteth in mercy, and will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what a variety of circumſtances are there, in which we cannot take outward ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the enjoyments of life, though ſurrounded with them; and which they would yield, were it not for ſuch circumſtances? Such are excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating pains, languiſhing ſickneſs, the loſs of dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt connexions in life, or anxiety for them in their misfortunes and diſtreſſes, or affliction from their miſconduct, or the calamities under which they are born and continued, or which may have come on them. In ſuch circumſtances man feels his need of the principles of religion.</p>
            <p>Or could outward things ſatisfy us <hi>at preſent,</hi> were we exempt from all the troubles of life; yet we cannot but be thoughtful for the <hi>time to come.</hi> Death is the common lot of mankind, and muſt ſoon be our own lot. Perſons of all conditions and ages die ſuddenly by various means. None of them return to us. We cannot promiſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves another day, or hour. Shall we then take up ſatisfied with the world, when we know not what a day may bring forth? Suppoſe we ſhall die to-morrow, or this night, where ſhall we then be? No where! nothing! if there is no God, who
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028529_0008_0FD9353E6FCB07F8"/>
alone hath immortality. What a damp muſt the proſpect of ſpeedy annihilation caſt over all the pleaſant things of the world? Muſt it not turn all joy into heavineſs? Can the mind be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the thought, that in a little time, perhaps in one hour, we ſhall ceaſe forever! Whenever death ſhall come, we ſhall periſh as the beaſts, if there is no God. What pre-eminence then hath man above them? What a fool, how brutiſh, is he who would thus degrade the human ſpecies, next in the ſcale of beings to the angels! Is it not more eligible and wiſe to believe an after ſtate, free from all the encumbrances, pains, ſorrows and anxieties of this? a ſtate of unmingled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing happineſs, adapted to our intelligent, moral nature? The aſſured expectation of ſuch a ſtate can calm the mind, reconcile it to the ſufferings of the preſent time, diſpel the gloom of the grave, the houſe appointed for all the living, and make us more than conquerers in paſſing the vale of death.</p>
            <p>The exiſtence of a God therefore is moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. He who wiſheth there were none, wiſheth miſery to himſelf, and to mankind. Were his wiſh the real truth, it would be the higheſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to embrace and act upon the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ſake of paſſing with eaſe through life, and cloſing it quietly and joyfully. If he is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken who thinks there is a God, and conducts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he is not a loſer, but a gainer, by his miſtake, in life. He cannot repent his miſtake
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028529_0009_0FD9354047789518"/>
after death; nor can any reproach him with it, if death is a total extinction of being. So that even on the ſuppoſition there were no God, the believer of one is wiſe, and the diſbeliever a fool. The atheiſt is a fool, ſhould what he wiſheth turn out to be true. It is an happy deluſion to think and wiſh differently from him, whether we regard our own comfort, or the welfare of mankind— Happy to think and wiſh differently, provided we alſo <hi>practiſe</hi> differently. For to believe a God, and not live accordingly, can only alarm us with unneceſſary fears—Unneceſſary, I mean, on the ſuppoſition of the truth of atheiſm—But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, if there is a God, they who live as though there were none, muſt be eternally <hi>ruined;</hi> and therefore the atheiſt is a fool.</p>
            <p>It is the part of wiſdom to chooſe and act on that ſide which in all events will be moſt ſafe. If atheiſm is folly, even on the ſuppoſition of its truth, much more is it folly on the ſuppoſition of its falſhood. Admit that the being of a God is barely <hi>poſſible,</hi> what an hazard may the atheiſt run? The hazard is, that he may poſſibly be miſerable beyond expreſſion, in body and ſoul, forever. If the being of a God is <hi>probable,</hi> the hazard then is that he will probably be thus miſerable. And if the being of God is <hi>certain,</hi> the miſery of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt is not leſs ſo. How inconceivable then is his ſtupidity? Could he perſuade himſelf that the notion of a God is entirely a fiction, ſo as to be tolerably calm through life, and to have no other
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028529_0010_0FD93548CA152D40"/>
apprehenſion at death than that of annihilation; yet, ſhould he then find himſelf miſtaken, the conſequence is too diſmal to be expreſſed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Even the ſhadow of a probability that he may then find himſelf miſtaken is abundantly ſufficient to convict him of folly in not providing againſt ſuch probability—call it contingency, if you pleaſe. What wiſe man would run the ſmalleſt poſſible hazard, where ſuch a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may be depending?</p>
            <p>We have ſhewn that the atheiſt's opinion, acted upon, abridgeth him of the trueſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in life, and cuts him off from all hope in death. What a dreadful leap doth he then take, if the oppoſite opinion ſhould be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, not diſcovered till too late to be corrected, he muſt fruitleſſly lament, and experience its effects under the final diſpleaſure of that God who <hi>is a conſuming fire.</hi> Had he acted on the ſuppoſition that there is a God, he would have run no hazard, if this be a miſtake. For who could puniſh or reproach him for it? If he had worſhipped as God an ideal being, his error and his exiſtence would terminate together, and he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the temporary conſolation, which the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical belief of a Deity muſt afford in this ſtate.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe atheiſm were the general opinion of mankind, and that a believer in God and true worſhipper of him muſt ſacrifice every thing dear in life, and life itſelf, to his belief and practice, would he not be the wiſe man, and all others
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028529_0011_0FD935AD82CCD7B8"/>
fools, admitting the truth of religion? <hi>Their</hi> gain would be temporal, their loſs eternal; but <hi>his</hi> gain would be eternal, his loſs temporal.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the ſummit of folly to live in ſuch a manner as muſt impel them to chuſe that there were no God, when at the ſame time men <hi>ſuſpect,</hi> and even <hi>conclude,</hi> there is one.</p>
            <p>Such is the fool deſcribed in the text. His heart is at variance with his head. He acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own ſentiments, as well as againſt the ſentiment of all the world. For this principle, the being of a God, has had the conſent of all mankind. The athieſt "half believes a God;" why elſe doth he <hi>fear</hi> one? It is folly to fear the mere phantom of a Deity. If a Deity is merely a phantom, he thinks it a reality, or it would not terrify him. The pſalmiſt obſerves, v. 5, con. "There were they in great fear, where no fear was." The vicious, the profane and atheiſtical ſcoffers at religion, as they have cauſe, are the greateſt cowards, in certain circumſtances. <hi>The ſound of a ſhaken leaf chaſeth them;</hi> and <hi>they fly as from the ſword, when none</hi> are <hi>purſuing</hi> them. Many imaginary fears are the effect of guilt. In time of danger it takes from hardy veterans in vice all fortitude. When their iniquity doth but ſeem to have found them out, they betray guilt in their aſpect, their behavior, their manner of defence; and ſometimes make immediate confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But theſe fears, you may ſay, are produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the apprehenſion of <hi>civil</hi> penalties, not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028529_0012_0FD9354A16129AB0"/>
by any ſenſe of a <hi>God,</hi> or of accountableneſs to him.</q> This, however, doth not account for the fears of the guilty, where no civil penalties are apprehended. It doth not account for their fear of death, from ſickneſs or otherwiſe. Nor is this merely a natural dread of diſſolution. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within preſages an after reckoning an after exiſtence. They judge themſelves, and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend an higher judgment.</p>
            <p>That ſuch as mock at ſin, and in the general courſe of life have no fear of God, are yet afraid when danger or death is nigh, proves that they believe there is a God, though they wiſh there were not. When their powers of reflection are by any means awakened, they are afraid of him. <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted!</hi> why do thy thoughts trouble thee? What is it within thy breaſt, that agitates thee, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thy repoſe? what that makes thee heavy in the midſt of laughter, and drives ſleep from thine eyes? If there is no God, thou mayſt certainly conclude that this officious intruder on thy peace is a liar; and needeſt not be troubled, becauſe it <hi>writeth bitter things againſt thee.</hi> Why ſhould the weakneſs of ſuperſtition, or ſickly fancy, cauſe thy countenance to turn pale, thy tongue to faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thy joints to tremble? Haſt thou found by thy wiſdom that ſome crazy dreamer firſt ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the notion of a God? that fear circulated it? and that it was inculcated to anſwer the ends of politicians? Why then art thou unmanned by the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028529_0013_0FD93554EEF5DDA8"/>
miſgivings and forebodings of thine own mind? Why ſhould theſe confute thy declaration, that there is no God?</p>
            <p>The plain truth is this: The thoughtleſs, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and profligate, by their manner of life, bring themſelves to ſay in their heart. <q>No God. Well were it for us, if there were none. He is not our God, our Father and friend. We are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his government, and have naught elſe to expect but to be frowned from his preſence. O that there were no God! or that he had not brought us into being!</q>
            </p>
            <p>When men have lived without God in the world, they have the temerity to wiſh, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they dare not utter, that God might not be. They are reſolved not to alter their courſe. This, they are aware, muſt end in ruin, if God exiſts, and governs the world. Hence the only alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native left them is to wiſh that atheiſm were true. <hi>Surely theſe are fools.</hi> They are at variance with themſelves. For while they wiſh there were no God, they alſo wiſh to die in favor with him. Can the atheiſt be named, who doth not moſt ſincerely join with Balaam in his prayer: "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his?" If this is even the atheiſt's pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, judge ye whether his atheiſm is any other than practical. And is he not a fool to live as no one can be willing to die?—eſtranged from God? By wiſhing to die as the righteous man dieth, he commends the life of the righteous, the part cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028529_0014_0FD93556C9FD8A78"/>
and the courſe purſued by him. The pious man's end could not be preferable to that of the impious, unleſs his life were ſo. That choice or courſe, which ends well, muſt be pronounced wiſe: that which ends ill, muſt therefore be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The atheiſt himſelf being judge, he lives and dies a fool; why elſe is it his wiſh that he may die the death of the righteous?</p>
            <p>Would we determine on wiſdom and folly as relative to the characters and purſuits of men, let us follow them to the cloſing ſcene. Let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve whether they go off the ſtage with honor or diſgrace. Is death the end of all men? Then they are wiſe who conſider their latter end—who refer their conduct in life to this ſolemn period, and act ſuch a part as they can the review with approbation. If the atheiſt cannot then approve his own part, but will be compelled to wiſh that he had acted the part of the godly man, is it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon that we call him a fool?</p>
            <p>Can any ſubject of enquiry be more ſerious and important than <hi>this,</hi> whether we ſo live as that it is our higheſt intereſt to ſuppoſe there is a God, or the contrary? Could men, either from ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pride or diſſolute manners, fix down in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that God is nothing but a name, they might then be exempt from the perturbations of guilt, and apprehenſions of a judgment. On this ſuppoſition, they would neither approve nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any affections, volitions or actions in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al view. Still, being endowed with ſore thought,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028529_0015_0FD93558B78AA0C0"/>
and obſerving the frailty of the human race, they could not but be anxious whether, or after what manner, they ſhall exiſt when they leave this world. If they are ſettled in the opinion of athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, what but palpable darkneſs is before them? None of their friends who have been removed, return to inform them whether there is another life; or if there is, of what ſort. Atheiſm then doth not relieve their minds, naturally thoughtful for futurity, and ſolicitous to know what may be at and after death—an event which the wiſe and fooliſh alike expect.</p>
            <p>But if the wicked rather <hi>wiſh</hi> there were not a God, than really <hi>diſbelieve,</hi> what madneſs hath led them to ſuch a wiſh? Shall they profeſs that they know and believe in him, and yet ſeldom have him in their thoughts, renounce his fear, deſpiſe his goodneſs, and abuſe his grace and patience? Shall their practice ſpeak this language, <q>Who is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhall we have, if we pray unto him?</q> Is he the former of our bodies, and the father of our ſpirit? Do we live, and move, and have our being in him? Doth every good gift come from him? Hath he to all other gifts added that of a Redeemer, which indeed comprehends all things? Can he ſave or deſtroy? And ſhall his creatures, formed to ſhew forth his praiſe, and for whom he hath delivered up his own Son, forget him, and live as though they were ſelf-made, and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved? as though their good were in their own
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028529_0016_0FD93559C3E12A00"/>
hands? as though they were not accountable? had nothing to hope from his favor, nothing to fear from his anger? <q>Underſtand ye brutiſh, and ye fools when will ye be wiſe? He that planted the ear, ſhall he not hear? He that formed the eye, ſhall he not ſee? He that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man knowledge, ſhall not he know?</q> Will you not call on his name in public or private? Or will you uſe it only to profane it? Or will you cry mightily to him in your calamity, or when danger is near; and yet not have him in all your thoughts in the day of health, ſafety and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity? Have you no concern with God, except in a time of extremity? and would you apply to him then only? Or have you to do with him at all times, in every place, in all circumſtances? Thoſe who fear before him habitually, who bleſs him at all times, and acknowledge him in all their ways, ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings. Their heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord. He hath not given them a ſpirit of fear. He is their refuge, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſent help in trouble. Such is the difference between religion and irreligion.</p>
            <p>The atheiſt is a fool from <hi>choice,</hi> not from <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</hi> Were it owing to a want or imbecility of underſtanding that he ſaith there is no God, his folly would be his excuſe. But this is not the caſe. "The world by WISDOM knew not God. <hi>Profeſſing themſelves to be</hi> WISE, they became fools." The groſſeſt errors in religion, and athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm itſelf, proceed from an affectation of ſuperior
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028529_0017_0FD9355E892C7320"/>
wiſdom. Thrô the pride of knowing more than they have faculties for, it comes to paſs that men know nothing as they ought to know. Hence they <q>put darkneſs for light, and light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter; and call evil good, and good evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How great is human depravity, that God ſhould be diſowned! that any of the human race ſhould indulge a wiſh in their hearts that HE were not! It is not conſidered what this horrid wiſh implies. But is <hi>inconſideration</hi> an excuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it not a crime? A God may be clearly ſeen in his works—parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in our own frame. The idea of a God, if not innate, has been a part of education among all nations; it is demonſtrable, if we <hi>aſcend</hi> from effects to their cauſe, whether it be or not in the other mode of <hi>deſcending</hi> from cauſe to effect. His being and moral perfections are the only joy and hope of ſuch a creature as man, formed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and adore, capable of deliberating and preferring, naturally conſcious of liberty and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableneſs, placed in this mixed ſtate, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently intended for another.</p>
            <p>The government of an omnipotent Deity, the parent of the whole family in heaven and earth, is matter of rejoicing to that part of his family to which we belong, as well as to that above. Is it not then among the moſt affecting proofs of man's fall and corruption, that he ſhould practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally deny the God that is above! Surely he muſt be a very different creature from what God made
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028529_0018_0FD9356152BF5CB8"/>
him, before he could wiſh in his heart, that his Creator and Father were not! Would it be cruel to wiſh a numerous family of children might be left orphans! Would it be moſt vile and abſurd were a child of the family to wiſh the father and head were taken away! What is this compared with <hi>his</hi> folly and vileneſs, who wiſheth that all the offspring of God, angels and men, had no parent! What muſt the conduct be, in which ſuch a wiſh originates? It is <hi>his</hi> wiſh who goes about ſeeking whom he may devour—<hi>his</hi> wiſh who left his own habitation by the eternal throne, and is compelled to ſay, "Fartheſt from God is beſt."</p>
            <p>What has been diſcourſed ſhould awaken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in thoſe who have much regard to the eye of <hi>man,</hi> but little or no regard to the eye of <hi>God.</hi> All things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do. This is forgotten, and practically denied, by all who do thoſe things under cover of the night, or in retirement, which, ſhould they come abroad, would fill them with fear or ſhame. To take pains in ſaving appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, but no pains about the principles and ends of our actions, all which are weighed by a God of knowledge, is to deny that HE looketh at the heart. They who have a <hi>form</hi> of godlineſs, but deny the <hi>power,</hi> cheriſh this inward thought, that God doth not ſearch the heart, in order to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man according to his ways. They who practiſe ſecret fraud, liars, falſe accuſers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028529_0019_0FD9356353D22C48"/>
perſons, thieves, adulterers, envious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, practically ſay, that God's eye is not on them. They deny him in works, in the heart. When thoſe whoſe eye is evil towards others, learn the charity which envieth not—when the unclean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come chaſte—when he that ſtole, ſteals no more, but worketh with his hands the things that is good, that he may give to him that needeth— when the perjured have no longer a right hand of falſhood—when the profane learn to fear HIM who holds not thoſe guiltleſs that take his name in vain—when liars ceaſe from falſhood—when they who have defrauded others, learn to live in honeſty—when they who have taken great pains to conceal their ſins from the world, ſhall take like pains not to ſin in ſecret—when they who have done their works to be ſeen of men, ſhall ſtudy to approve themſelves to God—Then all theſe will beſt ſhew that they believe a God. Then will they have reaſon to conclude, that his being and perfections are the wiſh and joy of their hearts. With him there is mercy, and plenteous redemption. The Savior of the world came to call all manner of ſinners to repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every one that doeth evil hateth the light.</hi> An <hi>evil</hi> heart is an heart of <hi>unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is inclined to deny or pervert the truth. Ahab ſaid of Mica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, <q>I hate him; for he never propheſieth good unto me, but always evil.</q> Micajah had told him the truth, and therefore was held as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Ahab, who cheriſhed as friends thoſe who propheſied lies.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:028529_0020_0FD9356443B0F628"/>Suppoſe a man of an evil heart may have juſt ſentiments of religion, and can draw a fine picture of it; ſuppoſe him to have all knowledge, and the faith of a martyr; yet he hath not love to God or men, and is <hi>as ſounding braſs, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymbal.</hi> If there be a God, we ought to love him with all the heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength and mind. It is good to draw near to him. They that are far from him ſhall periſh. The ſon in the parable, who, when commanded to work in the vineyard, anſwered very reſpectfully, <hi>I go, ſir; and went not,</hi> was as deſtitute of filial reverence as he who petulantly anſwered, <hi>I will not.</hi> Truſt not to external profeſſions. The divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is, <hi>My ſon, give me thine heart.</hi> "Keep thine heart with all diligence; for out of it are the iſſues of life." Next to the love of God, your neighbor claims your attention and regard. The love of him ſhould be meaſured by ſelf-love. In other words, <q>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If we walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, we ſhall redeem time, and improve every talent, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God. <hi>The wiſe ſhall inherit glory; but ſhame ſhall be the promotion of fools.</hi>
