            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Parſon and the Fowls; or the Maid too cunning for her Maſter.</head>
               <p>A RICH old batchelor, a clergyman in the country, having made choice of a pretty young maid to his houſe-keeper, had ordered upon a certain Sunday, a couple of fowls to be got ready for his dinner, that after he had given his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation a little Chriſtian conſolation at church, he might come home and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh his tired vitals with a dainty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum. When the clerk and his looby aſſiſtant, had chimed almoſt for about a quarter of an hour, and jogged the ſhepherd to fodder his ſheep, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his time by the ſand glaſs, his pretty houſekeeper was left te prepare the cack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers againſt the cuſtomary time of his return.</p>
               <p>The diligent maid when ſhe thought her ghoſtly maſter had been long enough exalted two degrees above the clerk, to get about a quarter of an hour on the right ſide of his text, gueſſed it a very proper time to lay down the fowls, which ſhe did accordingly. As the tid-bits were
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035716_0003_100654780D39F0C8"/>running merrily round before a rouzing fire, who ſhould take the advantage of the parſon's abſence, but his houſe-keepers ſweet-heart, who by his pleaſant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical hoity toities, and other winning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, had ſo wriggled himſelf into her affections, that it is not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think he had as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her as her maſter.</p>
               <p>The maid having miſtaken the time of day, happened to be a little too early with her cookery, ſo that the fowls were fully ready, before the parſon had given his hungry auditory leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to their puddings and dump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The ſweet-heart being a fellow of an incomparable ſtomach, thought it a great pity ſuch good victuals ſhould be ſpoiled for want of eating, and very eagerly ſolicited his loving jug to ſpare him one of the fowls to ſtop a little hole he had in his appetite, telling, her, one would be ſufficient for her maſter, and that ſhe had wit enough to contrive ſome ſtory or other, handſomely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the matter, and blind him from the true knowledge of what became of it.</p>
               <p>The maid being willing to oblige her lover, who ſhe found was ſo deſirous to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035716_0003_100654780D39F0C8"/>oblige her on all occaſions, ventured to take up one to ſave the longing of her ſweet-heart, who, being very well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſuch a nice enterta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He had no ſooner thus diſpatched his ſweet-heart's firſt courteſy; but he began to be very importunate with her for the ſecond telling her an excuſe was as eaſily made for both as for one; and that ſhe had as good be h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

When, if you had known him, you might have eaſily diſcovered by his countenance, he is in one of his old frieks." "Why, what's the matter with him?" ſays the country farmer, "he was wondrous civil to me in the church yard, and by
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035716_0004_10065479950C7D20"/>all means would bring me home to dine with him." "Alas! good Sir," replied the maid, whatever you do, let me adviſe you to make the beſt of your way out of the houſe, for if you ſtay, now he is in one of his frenzical humours, he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly geld you, and I dare ſay he is whetting his knife for the ſame purpoſe, he has ſerved too or three ſo already, though they have had diſcretion to keep it ſilent becauſe they would not be laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at."

"Zouns," ſays the prieſt, "I am reſolved the impudent rogue ſhall not cozen me of my dinner ſo;" and away run the parſon after the countryman, who by this time, had gotten near a fields length off from him; but however, having preached himſelf very hungry, he trotted away after him with his naked knife in his hand, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, "Give me you brazen rogue, what you have run away with in your breeches;" the fellow anſwering as he ran, Efaith, doctor not I, I would rather ſee you hang'd firſt."

               <p>A Turkey merchant travelling on the road about 20 miles from London, happened to be overtaken by bad weather a little before night, and having no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a tavern to have recourſe to for ſhelter, being a man of figure, he reſolved to beg admittance at the firſt houſe he came to, to avoid the ſeverity of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing ſtorm; he had not gallopped on a furlong further, but he came to a pretty neat box, which ſtood by the high way ſide, where he beheld a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful lady looking out of a window upon which he rode up to the door, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf to the lady at the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment humbly begged her to take pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diſtreſſed traveller, and that ſhe would be ſo kind as to give him a recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till the violance of the ſtorm was blown
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035716_0006_1006547E19BCDE00"/>over, or abated; the compaſſionate lady diſcerning him to be a gentleman, ſoon granted his requeſt, and ordered her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to admit her weather-beaten ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant, and to take care of his horſe; he had no ſooner taken ſanctuary in his little paradiſe, as he thought it, but a rouſing fire was kindled in the parlour, and a cap, nightgown, ſhirt, ſlippers, and all conveniences were brought him for ſhiftng off his wet apparrel, and putting himſelf into a more comfortable condition.</p>
               <p>When he had thus refreſhed his body with a good fire, and a dry garment, he preſented his ſervice to the lady by her waiting maid, and humbly craved leave to pay his reſpects to the lady, and that ſhe would honour him with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of returning her thanks for the great and charitable obligation ſhe had conferred upon him. No ſooner was the meſſage delivered, but the generous lady very readily bleſſed him with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: after he had attacked her ears with a whole volley of compliments and diſcharged himſelf at her entrance very much like a gentleman, ſhe called for a bottle of canary, and ordered a very agreeable cold entertainment to be

               <p>By this time the gentleman preſumed ſo far, as to aſk the lady if ſhe was married, who anſwered in the negative, further telling him, "That ſhe was obliged to a gentleman, who was her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar friend for her reſidence in that houſe who was gone a long journey into Scotland, and that ſhe did not expect him back this ſix weeks; and withal, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, ſince the weather proved ſo bad, he ſhould be very welcome to ſtay all night if it ſuited with his conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency." The gentleman being a jolly juvenile ſpark, and very amorouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, had no power to refuſe ſo kind an invitation from ſo fair a lady, but made a facetious acknowledgment of her favour, and thankfully accepted of her obliging proffer; and to prevent any miſtruſt that, upon more mature deliberation, ſhe might have of his being ſome deſigning perſon, he plucks a letter out of his pocket, directed to him at his houſe in London, from Sir R. J—, a juſtice of peace in the city, which had been ſent him about three days before by the penny poſt, the lady
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035716_0007_1006547FF3E1B530"/>read it over with abundance of attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making him a compliment when ſhe had done, viz, "That there needed nothing further than his appearance to prove him a gentlemen."</p>
               <p>The merchant, as he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, believing her to be a lady in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing began to take heart of grace, and to treat her after ſuch an amorous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that was ſufficient to let her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand he expected, as certainly as he lay there that night, that ſhe ſhould be his bed-fellow; ſo that when ſupper was over, having prepared her with a few melting kiſſes, and other ſoſtening preliminaries, he took the freedom to make her ſenſible of the unexpreſſible happineſs he had the hopes of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to which ſhe ſeemed neither very averſe, nor vet over forward, but cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſignified, after a bifarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe wanted ſome further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement than barely love and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring her to a compliance; upon which, the merchant being an intelligent man ſoon diſcovered her meaning, and being clevated by her charms and dalliance to the higheſt pitch of deſire, told her that he had no
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035716_0007_1006547FF3E1B530"/>preſent about him worthy of her accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but if at any time, when ſhe came to London, ſhe would give herſelf the trouble to ſend for him to any ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, he would be extremely glad to wait on her, and that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her with fifty guineas to buy her a diamond ring, if ſhe would do him the honour to wear it for his ſake. She ſeemingly took but ſlight notice of his generous offer; but however began to ſhift off her former coyneſs, and liplead him into a pretty good aſſurance that he had gained the point, and at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended ſo far as to promiſe him her ſavours, which was no ſooner done, but a convenient bed of reſignation was ordered to be ſheeted next to her own chamber, whither he could have an eaſy recourſe at midnight without the notice eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her ſervants.</p>
               <p>When all things were in readineſs, the merchant haſted to his pillow, thinking every minute an age till the buſineſs was conſummated; when all things were huſh the ſervants gone to bed, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity proved ſeaſonable, the lady was as good as her word, and nothing but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035716_0008_100654840F0D8FB8"/>Sallengers Round was reciprocally danced till both parties were rather tired than ſatisfied. About day break, the lady bade him good morrow and returned to her own bed, leaving her wearied lover to refreſh himſelf with a little ſleep after his hard night's Journey, when three or four hours repoſe had enabled him to riſe, up he got, and recovering his loſs of ſpirits with a plentiful cup of mulled Canary he returned the lady abundance of thanks for her compaſſionate favours, diſcharged himſelf handſomly of the ſervants and ſo proceeded on his Journey.</p>
               <p>About a month after the lady came to town? and according to her lover's directions, made bold to ſend for him to a certain tavern no great diſtance from his own houſe; but the gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting what an extravagant promiſe he had made the lady in requital of her favours, thought it the wiſeſt way to neglect going; accordingly ſent back word, "That he was very buſy, and could not poſſibly wait on her;" which provoking ſlight, after the pretence of ſo much kindneſs, juſtly kindled in the lady, ſuch a revengeful indignation, that her nimble wits had ſoon formed a

               <p>Accordingly ſhe takes coach, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the coachman to drive her to Sir Robert J—, a known Juſtice of Peace, and the very gentleman who ſent the letter to the merchant which he had ſhewn to the lady; Sir Robert being at home and at leiſure ſhe was ſoon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to acquaint the juſtice with her buſineſs, who told him that ſhe had a great complaint againſt his friend Mr. Hazard. The juſtice ſeemed much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized that ſo pretty a lady ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as an enemy againſt his friend, whom he thought to be a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted reputation, and deſired to know what ſhe had to charge him with, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the injured lady laid open her grievances thus, "Your friend Mr. Hazard, the merchant, not long ſince took of me a very pleaſant little tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he was to occupy without any let, hindrance, or moleſtation, for a certain term agreed on between both parties, in conſideration of the ſum of fifty guine as, which he was to pay me on demand; and after; he had enjoyed

Madam," replied the Juſtice. "I am very ſorry to hear theſe things of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who is my friend, and a perſon, that has always enjoyed ſo fair a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; but however, madam, theſe are matters that come within the cognizance of the common law, ſo that they are not properly within my ſphere to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with, but this ſervice I can do you: if you pleaſe, madam, I will ſend for him, and if, upon hearing both ſides, I find he has done you wrong I will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him all that I can to do you juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The lady approved of this propoſal, and thanked him for his civility, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir Robert diſpatched his footman with a meſſage to Mr. Hazard, which brought him preſently before his fair accufer. who repeated over her former complaint before the face of the offender; the merchant at firſt was much ſurpriſed to find himſelf ſent for upon this occaſion, till perceiving the lady had ſo wittily couched her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation under ſuch a modeſt allegory
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035716_0009_10065485ACFD70D8"/>and then he thought it beſt to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the charge, leſt by denying it, he ſhould provoke the lady to give the juſtice a full explanation of her mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his open ſhame and diſhonor, ſo that he confeſſed he had taken a tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her upon ſuch a conſideration as was alledged. "But Madam," ſays he, "you know there was a deep well belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this tenement, which wanted a pump, whithout which you are ſenſible the tenement would have been of no uſe to me; therefore ſince I was at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of putting up ſuch a conveniency, I think it is but juſtice you ſhould make a reaſonable abatement, "But Sir," replied the lady, "you muſt conſider, when you quitted the poſſeſſion, that you took the pump along with you; had you left the pump ſtanding that I could have had the uſe of it when I had ſeen occaſion, I ſhould now be very willing to allow any deduction; but ſince you put up the pump for your own pleaſure, and carried it away with you when you left the tenement. I think it but reaſon I ſhould have my full money." "Well Madam," replies the gentleman, "be

The lady punctually promiſed "it ſhould never be the worſe of her wearing." So taking leave of Sir Robert, he waited upon the lady to the next tavern, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to lend her the pump, and pay her the money.</p>

               <head>Thirty thouſand Pounds bid for a Pair of Band Strings; or the two Precious Stones preſented to a rich Widow.</head>
               <p>A RICH old alderman of the city of London that dealt in the interloping trade to the Eaſt-ladies, having a pretty young gentleman to his nephew, who had been bred under him; and being willing to give him an opportunity of raiſing his fortune, ſent him abroad as a ſupercargo, and withal gave him a thouſand pounds to improve himſelf with the beſt directions he could how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it to advantage: but the young gentleman, it being his firſt voyage, met
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035716_0010_10065487D41E6018"/>with ſuch unexpected loſſes and croſſes abroad, that he at laſt was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home very unfortunate, and was ſo far from having added to his uncle's benevolence, that he had quite em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzled, not only his own ſtock, but his uncle's cargo; however, making it appear to the old gentleman, it was more owing to misfortune than extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance: he was very kind and fatherly to his kinſman, notwithſtanding his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; and having a young briſk widow lady, to whom he was a caſhier, and for whom he ſometimes traded, that uſed often to dine with him, he reſolved by a ſtratagem, to try if he could not recommend his nephew as a perſon worthy of her affections, and as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman proper to become her huſband.</p>
               <p>Accordingly to put his project in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he provided himſelf with a ſtout horſewhip, which he conveyed privately under his cloak, and when thus armed for his deſign, he deſired his nephew's company to the tavern, in order to take part of a ſmall collation. The young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who was always very fond to obey his uncle, ſhewed himſef ready in an inſtant to anſwer his requeſt; and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035716_0011_1006548972DEE748"/>away trooped the old fox to the next tavern, with the unfortunate cub after him.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner entered, but the uncle deſired a private room above ſtairs, a quart of claret, and tobacco, ordering the drawer not to ſuffer any body to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb them for half an hour, for that they had ſome particular buſineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that would require at leaſt that time to be diſpatched in.</p>
               <p>When all things were performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order, and the door ſhut, the old gentleman commanded his nephew to ſtrip to the ſhirt, that he might ſee what linen he wore, for he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed he was grown ſuch a naſty louſy ſloven, that no body would venture to lie with him. The young gentleman mightily ſurpriſed at his uncle's requeſt, could not imagine what to think of it; at laſt conſidering ſome body or other, through prejudice, might report ſuch a malicious ſtory, he reſolved to give his uncle the ſatisfaction he required, and accordingly pulled off his coat and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035716_0011_1006548972DEE748"/>that in every particular the report was ſcandalouſly falſe.</p>
               <p>When he was thus ſtripped to his ſhirt the cunning old ſly boots, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effects his ends puts on his ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, and fell to peeping about his wriſt-bands and collar, as if, in good earneſt, he had been looking for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, "Come, Sirrah," ſays he, "now down with your breeches, let me look in the waſteband, for that's the moſt likely harbour to find ſuch cattle in." "Lord, Sir," ſays the young gentleman, "you command me now beyond modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty." "I tell you, Sirrah," replies the uncle, "I will ſee what condition you are in, and therefore do as I bid you, or it ſhall be more out of your way than your head is worth." The nephew know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his uncle to be a man of better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals than to have any brutal deſign upon him, for fear of diſobliging him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to his further requeſt, which he had no ſooner done but the old cuff fell to peeping in the ſeams and gathers, as earneſtly as if he had no other drift, than to ſee if he was louſy; but of a ſudden, as he was thus ſearching pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly for the creepers, up he ſtarts, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035716_0012_1006548D925377A0"/>before the other could pluck up his breeches, he lugs out his horſe-whip, ſeemingly in a paſſion: "Sirrah," ſays he, "your breeches hang, I have heard you whored away your money in Spain and Italy, and that you are returned home with ſuch damnable pox, that the teſtimonies of your manhood are ſwelled as big, Sirrah, as a couple of Norfolk dumplings, and I am reſolved, before you ſtir, to know the truth of the matters; therefore lug out your Young Smock Smelling Plugtail, that I may ſee your condition, or I will jirk your buttocks with this inſtrument of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, till I make your teeth chatter in your cod-piece." The young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man believing from his uncle's paſſion, he had really heard what he told him, between fear and anger, gave the old gentleman the liberty of beholding the premiſes, that his own eyes might bear witneſs of the falſehood of theſe baſe aſperſions.</p>
               <p>When the uncle beheld all, according to his judgment, in a ſound condition, "Now nephew," ſays he, "I have a mind to make a bargain with you, what ſhall I give you for thoſe pair of band ſtrings

"I will give thee," replies the uncle twenty thouſand pounds for them, and that's more than they are worth, by conſiderable," "Bleſs me Sir," replies the nephew, "I would not part with them for forty." "Thou extravagant Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin," cries the old dad, "I will give thee thirty thouſand for them, and if you will not take that, you may keep them." "In truth, Sir." returns the young one. "not I, I would not part with them for the univerſe." "Then thou mayeſt e'en dreſs thyſelf," ſays the old Chap, "and button up your ware, for I ſhall not be your purchaſer." "Pray Sir," ſays the nephew, "now your heat's over, what is you meaning for all this? I am perfectly amazed at the oddneſs of your fancy." "Hold your tongue, boy," cries old cruſty, "and ſit down to thy bottle and thy pipe; when thou haſt that in thy bed, that I have in my head, you will rightly underſtand my meaning." He then proceeded to aſk his nephew what ready money he had at his command, who told him," About
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035716_0013_1006548F391791F0"/>fifty guineas, and that was all he had in the world:" "That's not ſufficient," ſays the old gentleman, "there's a bank bill for two hundred pounds more; be ſure you take care to get yourſelf in good equipage, and take a couple of Blacks from on board, and put them into good liveries, and be ready to dine with me this day ſe'nnight." Having thus delivered his inſtructions, they drank off their bottle, and ſo parted till the time prefixed.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home above half an hour, but who ſhould ſtep in to ſup with him, but the buxom widow, who being very merry and jocund at table, gave to the old alderman a ſeaſonable opportunity to put her in mind of matrimony, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how ſo pretty a lady, and ſo good a fortune, could ſpend ſo much of her youth and beauty without the conſolation of a good huſband; and withal began to ſpeak much in the praiſe of a jolly young nephew of his, who was lately come from the Eaſt Indies and had made ſo proſperous a voyage, that amongſt the reſt of his effects, he had brought over a couple of ſuch precious

               <p>Upon this encouragement the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told her, "He had engaged his nephew to dine with him on that day ſen'night, and if ſhe would be pleaſed to honour them with their company, he ſhould think himſelf greatly obliged to her."

The lady, by that time dinner was over, could not forbear ſignifying by her eyes her approbation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: ſo that by the old gentleman's management, and his inſtructions to his nephew, the matter was ſettled in leſs than a fortnight, and the wedding kept, though with ſome privacy, at the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's own houſe; where they had not bedded above two or three nights, but the bride expecting the coſtly preſent of thoſe precious ſtones the alderman had told her of, took an opportunity one night, when ſhe was faſt locked in the embraces of her bed-fellow, to aſk him what was become of thoſe delicate rich ſtones he had brought over with him from beyond ſea? "My dear, replied the bridegroom, here they are at your ſervice; upon my word theſe are the individual jewels my uncle bid me thirty thouſand pounds for, but I would not part with them: and upon my word,

"Well, my dear, ſays ſhe ſince it is as it is, I am ſo far from repenting my bargain, that now you have preſented them to me, I aſſure you, I accept them ſo kindly, and like them ſo well, that all the money in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhall not purchaſe them."

               <p>A GENTLEMAN who lived at Greenwich, having buſineſs at London, and being a lover of ſauſages, coming by a wiſe's houſe who was eminent for making them, he furniſhed himſelf with a couple of pounds in a ſheet of brown paper, which he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry home for his own eating. When he had diſpatched the affair that called him to town, he returned to Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Stairs, in order to take boat for Greenwich. When he came to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide, finding he had the advantage of the tide, being a man of no prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, he contented himſelf with a ſkuller.

By and by they happened to overtake a huge dead maſtiff floating upon the water with his ſkin off, and his fleſh rendered by putrifaction, of as many colours at the rainbow. The waterman looking earneſtly upon the ſtinking carrion, ſhook his head, and ſcratched his ears, and ſhewed all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable ſigns of his great uneaſineſs; which the fare obſerving, could do no leſs than take notice of, and aſking him, "If that dog had ever been his, that he ſeemed ſo much concerned at the ſight of him." The waterman anſwered him, "No, but he could wiſh he was his now. and that he would willingly excuſe him his fare, if he would be ſo kind as to let him go back, to take him up in the ſtern of his boat." "Z—ds," ſays the gentleman, "he will ſtink ſo confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,

"Ah! maſter, if I had but him in my boat, I would deſire no other fare to day; if my wife had him but at home, he would be worth, at leaſt, half a piece to us." "Prithee friend," ſays the gentleman, "be ſo kind as to let me know what uſe thou ſhould put him to; I have a great deſire to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied." The waterman ſeemed back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward telling him, "It was a ſecret, and if it ſhould be publicly known, it would be the ruin of his family." The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman grew ſtill the more importunate to have his curioſity ſatisfied, giving ſuch aſſurances of his ſecrecy in the matter, that in ſhort the waterman told him, "His wife made ſauſages, and that he had lately found by experience, that dog's fleſh, which had been ſodden about a month in the river, after it was well cleanſed with ſalt and water, put in amongſt her pork, made the tendereſt and beſt ſauſages in the world; and that his wife, ſince her diſcovery of this ſecret, had got ſuch a reputation in what ſhe pretended to, that ſhe ſerved moſt

               <p>The naſtineſs of this ſtory put the gentleman into ſuch a hawking and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting condition, as if he had been in a ſalivation; that when he came to his landing place, he very fairly walks out of the boat, and leaves the ſauſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him: The waterman lets him paſs on a little way, and then taking them up in his hand, calls after him, "Sir, ſir, you have left your ſauſages behind you." "Ay, ay, replies the gentleman, I know it well enough, thou may'ſt even take them, and a pox take thee; the plague take thy wife, and the devil take the dog for I ſhall never eat ſauſages more for fear they ſhould be of your wife's making."

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035716_0019_1006549D9406C138"/>called the Sparrow's Neſt, bound directly to Jamaica, where we lay in harbour about ſix weeks before we got her freighted. From thence we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned back to a merchant in London; and the day before we ſailed, we took on board an old woman, as a paſſenger, who for many years had kept a bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in Port-Royal, till ſhe had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully acquired by the induſtry of the tail, the value of 2000 <abbr>

                  </abbr> which ſhe had changed into Spaniſh gold, and had brought it on board with her in a ſmall eſcritoir, being very deſirous of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her latter days in England, that when ſhe died might lay her bones to reſt in her own country, we weighed anchor, with the wind at weſt and by ſouth, getting clear of the land without any difficulty; and ſcudded merrily on till we made Cuba, the Iſle of Pines, the Cape Florida, and ſo entered the gulph: But before we got through, (as ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would have it) a plank happened to ſtart, and we ſprung a leak ſo faſt, that, notwithſtanding our pumps, we had four feet water in the hold in leſs than an hour's time, ſo that we had no hopes left of ſaving ourſelves, but by
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035716_0019_1006549D9406C138"/>betaking ourſelves to the boat, which accordingly we did; taking int he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and ſuch biſcuit and freſh water as we could venture to carry along with us. The old woman begged hard that we would take in her box of money, which, on ſecond thoughts, we yielded to, not knowing how uſeful it might prove to us, if we ſhould chance to be driven on ſhore amongſt the Florida In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. We were in all but eight hands beſides the old woman, who was as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent for all her paſt crimes, as an old thief going to the gallows. Thus, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the rage of the mercileſs ocean, we depended wholly upon providence to protect us; rowing by turns, keeping on our right courſe, by the direction of our compaſs, having nothing but the dread of deſtruction before our eyes, unleſs by ſome unexpected miracle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The remainder of the day we ſpent in labour at our oars, till at laſt night drew on, having neither ſhip nor ſhore in ſight from whence to expect ſafety; but fortune favouring us with little wind and a calm, ſea, we thought it neceſſary to take ſo ſair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035716_0020_100654A03786A150"/>to refreſh our bodies with a little reſt, that we might be the better able to ſtrive againſt the hardſhips of tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weather if it ſhould happen. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we drew cuts who ſhould ſet at the helm, and look out for a ſail, or awake the reſt, if any danger ſhould ariſe, and who ſhould the lot fall upon but myſelf: A greeably I took my poſt, while the reſt endeavoured to compoſe themſelves to ſleep; who being much tired with the day's fatigue, fell all to ſnoring in a very little time: they had not long got the ſtart of me, but I grew ſo very drowſy that I could not forbear nodding, and at laſt dropped into as ſound a ſleep as any of them; ſo that death had now an advantage to have catched us napping.</p>
               <p>How many hours we continued in this ſilence, I cannot tell; at laſt one awakes, and finds it ſo very dark, that he could neither ſee moon, ſtar, ſky or boat; nor could he perceive the boat had any motion as was uſual; with that he alarms the reſt, who began to rub their eyes, and endeavoured to look about them, but could not ſo much as ſee their hands, "Bleſs me, ſaid, I, it is
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035716_0020_100654A03786A150"/>a dark long night, I believe we ſhall never ſee day again." Another takes his oar, and claps it over-board, "W—ds, faid he, we are caſt aſhore in ſome creek, where the tide has left us; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil a drop of water is there about the boat." "For God's ſake, ſays the old woman, ſet me on ſhore, and give me my box; I care not where I am, if it be but upon dry land." "Prithee, ſaid I, ſtrike a light that we may ſee who and who's together." Which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done, upon which we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pent up in a little place, but where we could not think nor imagine. The old woman ſeeing no water about her, was over haſty to get upon dry land, as ſhe thought, and ſcrambled over the gunnel of the boat? at which interim one of the ſailors, being a little more circumſpect than ordinary, happened to eſpy the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of ſome creature or other hanging over his head. "Z—ds, ſays he we are got into a butchers ſhambles, I think, for here is a delicate pluck hangs: we have had no freſh proviſions for a good while, by my lord and my lady, I'll have a good ſlice of the liver." He then drew out his knife, and cut off about two pounds, upon

At laſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round us we eſpied a monſtrous whale which occaſioned us to think he had gorged us in our ſleep, and was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the wound in his liver, to throw us up again. But as fortune would have it we brought the money along with us and left the old bawd behind, for the whale to ſpue up at another opportunity.</p>

               <p>A YOUNG Gentleman of Hackney, known by the name of 'ſquire Suck-bottle, made it his endeavour to procure a match with Sir Thomas Cloſepurſe's daughter. In a little time he made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable progreſs in his deſign, and had
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035716_0021_100654A1C5F11288"/>gained both the affections and conſent of the young lady before he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed any treaty with her father, who hearing of the intrigue between Suck-bottle and his daughter, was ſo highly enraged at his clandeſtine proceedings, that he forewarned him from his houſe, and as a more ſecure prevention from the match, confined his daughter cloſe priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in her own apartment. The young 'ſquire being deeply concerned at the ſevere uſage of a Roman lover, went by midnight when all things were huſh and ſilent, to Cloſepuſe's habitation where by the aſſiſtance of a friend, he raiſed a ladder, and mounted himſelf upon the leads of the houſe and knowing her lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, dropped a letter down the chimney, to give her notice he would make her a viſit the next night the ſame way him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which letter in the morning the lady found with unexpreſſible ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>According to the time prefixed, the 'ſquire, with the aſſiſtance of two truſty friends, went in order to accompliſh his intrigue. The engine he had prepared to ſhoot the chimney being a rope and a baſket, by which means he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

Upon which Sir Thomas leaps up in a wonderful haſte, takes the key of his daughter's chamber out of his pocket, which he would not intruſt with any but himſelf, and gropes his way to the door. The lovers having done with their firſt courſe, and being laid down to take a little breath, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to hear the old gentleman ſumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the key-hole; upon which the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035716_0022_100654A399856AB0"/>daughter, through a great preſence of mind, ſkips nimbly out of the bed, ſets a chair between the bed and the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, kneels down, and with abundance of ſeeming fervency fell to prayers; and juſt as her father opened the door ſoftly, ſhe was in this part of her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "I beſeech thee make me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to my father's grey hairs, encreaſe his riches, advance him to honour, and may he live to the age of Mathuſalem." The old dad was ſo highly pleaſed with his daughter's piety and kind ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for her aged father, that he took no notice, and would by no means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb her, but gently ſhut the door and returned to his bedfellow, giving her a ſharp reproof for her evil opinion of their dutiful and godly child.</p>

His daughter being aptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent young woman behaved herſelf with duty and tenderneſs to her ſick father, that he could not endute to think of her marrying whilſt he lived; having buried his wife, and could have no body, as he thought, that would nurſe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him with ſuch diligence as his kind and obedient daughter: Who indeed, though a good humoured creature, was bleſt but with few external charms to render her inviting. An arch unlucky blade who was ſon to a neighbouring brewer, uſing to take delight in jeſting with the female ſex, pretended to court her, and made her believe he deſigned to make her his wife; carrying on the matter to ſo great a height, that the morning was appointed on which they were to be married at St. Pancras church, he promiſing to meet her at a certain hour in the church-yard, and to bring the ring and a licence along with him, the whole proceeding being without the knowledge of the father.</p>

She obliging him to keep it ſilent for a time, till ſhe ſhould take a ſeaſonable opportunity to pacify her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then, after a little time ſpent over a ſmall repaſt, they parted, The firſt news this married virgin heard when ſhe went home, was, that her uncle was dead in the country, who had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his own, and had left her 400 <abbr>l.</abbr> which the brewer's ſon hearing, came within two or three days to beg pardon; and to endeavour to excuſe the rudeneſs he had committed; ſhe ſeemingly forgave him, and appointed him a ſecond time to meet her at the ſame place, which on his ſide was then deſigned in good earneſt.

About eleven o'clock he ventures to open his cheſt, as far as an oyſter does his ſhell, to receive

               <head>Intrigue upon intrigue: Or, tha widow become mother to her gallant, and the younger brother father to the elder.</head>
               <p>A BRISK airy gentleman belonging to one ot the inns of courts, happened to make his courtſhip to a rich elderly widow, who had a pretty young girl to her daughter that thought herſelf as capable of matrimony as her mother; when the gentleman had repeated his viſits often enough to grow a little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; he found all the agreeable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements he could reaſonably expect from a perſon whoſe fortune was much ſuperior to his own. But the daughter looking upon her mother's humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with more than ordinary reſpect thought it abundance of pity ſo youthful
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035716_0029_100654B3D5F4A6B8"/>and ſo handſome a gentleman, for the ſake of a little money, ſhould bury his juvenile years in the grave of an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when herſelf would be very glad to cheriſh him in the embraces of a young one. The gentleman had not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his courtſhip, but he found ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſons to ſuſpect that he had not only worked himſelf into the widows love, but alſo into the affections of the daughter; and began to conſider, that the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was much the better fortune, yet the daughter would prove the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able match, and that what ſhe wanted in fortune would be ſupplied more to his ſatisfaction by her youth and beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, knowing her to be the only child, thought ſhe muſt come in at laſt for the effects of the mother, in caſe that he could but be ſubtile enough to divert her from matrimony. Upon theſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations he reſolved to alter his firſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and only for the future to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal courtſhip to the mother in order to procure more favourable opportunities of bringing his real deſign upon the daughter to its intended iſſue.</p>
               <p>The better to carry on this intrigue without the mother's ſuſpicion, he tho't
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035716_0030_100654B5605B91C0"/>it neceſſary to acquaint his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the buſineſs. that now and then when occaſion required he might prove an aſſiſtant in the matter.</p>
               <p>After this manner he proceeded with the old gentlewoman till he had ſtolen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable opportunities enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the daughter of his affections for her and to aſſure her that he only pretended courtſhip to her mother on purpoſe to now and then enjoy a lucky moment of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known the extraordinary paſſion he truly had for herſelf. The younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was a notable ſharp witted Gentleman and a very, perſonable man, reflecting one morning in his bed, upon the foul practice of his brother to gain his ends by diſappointing and deceiving the old gentlewoman, began to think it could be no crime in himſelf to take the advantage of his brother's fallacy, and at once make his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and do juſtice the widow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hindering his brother from effecting his deſign upon the daughter.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he reſolved to act a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part, and to neglect no opportunity of ingratiating himſelf with the mother, that when ſhe became ſenſible of his
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035716_0030_100654B5605B91C0"/>brother's deceit, he might be ready to ſupply the diſappointment by the offer of his own ſervice; which he was in hopes, if rightly managed, would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The widow having great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the integrity of her ſham pretender, was mighty reſpectful to the young gentleman upon his brother's account, ſo that in a little time he was as familiar in the family, as the daughter's admirer, who all alone made his younger brother acquainted with every tittle of his proceedings.</p>
               <p>When the elder brother had worked the young lady up to a compliance, a licence was taken out, and the morning was appointed for the prieſt to ſay grace to that love banquet, which both long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for with an equal appetite. The younger brother was made privy to the happy hour, and engaged to attend the ſolemnity in the office of a father, which he performed accordingly when the time came, and ſmiled in his own ſleeve to ſee the matter conſumated; which was no ſooner over, but he made an excuſe to diſpatch a little buſineſs, promiſing to be with them again at dinner.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he got his liberty,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035716_0031_100654B752FE8898"/>but away he poſted in all haſte, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the old gentlewoman, "What a diſhonourable trick his brother had putupon her, and how undutiful her daughter had been in complying to be a partner in ſo baſe and treacherous an intrigue." The widow, who had never ſo much as ſuſpected the integrity of her gallant, was ſo amazed and ſo confuſed at the ſtrange tidings, that for a little time ſhe was as ſtark mad as a raving bed lamite, till her paſſion was pretty well ſpent, and then the young gentleman, to ſpur on her revenge, told her, "That his brother's further deſign was to divert her if poſſible, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in hopes that her own fortune, upon her death, might deſcend to her daughter, ſo that he ſhould become at laſt maſter of all her riches, as well as the fortune already ſettled upon her daughter, and that this was the main conſideration that induced him to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her daughter after ſo many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to herſelf." This ſubtle inſinuation ſo inflamed her malice, that ſhe vowed, rather than they ſhould be one ſhilling the better for what ſhe had, ſhe would marry a cobler, or any rake hall, that
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035716_0031_100654B752FE8898"/>ſhe was ſure would ſpend it every groat." To which replied the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, "Madam, a perſon of your worth, comelineſs and diſcretion, can never have occaſion to diſpoſe of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to either a mean man or a ſpend thrift, could you conceive me to be a perſon worthy of ſo great a happineſs as ſo good a wife, I ſhould think it a bleſſing to myſelf and family, that you would give it into my power, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the injury and diſhonour which my brother has done you; and I aſſure you further, madam, that if you make me your huſband, it will prove a revenge upon him, a bleſſing to me and I promiſe you, I will do ail that in an honeſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman lies to make it a happineſs to yourſelf." "Well ſays the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, leſt time and delay ſhould make you prove as great a knave as your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will ſeek out for no other huſband nor need any further courtſhip; but in the revengeful mood I am now in, I will run this minute, headlong to be married."</p>
               <p>The young gentleman expreſſed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt joy for her ſudden reſolution, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ordered a coach to be called
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035716_0032_100654BA34DC4D88"/>and away they went firſt to make out a licence, and then to be married the very ſame morning, and at the ſame church, and by the ſame miniſter who had joined the former couple. As ſoon as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was over, the young bridegroom, by the conſent of his bride, ordered the coachman to drive to the ſame tavern where the treacherous pair had provided their wedding dinner, and in they popped upon them juſt as the firſt diſh was brought upon the table; the daughter was ready to faint thro' fear, the bridegroom bit his nails through madneſs; the mother up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided the quondum lover with baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, her daughter with undutifulneſs; the elder brother taxed the younger with treachery, whilſt the greateſt win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſmiled in his ſleeve, to think that at one lucky hit he had made his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>When their paſſions, as well as their victuals, were grown pretty cool, the youngeſt bridgroom, who was a man of eloquence, made a pleaſant ſpeech that unriddled the whole myſtery, and went ſo far in the reconciliation of all differences, that they ſat down to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035716_0032_100654BA34DC4D88"/>victuals, and made one dinner ſerve for both weddings: The elder brother at laſt ſubmitting to call the younger father, and the mother acknowledged the elder to be her ſon. So that by the help of mirth and wine they became all friends: and each lived comfortably for the future, with their own proper mates: and in proceſs of time hammered out ſuch a promiſcuous progeny that would puzzle the herald's office properly to diſtinguiſh what relation they were to one another.</p>

               <p>A FARMER's wife falling danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ill, was very importunate with her huſband, that he would grant her the liberty of making a will to diſpoſe of her wearing apparrel.

She thanked him heartily for this laſt kindneſs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035716_0033_100654BD21053388"/>how good a man he had always been to her and hoped he would ever proſper when ſhe was under ground, for his love and tender uſage, both to her and her children, and ſo begged him to fetch pen, ink, and paper, and ſhe would give him inſtructions. Away went the good man, at his wife's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, to muſter up the materials; but before he returned had the wit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it was a hard caſe, that her clothes, which were very neat and good, ſhould be given to a parcel of goſſips, away from her own children; and withal formed a project, as he thought, ſo to deceive his wife, that ſhe might die in peace, and yet ſave her apparel from the thankleſs hands of a parcel of tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling tittle tattles. When he had thus prepared himſelf, he returns with the ſcribbling inſtruments to his wife's bed ſide, deſiring her freely to impart her mind, promiſing that all things ſhould be perfor med accordingly; upon which ſhe began her inſtructions after the following manner, <hi>viz.</hi> "In the firſt place, give unto my beloved friend and neighbour, goody Blowzen, my high crowned hat, and beſt red petticoat,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035716_0033_100654BD21053388"/>for ſhe has been always ready to go and come upon all occaſions both to me and mine. The good man, inſtead of mentioning the benefit, writes, <hi>Tittle tattle for that;</hi> and then deſired his wife to proceed. "In the next place, ſays ſhe, I give and bequeath to my gammer Dowdy, my wedding gown and ſmock, for ſhe is a merry dame, and has made us all laugh many a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket." The good man writes, <hi>Tittle tattle for that;</hi> and then defires the next item," Laſtly, ſays ſhe, I give and bequeath my great claſped Bible, and my Whole Duty of Man to my dame Camwell, for ſhe is a religious woman, of whom I have learned more good over a jug of ſtrong beer, than ever I did of the parſon, for all the tithes we have given him; and that is all, I deſire to diſpoſe of from you. "Very well," replies the good man, and again, inſtead of the laſt item, ſets down a <hi>Tittle tattle for that.</hi> Well, wife, ſays he, now all things are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to your mind, I hope, you will die ſatisfied." "Yes yes, ſays ſhe, I thank you, my dear and

Pray, ſtick the will up in the window, and then you may go and fother the cattle." The good man, according to his wife's direction, left the paper in the window; and after he had given her a comfortable word or two, away he went about his buſineſs. No ſooner was his back turned, but in came one of her goſſiping legatees, to pay her a viſit; who entering the chamber, thus accoſted the ſick woman, <hi>viz.</hi> "How d'ye now, Neighbour? I hope, by the grace of God, you find yourſelf on the mending hand." "No, truly. Dame, anſwers the dying gammer, I am not a woman of this world; I find, by the weakneſs of my lungs and the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſpeech, I have but a ſhort time to tarry among you. But however, as you have been a good friend and neighbour, I have left you ſomething to remember me when I am gone. My huſband, whom you know has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a kind and a loving man to me, has given me leave to diſpoſe of my wearing clothes among you, and has writ my will with his owe hand: yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>With that gammer Dowdy opens the unlucky teſtament, and diſcovers the waggery "Alas!"

Pray, neighbour, leave me a little to myſelf, for I expect my huſband in every minute; and I have ſomething to ſay to him, that is not proper for any body to hear." So the goſſip ſhed a tear or two at parting, and, according to the others requeſt, took her leave for the preſent. By and by in comes the good man, and hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling up to the ſick wife's chamber, aſked her how ſhe did? who anſwered, as if ſhe was juſt expiring, "O very bad; not a woman for this world: and therefore ſhe had two or three dying

               <p>A Jolly Criſpin having a confounded ſcold to his wife, happened to come home one night, at a late hour very much troubled with a drunken vertigo in his noddle. He had no ſooner enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhop, but his angry help-mate, in a mighty paſſion for his offence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpit out ſuch provoking meſſes of maundering broth, in the very teeth of her pot valiant ſpouſe, that he ſwore,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035716_0036_100654C3AA35B5B8"/>"Since he could not be quiet at home, he would return from whence he came, and ſpend the reſt of the night, where he could be more eaſy." She ſtill perſiſted in her termagent ſpirit, and very ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating words were toſſed backwards and forwards, till at laſt the difference grew too great for any preſent recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. A chimney ſweeper coming by, who had pawned his brooms for an evenings draught, over-hearing their courſe compliments, ſtood a little under the eves to liſten to the fray. The ſhoe-maker at laſt grew ſo highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that he ſwore he would go out again: and wrenched open the door in ſpite of his wife's reſiſtance, out he went, and away he ſtaggered, ſhe baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after him in theſe words viz. "Go, and be hang'd, you rogue, ſince you will go, and may the devil go with you." The chimney ſweeper, when he heard the door open ſkuttled away a little before the ſhoe-maker, and ſtepped up into an alley till Criſpin was gone paſt him; then flinging his ſooty ſack which he had upon his ſhoulder over his head like a hood that he might make the more unuſual figure, he
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035716_0036_100654C3AA35B5B8"/>trudged after the ſhoe-maker, till he got juſt upon the heels of him. Criſpin hearing ſomebody come ratteling after, faced about, and by the light of the ſtars diſcovered a ſtrange black monſter juſt at his very noſe. "Who are you?" ſays the ſhoe-maker. "The devil. cries the chimney ſweeper, "Pray, Mr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſays Criſpin, what want you with me?" "Your wife ſent me after you, cries the chimney ſweeper, to fetch you home?" "Home, cries Criſpin, Pray Mr. Devil, to which home; your home or my home?" To your home anſwers the chimney ſweeper. "Then by all the ſhoes in my ſhop ſays Criſpin, I will not go, except you will firſt carry my wife to your home, and then I'll go home preſently." "Done ſays the chimney ſweeper, ſtay you here till I return, and I'll pack her off for you inſtantly." "Done cries the ſhoe-maker, do you perform your work, and I'll perform my word." Away runs the chimney ſweeper to the ſhoe-maker's houſe in St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, knocks at the door, to which comes the wife in her ſmock, expecting it was her huſband: The chimney ſweeper, for fear of frightning her, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035716_0037_10063C068F5B6580"/>diſcovers himſelf, and tells her what a trick he had put upon her huſband, and upon what errand her ſpouſe had ſent him; and that if ſhe would but firſt let him make him a cuckold, he would engage to make him a good huſband forever after. Upon this condition the wife conſented; and the buſineſs being done with a jirk, he gave her directions how ſhe ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the matter, and returned again to ſhoemaker, who waited with great impatience to hear the ſucceſs. "Well, ſays Criſpin to the devil, as he thought, have you done the buſineſs?" "Ay, ay, ſays the chimney ſweeper, effectually, therefore make haſte home, for I forgot to ſhut the door after me."

"Wounds, ſays the ſhoe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, good devil, keep her now thou haſt her, for if you let her come back again, I will certainly hang myſelf."

               <p>Upon theſe words out bolts his wife upon him from the cloſet, with her hair about her ears like a fury and her ſmock as black with the chimney ſweepers ſmuggling her, as if herſelf had been the devil crying out "You lie, you rogue, I defy the devil and all his works, I will make you know, Sirrah, there is never a devilin hell can maſter me, I am ſet on it; you may ſee by

               <head>The dead man's reſurrection; or the Judge buried alive in his own Cellar.</head>
               <p>ONE of the judges in king Charles the ſecond's reign, being in the long va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at his country houſe in Holſworth in Suffolk happened upon too ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on ſome little juvenal miſcarriages to fall into a deep fit of the hypocondria inſomuch that he fancied himſelf to be
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035716_0038_100654C904B8ADE0"/>dead, and was ſo very obſtinate under the influence of his whimſical diſtemper that he would not be perſuaded to ſtir hand or foot, or receive any manner of ſuſtenance, but what was forced down his throat by ſyringes, or ſuch like ſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agems, till he had brought his body into ſo low a condition, that had a lighted candle been in his belly, his ſides would have proved as a lanthorn; In this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born frenzy, he lay upon his back, ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out at his full length like a corps, and as motionleſs as a ſtone figure upon an old tomb, neither his phyſician nor his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily knowing what was to do with him. A famous High German doctor coming into the town, attended with a pack of fools and rope dancers, in order to pick the country people's pockets of a little money, hearing of ſo eminent a perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this unaccountable indiſpoſition took occaſion, the firſt time that he mounted the public theatre, to mention this matter to his country chubs, who were giving great attention to all the lies he could muſter up to his advantage telling them, "Their country phyſicians, were all fools and that the judge was only troubled with the mulligrubs, and that if his lady
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035716_0039_100654CBE006A778"/>would ſend for him, he would undertake to bring him to ſpeech, ſet him upon his legs, make him walk, talk, eat, drink, piſs ſhite, or do any thing in four and twenty hours time, or elſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing for his trouble." This large promiſe of the mountebank was ſoon communicated to the judge's lady who being a tender wife to her huſband, and willing to try every thing that might do him good, ſent immediately for the Dutch tooth-drawer, to conſult him about the matter; who told her poſitively, "He could ſoon cure him, if ſhe ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he ſhould have a hundred guineas reward provided he had leave without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, to do as he ſhould think fit." The lady aſſured him, "He ſhould have all the liberty he deſired to work the cure, and the reward he aſked when he had performed it." Both parties being agreed, the doctor ſent his man for a joiner and a coffin, as ſoon as the one had brought the other, up ſtairs they went, for the doctor would not ſee his patient before he had got his tools rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When every thing was in order, in goes the doctor and lady, the reſt tarried without, till called for.</p>

No ſooner had the doctor caſt an eye upon his ſullen patient, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cries out to the lady, "Lord, Madam what mean you to ſend for a phyſician to the dead man?
