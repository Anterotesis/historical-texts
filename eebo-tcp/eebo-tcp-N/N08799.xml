            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE the writing the following diſcourſe and prayer, the publiſher has been greatly ſolicited, by many of the auditors, for copies thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in purſuance to the repeated requeſts that has been made, the publiſher hath made uſe of the preſs to convey the ſame to the publick, with hopes it may be uſeful to ſome, and that no diſadvantage will enſue to any individual.</p>
            <p>The publiſhing of good books hath oftentimes been of great ſervice, nay, hath often been the means of kindling a holy fire in the hearts of the lukewarm.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected that the reading of the following diſcourſe will be attended with the ſame power, as at the time of delivery, except being touch'd by that power which cauſed them to flow forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:011241_0003_0F8678E7F5B2C3E0"/>
It is not the province of the editor to ſay much, or to multiply words, but hopes the enſuing diſcourſe and prayer may be read with a ſolid and ſober mind.</p>
            <p>It is the indiſpenſible duty of every one, to be careful how they handle the golden veſſels (holy words) of the Lord's houſe, and ſee that they prophane not the temple of God with unhallowed tongues.</p>
            <p>I therefore ſhall leave the iſſue to the all-wiſe diſpoſer of all good things.</p>
            <p>The publiſher having not ſeen the author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, ſince ſhe delivered it, the publick cannot expect to have her approbation for publiſhing the ſame; but he hath ſhewn it to many that were preſent at the time of delivery, and they are unanimous in their opinion it is the ſubſtance of what they heard.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Theſe words being much inſiſted on in the foregoing part of the diſcourſe, the editor hath thought proper to prefix the ſame.]</p>
            <p>IF I miſtake not, our dear Lord and Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, both he and his diſciples that were with him, were invited to a marriage that was to be in Cana of Galilee, which place he was graciouſly pleaſed to honour with his heavenly preſence; and even there manifeſted himſelf by his omnipotent and divine power, in a moſt wonderful and miraculous manner.</p>
            <p>Since my ſitting down here amongſt you in this meeting, the thoughts of it came into my mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſtudy or premeditation. I could not be ſilent, thinking it to be my duty, in obedience to the
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0005_0F8678E9459FB280"/>
divine will; for I deſired not the ſound of my voice to be heard, but would much rather hear than be heard; but apprehending it to be my duty, as that eminent apoſtle and ſervant of our Lord did, to whom a diſpenſation of the goſpel was committed; who ſaid, <hi>Woe be unto me if I preach not the goſpel!</hi> I heartily wiſh, and it is the earneſt deſire of my mind, that thoſe that are now concerned, may be ſolicitous; and O! that it may be the concern of every individual, that is here preſent, to invite this heavenly gueſt, that we all might be favoured with his heavenly preſence, and made to partake of his divine comforts. If we were thus ſolicitous and engaged in our minds, we might have great reaſon to expect his gracious preſence to be with us, as he our dear Lord hath promiſed, ſaying, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be, and bleſs them. Whereſoever two or three are gathered together in my name</hi> (that is, my power) <hi>there will I be in the midſt of them, and I will bleſs them.</hi> What wonderful condeſcenſion is this to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and people, to be ſo highly favoured with his heavenly preſence!</p>
            <p>In this he fulfils his promiſe which he hath made to his diſciples, as he expreſſes himſelf in another place, ſaying, <hi>I and my Father will come and ſup with them, and we will make our abode with them.</hi> O! bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0006_0F8678EA1D878E18"/>
and heavenly gueſt! O! that it may be the happy experience of the preſent parties here concerned, that they may be favoured with the heavenly manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine love, that they may witneſs his ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous power to viſit, preſerve, guide and direct them!</p>
            <p>We find that at the marriage in Cana there was to be a watch. <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> Here they were to watch for the divine command. O! that we may all be a watching, and have our eye to him that is both willing and able to help, and is ſtrength in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and riches in poverty; that we may adhere to his heavenly teaching, that is found of them that ſeek him, as he himſelf hath graciouſly promiſed, who ſaid, <hi>He that ſeeketh me ſhall find me, and he that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi> Here our bleſſed Lord ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his unſpeakable love to the ſons and daughters of men, to be thus ſo graciouſly viſited by the Lord of life and glory! O! that thou, O Lord may be invited! and O! that it may be the ſolicitation of every mind that is here met, and are anxious to hear what may be ſpoken; that, by and through thy inward appearance in their hearts, they may be brought to know and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thy divine will. This was the ſhort prayer of my ſpirit ſince my ſitting down among you. I heartily wiſh it was the concern of every one that is here. If it was the concern of us all, we ſhould have cauſe to
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0007_0F8678EB4C1093C8"/>
rejoice in our coming together; and it would do our ſouls good to be thus favoured by Divine Love, who is the Lord from Heaven, the Quickening Spirit, the God of Truth. O! may there be a true and zealous labouring and working to ſeek to him. O! may we be favoured with his heavenly company, that we may come to know him to be with us, and in the midſt of us; and have the happy experience to witneſs his power, and taſte of his bleſſing. By this experience we ſhall come to know his heavenly power to preſerve, and his divine inſtruction to teach us, who ſpeaks as never man ſpoke, who is the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Counſellor, the Mighty God, and Prince of Peace, the Everlaſting Father, and of the increaſe of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there ſhall never be an end.</p>
            <p>Now, what great advantage would this be to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, to know and witneſs this great power to rule and reign in them, whoſe right it is to rule and reign; and have the experience of his love and favour, who is the Mighty God, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; that He might take upon him the government and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in his ways.</p>
            <p>As we come under his government, and are obedient to his divine and heavenly inſtructions, we ſhall come to know his kingdom to be come, and his will to
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0008_0F8678EB8C178CF0"/>
be done in us as it is done in heaven; and have that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent prayer of our Lords anſwered; <hi>Thy Kingdom come; thy will be done on earth at it is done in heaven.</hi> O! what an excellent and heavenly experience it is to have the mind reſigned to the will of our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! to know the kingdom of God to be come in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy-Ghoſt? O! the heavenly rectitude of mind the people of God enjoy! what ſweet tranquility of mind do they poſſeſs, where the kingdom of God is come? where righteouſneſs and peace is known? and where the Lord Jeſus rules and reigns?</p>
            <p>It was obſerved before, that at the marriage which the Lord honoured with his preſence, they had a watch. The ſervants that attended, they were to watch and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the orders given them; which was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> And they waited for the divine command. Now, here was the advantage they had that were waiting upon our Lord: by their waiting and watching they came to know the Lord's will, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey His orders.</p>
            <p>We find that, at the marriage, there was a want of wine. What was the expreſſion to the ſervants that attended? It was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> And we may remember they were ordered to put wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0009_0F8678EC670935B8"/>
into the pots, which were not to be handed forth till he ordered: and they waited for the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Here, our Lord ſhewed his miraculous power. Here it it was our Bleſſed Lord made the water wine, and then ordered the ſervants that waited, to hand it forth Obſerve. The water was firſt made wine by a miraculous and divine power. It was then, and not before, the ſervants had to hand it to the company that was preſent. How gracious was our Lord, how great his power, in ſhewing forth this miracle? I could hot but admire his great love and wonderful condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mankind!</p>
            <p>Now, let us obſerve the expreſſion in the orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which was, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> And he directed the water that had been made wine, to be handed to the governor of the feaſt, that he might taſte it; and he taſted it, and thoſe that were at the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. What was then expreſſed? It was, <hi>The laſt wine is the beſt.</hi> O Friends, I cannot but admire the great love and condeſcenſion of our dear Lord, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his gifts to his children and people; how he manifeſted his power amongſt them; and how conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending he is to thoſe that are anxious to know the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being made wine, that the ſpirits of the contrite might be revived, and thoſe that are ready to faint might be refreſhed by the handing forth of divine love, which

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of his kingdom, prepared and given by him that is ſtrength in weakneſs and riches in poverty. Our own ſtrength, as men and creatures, is as water, be our Education ever ſo high, and our wiſdom but foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs. It is like water and not wine, be it ever ſo excellent, till taught of the Lord, by his inſpeaking word. The Lord he prepares it. It is his power alone, which is the ſame that ever it was, that thoſe who are truly concerned, come to know and witneſs a true and peaceable tranquility of mind. O that his company may be rightly and truly ſought after, that all thoſe that are here preſent, may be ſolicitous to hear his voice, that ſpeaketh as never man ſpoke; that every one may attend to his divine teaching and heavenly inſtruction; that they may taſte of the wine of his preparing, and when he orders his ſervants to hand it forth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may they have it to ſay (from a true and real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>the laſt wine is the beſt.</hi> This has been the concern of my ſpirit among you, that you may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his power to be with you, and in the midſt of you. It is his power only can do it. It is his power alone that can effect it.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes thought the lord is wonderfully manifeſting his power, even to the working of miracles. It is he that is the cauſe of the water being made wine, not thoſe that hand it forth. If he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0011_0F8678EDB47CFB30"/>
it, if he doth not make it, and if he doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it to be given, it is but water, and not wine, which cannot profit the people. It is not the quantity but the quality can ſatisfy thoſe that are ſeeking the Lord for divine help and ſtrength. This has been on my mind as I have been engaged amongſt you; and I think it was in ſome degree as a miracle.</p>
            <p>I do not want to monopolize other perſons places, or to take up the room of any other here. I could be more willing to hear than to ſpeak; but, methinks, when I feel of the water being made wine, I dare not but hand forth a little of the divine bleſſing, in order that the gueſts which have been here invited, may partake of the heavenly wine. The Lord he prepares it himſelf. He is inviting his children to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves with the wine of his kingdom. O, if people did but ſee, if their minds were rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and if there was but a true ſeeking to him, there would be a taſting of the wine of his preparing.</p>
            <p>O that the eve of the mind was but ſingle to him, and to his dear Son our Lord, in whom the Father is well pleaſed, who ſaid <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed!</hi> It is my ſincere deſire that there may be a hearkening to him, and a hearing of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly voice, that you may come to be acquainted
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0012_0F8678EE73D0F038"/>
with him, and obey his voice, that is the true Miniſter of the Sanctuary and Biſhop of his Church and People, whom God the Father ſends, is the earned prayer of my ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Now, if the eye were ſingle to him, and our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from him, and not from the arm of fleſh; we ſhould know the Lord Jeſus, who is all-powerful to be our redeemer. I ſay, if there was but a hearing of the voice of him, whom the prophet propheſied of, ſaying <hi>A prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up, like unto me. Him ſhall you bear in all things; and be that doth not bear him, ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi> If we did but hear and obey God, we ſhould come to know his power to be amongſt us. O that there may be a truſting in the Lord, and a dependance on his Spirit and Power to teach and inſtruct us, is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt concern of my mind. It is He that ſpeaketh truth and no lie, for he is a God of Truth.</p>
            <p>As we come to be diveſted of Self, as there is no leaning on our own underſtanding [<hi>Lean not to your own underſtanding, but truſt in the Lord</hi> (ſaid an eminent ſervant of God) <hi>truſt in the Lord, and he will help thee</hi>] not to lean on words, nor to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and parts of the creature, be them ever ſo high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; but in true humility of mind, with a perfect
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0013_0F8678EF4AB4DC28"/>
reſignation to his will, to wait upon the Lord, for his divine appearance in your hearts; for it is they that ſeek him ſhall find him: the humble he will teach of his way, and the meek he will guide in judgment. It is them he will fill with his heavenly oil; and thoſe that thirſt after righteouſneſs he will fill with his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wine.</p>
            <p>But, O Friends! there muſt be a watchfulneſs and care not to lean on our own underſtanding, or on our own cogitations, that is ſo apt to fill the mind. If we come to experience this, O how ſhould we be taught of the Lord! taught by him that is Truth and no lie, for he is the God of Truth.</p>
            <p>It is the true and humble ſeeking ſoul ſhall be bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, and thoſe that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; it is they, and they only, ſhall obtain the promiſe, <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord;</hi> but the rich and the full, they ſhall be ſent empty away. Thoſe that think great of their abilities, and they that are lifted up in their own imaginations, they are thoſe that ſhall be ſent empty away. The ability is not in man, nor is the ſtrength in the creature, but it is in the God of Truth. Great is the God of Truth! The Lord from Heaven is above all Gods, and above all Beings, and Principalities, both in Heaven and Earth.
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0014_0F8678EFF1AF9EA8"/>
Bleſſed be the God of Truth! It is He that teacheth his people truth, and brings them to be acquainted with himſelf. It is by the manifeſtation of Chriſt Jeſus the truth is come to be known, as he himſelf hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſaying, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. I am the way; nor is there any other way to come to the Father, for there is no other name given amongſt men, but the name of Chriſt, whereby mankind can be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Chriſt Jeſus, which is Life and Truth, that would raiſe us from ſin and death to a life of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If there was but a ſeeking to him, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be taught by him, what advantage ſhould we then receive? Our ſorrow ſhould then be turned into joy, and our weakneſs into ſtrength; we ſhould then come to know the promiſe of the Lord to be riches in poverty, and ſtrength in all our weakneſs. All thoſe that do put their truſt in him, and have an eye ſingle to him, that are ſolicitous for his divine inſtruction, and ſeek him with all their whole heart, who ſeeks the doctrine from his mouth, ſhall be made to know him that is the God of Truth. If thine eye be ſingle to him, thy whole body ſhall be full of light; that is, if thou art ſingly looking to God, and to his divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in thine own heart, thou ſhalt come to know him that is God, whom to know is life eternal, and be made acquainted with his truth; for what is to be
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0015_0F8678F2033F6BC0"/>
known of God, is made manifeſt in man. (This is ſcripture doctrine.) It is there he is manifeſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing himſelf againſt ſin and wickedneſs, and againſt every evil way.</p>
            <p>He that maketh manifeſt is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all. If thine eye be ſingle; thy whole body ſhall be full of light; thou ſhalt ſee what the Lord would have thee to do, and what to leave undone In him there is no confuſion, but the confuſion is in the creature, for want of ſingly looking to God; and this want is the cauſe of the want of a true devotion to and worſhipping God aright, who is to be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth; for ſuch doth the father ſeek to worſhip him. There muſt be no dependance on fleſh and blood; for fleſh and blood ſhall never enter into heaven. The apoſtle Paul conferred not with fleſh and blood, but gave up freely to the heavenly viſion, to the inſtruction of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, as himſelf hath ſaid. <hi>I conferred not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with fleſh and blood but ſtraightway gave up to the heavenly viſion.</hi> He did not receive the goſpel from man, but from the Lord from Heaven. Obſerve how bold he ſpeaks his own experience, <hi>I conferred not with fleſh and blood. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not from man, but by adhering to the light of Chriſt Jeſus, the heavenly inſtructor, who is the way, the truth, and the light, that enlighteneth every man that</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:011241_0016_0F8678F31DD7D0F8"/>
               <hi>cometh into the world; who is the Lord from Heaven, and King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find that it was given to the apoſtle, juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to preach Chriſt Jeſus to the Jews as Well as the Gentiles; though to the Jews he was a ſtumbling-block and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs. It was by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and a reſignation to the divine truth revealed in him, that he became an excellent inſtrument, in the hand of God, to diſcourage vice and immorality, and had to preach righteouſneſs; for it is the Righteous, my Friends, that exalteth a nation, but Sin is a ſhame to any people. This is inſtruction to mankind. This is what the Apoſtle of our Bleſſed Lord had to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. It was the great Buſineſs his Maſter ſent him to do, to preach righteouſneſs and diſcourage immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that Sin might be put an end to, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which exalteth a nation) be eſtabliſhed. This was the End for which Chriſt came into the world, and was propheſied of him; and that a long time before he came in that prepared body which he received of the Father; that he was to put an end to ſin and finiſh tranſgreſſion, and in the room thereof eſtabliſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now, if ever the work of righteouſneſs is done, if ever it be rightly and truly performed, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at home, in our own hearts; for (obſerve) Chriſt
<pb facs="unknown:011241_0017_0F8678F3B267F9F8"/>
came to take away ſin, and in the room thereof to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh everlaſting righteouſneſs. We may alſo take notice of another expreſſion of an eminent ſervant of Our Bleſſed Lord, that <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son</hi>—(what for?)—<hi>to take away ſin, in order that he might redeem to himſelf a peculiar and holy people, zealous of Good Works.</hi> How can we but be concerned that the Glorious End for which Chriſt came, might be anſwered, that ſin, which is ſhame, might be put an end to, and tranſgreſſion fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If we were truly ſincere, if we were true miniſters Jeſus Chriſt, how anxious would we be, how zealous would we labour, that ſin might be put an end to, all tranſgreſſion finiſhed! There is no room left for ſin nor place for tranſgreſſion; but the Lord directs to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord with comfort; for the Lord is of purer eye than to behold iniquity with approbation. There is no people that are ſo beloved of the Lord, that he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſin in them. It is nor forms or modes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or a formal righteouſneſs, nor the inventions men will do; but it is through obedience and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation we are made righteous; and by being waſh with the water of regeneration we come to be cleanſed from ſin and pollution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:011241_0018_0F8678F472CC0740"/>
If we come to be the beloved of the Lord, it muſt be by experiencing his love in us, and being obedient to his heavenly will. It is the obedient ſoul ſhall live. It is he that ſhall eat the good of the land, and drink of the wine of his kingdom. All thoſe that do his will ſhall know of his doctrine. It is they that ſhall be taught of the Lord, as our dear Lord ſaid, <hi>He that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my will ſhall know of my doctrine.</hi> O may there be a real concern in every heart, and an earneſt deſire raiſed in each of our minds, that ſin may be put an end to, and tranſgreſſion finiſhed! If we were ſolicitous enough for this, what a divine energy and ſtrength would be put into our minds, that everlaſting righteouſneſs might be brought in, and the kingdom of Chriſt be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>If we were true Chriſtians, taught of the Lord, and ſolicitous for his honour, we ſhould be made to know more and more, and be made ready to open to him, and willing to take on us his heavenly yoke, that would yoke us to his croſs, and draw our inclinations to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth,</hi> ſaith the Scripture of Truth. Here is a beautiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. It is compared to a yoke of young oxen that are yoked together, and are taught to draw, which they cannot do till they obey the yoke. It is as we come under the divine yoke, and are yoked to his croſs, and made to obey, we are taught to draw and become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the creation, and uſeful to one another; for
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011241_0019_0F8678F593610388"/>
he is only fit to live, who is fit to die. For this very end have we a being in the world, that we might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God, who gives us life, breath and being. This has been the concern of my mind ſince I entered this city, in the love of my heavenly Father, to call unto the inhabitants thereof, that they might eat of the fruit of inſtruction, which is the way to life, and become o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the voice of wiſdom, which is calling them in the ſecret of their hearts. The Lord, in his mercy is calling unto the ſons and daughters of men; he is calling them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan to ſerve the Living God. I cannot but admire his unſpeakable love and wonderful mercy that he beſtows on his people! Methinks there is a door of mercy open, which none can ſhut but he that has the key of David, who openeth and none can ſhut and ſhutteth and none can open. A door of mercy is open, and mercy is handing forth; and if there be not a complying, if there be not a coming up in obedience to righteouſneſs, the door of mercy will be ſhut. This is plainly ſet forth in the parable of the virgins.</p>
            <p>We may remember, that when the bridegroom came the fooliſh virgins had no oil in their lamps; and they ſaid unto the wiſe, <hi>Give us of your oil.</hi> What was the anſwer of the wiſe? It was a very reaſonable one,—<hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for you and us. Go and buy for yourſelves. And when they went to buy, the</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:011241_0020_0F8678F640D4FB70"/>
               <hi>bridgroom came; and they that were ready went in with them, and the door was ſhut;</hi> and an anſwer was made to the fooliſh virgins, when they wanted to enter, <hi>I know you not.</hi> A diſmal ſentence it was, and will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the wicked,—<hi>Depart from me. I know you not.</hi> I hope that this may never be the caſe of any that is here. The fooliſh had a name to virgins as well as the wiſe; but that would not get them an entrance. Tho' they had a name to virgins, it did not prevent the anſwer, <hi>I know you not.</hi> Obſerve. Here was both a name and profeſſion to religion. Both had the name to virgins but the fooliſh wanted oil: they wanted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. The time was elapſed; the door of mercy was ſhut; an anſwer was made; and a woeful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced,—<hi>Depart from me. I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard of him that ſpeaketh as never man ſpoke; who ſpeaketh in the ſecret of your hearts. But though you have heard, you may be no better than he that built his houſe upon the ſand. When the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, it fell, becauſe it was not built upon a rock. So will it be with thoſe that truſt to a name of religion, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal righteouſneſs, but neglect to come up in obedience to the word of grace in their hearts. I hope, and I earneſtly pray, that this may never happen to any that is in the hearing of my voice. The Lord, in his mercy bleſs you and keep you: may his infinite power preſerve and protect you!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:011241_0021_0F8678F6B5DB9130"/>
But he that built his houſe on the rock, when the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, it fell not, becauſe it was built upon a rock; ſo will be ſtand who builds on the divine rock, Chriſt Jeſus, the Son of God, and ſure Foundation, Againſt him the gates of Hell ſhall never prevail. The floods may come, and the winds may blow, and waves of temptations may raiſe themſelves high, he ſhall ſtand in the Day of Trial, becauſe he is built on the Divine and Eternal Rock.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none deceive themſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elves, for <hi>Such aa you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap.</hi> If you ſow to the ſpirit, you ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting; but if you ſow to the fleſh, a miſerable crop ſhall you reap. It is by experiencing the work of righteouſneſs wrought in us we come to taſte of the bleſſing; and <hi>O that it may be the caſe!</hi> is the earneſt prayer that accompanies my mind; and that you may know his gracious favour and mercy to be with you, and keep you! Suppoſe I ſhould ſay it hath attended me here, for which my ſoul doth bleſs the Lord, who hath come down to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and is making his power known in bleſſing the proviſion of Zion.

            <p>BE pleaſed, O Lord! to prepare our hearts, and put into our minds, to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thy goodneſs. We are made to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, in a ſenſe of our own nothingneſs, and ſay <hi>O Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the ſons of men that thou thus viſiteſt them?</hi> Thy children that love thee in their hearts, prevail, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of thy heavenly power, and are made willing to follow thee, and feel after thee, thou Lord God that changeſt not. Thou art a God, ſlow to anger, a God of wonderful love and unſpeakable kindneſs, Thy Truth is gone forth, and we cannot forbear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, in behalf of mankind, all the world over let their names or profeſſion be what it may) that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and tens of thouſands may be brought home to thy Son; and that thou wouldſt make thyſelf known, by manifeſting thyſelf to them. Be pleaſed to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in mercy, thoſe that have much thought of thy name, and alſo thoſe that have not enquired after thee; that by and through the diſcovery of thy light, O Lord God of Truth, they may come to ſee thy ſacred truth, and be made to follow thee whereſoever thou goeſt, that thy name, which is holy, may be glorified. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord God, as we have known thy infinite mercy to be with us, O be thou pleaſed, once more, to reach unto the hearts of ſuch as rebel againſt thee. It's

thy power alone can effect it. It is the ſanctifying, by thy divine power, thy inſpeaking word, that can reach every heart, that can turn them from the evil of their ways, to ſerve and obey thee, the Living God, that they may know a ſacrificing to thy dear Son, and to Thee, O Lord GOD. Be pleaſed to give them an humble repentance, that they may know thee, O Lord, to be a God of mercy. O Lord, remember the poor in heart, we humbly beſeech thee, even thoſe whoſe knees are ready to ſmite together, that have no might or ſtrength of their own, and who are ready to periſh. All ſuch as rebel againſt thee, turn thou, O God, their minds to thee. Thou, O God, art known in thy own temple the heart. It is there only that thou art to be felt and worſhipped. Prepare many more, yea, many thouſands, that they may taſte of thy goodneſs, and hear the voice of the High Prieſt who ſpeaks as never man ſpoke. In a ſenſe that thou art a God that changeſt not, and that it is therefore the ſons of men are not conſumed: in a ſenſe of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy, we humbly preſent ourſelves before thee, and beſeech thee that many may come to know and praiſe thy great name, who alone is worthy to be praiſed, adored, and magnified, with thy dear Son im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate, and Holy Spirit for ever more.
