            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are (though none such that I know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you) who have opposed the Doctrine of the <hi>Church-covenant,</hi> not only as to <hi>Renewals</hi> thereof, but they strike at the thing it self, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to be an Ordinance of Christ, or to have any Scripture foundation. <note n="(a)" place="margin">

Albeit I doubt not but that you unto whom I am now speaking; are fully satisfied in the Truth concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet it may be, it will not be altogether unprofitable (as tending to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> establishment in the present Truth) to remind you of the Arguments whereby that Principle of our way (and we trust the way of Christ) hath been confirmed, And they are such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is clear, beyond dispute that the Church under the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament was established by Covenant; and therfore the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of the lews is expressed by that of breaking their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Zach. 11.9, 10, 14. 2. The Names which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church in Scripture bear witness to this Truth, It is called a City, Psal. 87. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Eph. 2. 9. Every City is united by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; The Citizens are received into <hi>Jus Civitatis,</hi> into right of City priviledges by some Covenant or Oath. Again, the Church is said to be Espoused to Christ, 2. Cor. 11.2, And they that joyn to the Church are said to be married to the Church, If 62. 5. Now we know that marriage cannot be without Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 3. All Relations which are neither naturall nor
<pb facs="unknown:000239_0004_0FA4718EE7892F70"/>
violent, but voluntary, are by vertue of some Covenant; Church Relation is voluntary; therefore the Covenant doth constitute men in such a Relation. 4. If a Church decayed is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored and reformed by Renewing their Covenant, then the Church is at First Erected thereby; For things are to be Reformed by reducing them to their first Institution. Math, 16.8, 1. Cor. 11. 23. Rev. 2.5. But that the Church hath still been Reformed by Renewall of Covenant, the Scriptures do abundantly testify; How rarely do we read of a Church Reformation attained, but in this way? 5. Let the Inventory of all other Respects be brought in and considered, and it will be found that none of them constitute a Church, and therefore this of the Covenant only must. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason to Imagine that meer Cohabitation should doe it; For then Infidels would be of the Church. Nor doth a meer external profession make a man a member of this or that Church; For then it would be impossible to excomunicate or cut off a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt member from such a body Politick, since it is not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of men to prevent any one from making a profession of the Gospel. Nor doth Baptisme constitute a member of the Church: For then, if a mans membership ceaseth by dissolution of the Church, Excommunication, dismission, his Baptisme, if the form of membership, would become a nullity. It remains then, that a particular Church is constituted by the Covenant, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Saints to walk with God, and one another, according to the Order of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>It hath been objected by some, that the Doctrine of <hi>Explicit Covenanting</hi> doth unchurch all Christians but those of our way; such a practice not being known to the Christian World untill the late <hi>Separatists</hi> began it. Unto all which, the old answer is sufficient, that although the more Explicit the Covenant is, the better: <note n="(b)" place="margin">

               </note> Furthermore, it is evident, from <hi>Justin Martyrs</hi> testimony (who lived in the very next age to the Apostles) that Christians in those dayes did explicitly Covenant. For he saith of them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. They were such as did give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God, &amp; did profess they believed that the things taught in the Gospel were true, and that they would for the future lead their lives according thereunto.</p>
            <p>Others have objected, that we find nothing in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning a <hi>Church Covenant.</hi> And suppose it were so indeed, Is the old Testament Apocrypha in these dayes? Its a solid Notion, that things abundantly insisted on in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and matters about which there was no occasion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie in the Apostles time, are sparingly mentioned in the New Testament. As therein much is not said concerning the Sanctification of the Sabbath, Nor express mention of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of Infants, it was so plain and unquestionable a thing, that the Infants of Believers should have the initiating Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant applyed to them, that there was no need to insist expresly on a matter then so clear &amp; indisputable. And as for the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant,</hi> there wants not New Testament proof for it. For some Scriptures in the old Testament which speak of it, refer to the days of the Gospel. So Ifa. 56.6, 7. &amp; 44.5, &amp; 62.5, Jer. 50.5. Ezek.
<pb facs="unknown:000239_0006_0FA4719012206950"/>
20 37. And in the New-Testament we read of the Churches being espoused to Christ, and that <hi>Church-Members</hi> are <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Citizens,</hi> and of their being in <hi>Fellowship</hi> together, &amp; being <hi>added</hi> to the Church, all which expressions imply such covenanting as is by us propugned and practised.</p>
            <p>And if the thing it self be warrantable, the <hi>Renewall</hi> of it is in case a duty. Nor can I think of any momentous objection against it; I know some are scrupulous (and it is good to be of a tender Conscience) lest men be not duly prepared for a Renewall of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and will not keep their Ingagements, and so greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follow, But it may be Replyed, 1. This striketh at all Explicit Covenanting, yea by this Argument we must have no days of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, no coming to Sacraments, because if professors be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal in these things, they break the third Commandment, and the Lord will not hold them guiltless. 2. Our Churches are (through grace) as well prepared for this duty as the Children of Israel were sometimes when they Renewed their Covenant, &amp; a blessing followed. 3. If only an Externall <hi>Reformation</hi> should be attained ther by that may prevent outward Judgements. 4 A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of living Christians will be sincere in what they do, &amp; to bring down a blessing upon others as well as themselves. Christ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times judgeth of his Churches by the Gold that He seeth in them If a few Golden sincere members in a Church Renew, and keep their Covenant with God; the Societyes and Towns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they belong, shall fare the better for them. In a word a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should not be like him that <hi>Luther</hi> speaketh of, who because he made many promises to God, that he would serve him in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, and yet kept them not, therefore resolved to live at a loose end, and never ingage himself to God any more. Only a work of this nature should be done not in our own strength, but humbly depending upon Christ, and with all possible serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, since it is a most dreadfull thing to transact personally with the holy, and infinitely glorious Majesty of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>And now (my Brethren) as for the publication of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it was your concurrent desires that prevailed with me to consent unto it.

            <p>THis Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is Historical, amongst other things we have an account of what was done by the Jews (in those dayes the only Church of God upon earth) after they were delivered from the Heathen Nations, who had sorely wasted and destroyed them, in order to a <hi>Reformation</hi> of those evills that had provoked the Lord against them. There are two things mentioned that way in his and in the following Chapters. 1. They kept a day of solemn Humiliation by fasting and Prayer: the time when this day was observed is expressed in the first Verse of this Chapter, <hi>Now in the twenty and fourth day of the moneth, the Children of Israel were assembled with Fasting and with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes;</hi> and the manner how the day was observed, and the time spent is expressed in the third verse, namely in hearing the word and in Prayer: <hi>They read in the Book of the Law of the Lord their God one fourth part of the way, and another fourth part they confessed.</hi> In their <hi>Confessions</hi> they doe, 1. Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Lords great goodness to them and to their Fathers, in that he called Abraham and established a Covenant with him and his seed after him in their Generations, and brought them out of Egypt, wonderfully preserved them in the Wilderness; setled them in the land of Canaan, and there saved them many a time. The greatest part of this Chapter is taken up in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of this nature. 2. They confess their own ingratitude and unworthy walkings before the Lord, <hi>v</hi> 34.35. 3. They confess that they were under solemn Rebukes of Providence, <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. 4.

            <p>I shall only speak to the duty at present: we know that this people was in Covenant with God before this day of Fast was kept, and therefore the making of a Covenant here spoken of, intends only a Solemn renewal thereof.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine therefore before us; is, <hi>That there are times wherein solemn Renewal of Covenant is a duty incumbent on the People of God.</hi>

               </note> Now for the clearing of this Doctrine, there are four things that may be briefly enquired into. 1. What is implyed in making a Covenant with God. 2.

Q. 1. <hi>What is implyed in making a Covenant with God? A.</hi> 1. It Implyes <hi>a chosing the Lord the only true God in Jesus Christ to be our God.</hi> Psal. 48. 14. <hi>For this God is our God for ever and ever.</hi> This is <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>venanting,</hi> even a making an everlasting Choice of God. Hence it is expressed by that of <hi>Cleaving</hi> to the Lord. Josh. 23. 8. <hi>but cleave unto the Lord your God.</hi> h.e. chose him and him only and for ever as your God. The Substance, Soul and Life of the Covenant is in this. As the Sum of the Covenant on the Lords part is expressed by that of his being <hi>the God of his people,</hi> Jer. 31. 33. <hi>I will be their God and they shall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> An expression which is used (as some observe) at least fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times in the Scripture, to express the Covenant: so the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Covenant on our part is comprehended in that of <hi>taking the Lord to bee our God.</hi> And this is done inwardly when the heart is given up to God, when their is an entire resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mans soul and self unto God in Jesus Christ. 2. Cor. 8. 5. <hi>They gave their own selves to the Lord.</hi> Or outwardly and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>h.e.</hi> when men do profess before all the world that they are and would be the Lords Servants. Hence, when the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did solemnly renew their Covenant in Joshuahs time, he said to them, <hi>you are witnesses that you have chosen the Lord to serve him.</hi> Josh. 24. 22. that was their open profession and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they were the Lords servants. It is therefore expressed by that of <hi>avouching</hi> the Lord. Deut. 26. 17. <hi>Thou hast avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to be thy God this day.</hi> So thou hast said, <note n="(d)" place="margin">Hebr. <gap reason="foreign">

They are bound to own and subject unto the holy wayes of God.

Yea indeed, such a people, are bound absolutely to subject to the will of God, so as to obey him not only in some things but in every thing that he shall see good to enjoyn upon them. This we see in the Context, when this people renewed their Covenant, they promised saying, we will <hi>observe &amp; doe all the Commandments of the Lord our Lord.</hi> Neh 10. 29. And we read of the Corinthians that after they became a Covenant People, they did professedly subject themselves to the Gopsel. 2.

               </note> The like custom to this hath been solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed in some of the reformed Churches. And we see in this Context, that when these Israelites renewed their Covenant, they promised to forsake such and such sins, as afterwards we shall hear more fully. In a word, such Doctrines as are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Truth in Religion, and such practices as cannot stand with Power of Godliness a people that renew their Covenant are bound to renounce them. We come then to the Second En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>How it doth appear that it is not enough for men to make a Covenant with the Lord, but that solemn renewal of Covenant is sometimes a Duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We shall mention three Arguments, all of them evincing the Truth of the Doctrine before us. 1. <hi>It is evident that renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Covenant is a Duty, in that men ought frequently to worship God.</hi> Whenever God is worshipped the Covenant is renewed implicitly. No man doth at any time worship <hi>Jehevah,</hi> but he doth therein and thereby avouch the Lord to be his God, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that which we worship we own to be God, and our God also. And hence is that expression, Psal. 50. 5. <hi>My Saints that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice,</hi> because as often as the Lords people did offer Sacrifice to the Lord, they did by that act of Religious Worship, renew and confirm their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him. <note n="(l)" place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> p 247.</note> Sacrificing was of old a foederal Rite. So, when the Lords people sanctifie a Sabbath to the honour of his Name, they do by that virtually renew their Covenant. Ezck.20.20. <hi>Hallow my Sabbaths, and they shall be a Sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the Lord your God.</hi> Due observation of the Sabbath, is one Sign of a Covenant people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When men doe religiously observe the Christian Sabbath, they acknowledge
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000239_0013_0FA47196E02C8E98"/>
themselves to be under the New Covenant, even the Covenant of Grace, as under its new and last and best way of Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Jesus Christ is their Lord and Saviour. Yea when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Christians pray unto God in Christ, especially when they Fast and Pray, the Covenant is renewed: for then they profess that God in Jesus Christ is the object of their Faith, and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly (at least) promise to endeavour a Reformation of the sins which they confess and beg the pardon of. Inasmuch then as dutyes of divine worship ought frequently to be attended, it is not enough for men once to enter into Covenant, but there must be a renewal of that Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Truth is further evident, in that the Lord hath appointed Seals of his Covenant.</hi> Under the old Testament the Covenant was sealed by circumcision and the Passover: and we know that Baptisme and the Lords Supper are the Seals of the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; and therefore they are commonly called <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Which word doth import the highest engagement that may be; yea an <hi>Oath of Fidelity.</hi> It is <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 paragraph">
                     <desc>〈1 paragraph〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> a military word: For Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in former times were wont to take an Oath of Fidelity to their General, and this they called the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> They would say one to another, <hi>have you taken the Sacrament?</hi> meaning, have you yet taken the Oath of Allegiance to your General, that you will be faithfull unto him to the Death? So they that are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of either of the Sacraments appointed under the New-Test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, are under an Oath of Fidelity unto Christ. By Baptism Christians make a sure Covenant with the Lord. Hence they are said to be baptised <hi>(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Baptised person is bound to approve himself as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Servant of that God who is Father, Son and Spirit, and Baptisme is said to be <hi>into the Name of the Lord Jesus,</hi> Act.19.5. inasmuch, as the party baptised is under solemn ingagement to submit to the Name and Authority of the Lord Jesus in all things. When a Father (or Mother) presents his child to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, the Covenant is not only then sealed to the Child, but confirmed with the Parent, Yea he by bringing his child to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, doth renew his taking hold of that Covenant, wherein the Lord hath said, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy Seed.</hi> Also, In the Lords Supper the Covenant is renewed both on the Lords part and on ours. Christ therefore when he did institute that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000239_0014_0FA47198591DEE80"/>
Ordinance of the Supper, said, <hi>this Cup is the New-Testament in my blood which is shed for you,</hi> Luk. 22.20. <hi>h.e.</hi> the wine in the cup doth signifie the Blood of Christ, whereby the Lord doth confirm the new Covenant with the Believer, and the Believer doth by drinking of that cup, anew take hold of his interest in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and promise to walk before the Lord according to the terms of the Covenant. Now this Ordinance of the Supper ought frequently to be attended. 1.Cor.11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup.</hi> So that it is an Ordinance which Christians ought often to worship the Lord in. Some of the Antients, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Justin Martir, aed Turtullian.</hi>
               </note> doe expresly testifie that the Lords Supper was in those primitive times observed every Lords day, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (in the Acts of the Apostles) doth intimate no less. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ought to be often administred, albeit there is no stated Rule determining just how Often, and therefore the Covenant is often to be renewed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lords people ought to renew their Faith and Repentance,</hi> and that implyeth a renewal of Covenant. When a Sinner is truly converted, then is he savingly brought into Covenant with God in Christ. They that pretend to Conversion, Faith, &amp; Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are visibly in Covenant with the Lord, and they that are really converted, are everlastingly in Covenant even <hi>betrothed to the Lord for ever.</hi> Now there are renewed Conversions which the Lords own children may stand in need of, especially in case of any great iniquity committed against the Lord, or special Corruption breaking forth. Hence David after his lamentable Fall, in that matter about Uriah the Hittite prayed as in Psal. 51. 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God and RENEW a right spirit within me.</hi> He saw that he stood in need of going over the work of Conversion again, and so of <hi>Renewing</hi> his closure and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God in Jesus Christ. And it was said to Peter, <hi>when thou art converted,</hi> h.e. when thou shalt have renewed thy turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lord. Thou (saith Christ) wilt break thy Covenant &amp; Promise. Thou hast promised to stand by me thy Master what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever come of it; but Temptation will be too hard for thee, and then thou must renew thy Faith and Repentance.Luk.22.32. Yea it was said to all the Disciples of Christ, <hi>except you be converted,</hi> Mat.18.3. intimating that there was a necessity of their being converted anew from a particular Corruption, which was at that time too prevalent in them. Moreover the Lord Jesus doth
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000239_0015_0FA471990CDF3638"/>
call upon the Churches in Asia to repent, as we see in the 2<hi>d.</hi> &amp; 3<hi>d.</hi> Chapters of the Revelation. They had repented before Christ sent those Epistles from heaven to awaken them, yet the Lord would have them to renew their Repentance; and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that renewal of Covenant, which I am now speaking of. But the truth in answer to this enquiry will appear morefully in speaking to the third particular proposed, <abbr>viz,</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When the Lords People ought to renew their Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall only speak concerning those more solemn and extraordinary renewals of Covenant, which the Text hath espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reference unto. For I delight to keep as close as may be to the subject I have in hand. This then of a more solemn Renewal of Covenant is a Duty in two cases especially, both which are noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Context.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In case of eminent danger and distress,</hi> So here this Church and Congregation of the Israelites having said <hi>we are in great distress,</hi> it is added, <hi>and becauseof all this, we make a sure Covenant.</hi> The truth is that the very dictates of natural Conscience, direct men to renew their Vows and Covenants with God at such times. And instances are not rare in the Scripture confirming this. When Jacob was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from his Fathers house, that was an hazardous underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wherefore, he <hi>vowed a Vow saying, if God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I goe, so that I come again unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God.</hi> thus did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Covenant. Gen.28.20,21. And <hi>Jepthah,</hi> when he was greatly distressed by reason of the Heathen who made an unjust Warr upon him, that put him upon solemn vowing to the Lord, and so renewing his Covenant in that way, Judg.11 30. Likewise the children of Israel, while yet in the Wilderness, when some of the Heathen that lived in the southern parts, fought against them and took some of them Prisoners, they vowed a Vow to the Lord, Numb. 21.1,2. Yet more, when the first Generation of those that came out of Egypt were dead, and another Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion risen up, who were called of God to ingage in Warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Heathen Nations round about, Moses put them upon renewing their Covenant, Deut. 29.1. <hi>These are the words of the Covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel in the Land of Moab, beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb,</hi> Which sheweth that that only was a renewal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000239_0016_0FA4719A77D05098"/>
was only a renewal of the Covenant. It was necessary that the new Generation should come under the bond of a renewed Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In case of Apostacy from God, Renewal of Covenant is a Duty.</hi> Thus also in the Context: they confess that such and such depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the Lord were to be charged upon them, <hi>and because of this they made a sure Covenant;</hi> especially if there be any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table defection and degeneracy among a professing people, their great duty is to make haste to recover themselves by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and sincere renewal of their Covenant with God in Jesus Christ. If there be corruption in Worship, then this duty ought to be attended. So in Asas time, 2 Chron.15.12. And in Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias time. Chap. 23. <hi>v.</hi> 16. And in the dayes of Hezekiah and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.<hi>Chron.</hi> 29.8. and 34.3 1. Or if there be corruption in manners, though there should be a purity as to external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, this renewing of Covenant with God is then also a duty. It is a great mistake to think that the Lords people of old never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their Covenant except they were fallen to Idolatry: For the Jews were not Idolaters after the Captivity, therefore the Pharisees could say, <hi>we are not born of Fornication,</hi> meaning, they were not Idolaters; and so not guilty of spiritual adultery, Joh.8.41. Yet after the Captivity they renewed their Covenant with God from time to time. So Neh.10. And again in the 5<hi>th.</hi> Chap. <hi>v</hi> 12, 13. Also in Chap. 13.<hi>v.</hi>25 And in Ezra 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> There were scandalous evills amongst them in respect of transgressions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the 2<hi>d.</hi> Table, and therefore they did, (as was in such case their duty) solemnly renew their Covenant. Now these things are written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the World are come, 1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. 11. As the judgments which befell the Jews of old were recorded for our Admonition, so the course which they did (according to God) observe for the removal on diverting Judgment, is recorded for our imitation; and in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> concerning this renewing of Covenant, which the Text speaketh of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But why should this be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall mention but one <hi>Reason</hi> of the Doctrine, and that is; <hi>because of the Glory which doth come to God hereby.</hi> The Lord Jehovah looketh upon himself as honoured, when his Creatures doe own him and submit unto him as God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this submission is in the most solemn manner renewed,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000239_0017_0FA4719A8BC16258"/>
it tends exceedingly to the glory of the Name of God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this renewal of Covenant with God through Jesus Christ is the great Scripture expedient, in order to the accomplishing of Reformation among a professing people. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and you will still find, that when any notable reformation was effected in the Church, it was in this way attained. And therefore <hi>Piscator</hi>

               </note> upon this Text hath a good observation. <hi>Here</hi> (saith he) <hi>is an Example touching renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Covenant, which Churches ought to to insitate when they desire to carry on the work of Reformation.</hi> Again, this is the way to prevent much Sin &amp; dishonour to the Name of God. &amp; that seems <note n="(q)" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 paragraph">

                  </gap>
               </note> to be the special Reason why the Covenant was renewed not long before Joshuahs Death. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver private or particular transgressions there might be, we know not; but it is evident that there was no publick or general defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction till after Joshuahs dayes; for it is testified, <hi>that the people served the Lord all the dayes of Joshuah, and of the Elders that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived Joshuah.</hi> Judg.2.7. Therefore in his dying Exhortation he said unto them <hi>cleave unto the Lord your God, as you have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day.</hi> Josh. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3. 8. Why then did he put them upon renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Covenant? Even that so they might be ingaged against sin and Apostacy from God for the future. Hence it is said, Ch. 24.25. <hi>Joshuah made a Covenant with the People that day, and set them a Statute and an Ordinance in Shechem,</hi> that is to say, he did ratisie it as a standing perpetual Ordinance to them and to their posterity, so that Joshuahs design was by a Covenant for the future, to restrain them from Idolatry and Apostacy. As for those that are sincere, and truly Conscientious, such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of Covenant as I am speaking of, will ingage them to a more close walking with God. And others that it may be are not gone beyond a legal work, such a Covenant will be an awe upon Conscience, so as to prevent the Commission of many a Sin. They that have any Conscience in them, will be afraid to sin when under such solemn ingagements to the contrary. So then it doth in more respects then one, tend to the honour of God, &amp; therefore his People ought to renew their Covenant.</p>

USE. 1. Here is matter of sad Conviction and Reproof.

Now to neglect divine Institutions, such as Baptisme and the Lords Supper, and Church fellowship in order thereunto, is to be guilty of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Commandment, and God doth many times punish the neglect of his own <hi>Institutions,</hi> with as great severity as he doth plague for the practice of humane inventions in the things of God It may well be thought that this is one special trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, which hath provoked the blessed God to let loose the Heathen against those that doe profess his Name in this Land.

Our Fathers came into this Wilderness on purpose that so they might build an house for God, and walk with him in all his holy Institutions; and therefore there are none in the World, in whom neglects of that kind are so evill and provoking to the most High, as in the Children of such Fathers. Others there are that doe not inwardly and sincerely enter into Covenant with God. And that is true concerning all unconverted Sinners, all that are in a natural irregenerate estate. The natural man is a Servant to sin and Satan, and not to God.

Let not any of us be like unto him, It is recorded in the New-Testament, concerning the Christians at Tyre, that not only the men, but also their wives, yea and their Children (chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are expresly mentioned) manifested their affection to the Ministry, and worshipped the Lord together. Act. 21. 5. And was the Lord Jesus ever more moved with an holy indignation at his own Disciples, then at that time, when out of a perverse zeal, and sinfull scrupulosity, they would have witheld little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from him? Men are not aware how much they displease Christ by such a spirit, and by practices according thereunto.</p>

            <p>And what shall we doe that we may keep Covenant?</p>
            <p>Answ. 5. <hi>Whatever you doe, doe all in the Name of Christ.</hi> Look unto Jesus for help and Grace. Goe to him for pardon of all former breaches of Covenant, that his blood (which is the blood of the everlasting Covenant) may be sprinkled upon your souls. Without him you cannot renew your Covenant aright, nor keep it when you have done, <hi>Without me</hi> (said Christ to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> Joh.15.5. But through the grace and strength of Christ, you may doe all things. Be strong then in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus. Goe on in his Name and fear, humbly depending on him for the supplyes of his Spirit. And I beseech God, that the Grace of the Lord Jesus may be with you.</p>
