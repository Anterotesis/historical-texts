            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>ISAIAH xxxiii.6.</bibl>
                  <p>AND WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE SHALL BE THE STABILITY OF THY TIMES.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TO eſtabliſh on firm foundations the Happineſs of Society is evidently one of the moſt important concerns of man. If the attainment of that happineſs be highly deſirable, the perpetuation of it muſt be more deſirable. Its daily value is daily renewed, during its continuance; and, when extended through a century, it is mathematically proved to be of a hundred times the value, which it would poſſeſs, if extended only through a year.</p>
            <p>The mind of man, inſtinctively realizing this truth, has ever laboured rather to ſecure, than to obtain, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, both public and private. The attainment is uſually not a difficult taſk, the eſtabliſhment a Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean one. A free government has been always, and juſtly, ſuppoſed to be a primary ſource of national hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. To form ſuch a government has been found ſufficiently eaſy; but to render it durable has been ever conſidered as a problem of very difficult ſolution. Yet in its durability plainly conſiſts almoſt all the value of ſuch a government. Hence moſt of the political know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and labour of freemen has been employed, and exhauſted, in endeavouring to give ſtability to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028610_0006_0FD9C5D266A3D880"/>
political ſyſtems. Hence have ariſen the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous checks, balances, and diviſions of power and influence, found in our own political conſtitutions, and in thoſe of ſeveral other nations. In other nations, theſe means have been generally inſufficient to accompliſh the end. Whether they will iſſue more happily in our own is uncertain. In ſeveral inſtances, we ſeem to have approached the verge of diſſolution; but we have providentially withdrawn, before the ſeaſon of ſafety was paſſed. Men of extenſive political information, and ſagacious forecaſt, have frequently trembled for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional exiſtence; and, notwithſtanding ſome favourable interpoſitions of Providence in our behalf, they ſtill wait anxiouſly to know what the end will be. Should we fall, the faireſt hopes of wiſe and good men will be blaſted; the maxim, That mankind cannot be governed without force and violence, will ſtand on higher proof, and be advanced with new and triumphant confidence; and the great body of civilized men will probably ſit down in ſullen and melancholy conviction, that nations cannot, unleſs circumſcribed by Alps, or oceans, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently free.</p>
            <p>Moſt nations, and moſt politicians, have conſidered Arms and Wealth, as primary means of continuing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional happineſs. To this opinion they have probably been led by the allurements of avarice and ambition, by the power of cuſtom, and by a perſuaſion, eaſily imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that grandeur and happineſs are ſynonymous. All theſe are deceitful guides, and have in this inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted only to error.</p>
            <p>As means of defence, arms are evidently neceſſary to national ſafety, and, of courſe, to the permanence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional happineſs; but, as means of conqueſt, they are uſually the ſource of national ruin. States of moderate ſize, uninclined to military enterpriſe, and unambitious of high diſtinction, appear to have realized more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028610_0007_0FD9C6118CE56C10"/>
than thoſe of a contrary character. Widely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended dominions are too unwieldy an object, to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged with either ſkill, or ſucceſs; and power, diffuſed over a large territory, leſſens at every ſtage of its diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A greater and greater mixture of nations and tribes, once independent and impatient of ſubjugation, of different manners, religions, and intereſts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from uniting by prejudice and hatred, by impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious domination and irritated dependence, is continually accumulated, at every ſtride of conqueſt; and, like the iron and clay in the prophecy, though carefully moulded into a fair and regular form, is preparing to crumble, under the hand of the Former.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of government, alſo, and its neceſſary meaſures by becoming daily more complicated, become daily more perplexing. The public concerns are too numerous, the public officers, in opinions, characters, and intereſts, too various, the opportunities of ſecure op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion too eaſy, and the neglects of duty too frequent, to allow of any poſſible firmneſs, or conſiſtency. The pile, however ſkilfully erected, and conſtantly repaired, is by the increaſe of its own weight precipitated to the ground.</p>
            <p>From great accumulations of Wealth the ſame evil is derived with not leſs certainty, and in methods not very diſſimilar. Avarice is one of thoſe <hi>daughters of the horſe-leach, which inceſſantly cry, "give, give</hi>;" it is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>the fire, which ſaith not, "it is enough.</hi>" The love of property increaſes in a more rapid proportion, than the property itſelf, In a country poſſeſſed of immenſe wealth, places in government are, of neceſſity, highly lucrative, and, of courſe, the objects of ardent deſire. To attain them, no principles, no efforts, are eſteemed too great a ſacrifice. Sycophancy, ſervility, bribery, perjury, and numberleſs other ſpectres of vice, haunt all ſeats of power and truſt, and force the friends of public integrity to retire with alarm and diſcouragement. Honeſty is no longer
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028610_0008_0FD9C5D386D315E8"/>
counterfeited; but laughed at. Conſcience is not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced; but diſcarded. Poſts of honour, are toſſed out for a ſcramble; and truth, juſtice, and the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, are vendued to the higheſt bidder.</p>
            <p>On perſonal manners the effects are no leſs unhappy. Stimulated by avarice, and called onward by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding voice of cuſtom, every man makes gold his god. To acquire riches becomes the only object, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or duty. By his wealth every man's worth is ſealed. Wealth is virtue; and poverty vice. The means of acquiſition are, therefore, ſanctified by the acknowledged importance of the end. Extortion, fraud, gaming, and peculation, ſteal into character, under the impoſing names of induſtry and prudence, and whiten into virtues, in the ſunſhine, with which opulence is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, luxury holds out to appetite his ſtore of various and ſickly confections, and perſuades thoſe, who are prepared to be perſuaded, that ſenſe is the only ſource of real good, and that to eat and drink is the chief end of man. Enfeebled by ſloth, debaſed by indulgence, and groſs with a perpetual proſtitution of taſte and of talents, the rational character becomes aſſimilated to the animal one, and man claims a new and more intimate kindred to the ſwine.</p>
            <p>Parade and appearance, alſo, invite and engroſs the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional attention. Houſes, gardens, equipage, and dreſs, take the place of duty and worth; and from the prince to the peaſant the great ambition is to ſhine. Arts of ornament eject thoſe of uſe; and manners of manlineſs and dignity give place to ceremony and profeſſion. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, inſtead of enlightening the underſtanding and forming the heart, is employed in gracing the perſon and ſuppling the limbs; and inſtead of teaching truth, implanting virtue and faſhioning to worth by ſober diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, habituating care, and perſuaſive example, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028610_0009_0FD9C615B67F81F0"/>
all her labours in accompliſhing for the dance and the drawing room. Children, are of courſe, led out of the path of reaſon and duty into the by-ways of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and ſenſe, are conducted to the theatre and not to the church, and, while they are expected to become men and women, dwindle, with a regular diminution, into fribbles and dolls.</p>
            <p>Thus the influence of enormous Wealth, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Conqueſt, is equally pernicious to the Magiſtrate, and to the ſubject; and the national character becomes tainted, of courſe, with ſicklineſs and corruption.</p>
            <p>The experience of mankind has effectually elucidated the truth of theſe remarks. Greece, Rome, and the great nations of modern Europe, are all evident proofs of the intimate connection between Conqueſt and ruin; and Carthage and Holland are ſtrong exhibitions of the periſhing nature of ſociety, which reſts on the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and treacherous ſupport of unlimited Commerce.</p>
            <p>The plans of thoſe, who hitherto have chiefly planned for mankind, appear to have been formed principally for the purpoſe of fixing ſecurely that ſtate of ſociety, which they found, and little, if at all, for its melioration. For this end, they appear to have aimed merely to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the exiſting government againſt invaſion and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Men, they ſeem to have ſuppoſed, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be what they found them; ignorant, vicious, and unhappy. To render them as quiet as poſſible, in that ſtate, is naturally concluded to have been the higheſt object of their policy, ſo far as it is exhibited in hiſtory. Hence they laboured much to conſolidate the elements of the government, and to ſecure to it that reverence, ſubmiſſion, and ſtrength, which promiſed undiſputed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. When the promotion of ſcience became a part of the political ſyſtem, it was principally adopted, for the purpoſe of qualifying individuals to govern, and furniſhing uſeful agents to thoſe who governed, in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028610_0010_0FD9C5DB6E4B16E8"/>
proſecution of their meaſures; and rarely, and ſcantily, for the purpoſe of improving the maſs of men. The Object was not ſo ſo rule, as to engroſs the eſteem and affection of ſubjects; or to enable them to know when they were ſo ruled, as to make their rulers the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their eſteem and affection. The Object was not to prepare ſubjects by information, happineſs, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to underſtand, to love, and to preſerve their ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make them quiet in that ſtate, whether diſpoſed, or indiſpoſed. Hence, policy became an art; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment a trick. Rulers were employed in plotting againſt their ſubjects; and ſubjects either quietly ſunk into torpid inſenſibility, or, awakened by oppreſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond every bound, roſe to inſurrection and madneſs.</p>
            <p>This ſyſtem, though it has been almoſt the only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſyſtem, has never appeared to be of real uſe to man. It has often defeated itſelf, and fruſtrated the deſigns of thoſe, by whom it has been adopted. Aſſyria, Perſia, Macedon, Rome, and France, are all proofs, that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupported, as it has been by all the arts of policy, and the utmoſt accumulation of power, it has ſtill ſown in itſelf the ſeeds of diſſolution; and that thoſe, whom it was intended to aggrandize, have fallen into the ſame gulph of perdition, with thoſe whom it was intended to enſlave. The Character of the maſs of people, in each of thoſe monarchies, was the real cauſe of its political ruin; and the nature of the political ſyſtem was as really a principal cauſe of that character. In Africa, where Oppreſſion has more effectually wielded her iron rod, and where man has been more entirely ſhorne of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual dignity, a more uniform courſe of ſociety has been accompliſhed. But here quietneſs has exiſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out happineſs; a ſtagnant lake, filled with pollution and death; and nations, commuting reaſon for inſtinct have ſhrunk into brutes. In India, and in China, where the ſame ſyſtem has long, tho' not uninterruptedly prevailed,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028610_0011_0FD9C61736649F20"/>
the inhabitants have indeed riſen to higher grades of manual ingenuity, but, as moral beings, are nearly on the ſame level.</p>
            <p>Under the influence of freedom, man has been rouſed from this lethargy, and ſhaken himſelf with a returning conſciouſneſs of energy and action. In this ſuperior ſituation, his powers, his views, his efforts, enlarged with a portentous growth; but they grew chiefly by the aid of ſoil, climate, and accident. The cultivation which they received, was the cultivation of chance, of paſſion, and of appetite; not of ſyſtem, wiſdom, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Greece became a Giant in war, in ſcience, and in arts; but was ſtill an infant in moral improvement, and uſeful policy. No regular plan of amending the human character appears to have been thought of by her moſt admired ſages; and, while her efforts in the field, and in the ſtudy, awed mankind to aſtoniſhment, her citizens were merely a collection of ſuperiour ſavages. Their depravity aſſumed, indeed, a more elegant form, but not an eſſentially different character. Rome ſyſtematized, and in a higher degree than any other State has ever done, war, oppreſſion, and devaſtation. Her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, alſo, was more ſkilfully adjuſted, and more firmly compacted, than the Grecian ſyſtems; but it was ſtill toſſed by tumult, and ſhattered by frequent violence. Her citizens were left to the ſame accidental improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, though poſſeſſed of a more ſpecious ſtateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than thoſe of Greece, were debaſed with the ſame groſſneſs and immanity. Accuſtomed, from our infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to ſtudy their hiſtory, to admire their talents, and to celebrate their exploits, we are prone to form a different eſtimate of theſe nations; yet by a very moderate exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination we ſhall find, that they furniſh us many things to admire, but few to approve, that, as moral beings, they are diſtinguiſhed with little advantage from various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whom they contemptuouſly ſtyled barbarians. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one of the firſt political errors of later ages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028610_0012_0FD9C5DF22F00FB0"/>
to be too high a reſpect for the ſtate of ſociety in Greece and Rome.</p>
            <p>There is, I believe, a more rational policy, beginning with a different aim, and purſuing public quiet in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more effectual manner. The primary mean of originating and eſtabliſhing happineſs, in free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, is, I imagine, the formation of a good perſonal character in their citizens. Good citizens muſt of courſe conſtitute a happier community than bad ones, and muſt better underſtand the nature and cauſes of their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They may ſafely be governed by a milder policy, and cannot but be better judges of the deſirableneſs of ſuch policy. More the children of reaſon, and leſs the ſlaves of appetite and paſſion, they will naturally be more ſatisfied with real happineſs, and leſs allured, by that, which, however ſhewy, is unſubſtantial; will need fewer reſtrictions, and be more contented under ſuch as are neceſſary; will prize more highly ſuch liberty, as is ſuited to the condition of man, and proportionally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard that, which is Utopian. Hence, ſuch citizens may probably be governed by juſtice, and Common-ſenſe; and will not neceſſitate the adoption of force and oppreſſion, or the employment of circumvention and ſtatecraft.</p>
            <p>A family is, in ſome reſpects, a ſtate in miniature. Children of bad perſonal characters can ſcarcely be gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned at all, and never, without conſtant exertions of terror and force. Children of a good character are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſwayed, without either. Mild and equitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, few and gentle interpoſitions of mere authority, united with argument and perſuaſion, will, in a family compoſed of ſuch children, effectually eſtabliſh domeſtic order, peace, and happineſs. This difference of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, this exemption from the neceſſity of exerting force and inſpiring terror, depends wholly on the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of thoſe, who are to be governed. To a State
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028610_0013_0FD9C618C49C38B8"/>
theſe truths are not leſs applicable. If the perſonal character of its citizens were perfectly good, there would be neither neceſſity, nor opportunity, of governing by force. That train of penalties, which conſtitutes a great part of the buſineſs of every Legiſlature, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of every ſtatute book, would ceaſe to exiſt, as it would ceaſe to be neceſſary; and the mere expreſſion of the public will would execute itſelf. The Sheriff would enjoy a ſinecure, and the jail moulder without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant.</p>
            <p>On this general principle was the prophecy of the Text written. Wiſdom and knowledge, the prophet declares, ſhall, at ſome future period, ſome period which I apprehend to be ſtill future, be the ſtability of the times, to which he refers: i. e. the public ſtability of the age; of one, or of more than one nation: or, in other words, the means of eſtabliſhing on firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions public happineſs.</p>
            <p>By Wiſdom, all Perſons who read the Bible know, the Sacred Writers commonly intend Virtue; and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in that enlarged and Evangelical ſenſe, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces Piety to God, Good-will to mankind, and the effectual Government of ourſelves. "The fear of the Lord," ſaid Jehovah, when diſcloſing this ineſtimable and hitherto unexplored ſubject, "that is Wiſdom." "The fear of the Lord," ſays Solomon, (Heb.) is the <hi>chief part</hi> of Wiſdom." "The Wiſdom, that is from above," ſays James, "is firſt pure, then peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy." As Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is properly defined to be that attribute of mind, which aims at the beſt ends, and chooſes the beſt means to accompliſh them; ſo Virtue, which ſteadily aims at the Glory of God, the Good of mankind, and the Good of ourſelves, the beſt poſſible ends, and which more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally than any other diſpoſition directs to the beſt means
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028610_0014_0FD9C5E3A3C04860"/>
of accompliſhing them, was, with peculiar propriety, ſtyled Wiſdom by the penmen of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Virtue may be defined—The Love of doing good. It will be eaſily ſeen from this definition, if allowed to be juſt, that it can be but one indiviſible Attribute of mind. Yet, as the objects, towards which it is exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are materially different, it has been divided, for the purpoſes of conſideration, into the three great branches already mentioned. It ought to be obſerved, that it is not a paſſion, nor an aggregate of paſſions; but a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or diſpoſition, habitual, active, and governing. It is the mental energy, directed ſteadily to that which is right.</p>
            <p>God, the greateſt object in the Univerſe, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more important and worthy than all others, demands, of courſe, the ſupreme regard of every rational being. The firſt, the moſt obligatory, and the moſt noble exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Virtue is the Love and Reverence of this Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Being, generally termed Piety.</p>
            <p>Our fellow creatures, collectively, form the next great object of our regard. Virtue, exerciſed towards them, has very properly been denominated Good-will or Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence; a name deſcriptive of all right affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and including juſtice, faithfulneſs, kindneſs, truth, forgiveneſs, and all thoſe, which, are frequently ſtyled the Social Virtues.</p>
            <p>To himſelf every Man is alſo an important object of regard. Virtue, as exerciſed towards ourſelves, includes every juſt deſire and vindicable purſuit of our real good; but it is principally employed in regulating and confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within due bounds our appetites and paſſions; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the human mind, which perpetually prompt to wrong, and which, without a continual and vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, invariably diſhonour God, injure our fellow men, and ruin ourſelves. Thus exerciſed, Virtue is termed Temperance, or Self-government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028610_0015_0FD9C5E10B53DF30"/>It is unneceſſary for me to remark to this Audience, that all human conduct ſprings from the human will; that this is the only active principle in man; and that, as the will is directed to good, or evil, right, or wrong, man invariably does that, which is evil, or that which is good. The real importance of Virtue to the happineſs of Society lies in this; that Virtue is an uniform direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will to that which is good. When man is virtuous, therefore, his diſpoſition, the ſource of all his conduct, being ſteadily pointed to that, which is good, and right, his conduct muſt, of courſe, be alſo right and good. Hence Virtue of neceſſity aims at the happineſs of Society. A man's private intereſt may, for a time, and in his own view, be promoted by wrong; but the intereſts of a community can never be, for a moment, promoted but by that which is right. A ſelfiſh, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate intereſt claſhes with that of every neighbour, and cannot be advanced, but to the injury of the common good. Avarice always robs; ambition always oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and ſenſuality always wounds. Virtue, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, invariably ſeeks the common welfare, and gives no pain, where it is not indiſpenſably neceſſary for the promotion of that welfare.</p>
            <p>Virtue is, alſo, a principle ſufficiently powerful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to make all the happineſs, which Society can enjoy. It is the whole energy of the Deity; and of every perfect being; and may become the whole energy of man. It often has become ſufficiently powerful to produce the higheſt ſelf-denial, of which man in his preſent ſtate is capable; and is not uncommonly of ſuch ſtrength, as to conſtitute the only active character. Greater exertions have rarely ſprung from ſelfiſhneſs, than have ſprung from virtue. The labours of Alfred were not inferior to thoſe of Caeſar; nor were thoſe of the proudeſt and moſt ambitious Philoſopher to be named with thoſe of Paul.</p>
            <p>As Virtue is the genuine, the invariable, and the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſource of public happineſs, ſo it is in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028610_0016_0FD9C5E4CD326B00"/>
its ſtability. As it is its natural tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce happineſs, ſo this is always and equally its tendency. Wherever, and how long ſoever, it exiſts, the happineſs, of which it is the parent, will alſo exiſt.</p>
            <p>Good-will to Mankind, accompliſhes directly moſt of thoſe deſirable objects, at which the political Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Laws, of Society aim; It makes men honeſt, juſt, faithful, ſubmiſſive to government, and friendly to each other, without reſtrictions, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and renders magiſtrates equitable, public ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and merciful, without checks, factions, or rebellions. And all this it can accompliſh, without labour, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, without force, turmoil or terrour.</p>
            <p>Self-government, on the other hand, effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains from all thoſe evils in Society, to prevent which is the principal employment of Laws and of Magiſtrates. With far more efficacy, and incomparably more eaſe, than the poſt and the priſon, the gibbet and the croſs, does it deter from fraud, revenge, impurity, theft, robbery, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rebellion. At the ſame time, it guards from ten thouſand other evils, which no Law can reſtrain, and which, often, are not leſs pernicious to Society, than thoſe overt and glaring acts, which are the objects of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial deciſion. Its influence on the Magiſtrate is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propitious; nor are the private evils, which I have ſpecified more effectually prevented, than the extenſive and enormous miſchiefs of corruption, peculation, and tyranny.</p>
            <p>With regard to the advantage and neceſſity of Good-will to public happineſs, there has never been any debate, except that, which reſpects all Virtue, viz. Whether it is neceſſary, that men ſhould be principled to purſue the good of Society; or whether it is ſufficient, to require the actions conducive to this end, without any regard to the principle. This queſtion I ſhall diſcuſs in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028610_0017_0FD9C61C94DA4D78"/>With regard to the neceſſity of Self-government to the happineſs of Society a debate has always exiſted. In every Community men are found, who ſteadily inſiſt, that the indulgence of thoſe deſires which are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priately termed Appetites is juſtifiable, and in no way noxious to the public good. Were men brutes, and connected on equal terms with a republic of ſwine, goats, and ſwift-peters, this ſentiment would at leaſt plead ſome pretence in its behalf; and Reaſon would not be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo often to bluſh for the human character, when it read, to this effect, the labours of infidel philosophers, or heard the converſation of equally rational ſenſualiſts.</p>
            <p>The man of ſloth, the drone of Society, who adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the common ſtock, and lives on the labours and ſpoils of others, might yet be borne, were not his ſloth the flood-gate of wickedneſs. Idle to do good, he is a pattern of induſtry in doing evil. In his merely ſlothful character, every morſel, which he taſtes, is the plunder of his neighbour, and every act of his enjoyment a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predation on Society. To conſole them for the injuſtice, with a reſtleſs mind, and hands diligent in miſchief, he conſumes his time, and employs his talents, in gambling, horſeracing, cheating, ſtealing, receiving from thieves, corrupting youth, diſturbing good order, and purſuing an univerſal round of noxious labours and pernicious diverſions.</p>
            <p>If idleneſs, prodigality, the ruin of health, reputation, and uſefulneſs, the depravation of every mental and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faculty, the mortification of friends, the deſtruction of the peace, comfort, and hopes, of his family, and the exhibition of a contagious and peſtilential example, are not injurious to a Community, the drunkard, and the glutton, will undoubtedly ſtand on new ground, and may with new confidence bring forward a putrid carcaſe, and a putrid mind, to the public eye, and inſiſt, that they are ſound, uſeful, and healthy members of the Body politic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028610_0018_0FD9C5EC6042FCC8"/>The man of lewdneſs is in a condition even leſs hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. He unceaſingly ſcatters fire-brands, arrows, and death, on all around him. He profeſſes, indeed, to be in ſport, and merely to purſue his own amuſement; but the ſufferings of thoſe, who are unhappily within his reach, make that amuſement a very ſerious concern to them. He lives but to injure, and acts but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. The burglar plunders the purſe; the murderer cuts off the life, and hurries his unhappy victim to an untimely grave. The man of Lewdneſs robs the parent of his child, the huſband of his wife, and the family of their mother; murders houſhold peace, character, and happineſs; plunges the dagger of death into the ſoul, and hurries the victim of his luſt into the abyſs of the damned. The plunder of the burglar may be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the loſs may be borne: the victim of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer may live beyond the grave, and the unhappy mourners may with this hope ſoothe their excruciating ſorrows: but no means can reſtore, no mind can ſuſtain, the plunder of peace; no balſam was ever found for the ulcer of infamy; no ſkill can rebuild a ruined fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor can any artiſt repair the wrecks of a ſoul. Such is the innocence of the Leacher; and, were not too great multitudes intereſted in protecting and conniving at vice, the chace of the wolf and the tyger would be forgotten, and he, in their ſtead, would be hunted from the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men.</p>
            <p>Piety, the remaining branch of Virtue, although its utility, and its neceſſity to public happineſs, has been more frequently queſtioned, and denied, is, probably at leaſt as uſeful, and as neceſſary to this object, as either of the other branches. It will, I preſume, be allowed to be wholly rational, and probable, that there are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the creation, worlds, where the Creator is wholly reſpected according to his character; and where infinite greatneſs and excellence not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but obtain, a love, reverence, and obedience, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028610_0019_0FD9C61DEC086E30"/>
to their nature. That there is one ſuch world, the Bible directly declares. In ſuch a world, it is evident, Piety is the whole ſource of order, peace, and happineſs. Perfect itſelf, it there renders the whole moral ſyſtem perfect, and ſpontaneouſly produces that obedience to the divine government, which is leſs effectually produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here by threatenings and judgments. As Piety is the foundation, in that world, of the order and peace, on which all ſocial happineſs depends, it is rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it muſt be the natural foundation, in any other world, of proportional order and peace; and that, ſo far as it exiſts, it will benefit earth, as well as heaven, men, as well as angels, and any particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as mankind in general. In other words, as Piety appears to be the foundation of the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect intellectual happineſs; ſo it is to be deemed the real, the natural, and the univerſal foundation of ſocial good.</p>
            <p>From Piety, alſo, the other exerciſes of Virtue derive a higher diſtinction, are preſented with ſtronger motives, and enforced by more ſolemn ſanctions, than can ſpring from any other ſource.</p>
            <p>All the duties which we owe to mankind, are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſideration of Piety, viewed as merely due to men; worms of the duſt, beings of yeſterday, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of vanity and ſin. To ſuch beings moral obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though real, muſt be of comparatively little import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and operate with little force. But in the eye of Piety all theſe duties are enhanced, beyond meaſure, by the conſideration, that they are enjoined by God, and that, of courſe, every fulfilment of moral obligation to our neighbour is the performance of a duty to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. The ſame remarks are, with equal force, applied to the duties of Self-government. As much greater, therefore, as much more excellent, and as much more poſſeſſed of a right to require our ſervice, as God is,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028610_0020_0FD9C5EDC778B070"/>
than men, juſt ſo much more importance, and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does Piety give to theſe branches of Virtue, than they could otherwiſe receive.</p>
            <p>The principal motives to virtue are evidently the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure found in the practice of it—the eſteem, affection, and beneficence which it excites in our fellow creatures— the approbation and love of God—and the expectation of future rewards and puniſhments. The two firſt of theſe motives muſt certainly operate with as great, and the two laſt with much greater influence, on Piety, than on any other ſuppoſable character. To the eye of Piety God appears, as a Being totally different from that, which is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally formed by every other eye. His character is inveſted with an importance wholly new. His approbation, love, and rewards, on the one hand, and his abhorrence, anger, and puniſhments, on the other, appear as objects real and boundleſs. Primary objects of attention, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come primary concerns; and are not only ſeen by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, but directly felt to involve all the intereſts of man. Hence they become the directory of thought, and the law of action.</p>
            <p>A clear and fixed ſenſe of moral obligation is, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the opinion of moſt men, indiſpenſably neceſſary to the diſcharge of the duties, and to the production of the happineſs of Society. But ſuch a ſenſe, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, is to be looked for in Piety alone. The ſtrength of moral obligation lies wholly in the conviction, that a conſtant adherence to it is obedience to the will of God. But almoſt all the regard, which is rendered to God, or to his will, is rendered by the pious. Imperfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultory feelings of this nature, feelings which are yet of no ſmall importance, will generally be found, where a religious education has given birth to juſt moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and eſpecially where general influence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, united with public inſtruction, have cultivated ſuch ſentiments into habit. Beyond theſe limits nothing can be expected, nothing is commonly profeſſed, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028610_0021_0FD9C6228D8388A0"/>
nothing will ever be found, beſide the changing power of faſhionable opinion, the ſlippery dependence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal honour, and the accidental coincidence of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with duty.</p>
            <p>The great ſupport of moral obligation, in the preſent world, is the belief of God's moral government, of our accountableneſs to him, and of an approaching ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. The deſire of happineſs, and the dread of miſery, is a part of the intelligent, and even of the animal nature, and is inſeparable from the faculty of perception. As all happineſs, and all miſery, are ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately derived from the hand of God, and as no bounds can be ſet to the degree, or the continuance, of either, beſide thoſe, which he is pleaſed to ſet, this object comes home to every heart with a power totally peculiar. Its efficacy reaches all places, times, and perſons: all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I mean, beſide the fool, who hath ſaid in his heart, "There is no God." Its ſuperiour efficacy on men of piety I have already explained.</p>
            <p>In a world, like this, where the depravity of man is proclaimed by every Law, is engraven on the altars of every Religion, and is written with a pen of adamant on the iron page of Hiſtory, how deſirable is it, that this great motive to duty, this great ſanction of moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſhould, inſtead of being leſſened by ſophiſtry, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule, and neglect, be preſerved and ſtrengthened to the utmoſt, to ſave Society from thoſe numerous evils, of which it is the only remedy, and to prompt men to thoſe indiſpenſable duties, to which it is often the only effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motive?</p>
            <p>In addition to theſe obſervations it may be juſtly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, without Piety, the other branches of Virtue are never found. There has been no proof either from fact, or from argument, hitherto adduced, to ſhew, that one branch of Virtue can exiſt independently of the others. All the heathens, both individuals and nations, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028610_0022_0FD9C5EE59F22E70"/>
their fellow men in the moſt equitable manner, and who regulated themſelves with the greateſt decency, were diſtinguiſhed by reverence for the gods. Among Chriſtians, alſo, there is no want of evidence, to prove, that impious men are alike deſtitute of benevolence and ſelf-government, and that the appearances, which are ſound, of theſe characteriſtics, in thoſe who are not pious, are the accidental reſult of convenience, or neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But the ſubject will eaſily, and, I apprehend, perfectly explain itſelf. Juſtice in man is the love of that which is juſt. But can he, in whom this principle exiſts, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to his Maker? Can he be willing, and principled, to render to Caeſar the things which are Caeſar's, and not to God the things which are God's? Or can any thing be Caeſar's with ſuch abſolute right, as he, his talents, time, and ſervices, are God's? Gratitude is an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſenſe of benefits, and a proportionate love to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. But can any man be grateful to a human, who is not grateful to the Divine, Benefactor? Generally, can a man love intelligent being at all, who does not love the Infinite Intelligent; or be at all virtuous, unleſs his virtue be directed primarily to that Being, who is, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond all others, excellent, lovely and beneficent?</p>
            <p>Whether it be deſirable for Society, that its members ſhould be principled to promote its happineſs, or not; is a queſtion, which cannot be aſked without a bluſh, nor anſwered without a ſmile. It is to aſk whether it would be better for Society, that its happineſs ſhould be great, ſtable, and ſecure; or ſmall, fluctuating, and accidental. There is no ſteady ſource of public or private good, but principle; and there is, in this ſenſe, no principle, but Virtue. To Virtue public good neceſſarily appears, and is enjoined by an Authority inſtinctively obeyed (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God) as a primary object of regard. To a mind not virtuous it is, of courſe, and alway, an object ſubordinate, accidental, and ſolitary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028610_0023_0FD9C625D1FE6260"/>On the inhabitants of a land, univerſally virtuous, the peculiar bleſſings of Heaven may, alſo, be rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to deſcend. Where human weakneſs errs, where human power falters, and where human means prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, God may, both on rational and evangelical grounds, be expected to open his beneficent hand, and ſupply the neceſſary good. Here, alſo, Virtue may be ſafely pronounced to be the ſtability of public happineſs.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough, that the members of a Society aim at that, which will promote the general good; they muſt alſo know what it is. Knowledge is, therefore, with the utmoſt propriety deſignated in the text, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſource of this ſtability.</p>
            <p>In examining this part of the ſubject, it will be uſeful to conſider the kind, the diffuſion, and the effects, of that knowledge, which is intended by the Prophet.</p>
            <p>It will undoubtedly be conceded, that he intended that knowledge, which is real, and not merely nominal; that, alſo, which is practical, and therefore uſeful; and, of courſe, that, which is moral, or in other words, the moſt practical, and the moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all real knowledge, and all practical knowledge, is derived either from Experience, or from Revelation. Theories are generally mere dreams, which ought to be placed on the ſame level with the profeſſed fictions of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and to be written in verſe, and not in ſober proſe. Tho' dignified with the pompous title of Philoſophy, they have uſually, after amuſing the world, a little time, gone down the ſtream of contempt into the ocean of oblivion. They cannot be practical, becauſe they cannot be true; and hence, being of no uſe, except to pleaſe the imagination, they are of courſe neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <p>There is in the human mind a faculty, called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſenſe, which, though never in high eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Philoſophers, ſeems to have originated, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028610_0024_0FD9C5F1DE499DC8"/>
almoſt all the plans of human buſineſs which have proved to be of any uſe. The reaſon is obvious. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in forming near and evident deductions from facts, and in cloſely obſerving facts for that purpoſe, contented with moderate advances, and cautious of innovation, its ſtep, though ſlow, has been ſure; a real approximation to the end in view. Theory, or the contrary, rapid, but wild, has uſually receded more than it has advanced. Untried cauſes, cauſes to which a new application is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and experiments in buſineſs, made either a new, or in new circumſtances, have always been regarded by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſenſe with a ſuſpicious eye; and a ſtate of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not perfectly deſirable, willingly endured, in preference to the adoption of new ſyſtems, of which the effects were uncertain, and the operations dangerous.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of government, formed for South-Carolina, by Mr. Locke, may ſtand as a portrait of all political theories. Fair and rational on paper, but deformed and uſeleſs in practice, it ſuited the real circumſtances of that Colony, juſt as a map, drawn by the fancy of a Geograph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would ſuit an undiſcovered country; or a chart of ſoundings, marked by the Navigator, in ſport, would ſuit the real ſtate of an untraverſed ocean. If this Giant in underſtanding failed ſo entirely in an attempt to form a theoretical ſyſtem of government, reducible to practice, of what character muſt be the attempts of modern pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</p>
            <p>That the knowledge, communicated by Experience and Revelation, was intended in this prophecy, will be evident to all perſons, who remember, that this was the only knowledge in exiſtence, when the prophecy was written. Viſionary Philoſophy had not then begun to miſlead mankind. The world was contented with real knowledge; and, although its ſtock was ſmall, it was genuine and unalloyed, and therefore of a currency and uſe, ſuited to human purpoſes. Had its progreſs been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028610_0025_0FD9C629C9F4F728"/>
by war and devastation, and unbewildered by theoretical Philoſophy, we ſhould now probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, in real knowledge, many degrees beyond our preſent advances.</p>
            <p>A general diffuſion of knowledge, was undoubtedly deſigned in this prediction. In no other ſenſe could knowledge be ſuppoſed to be the means of general ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>The effects of knowledge, thus defined, are evidently of high importance to ſocial happineſs. The Legiſlator it will enable to underſtand the ſtate, the intereſts, and the duties, of a people; to form regulations ſuited to their ſtate, promotive of their intereſts, and coinciding with their duty; to diſcern, with a freedom from low and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious prejudices, that equitable government is the true ſource of honour to himſelf, and of proſperity to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to caſt his eyes abroad, without the purblind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of narrow minds, and ſee clearly the real condition of other nations, and their proper connection with the affairs of his own; to look back with diſtinctneſs, and with comprehenſion, on the paſt ſtate of human ſociety, and forward, with rational prediction, to events which are riſing on the ſurface of futurity. In a word, placed by ſuch knowledge on a lofty ſummit, he ſtands as a Watchman for the welfare of millions, unobſtructed by miſts, and undazzled by the height to which he is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with a ſteady eye marks diſtinctly the ſurrounding progreſs of things, and is enabled with confidence, and with ſafety, to utter alike the quieting voice of peace, and the timely alarm of danger.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner is the Judge enabled to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and interpret law, to form equitable deciſions, to exerciſe his diſcretionary authority in extending or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricting penalties, and generally to hold with an equal hand the balance of right, between neighbour and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and between ſubjects and the ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028610_0026_0FD9C5F54C1EB4F8"/>To maintain the dignity of government, to impreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his own office, to ſecure the general approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the execution of punitive juſtice, to ſtop at the bounds of law and right, and to mingle mercy with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by chooſing the leaſt diſtreſſing methods of enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judicial deciſions, are employments which conſtitute the duty of the Executive magiſtrate; employments, which demand, perhaps in an equal degree, clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and extenſive information, and which hazard, without it, the public proſperity, and the public peace.</p>
            <p>Nor are the people at large leſs intereſted in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above deſcribed. Stability of public happineſs, eſpecially in free States, depends wholly on the character of the citizens in general. Nor can it exiſt, unleſs they underſtand diſtinctly the rights and the duties of freemen, the duties of magistrates, the requiſitions of law, the common intereſt and the means of promoting it, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous nature of war, the beneficent influence of peace, the relations of men in Society to each other, and the character, which thoſe ought to ſuſtain, who are contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated as objects of the public ſuffrage. Equally uſeful is knowledge in teaching them the duties of Parents, children, friends, and neighbours, the nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of a happy domeſtic education, the advantages of mild and obliging conduct, the univerſal profit of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the miſchiefs of vice of every kind, in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and towards every perſon. Highly important is knowledge, alſo, to give that perſonal reſpectability, and to ſecure that rational eſteem, which excites and gratifies laudable ambition; to fill with profitable amuſement the hours of leiſure, and of age; to capacitate for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of uſeful and neceſſary buſineſs; and to furniſh means of improvement in the ſeveral arts and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life. In a word, from knowledge muſt, in a great meaſure, be derived that ſteadineſs of character, that poſſeſſion of comforts, and that rational eſtimation of things, which form the uſeful citizen, and the reſpectable Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:028610_0027_0FD9C62D608CCB50"/>From theſe obſervations, I flatter myſelf, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the ſtability of public happineſs is produced by Knowledge and Virtue; and that the diffusion of theſe through a Community is the true and the only method of ſolving that political problem, which has ſo long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the rulers of mankind. By theſe great attributes men are made good members of ſociety; and, compoſed of ſuch members, a Society muſt be happy. They form, they finiſh, the magiſtrate and the citizen alike. They teach every duty, and prompt to every performance. They originate wiſe and equitable laws, juſt deciſions and uſeful administrations. They create the amiable conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and houſhold offices, produce effectual domeſtic edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, train to early and happy habits, and conduct to family peace, neighbourly kindneſs, a cheerful ſubmiſſion to law, a ſteady love of rational government, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal growth of ſocial enjoyment. Sweet and ſalubrious ſtreams, they nouriſh happineſs wherever they paſs; and, enlarging and mingling in their progreſs, ſpread, in the end, an ocean of bleſſings over the millions, who inhabit an empire.</p>
            <p>It will not be improper to add, that the moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able political writers have, with one voice, declared Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be indiſpenſably neceſſary to the exiſtence of a free Government. As this ſentiment has been adopted in oppoſition to many prejudices, and intereſts, religious and ſecular, and adopted by them all, it may be fairly ſuppoſed to be the reſult of conviction and evidence. Perhaps it may have ariſen, in part, from the following view of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Government is rendered effectual by two great engines —force and perſuaſion. Force is the inſtrument of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm, and perſuaſion of free and rational government. To produce perſuaſion, it is always neceſſary to inſpire confidence. To inſpire confidence in ſubjects towards rulers, it is neceſſary for ſubjects to be ſatisfied, that their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028610_0028_0FD9C5F9110C6910"/>
rulers are poſſeſſed of knowledge to diſcern, and of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to aim at, the general good. To inſpire confidence in rulers towards ſubjects, it is neceſſary for rulers to be ſatisfied, that their ſubjects poſſeſs knowledge to diſcern, and virtue to approve, the real wiſdom and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of public meaſures. With theſe prerequiſites, rulers will with confidence purſue the public intereſt; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will with equal confidence ſupport their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: without them, the ruler, fearful and ſuſpicious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in perplexity and always in danger, will feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to have recourſe to art, cabal, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, to keep in motion the wheels of government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſubjects anxious, jealous, and impatient, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fluctuate between hope and fear, flock at every call to the ſtandard of faction, and prove the prey of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very demagogue.</p>
            <p>Facts, alſo, lend their evidence to ſupport this doctrine. Sparta and Rome were the moſt ſtable of all the ancient republics. Virtue, in the ſenſe of the Goſpel, they had not; but, in their early periods, they were, to an unuſual degree, poſſeſſed of what is called heathen virtue. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moſt, perhaps beyond all, the heathen nations, they feared their gods, reverenced an oath, and believed in a providence, which rewarded the good, and puniſhed the evil. Their ideas of truth and juſtice, however crude, were fixed; and they admitted fewer corruptions and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olations of the principles, which they eſteemed ſacred, than moſt other nations. While this was their conduct, their public happineſs, though imperfect, was ſtable; and, with the fall of theſe principles, it tumbled to the ground.</p>
            <p>Among the modern nations of Europe, Switzerland, eſpecially in ſome of its Cantons, holds the higheſt rank in public happineſs. For more than 400 years, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed country has withſtood every ſhock from within, and from without, and appears ſtill to reſt on firm found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028610_0029_0FD9C630867E4310"/>
Equally remarkable has this country been for knowledge and virtue. In no State, in Europe, have the inhabitants at large poſſeſſed equal information, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited equal proofs of piety and unblemiſhed morals. To theſe cauſes their happineſs is directly traced by every enlightened traveller. Happy Switzerland! God has created for thee thy walls and thy bulwarks. Under his good providence, thy bravery has made thee free, and thy knowledge and virtue have made thee happy.</p>
            <p>On this ſide of the Atlantic, Connecticut, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and increaſing acknowledgement, appears to hold, in this reſpect, the firſt ſtation. The happineſs of this State, for one hundred and fifty years, has ſuffered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from external enemies, little diminution. Its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, cuſtoms, manners, and general ſtate of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have ſcarcely been changed, but by the gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of refinement. Formed, at firſt, in all the great outlines, and nearly filled up, by men, whoſe diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rectitude of diſpoſition, led, of courſe, to juſtneſs of opinion, and whoſe ſound Common-ſenſe, improved by cloſe obſervation, did not lead to error, its Conſtitution, although, in many reſpects, a violation of political theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, has been found more than any other to be fitted for practice. Public and private happineſs its inhabitants have, in a high, perhaps an unrivalled, degree, enjoyed. In no country has Virtue, for ſo long a period, been held in higher eſtimation, received more marks of public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or more emphatically formed the general character. Knowledge, at the ſame time has, in an almoſt ſingular manner, been diffuſed through the maſs of people. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parent in the State has a ſchool placed in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; and every child is furniſhed with the means of the moſt neceſſary inſtruction. To aid, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, theſe peculiar advantages, a church in every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of a moderate ſize, opens its doors; to the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inhabitants, and invites every family to receive the knowledge, communicated by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:028610_0030_0FD9C5F913678B68"/>The ſame doctrine might be even more ſtrongly illuſtrated, if the time would permit, from the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contraſt to the picture already drawn, preſented by the deſolations and miſeries of vice and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Almoſt all the hiſtory of mankind is an exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this nature; for vice and ignorance have in moſt inſtances prevailed without a mixture, and reigned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul. Rulers have trampled on the necks, riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſpoils, and ſported with the miſeries, of their ſubjects. Subjects have fallen before them with impious homage, and ſlaviſh brutiſm, or reſcued themſelves from oppreſſion, to run mad with the phrenzy of anarchy, and to wanton in plunder and blood. Nations, as if in love with miſery, and unſatisfied to ſee their ſufferings ſo ſmall, have reached out an eager hand to graſp at woe. War has been the profeſſion of man, and arms his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of buſineſs, and of pleaſure. Conqueſt, like a roaring lion, has ſtalked round the deſolated globe, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he might devour. In his train, Ambition has ſmoked with ſlaughter; Avarice has ground the poor into duſt; and Pollution, like the meſſenger of death to the army of Sennacherib, has changed the hoſt of man into putrified corpſes. Fiends have looked on, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed; Angels have wondered, and wept; and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as if diſcouraged from efforts, has given up its work to waſte and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The end of the obſervations, which I have made, is to impreſs on the minds of this audience the importance of public and individual exertions to promote knowledge and virtue in this State. If the obſervations are juſt, the value of the object will not be diſputed. But it is one thing to be convinced of the importance of an object, and another to feel it in ſuch a manner, as to be rouſed into exertion in its behalf. Ignorance of the moſt proper methods of exertion, difficulties always preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in its progreſs, and doubts concerning its ſucceſs, added to native indolence, eaſily damp the riſing effort,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028610_0031_0FD9C6365EBBEB80"/>
and incline us to ſhift the burden from ourſelves to others, and to reſt ſatisfied with the general opiate of conſcience, that our attempts will be vain, and may, therefore, be ſafely neglected.</p>
            <p>To ſtrengthen this enervating concluſion in our minds, we naturally ſummon to our aid the general voice of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man experience. "The courſe of human affairs," we eaſily ſay, and ſay with ſome degree of truth, "has been a conſtant exhibition of extreme difficulty, ever found in extending and eſtabliſhing virtue in the preſent world. The volume of man is written only in black; and page after page, when carefully turned over, is ſeen to be marked only with lines of vice, ignorance, and ſorrow. Centuries have rolled on, without a beam of light; and Continents, throughout their expanded regions, have reeked with the ſlaughter of man, and echoed to the voice of mourning and miſery. Intervals have indeed appeared of a brighter aſpect; and favoured tracts have, at times, enjoyed the twilight promiſe of approaching day. But how few have been theſe envied exceptions to the general character of time, and to the general ſtate of the world! What miniatures of happineſs, knowledge, and virtue muſt we oppoſe to the gigantic figures of war, and woe, of idolatry and brutiſm! A few years form the only contraſt to ſixty centuries; and Switzerland is that ſmall duſt of the balance, which muſt be weighed againſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica and Aſia."</p>
            <p>Such is the language of ſloth and diſcouragement. In the main it is true; but it is not the whole truth. The few experiments, which have been imperfectly made, to diffuſe knowledge, and implant and cultivate virtue, in the maſs of mankind, have ſufficiently proved, that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for this end may be ſucceſsful; and that, when man has prepared the ground, and ſown the ſeed, Heaven will refuſe neither the rain, nor the ſunſhine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:028610_0032_0FD9C5FE9B40D650"/>The whole cultivation of virtue is a conflict with vice; but the warfare is honourable, and the victory fruitful in advantage, beyond the reach of computation. Nothing valuable comes to man, without his cooperation; and the toil is commonly proportioned to the worth of the acquiſition. As the diffuſion of Virtue over a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the firſt ſocial bleſſing, ſo it ought, according to the analogy of Providence, to be expected to demand greater efforts, than any other bleſſing. Liberty has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been the price of lives ſcarcely numerable, and of property exceeding calculation. Yet Liberty is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of leſs importance than Virtue. Had half the efforts been made to promote virtue, which have been made to extend war and ſlaughter, virtue would now, probably, conſtitute the prevailing human character. But Virtue, though the firſt good of man, has leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his attention.</p>
            <p>Wherever exertions have been made for the extenſion of virtue, ſucceſs has followed. Under the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by the labours, of the Apoſtles, its progreſs was a greater miracle to the eye, than all thoſe, which they performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as means of its exiſtence. With the gradual decay of effort it gradually ceaſed. At the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, exertion roſe to a character almoſt Apoſtolic, and ſucceſs attended it, like that of the Apoſtles. In Switzerland, Holland, Scotland, England, and in ſome parts of the American States, the growth and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Virtue has, at times, and through a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble period, been fully proportioned to the efforts in its behalf, and anſwered every rational hope. There is, therefore, from experience, no reaſon for diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, be ſaid, that Virtue is the gift of God. This is no objection to the ſentiments, here advanced. It is their ſupport. Every bleſſing is the gift of God. The harveſt is as truly his gift, as Virtue. Nor is there a reaſon to believe, that he will leſs willingly meet, with
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028610_0033_0FD9C63749963170"/>
his bleſſing, him, who labours to adorn the mind with moral beauty, and to plant in it the ſeeds of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than him, who, with equal induſtry, is employed in dreſſing the earth in verdure, and in filling the field with bread.</p>
            <p>That knowledge may be effectually diffuſed through a Community will not be doubted.</p>
            <p>On the methods, by which theſe great attributes of the mind, theſe great means of Social happineſs, maybe moſt effectually cultivated, and eſtabliſhed, I have much to ſay; and feel it to be a misfortune, that ſo large a part of my time ſeemed neceſſary to prepare a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the whole was neceſſary to raiſe the ſtructure. To the time, however, I muſt conform, and important as I deem the ſubject, muſt diſmiſs it with mere hints, and heads of diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The Laws of every country have all, or may have, an important influence on this ſubject. The formation and eſtabliſhment of knowledge and virtue in the citizens of a Community is the firſt buſineſs of Legiſlation, and will more eaſily and more effectually eſtabliſh order, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liberty, than all the checks, balances, and penalties, which have been deviſed by man. With the Legiſlature this buſineſs ſhould begin; and with reference to it moſt, if not all, their important meaſures ought to be concerted. They wiſh, doubtleſs, to do good to their country. In this way they can do more good to it, than in any other. Were this ſentiment, in full ſtrength, in the mind of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Legiſlator, the object could not fail of being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
            <p>In the exact execution of Law, thoſe magiſtrates, to whom this duty is entruſted, may find an extenſive field for the employment of this moſt honourable patriotiſm. It is not an uncommon, nor unfounded opinion, that the duties of executive officers are, here, leſs punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, than the public good demands; and that too
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028610_0034_0FD9C5FFC6521290"/>
ſtrong a ſpirit of accommodation is become their cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary character. Little crimes appear, unhappily, to be paſſed over with inattention, and thus prepare the way for thoſe which are greater. It is deſirable, that no Laws, beſide neceſſary ones, ſhould exiſt; but is equally and even more deſirable, that every exiſting Law ſhould be execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In an effectual Grand-Jury this State is unhappily and ſingularly defective, and ſuffers daily from the defect. Until this evil ſhall be remedied, one wide door to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality and unhappineſs will be unneceſſarily left open.</p>
            <p>Calumny againſt the ſeveral Officers, employed in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernmental duty, is one of the moſt obvious methods of weakening government. The eſteem of the Community is, in all countries, an object of no ſmall importance to perſons in public agency; but, in this country, it is of the higheſt importance. The magiſtrate, here, is raiſed above others by his office only; and the eſteem, which he wiſhes to obtain, is the eſteem of his peers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. To deprive him of this eſteem is to deprive him, in a ſenſe, of his all; and to do it wantonly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly is to act the part of an enemy, and a ſavage. "Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the ruler of thy people" is equally a law of Revelation, and of Common ſenſe. If Rulers tranſgreſs, and act with fraud, or injuſtice, the path of regular impeachment is open, and ought to be purſued. Mere political ſlander is the reſult of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of malice; and is as miſchievous in its effects, as baſe in its origin. The length, to which it has already proceeded, is great; the length, to which it will proceed, cannot be calculated. A ſmall degree of foreſight, will, however, enable us to decide, that, ſhould it not be check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the poſſeſſion of office will, of itſelf, be eſteemed, ere long, an adequate proof of diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>But as Public happineſs depends, in this country, at leaſt, on the perſonal character of its inhabitants at large, ſo the promotion of public happineſs muſt, in a great
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028610_0035_0FD9C63D0D199788"/>
meaſure, reſt on perſonal exertions. Men of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, who wiſh the end accompliſhed, muſt unite to furniſh the means.</p>
            <p>The primary mean of this end has, I flatter myſelf, been proved to be Virtue. States may be rich, powerful, and free; and yet not be happy. Antiquity furniſhes us with a long and pompous liſt of rich and powerful States; but ſcarcely with one, in which the great body of citizens in this State would not, if fairly informed in the hiſtory of thoſe States, be wholly unwilling to live; life, in our view, being hardly worth poſſeſſing, if it muſt be paſſed in ſo wretched a ſtate of Society. The ſame obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with nearly the ſame force, may be applied to almoſt all the preſent States of Europe. The Griſons, allies of the Switzers, are, by their Conſtitution of government, the freeſt people, perhaps, of any on the Eaſtern Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Still they are an unhappy people. They have neither virtue to deſire, nor knowledge to underſtand, the common intereſt. Juſtice, ſuffrages, and the whole pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic weal, are, among them, ſold annually, like goods in the market. Hence, with the fulleſt poſſeſſion of liberty, they are equally contemptible and wretched.</p>
            <p>There are two great means of promoting virtue; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Education and Public Worſhip. Religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation prepares the mind to love, to attend, and to profit by public worſhip; and public worſhip ſupports and regulates religious education. Without public worſhip, children would ceaſe to be religiouſly educated; and without religious education, public worſhip would ceaſe to be attended.</p>
            <p>To render public worſhip uſeful, it muſt be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, to make it frequented, it muſt, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts with its nature, be made pleaſing. For this purpoſe, the miniſters of this worſhip muſt, ſo far as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men will allow, be perſons of knowledge, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and dignity. To ſecure, in any country, a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028610_0036_0FD9C602F5CD3950"/>
of ſuch miniſters, their ſupport ought to be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the ſource neither of ſplendour and luxury on the one hand, nor of ſuffering and meanneſs on the other. Opulent livings would invite, and would be filled by thoſe, who moſt covet opulence; the aſpiring, and the unprincipled. A bare living would be leſt to ſloth, and ignorance. A rich and proud miniſtry would be inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to the poor, and the humble; a miniſtry ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling under penury would tremble at the frowns of the rich, and the great. The ſupport of miniſters ought alſo to be ſecure, and endangered by nothing, but their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct. Precarious livings, beſide their expoſure to all the evils of ſcanty ones, would furniſh, to the incumbents, daily temptations to ſacrifice conſcience and duty to the whims, and the vices, of thoſe, from whoſe goodwill they hoped to derive their daily bread. No Youth, poſſeſſed of learning, dignity, and worth, can be expected to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himſelf on the ocean of life, in a bark, which ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently announces a ſpeedy and certain ſhipwreck, by its total want of ſtrength, and ſafety, for the voyage.</p>
            <p>Religion is always eſtimated by the character of its miniſters. If they are generally vile, the religion, which they profeſs, is generally abhorred; if contemptible, it is deſpiſed; but, if worthy and dignified, it cannot but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Thus intimate and inſeparable is the permanent and ſufficient ſupport of the miniſters of religion with virtue, and of courſe with the exiſtence, and the ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of public happineſs.</p>
            <p>Religious education, in the firſt inſtance, is domeſtic. To the early mind, parents are the miniſters of religion appointed by God himſelf, and inveſted by him with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and advantages, wholly peculiar. On that mind it is in their power to make impreſſions, of the higheſt importance, and the moſt benign efficacy; impreſſions, which extend to all the great concerns of man, which mould the whole future character, and which ſtand, thro'
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028610_0037_0FD9C63E05782D50"/>
life, as prominent features in the conduct of every day. "Even a child may be known by his goings," ſays Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; or, as in the Hebrew, "By the goings of a Child may be known his future character, when a man." In the earlieſt ſtages of childhood may be implanted ſuch a ſenſe of right and wrong, of truth and falſhood, of honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fraud, of good will and malice, of accountableneſs and judgment, of heaven and hell, of the glorious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Redeemer, of the preſence, inſpection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and government, of God, as will remain, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and govern, through every ſucceeding period; ſuch a ſenſe, as will, in a great meaſure, form for every ſocial duty, and preclude the neceſſity of moſt political re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, and of all political violence. To communicate a religious education to their children is the greateſt bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which parents can uſually confer upon them; the higheſt ſervice, which they can render to ſociety; and the moſt important duty, which they can perform to God. Yet there is, perhaps, no duty more neglected.</p>
            <p>To the efforts of parents thoſe of Schoolmaſters ought to be added. Where parents perform this duty, the Schoolmaſter may happily increaſe, and rivet, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: where they neglect it, he may, in no ſmall meaſure, ſupply the defect. Moral inſtruction of every kind ought invariably to form a material part of ſchool education. To this end, it ought to be exacted of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Schoolmaſter, that he be, in the public eye, a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man.</p>
            <p>For this, and every other purpoſe, which is expected from ſchools, it is neceſſary, that the Legiſlature ſhould ſteadily interfere. Private efforts may do much; but they cannot do all. Where the ſuffrages of all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are of equal influence, meaſures are merely the effect of compromiſe, and incapable of ſyſtem, or regularity. Hence the abſolute neceſſity of ſome ſuperiour controul. Viſitors, under Legiſlative authority, ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028610_0038_0FD9C6072A274280"/>
and obliged, to inſpect the knowledge, and the morals, of the teachers, the ſyſtem of education, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with which it is purſued, and the progreſs of the pupils in knowledge, manners, and morals. Regular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns ought to be made to Commiſſioners of Government, concerning the whole ſtate of education; and public be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ſhould invariably reward ſuch perſons, as originate eſſential improvements.</p>
            <p>Example, Union, Concert, are primary wheels in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſyſtem of improvement. All things flouriſh, where all hearts are engaged. The great object, here urged, has never been, but very imperfectly, made a national object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It ought to be the firſt end of all meaſures national and perſonal. Power, wealth, and ſplendour, cannot be more certainly acquired. It is as eaſy to bleſs, as to conquer; to enrich a land with virtue, and to adorn it with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to ſtore it with ſilver, and load it with villas and palaces. Man may as eaſily be a Saint, as a Savage; and Nations as eaſily enlightened with Millennial glory, as overcaſt with the midnight of Gothiciſm. All that is neceſſary, on the part of man, is to bring the ſubject home to his heart, to feel its ineſtimable importance, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize its practicability, and to make it the chief aim of his fixed endeavours.</p>
            <p>Confident of the juſtice, and of the intereſting nature, of theſe obſervations, let me aſk, Is there in the wide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of human concerns, is there in the wider regions of the univerſe, an object, which ought more to engroſs the attention, and the labour, of man? Is there a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable patriotiſm, or a truer friendſhip to liberty, than thus to aim, and thus to labour? Ought it not to ſeize the heart, to inſpire the voice, and to command the hands, of every citizen? Who can ſay, and ſay with truth, "I have no concern in this employment"? Who can ſay, "My labours will be uſeleſs"? Who is ſo poor, ſo low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo ignorant, as not to be able to caſt in to the public
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028610_0039_0FD9C643B281F268"/>
ſtock his two mites? Who among the richer, the more enlightened, the more dignified, can, to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo nobly contribute, of his abundance?</p>
            <p>Connecticut can never be diſtinguiſhed for extent of territory, ſuperiour wealth, or great numbers of inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. This, inſtead of being a misfortune, ought to be eſteemed a bleſſing. A nobler diſtinction is thrown by a good Providence into its hands. It may riſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in knowledge, virtue, and happineſs. We need not grudge the droſs, while the gold is ours. It may be the Athens, not of a ſavage, idolatrous, and brutal world, but of a world enlightened, refined, and chriſtian. Let its citizens unite in well concerted and determined efforts, for this end; and it will be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>How honourable, how enviable a taſk, how glorious a crown of patriotic labours already undergone, would it be to the officers of an Army, diſtinguiſhed by unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented and moſt public-ſpirited efforts, in the cauſe of their country, to ſtand foremoſt in the purſuit of this firſt intereſt, this ſupreme glory, of that country? With that courage with which they braved a foreign invader, that patience of ſuffering with which they encountered toil, and want, and that perſeverance with which they ſurmounted difficulty and diſcouragement, to meet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foe employed to attack, every art exerted to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and every obſtacle raiſed up to hinder, our public proſperity? What a wreath of laurel will be twined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round their memory, whenever it is rehearſed, that they were, alike, the beſt ſoldiers, and the beſt citizens? The path to this glory, I flatter myſelf, I have diſcloſed.</p>
            <p>Such efforts are viſibly demanded of all citizens to preſerve, as well as to increaſe, the happineſs, for which that Army ſo bravely fought, and ſo largely bled. Our very Government, ſo mild, ſo uſeful, and ſo harmoniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted, has been attacked by intrigue, calumny, and inſurrection. This evil has exiſted, while the chair of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028610_0040_0FD9C60BCAC537A8"/>
Magiſtracy has been filled by a Man, who, under God, has probably wrought for this country more bleſſings, than were ever wrought by any man for any country: whoſe wiſdom has proved ſuperiour to every perplexity, whoſe patriotiſm to every temptation, and whoſe forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to every trial: a Man, who can paſs through no American States, ſurvey no field, and tread on no ſpot of ground, which he has not ſaved from devaſtation; who can mix with no aſſembly, viſit no family, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt no perſon, who muſt not ſay, "Our freedom, our peace, our ſafety, we owe firſt to God, and next to you:" who can turn his ear to no ſound of joy, which he has not a ſhare in exciting; and open his eye on no ſcene of comfort, which does not trace him as its origin; a man to whom poets, orators, ſages, legiſlators, and the nations of two worlds, have eagerly paid their tribute of eſteem, admiration, and love. Againſt this very man have theſe evils been directed. What then muſt be looked for, when the ſame ſeat ſhall be filled by inferiour talents, ſuſtained by a patriotiſm leſs unequivocal, and ſanctioned by a popularity leſs complete? What, but an event, at which philanthropy ſhudders; and, with the exiſtence of which, the hopes of the wiſe, and the good, will be extinguiſhed forever? To avert ſuch a cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe, and under the banner of ſuch a leader, his illuſtrious companions in the field will cheerfully unite, and call to the ſtandard every virtuous citizen, every friend of man, to preſerve all that, for which they fought, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe all that, in which they glory. Thus will they ſecure the peace of an approving conſcience, enjoy the tranſports of an expanded benevolence, and commence a career of honour which will know no end.</p>
