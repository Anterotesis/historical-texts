            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Death of the aged, holy, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Apoſtolical Man of GOD,</hi> SOLOMON STODDARD, for a long courſe of Years (thro' Grace) the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the Church of CHRIST in <hi>Northampton,</hi> has led me to the <hi>Words</hi> read for the preſent <hi>Lecture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it but a decent and dutiful Reſpect to his <hi>Name</hi> and Memory, (giving unto <hi>Free Grace</hi> the Glory of all that He was made to us and did among us) in this <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Lecture,</hi> upon the firſt notice of his expected <hi>Deceaſe,</hi> to mourn the common Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our Churches. For as he has been for
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003149_0005_0FF0800692B7FA18"/>ſome Years the moſt <hi>aged</hi> Miniſter in the <hi>Province,</hi> ſo in the Courſe of a laborious, burning Miniſtry, he has for many Years ſhone before us in the Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT; a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>Father</hi> not only to the nei'bouring Churches and Paſtors his own <hi>County,</hi> but alſo to thoſe of the whole <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AFTER thoſe in his own Nei'bourhood, it may be his Name and Miniſtry were not more dear and honoured any where than in this great <hi>Town,</hi> the Place of his <hi>Birth;</hi> where both Miniſters and People receiv'd his <hi>annual Viſits</hi> with a pecullar Reverence and Pleaſure; as He made them to us (while his bodily Strength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſo long a Journey, and this was to near his <hi>Eightieth</hi> Year) with all the Delight and Satisfaction that a FATHER has in viſiting the Children of his Love; bringing us the ſolemn Counſels and Warnings of GOD from Year to Year, which were received by Us in crowded Aſſemblies, that hung on his Lips, as a People that ſought Righteouſneſs and ſhewed much Love.</p>
            <p>THEN it was that this Lecture was <hi>His,</hi> and he was as a PETER here among the Diſciples and Miniſters of our LORD JESUS; very much our <hi>Primate,</hi> and a <hi>Prince</hi> among us, in an Evangelical and the truly <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> ſenſe; that is to ſay, among the <hi>Firſt</hi> for Light and Integrity, for Knowledge and great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Faith and Love which is in CHRIST JESUS, and for Zeal and Boldneſs in the Cauſe of Truth and Holineſs: But I muſt add, None leſs affecting a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> above his Brethren; none more pleas'd with Retirement, and none more with public Appearances for occaſional Services to CHRIST and Souls; none more ſtudious and inquiſitive after Truth; none more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and laborlous in his Studies; none more lively, fervent and unwearied in the Pulpit; nor did any one love his Work and his <hi>Maſter</hi> better.</p>
            <p>No one in our Churches has run (thro' Grace) a longer, a brighter and a like conſtant Courſe of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> on LORD's-Days and Lectures, to the finiſhing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003149_0006_0FF0800BA6EEFEC8"/>the <hi>eighty fifth</hi> Year of his Life; his LORD giving him a ſtrength of Body equal to that of his Soul, for ſuch a <hi>Run</hi> of Labour and Service; and therein a happy fruitful old Age; his Day and his Work ending together.</p>
            <p>AND accordingly, No Miniſter in the Land liv'd more mindful of <hi>Death,</hi> his own and his People's Death; the firſt and laſt Character of a Miniſter of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> ſtudions to ſave Himſelf and Them that hear him, and watching for Souls as One that muſt give an Account. And who among Men, for many a Year paſt, has enjoy'd a more ſetled <hi>Peace,</hi> and full Aſſurance of his Intereſt in CHRIST, than this Servant of the LORD did? whereby he liv'd above the Fear of Death, in a diligent Preparation for it, and in a pleaſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE no Miniſter in the Land, (I am bold to ſay it) for ſcores of Years paſt, could with greater Freedom and Pleaſure, Integrity and Truth, have taken to Himſelf <hi>thoſe Words</hi> of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> which I have choſen for his <hi>Funeral;</hi> and have ſaid to his Hearers in the Name and Fear of GOD, with all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Confidence; — "<hi>To You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>YET as the Body <hi>now</hi> is, it is wonderfully made, ſet up and kept up. Call it a <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> it is a ſine and noble one in it ſelf; like that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a work of great Deſign, and whereon much Art and Coſt and Care was beſtowed. Our Souls could neither provide this <hi>Tent</hi> for themſelves; nor can they now uphold, or preſerve it from falling, no not a Day. The Soul neither may nor can leave it at it's pleaſure, tho' it moves and removes it at it's Will; and often injures it by it's paſſions.</p>
            <p>THE Body ſhould be a Tabernacle for GOD to dwell in; for Him to be worſhip'd and ſerv'd in, both here and for ever.</p>
            <p>IF there is any thing now <hi>mean</hi> in it, we our ſelves have brought <hi>that</hi> upon it: We have made it <hi>this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> falling thing, which it is now become.

            <p>LET us <hi>thank</hi> GOD for this Dwelling He made it for us, gave it to us, put us into it. Let us give Him the <hi>Glory</hi> of it:<note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. x. 5. Pſal. xxii. 9. cxxxix. 14.</note>

            <p>BUT while we are in theſe mortal Bodies, let us eſteem them as <hi>no</hi> more than our earthly Houſe and Tabernacle; our meaner and dying Part. Let us daily think of leaving this Houſe of Clay, expect to remove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>IN our <hi>Text</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> things ſaid about our <hi>putting off</hi> our Tabernacle, "that we <hi>muſt</hi> do it, that we muſt do it <hi>ſhortly,</hi> and that we <hi>know</hi> we muſt do ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE <hi>muſt</hi> do it: It is not left to our Choice, <hi>if</hi> we will, or <hi>when,</hi> or <hi>how</hi> it ſhall be. Death comes with his Commiſſion and Authority from GOD, and ſays to us, You <hi>muſt</hi> and ſhall go. His Call to us is, <hi>Come away!</hi> and with a ſtrong Hand he hales and turns us out.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>FEW, very few among the dying Children of Men have a <hi>real</hi> Knowledge of <hi>this</hi> plain and common Truth. <hi>The Living know that they ſhall Die;</hi> but what then? how few among the Living <hi>conſider</hi> it, lay it to heart, keep it in mind, and <hi>Live</hi> as if they knew this?

            <p>I ſhall here conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> the very particular and extraordinary <hi>Revelation</hi> that CHRIST had made to <hi>Peter</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of his Death.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003149_0013_0FF080210696F748"/>To <hi>that</hi> the Apoſtle refers in my <hi>Text,</hi> namely, to the Words of the riſen JESUS to him, John 21.18, 19. <hi>Signifying to him by what Death he ſhould glorify God: That when he ſhould be old he ſhould ſtretch forth his Hands to be bound for it.</hi> So that the LORD had let him <hi>know</hi> "that he ſhould live to be <hi>old,</hi>" that he ſhould die a <hi>violent</hi> Death, and "that he ſhould <hi>willingly go to his Martyrdom.</hi> And now ſee in my <hi>Text</hi> the accompliſhment of theſe Things drawing on. The <hi>aged</hi> Apoſtle ſpeaks his own <hi>Readineſs,</hi> Courage and Conſtancy in his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this predicted Death. He was now <hi>old,</hi> and ready to <hi>reach out</hi> his Hands unto them that ſhould <hi>bind</hi> him for Death. <hi>Knowing</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I muſt ſhortly put off my Tabernacle:</hi> He ſpeaks as one ready and willing to go, whenever the LORD ſhould pleaſe.</p>
            <p>HERETOFORE <hi>Peter</hi> had not been the moſt <hi>patient</hi> at the Thot's of Sufferings, and of an ignominous and cruel Death in particular. He of all the Diſciples was once the <hi>leaſt likely</hi> to <hi>ſtretch</hi> forth his hands for another to <hi>gird</hi> him. When CHRIST ſpake firſt of his own Crucifixion, <hi>Peter</hi> could not bear it; "LORD (ſaid he) <hi>this ſhall not be.</hi> When he ſaw the rude <hi>Guards</hi> lay hold on his LORD, he drew and wounded <hi>Malchus.</hi> When he ſaw himſelf like to be <hi>ſeized</hi> and arraigned, he thrice <hi>denied</hi> CHRIST. Theſe things did not at all look as if he hereafter ſhould be the Man, who when he ſhould be old ſhould go freely, meekly and reſignedly to a <hi>Croſs</hi> for the Name of CHRIST. Yet CHRIST told him all <hi>this</hi> in the Preſence of his Brethren, to put Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon him after his Fall, and to comfort him in his Sorrow for it, and to encourage him in his Self-diffidence, Humility and Fear. And by the Words of my <hi>Text</hi> we ſee that. He remembers with Pleaſure what CHRIST had ſaid to him of putting off his Tabernacle, and was looking out for the Day.</p>
            <p>Now it is true that none of <hi>us</hi> have any ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation made to us, concerning the Time and Manney of our Death. Never the leſs it is moſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003149_0014_0FF0802407278718"/>true and certain, as to every one of us, "That CHRIST has many a Time, and in many Ways, ſhewn to <hi>us</hi> that <hi>we</hi> muſt ſhortly put off <hi>our</hi> Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>AND as it may be very <hi>profitable</hi> to us to conſider this, ſo it ſhould be a <hi>pleaſant</hi> Meditation to us; For every Notice to us of this Nature from the LORD JESUS ſhould be taken <hi>in Love</hi> as it is ſurely meant.

Again, HE (<hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World</hi>) did from the Beginning ſhow his People that they muſt die, <hi>in the Sacrifices and Offerings</hi> our of the Flocks and Herds; even from the Day of <hi>Abel.</hi> In the Blood of Theſe <hi>Adam</hi> had the firſt Sight of Death; and they were <hi>Notices</hi> to him that he himſelf muſt die, as well as <hi>Figures</hi> of the Death of CHRIST the great Sacrifice.

            <p>THUS again, In every <hi>Sermon</hi> preached to us on the Subject of Death, whether the dying Creature will hear or whether he will forbear, CHRIST ſends him Line upon Line concerning his paſſing hence, to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. O it is CHRIST that ſpeaks to us by his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003149_0016_0FF08028BB5E93F0"/>Word and Spirit, and ſhews us that we muſt die, we know not how ſoon or ſuddenly; and what a great thing it is to ſet our Souls in Order againſt that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hour! That the ſecond Death may have no power over us! That we may never be hurt of it! That this laſt Enemy may be ſlain before us! And that to die may be our Gain, infinite and eternal Gain!</p>
            <p>So in all the <hi>Records</hi> of the Death of Saints and Sinners, from the Death of <hi>Adam, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the LORD has ſhewn his People, from Generation to Generation, that they muſt ſhortly die. <hi>Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> And who art Thou, O Man! whoſe <hi>inward Tho't is, that thy Houſe ſhall continue for ever? and thy Dwelling-place to all Generations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, IN the Deaths and <hi>Funerals</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Friends, from Week to Week, CHRIST ſhews us that we alſo muſt ſhortly die. We may ſee our LORD at every Funeral with the <hi>Keys of Hades</hi> in his Hand<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>18. Deut xxxii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>30.

If <hi>He</hi> will that <hi>Peter</hi> be bound and die, and that <hi>Iohn</hi> tarry till he come; what is it to the reſt of the Diſciples? <hi>He</hi> alſo has determined by what Death every Believer ſhall glorify GOD. The Kingdom of Providence is <hi>His,</hi> and the two great Things in it are <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is therefore our LORD <hi>IESUS</hi> who ſhews us we muſt ſhortly die, in all thoſe bodily <hi>Infirmities, Pains</hi> &amp; <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> which we feel within ourſelves daily, and which are the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of Death upon us; and as we advance in Years the <hi>Shadows</hi> of it lengthen upon us. 'Tis an inſtructive <hi>Fable</hi> that you have read, "How a certain Man made an Agreement with Death,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003149_0017_0FF0802DC7631918"/>that he ſhould kindly give him ſome <hi>Notice</hi> &amp; Warning of his Coming; and when Death afterward came upon him ſuddenly, the trembling Man pleaded his <hi>Promiſe;</hi> "Did you not agree to give me Notice of your Coming?

Theſe were the kind Notices of my Coming; and now Come away!</p>
            <p>BUT in the laſt place, and in the <hi>beſt</hi> Senſe of all, CHRIST ſhows unto his <hi>own</hi> Diſciples, as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> that they muſt ſhortly put off their Tabernacle, <hi>by the effectual Impreſſions of his Grace, and by the Teaching of His</hi> SPIRIT. He ſavingly enlightned <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo he doth all his Elect, in the <hi>Truth</hi> before us; whereby they are inclined and made to live in a ſerious and diligent Preparation for Death, Judgment and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

            </p>
            <p>LET our Souls apply to CHRIST by ſervent Prayer, "<hi>Lord IESUS,</hi> Be Thou my <hi>Teacher</hi> in this great and neceſſary Leſſon! In thy <hi>Light</hi> ſhew me my mortal dying State.</p>

MINISTERS die <hi>Young</hi> like other Men; and in the midſt of Uſefulneſs, Labours and Fruitfulneſs; They live to <hi>old Age</hi> alſo, are grey in their Lords Work, and worn out in the Service of Souls. Sometimes they <hi>out-live</hi> their Work, and their Powers for Service are <hi>gone</hi> before they put off their Tabernacles.

            <p>THEY die of the ſame <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> that others do: of Fevers of Dropſies, by Languiſhings and Conſumptions, or by Apoplexies and ſudden Suffocations: They die of Stupors, or Strangury, of dolorous Cancers (and that even in the <hi>Tongue,</hi> as did a late excellent Miniſter in <hi>London</hi>): They die of noiſome and ulcerous Diſeaſes as well as others; their Fleſh <hi>broken and become loath-ſome</hi> before it is put off; their body <hi>vile</hi> to an Eye of ſenſe: They die by evil <hi>Accidents,</hi> as we call em, by broken Bones, by Drowning, by Beaſts of Prey; (as the <hi>old Prophet.</hi>) or by the hands of Robbers and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or by Violence and Injuſtice under the Name and Form of Law. They are <hi>in trouble as other Men, and plagued like other Men;</hi> and (like <hi>Peter) have Bands in their Death.</hi> — How many of Chriſts faithful and eminent Miniſters have died <hi>Martyrs</hi> for his Name and Truth? Since the Death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> GOD has (according to his Sovereign Will) <hi>ſet them forth appointed to Death, a Spectacle to the World, to Angels and Men.</hi> But if they live and die at <hi>Home,</hi> in Eaſe and on their Beds; die af Age and in Honour, with their Children and Friends about them; beloved, deſir'd and pray'd for by their People; and mourn'd for when they can continue no longer, but <hi>go from the Place of the Holy,</hi> This alſo is like other worthy Worſhippers.</p>
            <p>MINISTERS <hi>know</hi> all this concerning Themſelves, and ſo do all about them; and it is by no means to <hi>inform</hi>

Nay are not their Sins <hi>greater</hi> than other Mens? And ſhall they not then ſuffer the <hi>Pains</hi> of Death as well as others? Or if CHRIST has <hi>taſted</hi> Death for Them, among the Church of his Elect, ſhall not they alſo <hi>drink of his Cup? and be baptiſed with his Baptiſm?</hi> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if like the <hi>two Brethren</hi> they hope to be <hi>nearer</hi> to Him than Others, in his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and Glory.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 7.</note> and (by his Grace) to exhibit it when they come to <hi>die;</hi> that HE may be <hi>magnified</hi> (and Souls edified) <hi>in their mortal Bedies; Whether it be in Life or Death</hi>

            <p>FOR theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> Miniſters die, and ſhould die, like other Men. They <hi>know</hi> it, and have nothing to ſay againſt it. And they <hi>need</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to know it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, lay it to their Heart and live accordingly; as much, if not more than Others. PETER had the <hi>Primacy</hi> in this reſpect, among the <hi>Brethren</hi> to whom he wrote; tho' not among the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> In this let <hi>Miniſters</hi> learn of Him, and be Followers of him, as he was of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>WOULD to GOD it could be truly ſaid of all the <hi>Miniſters of</hi> JESUS, that <hi>they</hi> have a ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>this</hi> plain Truth, which they preach to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Others from day to day!

            <p>BUT who are ſo <hi>obliged,</hi> bound and advantaged to conſider duely of, and live by the Knowledge of their own Mortality, as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel? Who are more call'd to <hi>converſe</hi> with Death, and to look into Eternity than they are? How often are <hi>they</hi> at the ſick and dying Beds of People, to the moſt ſolemn Ends and Purpoſes; to miniſter to their Souls, to enquire into their Spiritual State to aſſiſt them and pray over them in the Agonies of Death? and to follow their Remains, among the Mourners, to the Grave!</p>

Who have a greater <hi>Account</hi> than they to give?

            <p>AND it is to be charitably <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> of the Miniſters of Religion, that as <hi>many</hi> of them, and far <hi>more</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this <hi>Order</hi> than of any other, have the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> Knowledge of the Truth before us; or elſe <hi>Woe</hi> unto their Souls, and to the Churches of CHRIST for their ſakes. This doth in a ſpecial manner agree to their holy and ſpiritual Calling, to their peculiar Bonds and Ordination Vows, and to their high Profeſſion. And this is the Way for them to be bleſſed by GOD and made ſucceſsful in their Work: As <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed for, and propheſied concerning the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and bleſſed them with his dying Lips; Deut. 33.8. <hi>Let thy Urim and thy Thummim be with thy Holy One.</hi> Which was to ſay, "Let GOD furniſh them with thoſe Gifts and Graces, that Light and Integrity, that Illumination and Sanctification, which are requiſite to the faithful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Duties of their high and ſacred Office. And ſo <hi>Aaron</hi> was illuminated, living in a Preparation to <hi>undreſs</hi> and die, at a Day or an <hi>Hours</hi> warning. And this is a ſhining part in the Character of bleſſed <hi>Paul;</hi> as he tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that by Death working in <hi>him,</hi> Life ſpiritual and eternal was the more convey'd to <hi>them</hi> thro' his Miniſtry; he being the more quickned from day to day in ſerving their Souls, by the daily Views he had of his own Dying: Which I take to be the ſenſe of thoſe Words, 2 Cor. 4.12. <hi>"So then Death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

And who in fact are like laborious, and it may be ſucceſsful, in their Miniſtry, as thoſe that live moſt in the Views of Eternity? As I remember that

            <p>O the Comfort and Pleaſure to a Miniſter in <hi>Age,</hi> or to any Chriſtian, that can thus look back on a Life ſpent in <hi>the Knowledge of Death,</hi> and a diligent Preparation for it.

            <p>YOU will pleaſe to accept and improve the preſen <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> as meant by the Will of GOD for <hi>this</hi> End.</p>
            <p>AND I wiſh it were at all <hi>Worthy</hi> to bring to your Remembrance, with a deſerved Reſpect and Reverence, the Perſon and Miniſtry of that honoured and beloved <hi>Servant</hi> of CHRIST; to whoſe Memory and your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Profit it is a ſmall Tribute.</p>
            <p>YOU have ſeen the main <hi>Deſign</hi> and Scope of his powerful and ſucceſsful <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> with the bleſſed Fruit and <hi>Crown</hi> of it, in the Things that I have ſaid; <hi>What</hi> He reap'd from it himſelf, and with pleaſure ſaw others reap.</p>
            <p>THRO' Grace He was <hi>not negligent</hi> to put all unto whom he came in Remembrance of the great Concerns of their Souls and the eternal World. <hi>As long as he was in this Tabernacle,</hi> (and how <hi>long</hi> was that thro' the Favour of GOD to us how did he <hi>ſtir up</hi> Himſelf
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003149_0026_0FF080481F6DCAA8"/>And all that heard him, in his pungent and awakning <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> as <hi>knowing</hi> that he muſt ſhortly give an Account to GOD, and thoſe that heard him, together with him. And now <hi>after</hi> his Deceaſe, <hi>We</hi> ſhould have theſe things always in Remembrance, as we can bear Witneſs for him he earneſtly endeavour'd, while he was with us and came to us in the Name of the LORD. Let <hi>his Death</hi> bring to our Remembrance, and fix deep in our Hearts all that we have ſeen and heard, of the Power of Godlineſs in his teaching Life and Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>As the aged <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wrote to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſo the ſurviving <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Land may repreſent the <hi>Deceaſed</hi> yet ſpeaking to them; <hi>"Thou haſt fully known my Doctrine, manner of Life, Purpoſe, Faith, Long-ſuffering, Charity, Patience: Continus thou in the things which thou haſt learned &amp; haſt been aſſured of.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Crown</hi> of Life is to finiſh well, in a <hi>happy Death.</hi> And the way to <hi>this</hi> is to paſs our Days here under the governing Tho'ts |of Death and <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE muſt <hi>congratulate</hi> with the wiſe and faithful Servant that Lives and finiſhes thus: as the Spectators in the <hi>Olympic Games</hi> ſhouted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>THE laſt <hi>Character</hi> of a Goſpel Miniſter is Sanctity and Fidelity in his LORD's Work, in the diligent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of many Talents, and the gaining of many more thereby.</p>
            <p>THE Gifts and Powers, natural and acquired, of an active Soul in a ſound Body, are a rich Endowment; the <hi>Student,</hi> the <hi>Diſputant,</hi> the <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Preacher,</hi> are great and good lines in the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of a compleat <hi>Divine:</hi> But yet theſe are the <hi>leaſt</hi> part in the <hi>juſt Character</hi> which the Public has had to day of the <hi>Deceaſed: "The holy Man of GOD, and the diligent, compaſſionate and faithful Paſtor"</hi> are much bolder and brighter Lines in his heavenly

            <p>LET the Miniſters of CHRIST, elder and younger, now preſent before the LORD, learn from the holy Life and happy Death of this our <hi>Father,</hi> how to <hi>fulfil</hi> our Miniſtry.

            <p>ON the 11th Inſtant died, and this Day was buried here, the very reverend and aged, our honoured and beloved Paſtor, Mr. <hi>Solomon Stoddard;</hi> too eminent a Perſon to be ſuffer'd to ſlip into his Grave in ſilence.</p>
            <p>HE was born at <hi>Boſton,</hi> Anno 1643. The eldeſt Son of <hi>Anthony Stoddard</hi>
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; by his ſecond Wife, who was the Siſter of Sir <hi>George Downing.</hi> Had his School Learning at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Maſter Corlet.</hi> Took his firſt Degree at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vard College</hi> Anno 1662. And was afterwards one of the Fellows of that Houſe. Growing out of Health by reaſon of too cloſe an Application to his Studies, he was prevail'd on to take a Voyage to <hi>Barbados,</hi> with Governor <hi>Serle</hi> as his Chaplain, where he preach'd to the Diſſenters in that Iſland. But his State of Health growing better, he return'd to his Native Country in about two years.</p>
            <p>UPON the Death of the excellent Mr. <hi>Eleazer Mather,</hi> the firſt Paſtor of the Church in this Place, who died when but 35 Years of Age, Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi> was choſen and invited to ſucceed him. He was ordain'd to the Paſtoral Office over us, Anno 1672; and we have injoy'd an uncommon Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in him, for 56 Years together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003149_0030_0FF080532BD28D38"/>
HIS natural Powers were quick and ſtrong, and by the Bleſſing of GOD on his hard Studies, he was furniſh'd with that Learning which is requiſite to make a Divine of the firſt Rank. He was well skill'd in the learned Languages; well vers'd in the religious Controverſies that relate either to Points of Doctrine or Church-Government; and was himſelf a ready and ſmart <hi>Diſputant,</hi> a wiſe and judicious <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> whoſe Advice and Counſel were much ſought and valu'd by the perplex'd and ſcrupulous,</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Paſtor</hi> he was diligent, laborious, conſtant; wiſe, faithful, compaſſionate. His Sermons were plain and powerful, experimental and ſpiritual, cloſe and ſearching, yet rational and argumentative. His Subjects chiefly ſuited to awaken ſecure Sinners, direct Souls about the great Work of Converſion, and to help Perſons to judge of their ſpiritual State. And he was favour'd with a more than ordinary Preſence of GOD in his Work, and many Seals of his Miniſtry; in the Courſe of which there were three remarkable Seaſons, in which the Spirit of GOD ſo mov'd upon the Hearts of his People, that it became almoſt the general Cry of the Place, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were ſo numerous, as to give a happy Occaſion for that admiring Queſtion, <hi>Who are theſe that flie as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE was a Man zealous againſt Sin, a hearty Mourner for the iniquities of the Times, an earneſt Pleader with GOD for the Land, the Nation, and His Church in the World.</p>
            <p>THE moſt in the Town have been born &amp; bro't up under his Miniſtry; and ſcarce any Miniſter was more reverenc'd and belov'd by his People.</p>
            <p>HIS Station was indeed in a remote Corner of the Land, but his Light and Influence went out thro' the whole Country; and <hi>His</hi> being our Paſtor gave a Name and Reputation to the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003149_0031_0FF08055810BBEF8"/>
HE us'd for many Years together to make his Annual Viſits to <hi>Boſton</hi> at the time of the Commencement; and the Day after to preach the <hi>Public Lecture,</hi> to a numerous Audience, expecting and glad to hear him.</p>
            <p>HIS Labours and Uſefulneſs were drawn out to an uncommon length. For <hi>fifty</hi> Years, or more, he preached twice every LORD's day; and till his 86th Year (in which he died) he was a conſtant Preacher one Part of the LORD's-days, and at a monthly-Lecture without the uſe of Notes at all; and, in the Opinion of ſome good Judges, ſo well, that it could not be diſcern'd his Powers were much abated. And ſo cloſe did he follow his Studies, even in this advanced Age, that when he died he had a conſiderable Number of Sermons ſtudied, that were never preach'd.</p>
            <p>HE injoy'd a great meaſure of Health, and was ſeldom taken off from his beloved Work by Sickneſs. His Stature was ſomething taller then the common Size, his Countenance comely, his Preſence venerable; his whole Look and Behaviour ſuch as gave thoſe who convers'd with him, occaſion to ſay of him, as the Woman of the <hi>Prophet, I perceive that this is a holy Man of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE whole Land has a great Loſs in his Death; for ſuch Perſons are the <hi>Chariots and Horſemen</hi> of a People, their Glory and Defence.</p>
            <p>HE married Mrs. <hi>Mather,</hi> the prudent and pious Relict of his Predeceſſor, and Daughter of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Warham</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> who now ſurvives him; by whom he was bleſs'd with many Children, eight of which are living, two Sons, and Six Daughters. His Eldeſt Son, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Anthony Stoddard,</hi> is now the worthy Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Woodberry.</hi> His ſecond Son, Col. <hi>John Stoddard,</hi> is one of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Members of His Majeſty's Council. And five of his Daughters are married to worthy Miniſters. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> (one of his Sons in Law)
<pb facs="unknown:003149_0032_0FF0805A4E910CB8"/>preach'd a Funeral Sermon for him, the day of his Interment.</p>
            <p>HE had the Satisfaction for ſome time before he died, to have his Grandſon, Mr. <hi>Jonathan Edwards,</hi> joined with him, to be the Collegue of his Age, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor at his Death; for whom we can't wiſh any thing better, than that the Mantle of <hi>Elijah</hi> may reſt upon <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
