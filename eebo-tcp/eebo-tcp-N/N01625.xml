            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>I. Epiſtle of JOHN, I.7. laſt part.</bibl>
                  <p>— <hi>And the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe Words we have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the blood of Chriſt. By the blood of Chriſt we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the natural blood of Chriſt: if a Man had kept ſome Ounces of that when it ran out of his ſide, it would have done him no good: but the meaning is, the Sufferings of Chriſt, eſpecially his bloody death. The commendation of it is, (1.) That it has an Efficacy to cleanſe us from Sin. Sin is a pollution and ſtain: it renders Men offenſive to God, it makes them filthy in the Eye of God; it expoſes them to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001930_0003_0FBA1D1CA6A572A8"/>Gods wrath: but the blood of Chriſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us: Rev. 1.5. <hi>Jeſus Christ waſheth us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> (2.) The greatneſs of the efficacy: it cleanſeth away all ſin. Some Sins are of a double die, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Sins; ſome have committed a Multitude of Sins, and nothing elſe can cleanſe from any one Sin, but this cleanſeth from all. This is amplifyed by the reaſon, <hi>His Son:</hi> if he had been a Man, if he had been only the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> his blood would have had no ſuch vertue: but he being the Son of God, his blood cleanſeth from all Sin.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>There is Mighty Vertue in the blood of Chriſt to Expiate the guilt of Sin.</q>
               <p>The Law of God condemns for Sin. Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> It brings Men under obligation to ſuffer Eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All Men by Sin are expoſed to the wrath of God. This begets a great deal of diſquietment in the hearts of ſome Men, they would gladly be put into a way to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the guilt of Sin; they have tryed ſome methods and they don't effect the thing, Prayers and Tears will not do; but this Doctrine gives an account what will do: There is vertue in the blood of Chriſt to do it. Some things have a tendency to work this and that Effect, but they are not always
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001930_0004_0FBA1D1FE30852A0"/>powerful; but there is worth enough in the blood of Chriſt to take away Sin. Other things are no ranſom for the Soul; but they that have an intereſt in the blood of Chriſt are delivered from the guilt of Sin. It is all one whether Mens Sins be more or ſewer, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs heinous, the blood of Chriſt will waſh them clean. Meats and drinks have vertue to nouriſh Men, Clothes have vertue to warm them, Phyſick may have vertue to heal them, but the blood of Chriſt has vertue to cleanſe them from their Sins. If a Man have Money, he may purchaſe Land or Cattle or Corn, but he cannot purchaſe Pardon, but the blood of Chriſt will procure the Pardon of Sin. Eph. 1.7. <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his blood, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins.</hi> Rev. 5.9. <hi>Thon haſt Redeemed us to God by thy blood.</hi> Wiſdom is a defence and Money is a defence, but the blood of Chriſt is a defence againſt the curſe of the Law: Gal. 3.13. <hi>He hath Redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proof of this we may conſider theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Argu. <hi>The Father would not have put Christ on this Service, if his Death would not have prevailed for the Pardon of Sin.</hi> Men were the Inſtruments of putting Chriſt to death, but the thing was according to the counſel of God: Act. 2.23. <hi>He was delivered by the determinate counſel and ſore-knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001930_0005_0FBA1D2135D4A7A8"/>God.</hi> Yea, God appointed him to die for our Redemption: God made him a Prieſt to offer up this Sacrifice: Pſal. 110.4. <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi> God commanded him to lay down his life: Joh. 10.18. <hi>This Commandment have I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of my Father.</hi> God called him to ſuffer upon our account: Iſai. 53.6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> From hence may we conclude the vertue of Chriſts blood to take away Sin. It was a great thing for the Son of God to ſuffer: there never was any other ſuch thing from the foundation of the World, nor ever will be again. The dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Perſon is infinite, and the love of his Father exceeding great; and there is no fair account, why the Father ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to lay this puniſhment on him, if it would not have had a mighty efficacy for the taking away the guilt of Sin. Would God lay this upon him for nothing, or for a ſmall matter? Certainly it muſt be upon ſome great deſign: God fore-ſaw the great Good that would come thereby. And would the Son have been willing to undergo ſuch great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if it would not availed for the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of abundance of Sin? He knew that many would be redeemed thereby. Math. 20.28. <hi>The Son of Man came to give his Life a ranſome for many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Argu. <hi>God promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt, that his Death ſhould be accepted for the doing away of Sin.</hi> Chriſt did not ſuffer under an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001930_0006_0FBA1D2389316C90"/>whether his death would ſignify any great matter, whether any number of Men would be the better for it. God gave a great number to him to redeem, and promiſed that his Death ſhould be accepted as the price of their Redemption: Iſai. 53.10, 11, 12.— <hi>If he make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. So Iſai. 49.6. <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth.</hi> A number of all Nations ſhall be ſaved by him: Pſal. 2.7, 8. Pſal. 72.17. <hi>Men ſhall be bleſſed in him, all Nations ſhall call him bleſſed.</hi> And what can be a ſtronger tie, and greatee ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the promiſe of God? Chriſt on the incouragement of this promiſe undertook this Service, and God that made ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes before he died, and expreſſed ſuch an eſtimation of his Sufferings, will not deſpiſe them now they are accompliſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Argu. <hi>From the Sacrifices that were offered of old.</hi> Sacrifices were offered up from the beginning of the World. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4. And this practice was continued in the Church for Four Thouſand Years: there were daily Sacrifices, Sacrifices for the Sabbaths, for the beginnings of the Months, and Yearly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: there were burnt-offerings, treſpaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, ſin-offerings, peace offerings, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will offerings &amp; vows: Multitudes of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were offered up in Sacrifice to God: twenty and two thouſand Oxen, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001930_0007_0FBA1D24C3ABED18"/>and twenty thouſand Sheep at the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple: there was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and labour in Sacrificing; and theſe were all types and ſhadows of Chriſt: <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. Theſe Sacrifices could not purge away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. God did not regard them but as they were types of Chriſt. Heb. 10.5. <hi>When he cometh into the World, he ſaith, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> The deſign of theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices was to repreſent the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, to inſtruct the World about Chriſts Death, to be monitors and remembrancers of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, that ſo the People of God might be continually exerciſing faith on him. And would God have done this if there had not been wonderful vertue in this blood? Why ſhould they be taught with ſuch labour and expence to depend upon his death if there were not ſuch glorious vertue in it? I may add to this the conſideration of other types: the paſsover was a type of Chriſt: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. So was the brazen Serpent: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. And the legal waſhings: God took abundant occaſion to inſtruct them in the vertue of Chriſts blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Argu. <hi>From the Sacraments of the New Teſtament.</hi> Baptiſm ſhews the efficacy of Chriſts death unto Salvation: thereby is held forth our fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Rom. 6.3. <hi>So many of us as have been baptized into Jeſus Christ, were baptized into his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001930_0008_0FBA1D2743640EA8"/>death.</hi> Baptiſm is a Seal of the doctrine of faith in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Adult Perſons profeſſed their Faith in Chriſt before they were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36, 37. Baptiſm repreſents the waſhing away of the guilt of Sin by the blood of Chriſt. So we are taught the ſame by the Lords Supper. Therein his death is repreſented as a violent death, and as on our account: Matt. 26.28. <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. <hi>This is my body which is broken for you.</hi> Chriſt has appointed, that in this way his death ſhould be ſhewed forth, till he comes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. And ſurely it had not been worth the while to have appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Signs of this unto the end of the World, if it had not procured Salvation. The Wine in the Lords Supper is called <hi>His blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> Math. 26.28. becauſe it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes the bleſſings of the New Teſtament. In theſe Ordinances God ſhews that it is much upon his heart to ſtrengthen our faith in the blood of Chriſt. Here we ſee ſolemn Ordinances founded on the doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Sufferings of Chriſt: if this doctrine were not true there would be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for theſe Ordinances. God has not appointed any Ordinance, that ſhould be like the ſtock, <hi>a doctrine of Vanities,</hi> as the phraſe is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.8. God needs no ſuch worſhip as is not built on a real foundation. If this doctrine were not true, the Sacraments would be a meer mockery.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001930_0009_0FBA1D2B096D9AD0"/>
5. Argu. <hi>God doth direct us to truſt in the blood of Chriſt.</hi> We have many invitations in the Scripture to truſt in him. Math. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you reſt.</hi> And ſurely God will not with ſeeming love draw us into a ſnare, will not with great appearance of love perſwade us to build upon a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Yea alſo he commands us to truſt in Chriſt. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we believe on the Name of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ.</hi> And will God require us to put an honour upon Chriſt that he is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of? Will he command us to flatter our ſelves and truſt in that which will not ſave us? Will God command us to do, that which we cannot do, except we be out of our wits. If it be not ſaſe to truſt in Chriſt, we could not do it, unleſs we were under a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion: it would be an hard leſſon to be bound to do that, which there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for. Yea, God commands us upon pain of damnation to truſt in Chriſt: Joh. 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> But if there be no ſafety in believing on him, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we ſhould be puniſhed for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him. Will God damn Men for not building their hopes for Heaven upon the Sand? will he caſt them into Hell for not truſting in a broken reed? Further, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is inforced with a promiſe of Salvation.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001930_0010_0FBA1D2DC6CC7698"/>Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi> But God will not reward Men with Eternal life, for truſting in that which hath no ſaving vertue in it.</p>
               <p>Queſtion. <hi>How comes there to be ſuch vertue in the blood of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall Anſwer this in Four Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>I. PROP. <hi>CHRIST Suffered the Curſe of the Law.</hi> That is, the evil that the Law threatned. God was bound to execute the curſe for Sin: Math. 5.18. <hi>No jot or tittle ſhall paſs from the Law, but all must be fulfilled.</hi> And accordingly the wrath of God fell on Chriſt, Sin was puniſhed in him, he did not bear a part of the curſe, but the curſe: Gal. 3.13. <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He Suffered the Curſe of the Law in his Body.</hi> They that ſuffer for themſelves muſt ſuffer in their bodies: beſide what they ſuffer in their bodies here, their bodies muſt ſuffer in Hell: Math. 10.28. <hi>Fear him that can caſt both Body and Soul into Hell.</hi> Therefore they muſt riſe from the dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2: The Body is a partaker in Sin and therefore it muſt partake in Suffering. So Jeſus Chriſt did not only die for us, that would not ſerve the turn, but he died an accurſed death. That was ſignifyed by that Law: Deut. 21.23. <hi>Curſed is he that hangeth on a tree.</hi> So
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001930_0011_0FBA1D2F4B3821A0"/>Chriſt bore a painful and an ignominious death. Phil. 2.8. <hi>He became obedient to death, the death of the croſs.</hi> He endured a great deal of pain. Pſal. 22.16. <hi>They pierced my hands and my feet.</hi> And he died as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor. There was a neceſſity that he ſhould endure abundance of pain, becauſe he was to redeem us from the pains of Hell. He was cruelly Scourged, and horribly Tormented on the Croſs, that we might be delivered from the bodily Torments of Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He Suffered the Curſe of the Law in his Soul.</hi> The Soul of Chriſt was filled with ſorrow. Math. 26.38. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> He had a terrible ſenſe of the wrath of God in his Soul. He did not ſuffer much of this in the time of his Publick Miniſtry; but about and in the time of his death, he was diſtreſſed with the ſenſe of Gods wrath. As ſometimes Godly Men do enjoy the ſenſe of Gods favour, ſo Chriſt endured the ſenſe of Gods wrath. God was not angry with Chriſt for taking his Office upon him, but for our Sins. And Chriſt Jeſus had a deep ſenſe how God was provoked by the Sins of the Elect, and that the guilt of all thoſe Sins was tranſlated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Gods wrath did burn againſt him, God looked on him as the guilty Perſon: God looked upon him as the object of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice: and he was purſued by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance for thoſe Sins: Iſai. 53.6. <hi>And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001930_0012_0FBA1D3140F938C8"/>us all,</hi> &amp;c. 11. v. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travel of his Soul.</hi> This was the principal part of the puniſhment of Sin; this made Chriſt ſweat drops of blood: this was typifyed by that fire on the Altar that did conſume the Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Hereby Chriſt ſuffered the ſubſtance of that which was due to us. There was no need that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer the ſame in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that we ſhould have ſuffered, if we had born the puniſhment of our own Sins; but it was needful that he ſhould ſuffer the Subſtance of our puniſhment, therefore it is ſaid that he endured the curſe: Gal. 3.13. <hi>He was made a curſe for us.</hi> He came to fulfil the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. Chriſt being our ſurety was bound to pay our debt; and God did not abate him any thing of the extremity of the curſe that was due to us. He ſuffered the puniſhment of our iniquities, and anſwered the challenges of Juſtice. 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>He bore our ſins in his own body upon the tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. PROP. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus who Suffered was the Eternal Son of GOD.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus was honourable on the account of the excellencies of his humane Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> his Wiſdom and his Holineſs, but the great dignity of Chriſt is, that he was the Son of GOD. This cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is given to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Pſal. 45.6. <hi>Thy throne O God is for ever and ever.</hi> Iſai. 9.6. <hi>He is the Mighty God.</hi> And the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> doth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert it. Math. 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved ſon.</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>He is the brightneſs of his glory,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001930_0013_0FBA1D36C5C45180"/>and the expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> And the works of Creation are attributed to him. Indeed he ſuffered in his humane Nature on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the divine Nature is not capable of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; the divine Nature can't ſuffer pain or grief: at the time when Chriſt was upon the Croſs in the greateſt Extremity, the divine Nature was in perfect felicity. But yet his Sufferings were the Sufferings of the Son of God. If one part of a Man ſuffers, the Man ſuffers. Indeed the humane Nature is not properly a part of Chriſt, yet it is perſonally united to him; hence the ſufferings of the humane Nature are the ſufferings of God. 1 Cor. 2.8. <hi>They crucifyed the Lord of glory.</hi> Acts 3.15. <hi>They killed the Prince of Life. He that was in the form of God ſuffered the death of the croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows that his temporary ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were Equivalent to our Eternal ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Chriſt Jeſus was in a ſtate of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, all the while he was on the Earth, but the extremity of his ſufferings were but about a Night and a Day, yet theſe did anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for our Eternal ſufferings. If we had ſuffered in our own Perſons, we muſt have ſuffered for ever. Math. 26.41. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire.</hi> But his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were but temporary, yet they are Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to ours, becauſe of the dignity of his Perſon. We were finite Perſons, and He an infinite. Our ſufferings muſt have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in duration, and His were infinite in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001930_0014_0FBA1D38944BC148"/>reſpect of the dignity of his Perſon. Finite creatures cannot bear infinite puniſhment in a finite time: but an infinite Perſon may bear infinite puniſhment in a little time. The ſufferings of an infinite Perſon, have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value, and ſufferings that are of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value are equal to the ſufferings of meer Men for ever. Acts 20.28. <hi>God has purchaſed the Church with his own blood.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. PROP. <hi>Chriſt who ſuffered was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy.</hi> Many other Men are imperfectly holy, but Chriſt was perfectly ſo: He was not guilty of the firſt tranſgreſſion: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> was not repreſented by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo not involved in the guilt of his Sin. Other Men come Sinners into the World, but He was holy from his birth. Luke 1.35. <hi>That holy one that ſhall be born of thee.</hi> Chriſt was free from all manner of Sin, both Original and Actual: Heb. 7.26. <hi>He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners.</hi> He had great temptations from Men to Sin, but they did not prevail. 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again.</hi> He had temptations from Satan, but he did not prevail. Joh. 14.32. <hi>The prince of this World cometh and hath nothing in me.</hi> He always did that which pleaſed God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8 29. The moſt famous Men that ever were, were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001930_0015_0FBA1D3B94F3C8E8"/>
                  <hi>Noah, Moſes, David, Hezekiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul:</hi> but <hi>CHRIST</hi> was perfectly free from Sin. Men found fault with him, but God found no fault with him. He was Gods holy One. Acts 2.27. <hi>He fulfilled all Righteouſneſs,</hi> Math. 3.15.</p>
               <p>Hence, His ſufferings might be upon our account. The Lambs that were offered in Sacrifice were to be without ſpot. If Chriſt had not been holy, He could not have been a Sacrifice for us: a ſinful Perſon is liable to ſuffer upon his own account, and can't ſuffer the wrath of God for others: but Chriſt being holy, his Sufferings were available for our Redemption. 1 Pet. 1.9. <hi>We were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb, without ſpot and without blemiſh.</hi> It would have been utterly unacceptable to God to offer that which is polluted: but Chriſt being perfectly holy, there could be no objection againſt his Sacrifice. Being not liable to puniſhment on his own account, he was capable to ſuffer upon our account: He was only guilty by imputation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what he ſuffered, was not on his own Account, but on our account.</p>
               <p>IV. PROP. <hi>He was appointed to be a Surety for us.</hi> If that be tendred to God that is a reſponſible conſideration, that is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for us, unleſs God do accept thereof. If a Man offers to another a full price of a Field or an Houſe, that will make no purchaſe,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001930_0016_0FBA1D3CC67A43A0"/>without the conſent of the owner; but in this caſe God conſented: He appointed Chriſt to this Service: He made him to be the Second <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be the figure of him: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in this undertaking was Gods Servant, Iſai. 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant, whom I uphold; mine Elect in whom my Soul delighteth.</hi> Chriſt was no intruder, He did not thruſt himſelf into this Service. Heb. 5.5. <hi>Christ glorifyed not himſelf to be made an High Prieſt.</hi> God made him a Prieſt to offer up this Sacrifice. Pſal. 110.4. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus was choſen of God. God laid him for a foundation in <hi>Zion, Iſai.</hi> 28.16. God gave him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to offer up himſelf for us, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.18. He was put into the Office of a Mediator. <hi>There is One Mediator, between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. He ſtood as a Surety to repreſent us. Heb 2.12. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was made a Surety of a better Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, thoſe Sufferings that were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for One, were ſufficient for Thouſands. Chriſt being appointed a Publick Perſon, what he did and ſuffered is for every one of them whom he repreſented. The vertue of Chriſts Suffering is not divided among the Elect; but the vortue of his Sufferings doth belong to every one of his. There was no need that he ſhould ſuffer the more becauſe he ſuffered for a great many. <hi>Adam</hi> being a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001930_0017_0FBA1D3E41D51208"/>Publick Perſon, if he had performed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it would have been reckoned to all his Poſterity, it would not have been divided among them, that if there had been a great many of them, they would have the ſmaller portions. Thus <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is the ſin of all his Poſterity; that ſin that was ſufficient to ruine him, would ruine ten Millions, even all his Poſterity, be they more or leſs. So thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt, that were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Redeem One, are a valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Millions. If many have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned on that account, yet the cleanſing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts blood is not diminiſhed. 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of Reproof to thoſe that deſpiſe the blood of Chriſt.</hi> We read of ſome that count <hi>the blood of the Covenant a common thing,</hi> Heb. 10.29. You may well think, that God takes it hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly, when you deſpiſe it as if there were no great vertue in it. There be ſome Men that are diſtreſſed for want of pardon, Death is amazing to them; but they dare not truſt in the blood of Chriſt, as if there were little vertue in it: you heat great commendations of it, but you don't believe them: you ſlight it as inſufficient for the Expiation of your Sins: You don't believe that God has any great eſteem of it, you think if you ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001930_0018_0FBA1D4056C698D0"/>truſt in it, it would be a preſumptuous thing, that would be a way to be cheated of your Soul. Though you pray that you may be ſprinkled with Chriſts blood, and profeſs the ſaving vertue of it, yet you do deſpiſe it.</p>
               <p>For, it is not from the low opinion that you have of your ſelf that you are afraid, but from the low opinion that you have of Chriſt. You ſay you are a poor wretched Sinner, you have a bad heart and are extream vile, and run out very much in condemning your ſelf, as if you had a very humble ſenſe of your own unworthineſs, but this is not the thing that hinders your coming to Chriſt: Many perſons that have lower thoughts of themſelves than you have, do yet venture upon Chriſt. Notwithſtanding your pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humility, you have too high thoughts of your ſelves; but the cauſe of your fear is, you are not ſenſible of the mighty vertue that is in Chriſt: it is not becauſe you ſee your ſelf a great Sinner, but becauſe you don't ſee Chriſt to be a great Saviour. It is not becauſe you have ſo deep a ſenſe of your malady, but becauſe you have ſo little ſenſe of the remedy. Men that are wretched Men are invited to Chriſt. Rev. 3.17, 18. <hi>Thou art wretched and poor and miſer able and blind and naked: I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayeſt be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayſt be clothed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it from the high opinion that you have of the Juſtice of God, that you are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001930_0019_0FBA1D42AEAFC070"/>afraid to come to Chriſt. You ſay there be terrible threatnings in the Word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinners; He ſays <hi>the wages of ſin is death, and curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi> You ſay God is juſt and will be as good as his word, <hi>and no jot nor tittle of the Law ſhall paſs, but all ſhall be fulfilled.</hi> But this is not the thing that hinders your coming to Chriſt, but the thing is, you are not ſenſible that Chriſt has fulfilled the Law, that all the challenges of the Law have been anſwered by him, that he has fully payed our debts to the Juſtice of God. Thoſe that do come to Chriſt have as firm a perſwaſion of the Juſtice of God as you have, and that ſhews them the neceſſity of coming to Chriſt, and don't at all diſcourage them, for they ſee a ſufficiency in Chriſt to deliver them from the curſe of the Law. Gal. 3.13. <hi>Christ has redeemed us from the curſe being made a curſe for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it from the high opinion that you have of the Holineſs of God, that you are afraid to come to Chriſt. You ſay God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Holineſs. The Scraphims cry <hi>Loly, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Iſai 6 3. <hi>God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13. And you ſay, God will not endure ſuch an unholy Creature as you are: how can the holy God take delight in ſuch a polluted Creature; you are filthy &amp; abominable; but this is not the reaſon, why you are afraid to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001930_0020_0FBA1D43825313D8"/>come to Chriſt, for it is no way inconſiſtent with the Holineſs of God, to pardon Mens Sins. God may hate Sin yet pardon it. He may hate Sin, yet pardon Sinners, and take delight in Saving them; the pardoning of Sin is a promoting of Holineſs. Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> If you had a due ſenſe of the vertue of Chriſts blood, the holineſs of God would be no diſcouragement unto you.</p>

                  <hi>This Doctrine condemns thoſe that have a greater value for their own works than for the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Some Men make their own works the great foundation of their hope.

Some becauſe of their works, they think God is not angry with them; though their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be not healed, yet they are eaſed: ſome are ſtriving to get juſtification by works, and are neglecting the offers of Mercy thro' Chriſt.

Conſider, 1. <hi>You have no Divine Warrant for this.</hi> It is a bold preſumptuous thing to truſt in God without his Word to warrant you. They that go in this way go upon the incouragement of their own carnal reaſon: Men have a warrant to truſt in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commands them. 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment that we believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And becauſe God invites them: Math. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden.</hi> But where do you find any command to truſt in your own works, or any invitation to do ſo? or any promiſe on that condition? The Scripture is ſilent, there is not a tittle that way: You muſt go ſome-where elſe to find your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; the word of God don't ſupport that hope: it is a daring thing to truſt in God without any incouragement from him. Men have nothing but bold conjectures, and raſh ſuppoſitions to bear them out therein: they that do ſo, venture their Souls upon a fooliſh imagination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God declares againſt it.</hi> To truſt in God without his word is bad, but to truſt in him againſt his word is worſe. God warns them againſt it, that it is preſumption with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To depend upon that as a way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which God declares to be a way of Damnation, is extream impudence: the foundation of their belief is unbelief. Are we not told that works will not ſave Men? Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no

Be there any ſolemn war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to diſcourage Men from truſting in Chriſt? Men are afraid though God don't warn them againſt it, but they will truſt in their own righteouſneſs though warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as if God jeſted with them, when he warned them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Your beſt works have matter of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them.</hi> The beſt works of Men are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Iſai. 64.6. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags.</hi> There is pride, dulneſs, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that doth attend them; and can you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that thoſe things that do deſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, do deſerve deliverance from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? Are thoſe works meritorious that are puniſhable? Do thoſe things that deſerve Hell, deſerve Heaven? Perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the price of Heaven, but with what aſſurance can Men depend on that Obedience which is imperfect? Do Men think that they pay for Heaven by ſuch works as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Hell? Has God changed the price of Heaven? Will ſuch actions as were wont to provoke the Juſtice of God, now pacify his Juſtice?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Your works don't anſwer the Law.</hi> The Law is a ſtanding rule: As God bound us by his Law, ſo he bound himſelf, he made a Law for himſelf, and will not depart from it.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001930_0023_0FBA1D4B2C9DE7D0"/>rule, your works will not juſtify you. The Law threatens the curſe for ſin.

Works have not the nature of ſatisfaction in them; imperfect works ſignify nothing by the Law, to earn eternal Life; theſe Men can't claim by the Goſpel, becauſe they reject Chriſt, they can't claim by the Law, becauſe they don't keep the Law. <hi>What things the Law faith, it faith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Your good works are fewer than your Sins.</hi> Suppoſe your works were better than they be, and had the nature of ſatisfaction in them ſo far as they would go, yet upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you will find, that your good works are fewer than your Sins, your good thoughts few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than your ſinful Thoughts, your Sins of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Commiſſion, do far exceed the number of your good works: you muſt ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Mine iniquities are more than the hairs of my head.</hi> And do you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that one good work, will ſatisfy for an hundred bed ones?

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001930_0025_0FBA1D4EC6D4DEF0"/>and if you have a part in the blood of Chriſt, you may be ſure that your Sins are pardoned. It is a thing of great conſequence to have your Sins pardoned. Pſal. 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Whatever Afflictions you are under, you may bleſs your ſelves, if your Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: But you are a miſerable Man if they be not. Your Sins will ſink you into hell. Inquire therefore whether you have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the blood of Chriſt: you have had a great opportunity to get an intereſt in his blood, you have been inſtructed in the need you have of it, and the vertue of it: you have had time enough to obtain it: Others as Young as you have obtained it. Examine therefore how it is with you: if you have, you will ſee a foundation of comfort, if you find that you have not, that may ſtir you up to get an intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>Signs, 1. <hi>If you be indeed convinced of the cleanſing vertue of this blood, then you have an interest in it.</hi> They that are convinced of this, have ſaving light let into them; they are tranſlated from darkneſs unto light, and ſo are delivered from the kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Light to diſcern the glory of Chriſt is the peculiar enjoyment of Godly Men. 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Myſteries of the Goſpel are hid to other Men, but revealed to the Saints. Conviction of the ſaving vertue
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001930_0026_0FBA1D504D07FFA0"/>of the blood of Chriſt, is not from common illumination, but from Sanctifying and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving light: when ever Men are convinced of the ſaving vertue of Chriſts blood, they will receive him: it is for want of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and underſtanding, that Men do reject Chriſt: God gains the Will by convincing the Mind. Many Men can't be perſwaded to come to Chriſt, becauſe they don't ſee it ſafe. Light and Life go together. Joh. 6.40. <hi>Every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him.</hi> v. 45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is one thing to be convinced of, another to be affected with this dectrine.</hi> Common illuminations are very affecting: Men may be affected with the terrors of hell, yet not certainly believe them; as hypocrites are. Iſai. 33.14. <hi>They ſay, who can dwell with devouring fire?</hi> So, Men may be affected with the Goſpel, yet not be indeed convinced. Math. 13.20. <hi>Anon with joy they received it.</hi> Gal. 4.15. <hi>Where is the bleſſedneſs, ye ſpake of?</hi> Experience ſhews that Men are commonly affected with tidings that they are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of. A probable apprehenſion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vertue of Chriſts blood may work much upon the affections of Men. Many Men are greatly affected with the Goſpel, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fall from the profeſſion of the truth.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001930_0027_0FBA1D5250195680"/>Being much affected is no ſecurity from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. But if Men be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed convinced, they will never fall away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is one thing to be convinced, and onether thing to be filenced.</hi> Men are wont to have a great many objections againſt the ſufficiency of Chriſts blood for them; but ſometimes they are argued ſo with, that their Mouths are ſtopped, their objections from the number and aggravations of their Sins, their objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the anger of God, their not knowing their Election, are anſwered, and they can't gainſay the replys that are made to them: yet they are not convinced, they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and put to ſilence, yet not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Acts 9.22. <hi>Saul confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damaſcus, proving that this is very Chriſt.</hi> For Men may be put to ſilence, yet not ſee the grounds of faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the word of God, the riches of his grace, and the dignity of Chriſt. Men may be put to ſilence, yet harbour apprehenſions, that though they can't anſwer what is alledged at the preſent, they may be able when they have ſtudied more upon it, and that if they are not able to anſwer what is ſaid, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be able.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is one thing to be convinced of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts blood, another thing to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that this is the doctrine of the Scripture.</hi> Many are convinced that if the Scriptures be true, the ways of Sin are dangerous, yet they are not convinced that Sin is dangerous; ſo
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001930_0028_0FBA1D53411148F0"/>many are convinced that if the Scriptures be true, Salvation is by the blood of Chriſt: they are fully ſatisfy'd that this is the doctrine taught in the Bible; yet they don't believe the vertue of the blood of Chriſt: they can plainly underſtand the ſenſe of the Scripture, but they are ſtrangers to the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the word of God. Many of the <hi>Jews</hi> though they profeſſed to believe <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not believe him. Job. 5.46. <hi>Had ye believed Moſes, ye would have believed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is one thing to be convinced of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts blood, another thing to be perſwaded that there is no other way of Salvation.</hi> A Man may be very clear in that, that the way of the <hi>Turks</hi> is not the right way; that way countenances wickedneſs, and makes no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to ſatisfy Juſtice, and promiſes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures in the other world: So he may be abundantly ſatisfyed, that the way of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> is falſe, becauſe of then Idolatry and Superſtition, and becauſe their Religion is againſt ſenſe and reaſon, they don't teach the right way of Juſtification: So he may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed that the way of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is falſe; they don't own the Divinity of Chriſt, they give no rational account of our Juſtification; yet theſe men may be in the dark, about the ſaving vertue of Chriſt blood. They prefer our Religion before others, look upon it is probably true, yet are not certain of it.</p>

2. Sign. <hi>If you live upon the Sufferings of Christ, you have an intereſt in his blood.</hi> Chriſt tells us that <hi>His fleſh is meat indeed,</hi> Joh. 6.55. If you believe in the blood of Chriſt, that is the foundation of your hope. Some pretend to believe in the blood of Chriſt, but their comfort doth eſpecially depend upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that they have done. When they think how they have provoked God to anger, they comfort up themſelves with their Prayers and Tears, they make them their refuge, they are the things that quiet their hearts and diſſipate their fears. But they that have an intereſt in the blood of Chriſt, make that their plea: that is their great refreſhing: Phil. 3.3. <hi>We rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> When Conſcience accuſes, they ſet this againſt thoſe accuſations. Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died.</hi> When they think of the Juſtice and Jealouſy of God, they remember the dignity of Chriſts Perſon. Heb. 1.3. <hi>He who is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of the Father, has purged our ſins by his blood.</hi> They are comforting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the <hi>Juſt died for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. They remember that God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that Men ſhall be bleſſed in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.17. When they conſider the provoking nature of Sin, they remember that Chriſt has offered a Sacrifice acceptable to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>They ſet under his ſhadow with great delight,</hi> Cant. 2.3. They are beholding the Lamb of God, that takes away the Sin of the world.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001930_0030_0FBA1D5D11353E30"/>They likewiſe receive ſtrength from Chriſt to live holily: the conſideration of the blood of Chriſt has a Sanctifying efficacy upon them. They are not bold to Sin becauſe Chriſt has procured pardon, but they are ſtrengthned againſt Temptations thereby. Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live by faith in the Son of God.</hi> The Death of Chriſt is a means to crucify their Sins. 2 Cor. 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains me.</hi> The conſideration of Chriſts death is powerful to make them live holily.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of Exhortation, to depend on the blood of Chriſt.</hi> You want pardon, you are undone, if you be not pardoned. You dare not depend upon your ſelf, and it is well that you dare not: But you may ſafely depend upon the blood of Chriſt. It is Mens wiſdom to be cautious what they do depend upon; it would be a dreadful thing to throw away your Souls: There is no danger in depending upon Chriſt. God never propounded any other way to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This is a way agreeable to the Juſtice of God, this is a way contrived by the wiſdom of God, this is a proper way to advance the glory of Gods Grace. This is the way that God contrived before the foundation of the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. You need not be afraid of any inſufficiency in the blood of Chriſt: Fear to venture you Soul on Chriſt, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of God and Chriſt; but it is no
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001930_0031_0FBA1D5E8D425538"/>preſumption to accept Gods offer. It was a ſafe thing for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſprinkle the Poſts of the doors with the blood of the paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when the deſtroying Angel was to go through the Land of <hi>AEgypt:</hi> It was a ſafe courſe for them that were ſtung with the fiery flying Serpents, to look to the brazen Serpent: So, it is a ſafe thing for you to fall in with the Counſel of God, and truſt in the blood of Chriſt, <hi>for that cleanſeth from all ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now anſwer ſome Objections that may riſe in your hearts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obj. <hi>It is very uncertain whether I am Elected; and if not, I ſhall never be ſaved.</hi> Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election have obtained it, and the reſt are blinded</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The uncertainty of Election is no diſcouragement. Multitudes of Perſons have come to Chriſt and been ſaved by him, and they were all uncertain of their Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to Chriſt: for there is no way to know Election but by Vocation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And tho' your Election be uncertain, yet the event of your faith is not uncertain: You uſe means for the preſervation of your Lives, tho' its uncertain whether God have decreed that you ſhall live any longer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is an abſolute connexion between Faith &amp; Salvation: if you believe in Chriſt that will be a ſure ſign of Election. 1 Theſ. 1.4, 5. <hi>Knowing brethren your Election of God,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001930_0032_0FBA1D603805CFE8"/>for our Goſpel came in power,</hi> &amp;c. Faith is a ſure fore runner of Salvation. The terms of the Goſpel do not run ſo, If you believe you ſhall be ſaved, provided you be Elected; but <hi>he that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.36.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obj. <hi>There are but few that have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the blood of Chriſt. Multitudes in Places of Profeſſion fall ſhort of Eternal life.</hi> Math. 20.16. <hi>Many are called and few are choſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The reaſon why ſo many fall ſhort of Salvation is becauſe they will not come to Chriſt: they refuſe and ſo they periſh, and if you refuſe, you will periſh. All that believe in Chriſt are ſaved. Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God.</hi> If you believe in him it will be no ſtrange thing for you to be ſaved, tho' thouſands fall at your ſide, and ten thouſand at your right hand: and if there be but few ſaved, why may not you as well as others obtain? that was no diſcouragement to <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſhould be none to you: you ſtand as fair as others for Salvation, and will not be rejected if you come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obj. <hi>I have not the inward Call of the Goſpel: all that have that Call are Juſtifyed,</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>but I have only the External call, and Multitudes have that, who periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The External call is our warrant to believe. The Goſpel is the word of God, and offers of God recorded in the Scripture make it our duty to believe, and are our ſecurity in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001930_0033_0FBA1D619B88CC30"/>a way of believing. In the External call there is Gods command and Gods promiſe, and we muſt be judged by what is written. Rom. 2.16. <hi>God will judge the ſecrets of men according to my Goſpel.</hi> The inward call is no diſtinct call, but only the opening of the eyes to ſee the External call to be true. You may not expect any ſuch revelation as was made to the Prophets. If you believe the Voice of God in his Word, that is enough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Obj. <hi>The blood of Chriſt can't move the heart of God to pity me. It ſeems, that if I had a broken heart, that would move God to pity me; but how can the Sufferings of Chriſt move Gods pity to me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> You don't need any thing to move God to pity you. The pity of God is only from his own breaſt. Hoſ. 14.4. <hi>I will love them freely.</hi> All that is wanting is, to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the Law for you, to ſatisfy Juſtice, and pay the price of your Redemption, and this the blood of Chriſt has effectually done. It was only the Law that lay in the way of your Salvation, and the blood of Chriſt anſwers all the challenges of the Law. 1 Pet. 1.19. <hi>We were redeemed with the precious blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> His Sufferings were as much as Juſtice doth demand for our Redemption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obj. <hi>God ſeems to be too angry with me to accept of me: He must needs be angry with me, becauſe I have been provoking of him all my days; and he appears to be ſo, in that he don't hear my Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001930_0034_0FBA1D6552525A78"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God is alwayes angry with Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he pardons them: till the very moment wherein they are pardoned, his anger is not abated But he is never ſo angry with any Man, but he ſtands ready to pardon him, if he comes to Ghriſt. Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God is no paſſion, his anger is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Judge, He is angry becauſe Men are guilty of the Law; but when they come to Chriſt, they are not guilty by the Law, the Law acquits them, and ſo Gods anger ceaſes. God is never ſo angry as to be unfaithful; if he be angry, he will not forget his Word.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Obj. <hi>I am not godly but under the power of Sin, and ſo it ſeems to be a preſumptuous thing for me to thrust my ſelf on Chriſt: for without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb 12.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God doth not expect, that Men ſhould be firſt holy, and ſo be encouraged to come to Chriſt; they are invited that have no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they that are wretched and blind and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. They that are a thirſt, being deſtitute of Grace are invited, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. There is no need of antecedent holineſs, before Men come to Chriſt, though there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a concomitant holineſs: Men come with a ſpirit of Love and Repentance. God is ſaid to <hi>Juſtify the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. that is, ſuch as were ungodly, till the very time of their Juſtification.</p>

            <p>THESE words with thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, are an evidence of what he had predicted in the firſt verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the laſt days perillous times ſhould come. By the laſt days we are to underſtand the laſt days of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. So James 5.3. <hi>Ye have heaped trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure together for the laſt days.</hi> Acts 2.17. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, ſaith God, I will pour out of my ſpirit upon all fleſh.</hi> Thoſe laſt days ſhall be perillous times, times of great danger; this be proves from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that ſhall abound among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and he firſt mentions that which is the root of all
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001930_0036_0FBA1D684F716268"/>the reſt, <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of themſelves:</hi> there is a lawful ſelf-love, an holy ſelf-love, and a ſinful ſelf-love. This is that he ſpeaks of, <hi>Men ſhall love themſelves,</hi> without due regard either to God or their Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why doth he make this a ſign of Perilous Times, ſeeing all carnal Men, in all Ages, are lovers of themſelves?</hi> This is no new thing for ſuch Men to love themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Two things may be intended in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Men ſhould be generally carnal, and ſo under the power of ſelf love.</hi> There would be very few godly Men among them, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it was a little before the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſelf-love would mightily prevail over the light of Conſcience.</hi> There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among carnal Men; ſome are under great reſtraints, but others are left of God to the prevailings of their Luſts, and hurried into all manner of abominations.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>Natural Men are under the government of Self-Love.</q>
               <p>Godly Men are under the influence of a better and higher principle, they have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love to God. Pſal. 18.1. <hi>I love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength.</hi> But Natural Men are ruled by a ſpirit of ſelf-love. The firſt and great Command is, <hi>to love the Lord thy God with all the heart,</hi> Matth. 22.37, 38. But Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Men are wholly deſtitute of this ſpirit.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001930_0037_0FBA1D6E515ACF60"/>There is much of a ſpirit of ſelf-love in the Saints; but other Men are under the power of it. Phil. 2.21. <hi>All ſeek their own things, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Self-love branches out it ſelf into the love of honour, and profit, and eaſe, and carnal pleaſure, of their wills, and of their lives; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the love of one intereſt is predominant, and ſometimes the love of another, but ſtill they are governed by a ſpirit of ſelf-love. Their own hearts tell them, that they ſhould not be governed by it, but it doth rule them.</p>
               <p>In ſpeaking to this I ſhall firſt premiſe two Cautions, and then prove the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Caution, 1. <hi>They are ſometimes over-ruled by a ſpirit of Compaſſion.</hi> Men that are devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to themſelves, are ſo over-born ſometimes with a Spirit of Compaſſion, that they forget their own Intereſt. Some Men are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate than others: but there is no Man ſo void of compaſſion, but upon ſome occaſions pity will prevail upon him. The ſeeing or hearing of the Miſeries of others, will extort acts of compaſſion, and they will be under a neceſſity to deny themſelves, and relieve them. Men have not the command of their own compaſſions, their compaſſion doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſometimes whether they will or no, and they are forced to neglect their own intereſt to relieve others in their diſtreſs: and this compaſſion is not only to friends, but to ſtrangers, perſons that they have no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with; yea to Enemies, perſons that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001930_0038_0FBA1D6FEA999038"/>they are prone to do a diſpleaſure to them; yea, to bruit Creatures alſo.</p>
               <p>Caution, 2. <hi>Sometimes they are over-ruled by Conſcience of Good and Evil.</hi> Some things are ſo manifeſtly good, that they cannot but give an approbation to them, and ſome are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly evil, that Men muſt diſapprove them. Rom. 2.18. <hi>Thou approveſt the things that are excellent being inſtructed out of the Law.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will bear its teſtimony for ſome things and againſt others, though it thwarts their own intereſt. Some things appear ſo right, that they will plead for them, though it be againſt their own intereſt: And ſome appear ſo wrong, that they will plead againſt them. Sometimes carnal Men will ſtand up in a cauſe from the meer dictates of Conſcience, though he doth expoſe himſelf to great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities thereby, it would apparently be his intereſt to be on the other ſide, but Conſcience bears down all before it. The Conſciences of bears down all before it. The Conſciences of Men are very much corrupted, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will offer violence to them, for a little gain or pleaſure, or to obtain favour with Men: but ſometimes it is otherwiſe, Conſcience will overcome regard to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and regard to their worldly profit, and in obedience to the dictates of Conſcience they will forget their intereſt: they are ſet that right ſhould take place, tho' they ſuffer for what they do.</p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall now prove the Doctrine. And it appears by an induction of particulars.</p>

1. <hi>They are governed by ſelf-love in their ill Affection to God.</hi> It is ſaid of carnal Men that <hi>they have God:</hi> Joh. 15.25. <hi>They hated me without a cauſe.</hi> Rom. 1.30. <hi>They are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God.</hi> Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural mind is Enmity to God.</hi> Some of theſe Men find af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God, yet they are enemies to him: <hi>They were alienated and enemies to God by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works,</hi> Col. 1.21. They are wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of love to God: Joh. 5.42. <hi>You have not the love of God in you.</hi> They could be glad there were no God. They don't like it that he ſees them, that he is juſt, that he is able to avenge himſelf. And the foundation of this enmity to God is ſelf-love. They are ſo addicted to their own intereſt as makes them to have a bitter ſpirit towards God.</p>
               <p>They hate God becauſe he croſſes them in his Laws. They have a deſire to ſerve their corruptions, but they are reſtrained by God: they would fain have more liberty in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pleaſures, than the Laws of God do allow them: ſo in purſuing the World, but God will not ſuffer them They dare not do what they have a mind to do, leaſt God ſhould be offended. Carnal Men affect a great deal of liberty, they would walk after the ſight of their eyes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9. but God limits them and controuls them, he tells, that they may not do this and this, and they are forced to deny themſelves of many things that they deſire, and they don't know how to bear it. It ſeems to them that God is an enemy to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001930_0040_0FBA1D7759B72528"/>their comfort; they think they could live an happy life, if they were not confined within ſuch narrow bounds, and ſo they have an ill affection unto God as an adverſary of their felicity.</p>
               <p>So they hate God becauſe he afflicts them in his Providence. They have a great many afflictions that are very croſs to them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are afflicted with Sickneſs &amp; Death in their Families; ſometimes their Corn is blaſted, the Worms devour their fruit, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies diſtreſs them, their deſigns are broken, their joy is turned into ſorrow, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in difficulties, and they attribute theſe things to God. Whatever be the inſtrument of the affliction, yet it comes from God; if it ſeems to be a meer caſualty, yet it is ordered by God. Job 12.9. <hi>Who knoweth not in all theſe, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</hi> They think it is God that bereaves them, and makes them poor, he could eaſily have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their ſorrows, but he has a mind to croſs them, ſo they look upon him, as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their comfort; he is ever and anon plaguing them, and wont ſuffer them to live quietly, and they are very angry with him. Jon. 4.1. <hi>It diſpleaſed Jonah exceedingly and he was very angry.</hi> Iſai. 8.21. <hi>When they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves and curſe their King and their God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So they hate God becauſe they are afraid that he will bring miſeries upon them. If they proſper at preſent, they are afraid that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001930_0041_0FBA1D7A005553C0"/>God will go out againſt them in ways of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. They know, that they are guilty, and they have a terrour upon their ſpirits, leaſt wrath will fall upon them. Job 15.21. <hi>A dreadful ſound is in his ears.</hi> They think they ſhould do well enough if God would but let them alone; but they are afraid that God will damn them. They read many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Scriptures againſt Unconverted Men, and they are doubtful that God has determined to deſtroy them, and they don't know how to bear the thoughts of it. The fear of Hell ſpoils their Mirth, and it is a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible provocation to them: they are even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to blaſpheme God Rev. 16.11. <hi>They blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the God of Heaven, becauſe of their plagues, and becauſe of their ſores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are governed by ſelf-love in their ill Affection to Men.</hi> Men are obliged <hi>to love their Neighbours as themſelves,</hi> Matth. 22.39. But no natural Men do in any meaſure live up to this rule; but Men are great enemies one to another. Tit. 3.3. <hi>Hateful and hating one another;</hi> they do but a little good one to another: they do a great deal of hurt one to another, abundance of the miſeries of Men riſe from Men; Men do much more hurt one to another, than the bruit Creatures do to them. They are like pricks in one anothers eyes, and like thorns in their ſides. And the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this is inordinate ſelf love; their love to themſelves begets enmity to others. 2 Tim 3.2, 3. <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of themſelves,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001930_0042_0FBA1D7CCCC201A8"/>diſobedient to Parents, unthankful, without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſers of thoſe that are good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they hate other Men becauſe they hurt them. Self-love makes Men tender of their intereſt, and if other Men hurt their Eſtates, their Reputation, their Bodies, their Children, their Spirits are imbittered againſt them, they ſtand ready to revenge their wrongs; they can't bear it, that their intereſt is touched; if they have an opportunity they will be even with them, their hearts are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating revenge. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>

                  </hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrong done to their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Joab</hi> will avenge himſelf of <hi>Abner</hi> for the death of <hi>Aſahel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 3.27. Yea, if they but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have hurt them, they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.19.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they are afraid others will hurt them, and that makes them hate them: others have threatned them, have made attempts that way; ſometimes they have provobed others, and they expect the fruit of their diſpleaſure, and upon that account they ſeek their hurt. <hi>Hanun</hi> had given occaſion of anger to <hi>Lavid,</hi> and then prepares to make War with him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6. If they are but jealous, that another will do them a diſpleaſure, they have an evil eye towards him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.9. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love makes them to have an ill affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others becauſe they ſtand in their way. Men are in the purſuit of ſome advantage, and ſome others ſtand in their way, they are
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001930_0043_0FBA1D7E031BBB08"/>competitours? with them for the ſame Oſhice, others are as well accompliſhed as themſelves, and they have an intereſt in the heart of thoſe that have power to preferthem, and ſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are in danger of diſappointment, and they can't bear them, they will tell of their infirmities, and ſeek their ruine. <hi>Abner</hi> can't bear <hi>Amaſa's</hi> advancement, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they have an ill affection to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers becauſe they do out-ſtrip them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times others carry more worthily and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably than themſelves, and they can't bear them. Eccl. 4.4. <hi>For every good and every right work, a man is envied of his Neighbour.</hi> Some have more knowledge and greater ability, and they can't love them. They would be glad to engroſs every thing that is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. Men are hated becauſe of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments &amp; attainments. <hi>Rachel</hi> envied her Siſter, <hi>Corah</hi> envied <hi>Aaron, Saul</hi> envied <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Self-love makes Men have an ill affection to others, becauſe they blame them. Some Men are much offended, when they are reproved, they are fonder of their reputation, and take a reproof for an affront: they take it to be a great abuſe, and bear a grudge on that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſtand ready to revenge themſelves, and are forward to do a Man a diſpleaſure on that account. So the Phariſees hated Chriſt. So <hi>Abner</hi> hated <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.8. Men love to have others Prophecy ſmooth things, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.10. Men can't bear plain dealing, they love to ſleep in a whole skin, they can't
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001930_0044_0FBA1D8043CFA988"/>endure plain dealing. <hi>Ahab</hi> hated <hi>Micajah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Self-love governs in Moral Carriages.</hi> Some Natural Men have their particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertures: ſome Men are of Truth, ſome are very juſt, ſome are temperare, ſome are dutiful to Superiours: Some are adorned with all moral vertues, they have a lovely converſation, and are much to be commended on the account of their Morality. Matth. 19.20. <hi>All thoſe things have I done from my youth.</hi> But they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned therein by a ſpirit of ſelf love. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love will make Men carry very badly, and ſelf-love will make Men carry very well. This is the wound of their Morality, that they don't ſerve God therein, but they ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Hoſ. 10.1. <hi>Ephrains is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf;</hi> they have a ſelviſh aim in all they do. It is lawful for them to aim at themſelves in a ſubordinate way, to the glory of God: but they make themſelves their laſt end.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they do it for their Reputation. Vicious carriages are ſhameful; if they be known they are a diſgrace to them. Gen 38.23 <hi>Let her take it to her ſelf leaſt we be ſhamed.</hi> Such carriages are matter of reproach, thereby they make themſelves of the number of the fools in Iſrael; they are deſpiſed and render themſelves ignominious; their Relations are aſhamed of them: it is a diſgrace to be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with them. This conſideration is the great thing that influences many Men: they
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001930_0045_0FBA1D8409796A40"/>can't endure to be objects of contempt and ſcorn; they think of that Scripture, Prov. 6.33. <hi>A wound and diſhonour ſhall he get and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> They hate to be a by-word. This makes them to withſtand temptation, they are content to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their pleaſures that they might keep a good Name.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they carry morally for their profit. Many corrupt carriages are of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing Nature; ſo is Idleneſs. Prov. 6.10, 11. <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the hands to ſleep, ſo ſhall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</hi> So is Wontonneſs, Prov. 5.10. <hi>Leaſt strangers be filled with thy wealth.</hi> So is Intemperance, Prov. 23.21. <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to poverty.</hi> Men that are given to that, laviſh away their Eſtates. And Men abſtain from Vice, becauſe they can't endure to be brought to ſtraits and neceſſities, they are backward to ſuch ways as will draw them into Expences; it ſeems to them a fooliſh thing to waſte what they have, they ſhould bring themſelves to Poverty, they can hardly afford to ſpend for neceſſity, much leſs for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity. They conform to many Moral Rules from principles of good Husbandry.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they carry Morally to pleaſe their Friends. Some Perſons are ſo hardned in ſin that they don't much regard their Relations. They are like <hi>Eli's</hi> Sons <hi>that did not hearken to the Voice of their Father:</hi> but there be ſome
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001930_0046_0FBA1D864EA55038"/>that have a great Veneration for their Parents, they are ſenſible that their Parents have a dear affection to them, and they count them wiſe and good, &amp; can't bear to grieve them, and their counſels ſtick upon their hearts. When they have Temptations they think if they ſhould comply it would be bitter to their Parents, and ſo they reject Temptation; and they dare not be ſo bad as others. 2 Chron. 24.2. <hi>Joaſh did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, all the days of Jehoiadah the Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it is to prevent the Reproach of their Conſciences. They have experience that when they carry orderly, they have not ſuch Reflections as at other times, their hearts don't twit them, nor revile them. They are more quiet within and can vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but if at any time they are extravagant, it perplexes them afterward, &amp; they have a ſtorm within; their Conſciences upbraid them, and imbitter their comforts, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages look ugly and baſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.2. And ſo they reſiſt Temptation.</p>
               <p>So they carry Morally to prevent Judgment. The Scripture is full of Inſtances of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on particular Perſons for ſinful carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and they dare not fall in with Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leaſt the wrath of God ſhould break out againſt them, and leaſt they ſhould periſh for ever. Job 31.23. <hi>Deſtruction from God was a terrour unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:001930_0047_0FBA1D87C8FF2190"/>
4. <hi>Self love governs them in their Religion.</hi> Natural Men do perform many duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Iſa. 58.2. <hi>Yet they ſeek me daily and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did righteouſneſs and forſook not the Ordinance of their God, they ask of me the Ordinance of Justice, and take delight in approaching to God.</hi> They Pray, and Preach, they Faſt, they attend Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they may do all the external duties of Religion, &amp; therein put a great deal of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal honour upon God: but ſtill they have ſome ſelviſh deſign in all that they do; they make the worſhip of God to be an engine to carry on their ſelviſh deſigns; there is no love to God in thoſe Services.</p>
               <p>Some of them have wicked ends in their Worſhip. They have ſome baſe deſigns when they carry Religiouſly. Mat. 23.14. <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour widows houſes and for a pretence make long Prayers.</hi> They have been Religious that they might avoid duty to their Parents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.5, 6. Their deſign has been to wreak their Malice upon others. <hi>Jezabel</hi> would have a Faſt proclaimed in order to the death of <hi>Nabai,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.9. And many others have low deſigns in their Religion: the Phariſees pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that they might have glory from men,</hi> Matth. 6.5. The Jews Faſted for themſelves: the higheſt deſign of Natural Men is Salvation: They agree with the Devils in their deſire that they may not be caſt into the deep; and with <hi>Simon Magus, That miſery may not come upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:001930_0048_0FBA1DEC4132FDD8"/>
This is very evident in ſome, becauſe they caſt off Religion when it is not for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. If Men aimed at Gods glory, they would purſue it to the end of their days: no flatteries would make them caſt it off; no danger would make them relinquiſh their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but ſome of them after a while are turn coats, they ſee an opportunity to mend their Eſtates, and ſhake off Religion. <hi>Demas has forſaken me having loved this preſent world,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10. Some are terrified with the fears of Perſecution and turn Apoſtates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. And there be others, that attend ſome duties of Religion but wont attend all. If Men did aim at the glory of God, they could not neglect any duty of Religion. But ſome perſons have a reſpect to one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but neglect others. They come to the Houſe of God, but won't Pray in Secret. Some attend Faſts when Authority commands them, but not elſe. Some will bring their Children to Baptiſm, but neglect the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Supper.</p>
               <p>Some Men aim at no more Religion than will promote their own Intereſt; they love to get ſo much as will make them acceptable to Men, and don't regard to get more: and ſome would fain have ſo much as will ſecure their Salvation, that they may have Eternal Life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.16. but think it ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to afflict themſelves to get any further meaſures of Religion. And this doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhow, that Multitudes of Men, act in
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001930_0049_0FBA1DF50260CB90"/>Religion only from Self-love, becauſe they do oppoſe that part of Religion that muſt be done for Gods Glory. The very nature of ſome actions do imply a regard to Gods glory. So believing in Chriſt cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving God the Glory of his Grace and Faithfulneſs: but they refuſe that. Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life.</hi> So godly Sorrow doth imply in it a ſincere regard to Gods glory: but they utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that. All Spiritual duties are neglected by them. Thoſe things that may be done for ſelf-ends are attended, but they neglect the reſt.</p>

                  <hi>From hence we way learn, That it is a vain thing for Natural Men to pretend that they do things for Gods honour.</hi> Sometimes they make ſuch pretences. Iſai. 66.5. <hi>Your brethren that caſt you out for my Names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified.</hi> But if they make themſelves believe that their end is Gods glory, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude themſelves: and if they make others believe that they aim at Gods glory, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude them: for they are governed by a ſpirit of ſelf love, and are wholly deſtitute of love to God. Some of them do confeſs that they have but a little love to God, but indeed they have not one ſpark of love to God in their hearts. Joh. 5.42 <hi>You have not the love of God in you.</hi> They talk of aiming at Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but it is only a pretence.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:001930_0050_0FBA1DF7564BC768"/>
1. <hi>Sometimes they pretend it to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> They are accuſed of that which is faulty, and when they have nothing to ſay to prove that the thing is lawful, they make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of that, that they had a good end in doing it. They ſay they did not do the thing out of ſpirit or ill will, but for Gods glory, &amp; think no body can contradict them therein; and if they do believe them, they will not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them very hardly, for the honour of God is a glorious end: but the thing is a meer Excuſe, they cover their revenge and malice with a pretence of Gods glory. Joh. 9.24. <hi>Give glory to God, we know this man is a ſinner. Abiſhai</hi> would have <hi>Shimei</hi> puniſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had <hi>Curſed the Lords anointed,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.19. but he would ſain have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> though he alſo was the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They pretend it to vindicate themſelves.</hi> When they are charged with iniquity, they ſtand up in the vindication of themſelves, that what they do is a proper means to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the glory of God: regard to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour calls for it. Hereby they would free themſelves from blame, and labour to ride clear of fault, becauſe the thing is for Gods glory: to ſtave off cenſure, by pretending love to the rule, and to the glory of God. Joh. 19.7. <hi>We have a law, and by our law he ought to die:</hi> But theſe Men love their own honour, much more than the honour of God.</p>
               <p n="3">

3 <hi>They pretend it to get applauſe.</hi> They are gaping after commendations, and they are not contented that Men ſhould think only that the thing is right in its nature, but they would have them think alſo that they do it for a right end; that the honour of God is a thing that lies near their hearts. They would have Men to cry them up for choice and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Men. It is matter of Reputation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Gods glory, but the thing they aim at is their own honour. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the main was, <hi>that they might have glory from men.</hi> Mens commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was better than Meat and Drink to them.</p>

The way that godly Men take is for their good; the way of Holineſs is the way of Happineſs: but ungodly Men are acting as if they ſought their own deſtruction, and were carried out with a malicious ſpirit againſt themſelves. Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against me wrongeth his own ſoul, all they that hate me love death.</hi> Then ſurely they are miſerably blinded, and are under a ſtrange deluſion; if they were not deceived, they would not act as they do.</p>

1. <hi>In giving way to ſinful practices.</hi> Evil practices have been witneſſed againſt in all Ages, yet there be thoſe that will keep up the trade. Some are addicting themſelves to ways of Intemperance, they are thirſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Strong Drink, and inflame themſelves with it. Some addict themſelves to ways of Uncleanneſs, and polluting themſelves with their Luſts. Some are practiſing Injuſtice. Some are falſe in their Speeches: And ſome are prophane in their Behaviour. Theſe Men are undoing themſelves: they complain that others are enemies to them, but indeed they are their own enemies. Job 31.3. <hi>Is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the wicked, and a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity?</hi>
               </p>

Men have many awful viſitations for their ungodly practices. God makes their lives uncomfortable.

There be means uſed for the preſervation of their lives, and they pray that they may live, but God will not be intreated: Death is the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, but a more early death is the fruit of their own ſins.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is preſenting their ſins before them; they have a frightful and gaſhly look. They are in a great doal of confuſion of ſpirit. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is minding them of the curſes that are written in Gods word. Sometimes there be inſtances of vengeance and their hearts are meditating terrour; if they have many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, their wounds ſmart ſo as to make their lives uncomfortable. Some have
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001930_0054_0FBA1DFEDA216848"/>pangs of terrour, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> and <hi>Felix:</hi> Some in a more abiding way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.16. <hi>Judds</hi> was weary of his life; the Silver made his heart heavier than his Purſe, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.3, 5.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) <hi>Sometimes God gives them up to hardneſs of heart.</hi> God takes occaſion from the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, to leave them to an obdurate Spirit. Spiritual Judgments are the moſt terrible Judgments, and the leſs ſorrowful their hearts are, the more ſorrowful their condition is; by living in Impenitency, they grieve away the Spirit of God. Formerly they thought it was but repenting and their danger would be over; but ſometimes God gives them up to a ſeared Conſcience: Rom. 11, 8. <hi>God hath given them the ſpirit of ſtumber.</hi> Their lives are longthned out, and they continue under the Means of Grace, but nothing works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; Younger Perſons are Converted, and the Spirit of God is ſtirring in the Place, but they are like the barren heath. Their Hearts are made far and Ordinances are blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. Thoſe rebukes and warnings that ſink into other Men, take no impreſſion on them, the arrows of the word fly over their heads, and the Goſpel is a favour of death unto death unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are very much miſtaken in preferring the World before Salvation.</hi> Many Men are craving Salvation: they can't beat the thoughts of Damnation; they are Praying for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, willing to attend Ordinances, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001930_0055_0FBA1E0018E24CE0"/>from vicious courſes; like <hi>Balaam,</hi> they deſire to die the death of the Righteous; yet their hearts are more upon the World than upon Salvation: the World is a dreadful ſnare to them, they ſee a great neceſſity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the World, and lay more weight on that than on Eternal life. Mat. 22.5. <hi>They made light of it, and went one to his Farm and another to his Merchandize.</hi> Theſe Men are under great deluſion and are enemies to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such Men take a great deal of care and pains, for that which will do them but little good.</hi> If they had Salvation, that would make them happy. But if you ſhould add ſomething to your Eſtates, that will be little advantage to you. You might eat better Food, and wear better Cloths, and have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Portions for their Children; but theſe are trifles to Salvation. Some that have leſs in the World live more comfortably than they that have more. Luke 12.15. <hi>The life of man conſiſts not in the abundance of thoſe things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> But ſhortly they muſt die and then all is loſt. Eccl. 9.6. <hi>They have no more a portion in any thing that is done under the Sun.</hi> You will be brought into an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with beggars. Princes muſt put off their Robes and beggars their Rags, when they lie in the Grave. Pſal. 49.17. <hi>His glory, doth not deſcend after him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They live but an uncomfortable life.</hi> They have a great deal of vexation of Spirit. Worldly cares are like thorns, they pierce<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001930_0056_0FBA1E02009F31E8"/>the Soul. You may have great diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and croſſes, you will have eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, like an hungry Man that can't be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

               <p n="5">(5) <hi>Sometimes becauſe of this God blaſts their worldly deſigns.</hi> If Men ſeek the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs in the firſt place, they are ſometimes bleſſed in their Worldly enjoyments on that account, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. but if their hearts be upon the world, they are blaſted becauſe of that. God loves to curſe their idols. If they had loved the world leſs, they might have had more of it. He is angry for their Covetouſneſs. Iſai. 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetouſneſs I was wroth and ſmote him.</hi> God is teaching of them by experience the vanity of the world: This is one reaſon that Men have ſo many Judgments on their Worldly enjoyments, they ſet their eyes on worldly things, and therefore God gives wings to them, and they fly away. Hoſ. 2.7. <hi>She ſhall follow after her lovers and ſhall not find them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">(6) <hi>Sometimes he puts them off with worldly things.</hi> Some Men prefer the World, and God gives them their hearts deſire, and denies better things to them. The Men take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Providence of God, and ſay, God proſpers them, and deals graciouſly with
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001930_0057_0FBA1E09913DF4A8"/>them, and they are bleſſed above many of their Neighbours; but they are miſtaken, God deals in Judgment with them. He ſays, let them proſper in the world, that it may be a ſnare to them: they don't mind the offers of Salvation that are made in the Goſpel, but are ſet for the world, let them have it, and they ſhall have nothing elſe; Heaven ſhall be reſerved for other Men.

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001930_0058_0FBA1E0DAD05E4E8"/>the Enjoyment of God before all the World: and ſuch Men do prefer the Enjoyment of God here before all the World. Some are very deſirous to Enjoy God when they die: it is a horrour to them to go to Hell: but they don't regard Gods Preſence here: they can live contentedly without Communion with God here. But godly Men prefer his Preſence here. Pſal. 63.1, 2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee.</hi> Such Men as prefer the enjoyment of God, wont neglect any thing that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in order to the enjoyment of God. They wont think much of their Time, and their Pains; they will put away their Sins; they will part with any thing rather than looſe God: they will part with Eſtate, and Eaſe, and Liberty, and Life, rather than looſe God. Acts 21.13. <hi>I am ready to die for the Name of Jeſus.</hi> Rev. 12.11. <hi>They loved not their lives unto the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Do you prefer the Honour of God before any worldly Enjoyment?</hi> The honour of God is of more Moment than your Outward Enjoyments. And it is fit God ſhould have his honour whatever doth become of your Enjoyments; but many will not ſtir much out of their way for the honour of God. But thoſe Men that purſue the honour of God, will not live in any Sin for the ſake of any worldly Enjoyment. All Sin is to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. If you eſteemed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God above your Enjoyments, you would not endure to live in any Sin for the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001930_0059_0FBA1E0F8115AA08"/>ſake of them. A Man that prefers the honour of God, will be contented that God ſhould vindicate his Name by Judgments. Some Men can't bear Judgments, the reaſon is they don't care what becomes of Gods honour, ſo they can ſhouriſh in the World. If Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the honour of God, they think it is well that God brings Judgments: though they ſuffer by them, yet they are willing it ſhould be ſo. They ſay, there is need of them for the vindication of the Name of God. Dan. 9.7. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face.</hi> If you prefer the honour of God, you will part with any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment for Gods honour. Some think much to part with any thing for Gods honour: But <hi>Abraham</hi> parted with his Country, with the Goods that he had taken in Battle, and with his Son for Gods honour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Queſt. <hi>Do you prefer the honour of God before your Salvation?</hi> The honour of God is of more worth than your Salvation, and you muſt prefer the honour of God before it. It is not a duty to be willing to be damned for Gods honour. It is fit the Will of Man ſhould ſubmit to the pleaſure of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he will diſpoſe of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. But he don't require Men to be freely willing to be damned, or to chooſe damnation for his honour; for God requires Men to ſeek Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. And indeed it is againſt Religion to be willing to be damned, for then they will be everlaſting enemies to God.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001930_0060_0FBA1E13C88B9F40"/>Love to Gods glory will make Men to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be the inſtruments of his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Yea, it is impoſſible that Men ſhould be underſtandingly willing to be damned; for it is againſt Nature: there is no principle in Man to make him willing. Yet thoſe that love God prefer his glory before their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they are ſatisfyed in the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God in damning Men for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; they deſire Salvation principally that they may honour God. They do count the honour of God of greater moment than their Salvation, and take a complacency in that, that God will not diſhonour himſelf, but will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his Name.

When we read the dreadful threatning that God has denounced againſt them, we ſhall not need to wonder: there is no occaſion to think that God deals hardly with them: for they utterly neglect the end that they were made for, and make it their buſineſs to ſerve

Many ſevere Laws are made in one Kingdom and another to prevent theſe Sins, but they break in like a flood, and ſpread over the World: and this is the cauſe of them, Men love themſelves more than God. One loves his pleaſures more than God, another his profit or his honour; one Mans Self-love works in one channel, anothers in another; this is the root of all wickedneſs: the Spirit of every Natural Man has in it the Seed of all wickedneſs: In ſome it grows up to more maturity than in others; but they are of ſuch a Spirit as would lead them into every abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. 2 Tim. 3.2, 3. <hi>Men ſhall be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="3">(3) The doctrinal inſtrument; <hi>The Goſpel.</hi> The Goſpel is the doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, which contains the Revelation of the way of Life, and encouragements to believe: it contains the doctrine of the Perſon and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Chriſt, his Humiliation and Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Covenant of Grace which God makes through him.</p>

               <q>The Goſpel is the Means of Converſion.</q>
               <p>GOD created the World without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, but in Converſion he make uſe of the Goſpel as his inſtrument. The Goſpel is but an inſtrument, for many that enjoy the Goſpel never are Converted: but the Goſpel is the inſtrument in this work; the Goſpel is not a Phyſical inſtrument, but it is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtrument of Converſion. There is no expectation that Men ſhould be Converted
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001930_0068_0FBA1E2A8371A720"/>that do not enjoy the Goſpel; there may be Reformation without the Goſpel, but not Converſion, for the Goſpel is the inſtrument of Converſion. The Goſpel is not the Means only to bring Nations to the Profeſſion of the faith, but alſo to bring Men into a ſtate of Grace. Converſion prepares Men for pardon of Sin, and heavenly Glory, and the Goſpel is the inſtrument of this work. The Goſpel is very ſerviceable to Men after they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: it is very uſeful for the increaſe of Grace and Conſolation; but it is alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Converſion. God don't deal with Men as ſtocks and ſtones by meer force; but he deals with them as with reaſonable Creatures. He convinces them and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails on them: and the Goſpel is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby he works. Pſal. 110.2. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of his ſtrength out of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Goſpel is there called the Rod of his ſtrength, becauſe he Converts Men by it. Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi> The Goſpel is called the word of Truth by way of excellency: And when God ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach the Goſpel, he ſent him to Convert Men. Acts 26.18. <hi>To turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>That other things beſide the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are Means to prepare Men for Converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The works of Creation.</hi> The works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation are a ſtanding Monument of the power,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:001930_0069_0FBA1E2C1A098318"/>and wiſdom, and goodneſs of God. Pſal. 19 1. <hi>The heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament ſhew his handy work.</hi> Rom. 1.20. <hi>The inviſible things of him are already ſeen by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead.</hi> The conſideration of them is many ways uſeful to promote Converſion. Theſe works inſtruct Men that God is worthy to be feared and glorifyed. They may ſee thereby that they owe their Being and their Comforts to God, and that they are his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Theſe works ſhew that Sin is rebellion againſt the Author of their lives; that it is unreaſonable to neglect him. Dan. 5.23. <hi>The God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.</hi> And that God muſt take Sin very heinouſly. Iſai. 1.2. <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children and they have rebelled against me.</hi> Theſe works are a Conviction that God is able to avenge himſelf on Man for their rebellion; that there is no defence againſt the mighty power of God: that he is able to perform all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and his promiſes. Such conſiderations work upon the Conſciences of Men, and make them ſenſible of their ſin &amp; danger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Law or Covenant of Works, is a Means to prepare Men.</hi> The Covenant of Works conſiſts of Precepts and Sanctions, and is very ſerviceable to promote Mens Converſion. Gal 3.24. <hi>The Law was our School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt.</hi> The Precepts of the Law ſhew Men their Sins, by comparing their
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001930_0070_0FBA1E3082708AD0"/>Actions with the Commands they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their iniquity. Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> Heb 4.12. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two edged ſword, piercing even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, of the joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi> The Law has alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating power, is an occaſion of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Corruption, as the dam makes the warers ſwell; and ſo Men become acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their own hearts. Rom. 7.3 <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence.</hi> The Law alſo condemns Men for Sin, ſhews them their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, what deſtruction they are in danger of, terrifies the Conſcience: the Law ſays, <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. The Law convinces Men that vengeance muſt be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for ſin. Math. 5.18. <hi>No jot or title ſhall paſs from the law but all muſt be fullfilled.</hi> The Law doth alſo diſcover the Righteouſneſs of Mans condemnation: Rom. 3.19. <hi>What things the law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World become guilty before God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Works of Providence do alſo prepare Men for Converſion.</hi> Gods works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are various, and contribute much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Mens Converſion. Mercies are a Means to draw Men to ſeek the favour of God, and Afflictions are Means to awaken Mens Conſciences. Sometimes Men have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001930_0071_0FBA1E368672D548"/>Afflictions, and they are very ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable. Job 33.22, 3, 4. <hi>His ſoul draws near to the grave, and his life to the deſtroyers; if there be a meſſenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew to man his upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; then he is gracious to him, and ſaith, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ranſom.</hi> So, Job 36.8, 9, 10. <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and held in cords of affliction, then he ſheweth them their work and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that they have exceeded; he openeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Manaſſeh.</hi> Sometimes Publick Judgments are very ſerviceable to them. Hoſ. 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offence and ſeek my face: in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> Some Perſons are ſmitten in Conſcience at ſuch times, and ſtirred up to be ſeeking Peace with God. So the great Works of God in the World are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to this end. Storms and Thunder and Lightning and Earthquakes. 1 Sam. 12.18, 19. <hi>The Lord ſent Thunder and Rain that day, and all the People greatly feared the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel; and all the People ſaid unto Samuel, Pray for thy ſervants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, 2. <hi>That if God would open the eyes of Men to ſee his Glory in the works of Creation, or in the Law, or in Providences, that would make Men holy.</hi> There is a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing light in theſe things, and they
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001930_0072_0FBA1E3854316348"/>diſcover the glory of God. Pſal. 8.1. <hi>O Lord Our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth?</hi> And if there were but inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries made to the Heathens thereby, they would love and fear God. There is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant cauſe to love God from the diſcoveries of his glory in theſe; the power of God, and wiſdom and goodneſs of God manifeſted in the works of Creation, are lovely: and the holineſs wiſdom of God appearing in his Law, are lovely: and the glorious Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of God appearing in the works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, are lovely; and give ſufficient cauſe to Men to love and ſerve God: and upon this account it is that the Heathens are guilty for their not loving &amp; ſerving God; this makes them without Excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. They have Conviction enough ſet before them to draw their hearts to God.</p>
               <p>This is further evident from theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If Men know God they will be holy.</hi> Where God is truly known, he will be loved and ſerved uprightly. Pſal. 36.10. <hi>Stretch out thy loving kindneſs to them that know thee, and thy righteouſneſs to the upright in heart.</hi> Pſal. 91.14. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will ſet him on high, becauſe he hath known my Name.</hi> The Nature of Man is ſuch, that the Will always follows the laſt dictates of the Underſtanding; the Will it ſelf is a blind facility, and it follows the direction of the Underſtanding. When
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001930_0073_0FBA1E3BC4DC6A50"/>once Men have a Spiritual Sight of the glory of God, they can do no other but ſerve him. Light and Life go together. Before Men know God it is impoſſible that they ſhould love him, for they are ſtrangers to the reaſon and foundation of love: if they have never ſo many arguments ſet before them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade yet they cannot do it, if they ſtrive very much with their own hearts to love God, from a fear that they ſhall be damned if they do not, yet they cannot do it. But when their eyes are opened and they ſee the glory of God, they would act againſt their Nature if they did it not. The excellency of the object is the foundation of the duty, and when that reaſon is ſeen, they are under a neceſſity to do it. Becauſe Man is capable to know God, therefore he is capable to love and ſerve him: and when he doth know God he is under a neceſſity to ſerve him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Glory of God ſeen in theſe works doth make Men more holy.</hi> When Men are once Converted, they grow in Grace by theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; they ſee the glory of God in the works of Creation, and that has a gracious Effect on them. Rev. 4.11. <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord, to receive glory, and honour and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they are and were created.</hi> The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe mighty works have a great influence into their holy walk. We find the Saints in Scripture graciouſly affected many times with the works of Creation. The
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001930_0074_0FBA1E3E2626CCC8"/>Thoughts thereof ſtirred up a Spirit of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>David</hi> magnifies God on that account: <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſts of them with the breath of his mouth.</hi> They often glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God as <hi>the Creator of the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſai. 40.28.

Pſal. 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may learn thy ſtatutes.</hi> And the great works of God in the World are great helps to the growth of Grace: Saints are often Meditating on them, and ſo ſtirring up their hearts in holineſs. Pſal. 107.8. <hi>Oh that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs; and for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works to the children of men.</hi> Pſal. 145.5, 6. <hi>I will ſpeak of the glorious honour of thy

Men ſee that the Goſpel is a faithful ſaying and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, as it is called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. The Word can have no operation but as it is underſtood by the underſtanding, it works upon the Will; there muſt be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinary underſtanding, but that is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: Multitudes underſtand the letter of the Goſpel that are not Converted. Men that have not the ſpiritual underſtanding of it may be affected with it, and be perſwaded to an outward conformity to it, but when they underſtand it ſpiritually, then it works effectually upon them. There is no prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Men to turn to God ſo long as they are in the dark about the Truth of the Goſpel, about the divine Glory of Chriſt, and the freeneſs of the Grace of God; but when the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:001930_0076_0FBA1E4726841F68"/>Goſpel is ſpiritually underſtood immediately it works upon the heart. 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>Ye received the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God, which worketh effectually in you that believe.</hi> Joh. 6.40. <hi>That every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlaſting life.</hi> v. 45. <hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi>

Joh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father that ſent me draw him.</hi> And they had an enmity in their ſpirit unto

               <p>4 Conſider, <hi>Why God doth this by the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aoſ.</hi> Here take notice of theſe four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith in Chriſt is the condition of Pardon and Salvation.</hi> Perfect righteouſneſs was the condition of the Covenant of Works Gal, 3.12. <hi>He that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Perfect Obedience fell under a double conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the Covenant of Works: it was the matter of Juſtification, and ſo it is ſtill, for we are now Juſtifyed by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt. Therefore he is ſaid <hi>to bring in ever lasting Righteouſneſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. <hi>And by
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:001930_0078_0FBA1E4E31A83820"/>the Obedience of One ſhall many be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> Rom. 5.13. And perfect Obedience was alſo the condition of Juſtification. But now under the Goſpel Faith is the condition of Juſtification. Joh. 5.24. <hi>He that heareth my words and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlasting life, and ſhall not enter into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> It is by Faith that we are accepted: The terms of Juſtification are, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 15.31. It is Faith that gives a Man an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. It is moſt ſuitable that among the Graces of the Spirit Faith only ſhould be the condition of Juſtification. Love to God is as holy an action as Faith: Yet it is moſt ſuitable that Faith ſhould be the condition, becauſe it doth accept of the Grace of God offered in the Goſpel, and is an acknowledgement of the ſufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt: and God has made it to be the condition of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Act 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſs that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive the remiſſon of ſins.</hi> Hence Faith is called our Evangelical Righteouſneſs: it is called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> Heb. 11.7. God has made a law concerning our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is called <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. And when we believe we have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the condition of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Therefore it is meet that Faith ſhould be first wrought.</hi> The firſt good thing that is wrought in any Man is Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001930_0079_0FBA1E50D620F290"/>this being the condition of Juſtification, it is no ways fit that Men ſhould have other good things wrought in them before Faith: for it is not fit that Love and Repentance ſhould be wrought in him, and yet he remain in an Eſtate of condemnation. Every Man is in an Eſtate of condemnation until he believes in Chriſt. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18. And it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable that a Man ſhould have the Exerciſe of Love and Repentance given to him, and yet be ſuffered to lie in an Eſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But if they were wrought before Faith, then the Man would have a gracious Spirit, and be Sanctifyed, yet remain a Child of wrath and be under the curſe of God, and in a periſhing condition, then Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance would be no ſigns of Juſtification, and theſe Sins which were mortifyed would be imputed, but this would be utterly unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: but ſeeing Faith is the condition of Reconciliation, it is meet that Faith ſhould be the firſt good thing that is wrought in the Man. And ſo it is, God never gives Men Love or Repentance before Faith; whatever appearances there may be of thoſe things, all is in hypocriſy that goes before Faith; there is no godly Sorrow, no regard to the glory of God, until Men believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Faith in Chriſt can be wrought only by the Goſpel.</hi> Faith in Chriſt is an accepting the offer of the Goſpel: Faith is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Grace of God held forth in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001930_0080_0FBA1E5242D8CA50"/>the Goſpel, and of the faithfulneſs of God in Goſpel-promiſes, and of the Righteouſueſs of Jeſus Chriſt; Faith is a coming to Chriſt as a Mighty Saviour, and it is impoſſible for Men to come to Chriſt and know nothing of him. Rom. 10.14. <hi>How can they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Can a Man admire the excellency of Chriſt, and take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from him, and venture his Soul on him, and yet know nothing of him? Can a Man that is an utter ſtranger to Jeſus Chriſt glory in him, and prefer his Righteouſneſs before all his own works, and build the hopes of his Soul for another World upon him, as a ſure foundation, before he is made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſuſliciency of Chriſt? Let a Man know never ſo much of the works of Creation, of the Mighty Power of God in making all things out of nothing: and of the Wiſdom of God in making ſuch variety of Creatures, in divers Forms, with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of faculties and vertues; in giving ſuch perfection to the World, that there is nothing wanting to the integrity of it, this will never prevail upon him to depend upon an unknown Chriſt. If a Man be terribly frighted with his Sins and under the awful apprehenſions of the wrath of God, ſo that his fleſh and his heart trembles, that will not prevail upon him to come to an unknown Chriſt. Let Men be never ſo much affected with Mercies or Afflictions, yet he will neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. If he don't know him, there can be
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:001930_0081_0FBA1E5548F3F630"/>no act of Faith without the knowledge of the object of Faith, there can be no act of Faith without the knowledge of the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to believe. Faith is a rational underſtanding action: In order to the act of faith, there muſt be a knowledge of the Goſpel, and the actual conſideration of it, at the very time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Goſpel is not only proper to work Faith, but alſo to work every other Grace.</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth not only work the heart to believe, but it draws the heart to other gracious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; when Men ſee the love of God in the Goſpel, that draws forth love. 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> The knowledge of the Goſpel makes Men fear God. Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> The Goſpel is a proper Means to work a Spirit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and break the heart for Sin. Luk. 7.38. <hi>She stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feet with tears.</hi> This was the fruit of her receiving the Goſpel, for her ſins were forgiven, <hi>v.</hi> 47. By the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Mens hearts are brought into a prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for all holy carriages; the Goſpel is an effectual Means not only to draw Men to Chriſt, but to work univerſal holineſs. Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this preſent world.</hi> This makes Men New Creatures. <hi>If any man be in Jeſus Chriſt,

                  <hi>Hence learn, That where the Goſpel is not known there is no Converſion.</hi> There be many People in the World that are ignorant of it. so the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the <hi>Papists,</hi> accordingly they are not Converted. Knowledge is the Key that opens the door of life. Luke 11.52. <hi>Ye have taken away the key of knowledge.</hi> There is no Silvation but in the Church of God; among them that have the Oracles of God. Joh. 4.22. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> For it is by the Goſpel that Men are Converted. Jam. 1.18. <hi>He hath begotten us by the word of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Though there be Morality.</hi> Some of the Heathens were noted for their Morality: they were juſt, chaſte and temperate. The light of Nature teacheth Men Morality: the Law written in the heart is the Moral Law. But Morally differs very much from Converſion.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming themſelves that way, will beget an habit. But Grace is obtained by infuſion. Moral vertues don't render Men acceptable to God, for thought they look like Graces, yet they are Luſts. Moral vertues do give an external honour to God, but they don't diſpoſe Men to aim at the Glory of God.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:001930_0083_0FBA2177CAC30910"/>Moral vertues may be loſt. A Man that is juſt and temperate, and a Man of Truth, may deſerve a contrary character before he goes out of the World. A Man may be an honeſt Man but not a good Man: Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs is not Holineſs. Generally by the common workings of Gods Spirit, Men are Moral Men before they are Converted. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Moral Man when he was a Phariſee. Phil. 3.6. <hi>Touching the righteouſneſs that is in the law blameleſs.</hi> Morality is ſome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Converſion, but it is not Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Morality intitles no Man to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though there be much Devotion.</hi> Some of the Papiſts are very devout, they Pray a great many times in a day. So ſome of the Turks are very devout Men: So were ſome of the Heathens. Acts 17.23. <hi>I paſſed by and beheld your devotions.</hi> So many of the Jews that were ignorant of Chriſt: they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerve God Day and Night: the Scribes and Phariſees for a pretence made long Prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. but this may be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They offered a great many Sacrifices to the Calves at <hi>Dan &amp; Bethel.</hi> Mens devotion may riſe only from terrour. Pſal. 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them then they ſought him, they returned

They ſeem to put much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect on God, but their devotion is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Him; their devotion ſometimes is a cloke to cover their wickedneſs, and prevent Mens ſuſpecting them.</p>

                  <hi>Of Reproof, To thoſe that have lived all their days under the Preaching of the Goſpel, yet are not Converted.</hi> Some Men that are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted do imagine that they are Converted, they will not take this reproof to themſelves but there be many Men among us that have lived Thirty Years under the Preaching of the Goſpel; they have had a great deal of Teaching, yet they are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are not yet Converted: their own hearts tell them that they are in that Eſtate wherein they were born. Some of them lead a rude life, &amp; addict themſelves to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices that are contrary to the dictates of their Conſciences; and others of them are rejecting Chriſt, under one pretence or other, they are turning off the Invitations of the Goſpel. If the Goſpel be the Means of Converſion, it might have been expected that you ſhould
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001930_0085_0FBA217AC22894F0"/>have been Converted many Years ago; but this is a matter of lamentation, that you are not Converted to this day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This is a great provocation.</hi> If God had not uſed Means with you, you would have had no Sin in compariſon. Others that han't lived ſo long under Means as you have done, have been Converted. The Means are very proper, and ſuch as have prevailed with other Men; but you have ſhewed a rebellious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have withſtood all the calls of God. God may complain of you and ſay, as Prov. 1.24. <hi>I have called and they refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand and they have not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> You have been under ſpecial advantages to be Converted, you have had proper War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Encouragements, but yet you ſtand out. It may be your Conſcience has many times troubled you becauſe of it, but yet you make a ſhift to hold on your way; you have deſigned many times to turn to God, but your heart has deceived you; you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that you would turn to God, but have dealt falſely with Him. There is no better Means to effect Mens Converſion than the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, &amp; this you have had plainly &amp; powerfully Preached to you, yet all has been in vain. It may be you plead in excuſe for your ſelves, that you have many Temptations, but the great reaſon of it is the hardneſs and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs of your own heart; that is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Chriſt gives of it.

2. <hi>This is a dark ſign.</hi> It is very much to be feared what will become of you. We hope concerning young Children that when they grow to Years of Underſtanding, they will be wrought upon by the Goſpel, but there is leſs hope by far of thoſe that have withſtood it for many Years: the Goſpel is the proper Means, but God has not bleſſed it to you; there has been a blaſt upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means. God has given you his Word, but denyed his Spirit. He has made the Goſpel powerful to convert Others. Some that have been your Companions; ſome that have been in Relation to you; ſome Younger than you. It has been a ſavour of life to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but you are ſuffered to lie in a periſhing condition. God knows what the meaning of it is, that the Goſpel is hid from you. He gives you Corn as well as others, and Health and other outward bleſſings; but you have not a bleſſing upon the Means of Converſion: If this do not determine the caſe againſt, yet it is a threaning Providence. Deut. 29.4. <hi>God hath not given you eyes to ſee, nor ears to bear unto this day.</hi>

                  <hi>Of Examination, Whether you be Converted.</hi> It is a pain to a Man to be between hopes and fears about his Converſion, for his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation doth depend upon his Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001930_0087_0FBA2180013013C0"/>ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.5. And if a Man begins to rejoyce in the apprehenſion of his Converſion, he is preſently caſt down with fears, whether he be not miſtaken: He reads the promiſes that are made to Converted Men, and they are ſweet and precious to him, he would fain take the comfort of them, but he ſtands quivering, but dare not apply them to himſelf. He thinks of thoſe words, <hi>If a man thinks himſelf ſomething when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf.</hi> And when he reads threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to Unconverted Men, he has an awful ſence of the doleful condition of ſuch Men, and he pities them with all his heart; he can't conceive how they will do to bear thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries; he thinks their worldly ſelicities will be utterly forgotten after a while, and they will mourn at the laſt: but then it turns in his thoughts, that may be he is one of them, and he is frighted leaſt they ſhould be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him; he ſays, that has been the portion of many Men, that have promiſed great things to themſelves; many Mens hopes do utterly fail, when God takes away their Souls, and he ſays, if that ſhould be his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſhould be undone. When his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours know nothing of it, he is in anguiſh of Spirit, becauſe he is in ſuſpence, whether he ſhall hear thoſe words, <hi>Come you bleſſed,</hi> or, <hi>Go you curſed.</hi> Some will be bleſſed, and ſome will be curſed, but he doth not know which number he doth belong unto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine your ſelves; this doctrine gives
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:001930_0088_0FBA2182A13484D0"/>light into it: The Goſpel is the inſtrument of Converſion, no body elſe can tell, how they were Converted; but if it were true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It may be wrought by Goſpel promiſes.</hi> There be many great and precious promiſes. Joh 6.37. <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Math. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>If any man open unto me, I will come in and ſup with him and he with me.</hi> Theſe promiſes are a great ſecurity to all that come to Chriſt, they give an aſſurance that Men ſhall be accepted. The faithfulneſs of God ſtands engaged for their Salvation. A Man may Pray, &amp; Read, &amp; Confeſs Sin, &amp; Faſt, yet have no ſecurity for his Salvation; but if he receives Chriſt, God has paſſed his word, and that is the beſt ſecurity in the World for his Salvation. He has left himſelf at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether he will give Health, or Riches, or Honour, but he has promiſed Eternal Life. And if in theſe promiſes, or any ſuch like. God has made a diſcovery of his Grace and Faithfulneſs, and the ſufficiency of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that you have been bold to caſt your ſelf on him, then you are Converted. It may be you may have many ſcruples ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in your hearts, becauſe you find a great deal of corruption remaining, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are not repeated ſo often as you hear it is with ſome others; or Prayers are not anſwered; but you are certainly Converted.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:001930_0089_0FBA2183C7C4B948"/>Theſe diſcoveries do beget Faith and Love and Repentance, which will be preſerved and renewed in the heart, and will end in eternal Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It may be wrought by Goſpel Invitations and Commands.</hi> There by ſeveral gracious Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Goſpel. Rev. 22.17. <hi>The ſpirit and the bride ſay come, and let him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt come: and whoever will, let him take the waters of life freely.</hi> Rev. 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee it buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayſt be rich, and white raiment, that thou mayst be clothed.</hi> In theſe Invitations God deals truly and uprightly: God doth not make vain &amp; fallacious pretentions of kindneſs, but tells his very heart to Men; He don't go about to lead them into a ſnare, and make appearances as if he were more kind and gracious than he is. There be alſo poſitive commands. 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>This is his commandment that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God, that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, whom he hath ſent.</hi> God has put forth his divine authority; He don't only allow us but requires us to believe on Jeſus Chriſt: and he will not command to truſt in a broken reed; he will not enjoyn us to truſt in a lie. And if you have ſeen the Grace of God in theſe Invitations, ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your great unworthineſs, and your provocations, you have been bold to accept his offers, and if you have ſeen the truth of the Goſpel in thoſe commands, that
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:001930_0090_0FBA2185A8BB5670"/>it muſt needs be a ſafe thing to truſt in Chriſt, and from the incouragement of Gods Word, venture on Chriſt, you are Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It may be by Goſpel declarations.</hi> There be many declarations of the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. As, 1 Tim. 10 15. <hi>This is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3. <hi>Chriſt died for our ſins, according to the Scriptures.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>Himſelf bore our ſins in his own body on the tree.</hi> Sometimes God lets light into the Soul, by one of theſe, or ſome other word to like purpoſe, or by the general doctrine of the Goſpel though you had no particular word. God has ſhewed you the truth and glory of the Goſpel, it is a ſure ſign that you are Converted. There be indeed ſome common illuminations, that do for the preſent affect the hearts of Men, that many have had and yet they remain Unconverted; but when the ſpirit of God convinces Men of the divine and ſaving vertue that is in the blood of Chriſt, they do immediately turn to God. If the Father that is in Heaven doth reveal Jeſus to be the Chriſt, the Son of the living God: If the Comforter doth convince Men of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; that is a ſufficient evidence of Converſion, and that evidence will not go alone. 1 Theſ. 5.13. <hi>Ye heard the word not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the word of God, which worketh effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in you that believe.</hi>

                  <hi>Of Conviction, That there is ſufficient ground in the Goſpel to make Men turn to God.</hi> This is the Inſtrument that God works by; and when it is indeed underſtood it always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. Many Men hear the Goſpel, but the light don't ſhine into them; the Goſpel is hid to them, and they remain in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition. But every Man whoſe eyes are opened to ſee the Truth and Glory of the things therein revealed, doth turn to God. The Goſpel will then have prevailing Efficacy. Some things the more they are underſtood, the more they are deſpiſed; but if the Goſpel be indeed underſtood it is evermore ſuccesful; there is not a Man in the World, that ever failed of being Converted in this caſe. And we may conclude from thence, that there is reaſon for Men to do ſo; for ignorance of the Goſpel hinders Mens Converſion, but the knowledge of it doth effect it.</p>
               <p>And it muſt needs be ſo:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſidering that there is great good offered.</hi> That is offered in the Goſpel that will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Soul. Men take a great deal of pains for ſmall things; but the good offered in the Goſpel, comprehends all that Men need. The good he offers there is better than Lordſhips, and Principalities and Kingdoms; he offers that which is better than Long-Life, that which Men ſtand in neceſſity of, and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001930_0092_0FBA2189C0CF2358"/>indeed all that is neceſſary. He offers more good than we can comprehend; Peace with God paſſes all Underſtanding. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Becauſe God could ſwear by no greater, he ſwear by himſelf.</hi> So I may ſay, becauſe he could offer nothing greater, he has offered himſelf. 1 Pet. 5.10. <hi>He hath called us to his Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This good can be attained in no other way.</hi> There have been many other ways thought of: They generally center in Mens own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but that will not ſerve their turn. No Man ever did proſper in that way. The Jews did <hi>not attain to the Law of righteouſneſs, becauſe they ſought it, as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. That way is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Juſtice, but God will offer no violence to his law. <hi>No jot or tittle of the Law ſhall paſs, but all ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5.18. God will not vary one hairs breadth from the Law. He had rather that his own Son ſhould die, than caſt the leaſt contempt on the Law: and if the Law ſtand in force, the works of the Law can't juſtify. Rom. 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh living be justifyed in the ſight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is great ſecurity, that the good offered in the Goſpel ſhall be obtained in that way.</hi> We have foundation enough to depend upon. God ſent Chriſt for this end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. He is appointed of God to be the foundation of the Church, <hi>Iſai</hi> 28.16. and God never had a repenting thought of this contrivance.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001930_0093_0FBA218BD954C1A8"/>Pſal. 110.4. <hi>God has ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck.</hi> There is a divine vertue in the ſufferings of Chriſt. <hi>God has purchaſed the Church with his own blood,</hi> Act. 20.28. And the word of God is a full ſecurity. God has promiſed bleſſedneſs in this way: He has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it upon record under his hand: He has promiſed it on Oath, and has appointed Seals to his Covenant; this is not a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uncertain hope, but of ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.

Pſal. 29.9. <hi>In his Temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory.</hi> Divine worſhip is too great an honour to be given to any Creature. Rev. 19.10. <hi>Worſhip God.</hi> So Men glorify God, when they Pray to him, and do in religious manner ask bleſſings of him, and do aſcribe the bleſſings they enjoy unto him. They therein give a teſtimony to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power and Goodneſs of God, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their dependance on him. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is Praiſe: the language of Prayer is, <hi>Thine is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory.</hi> Math. 6.13. So a religious Attending on the Preaching of the Word, is a Praiſing of God. When they are hearing the Word with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they therein acknowledge the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Majeſty of God, and his Divine Truth &amp; Faithfulneſs: We therein acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his Word is the rule of Faith and Life. That his Word is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation; that it is worthy to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and obeyed. Act. 10.33. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> So a religious Singing of Pſalms, is giving glory to God. Pſal. 147.1. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is good to ſing praiſes to our God.</hi> So a religious receiving the Seals of Gods Covenant, is praiſing God. There is a thankful Memorial of the Redemption of Chriſt. 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>Ye ſhew forth the Lords death.</hi> There is a teſtimony given to the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001930_0098_0FBA2198D478CC88"/>ſaving vertue of Chriſts blood: <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By an holy Converſation.</hi> An holy walk is a practical acknowledgement of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God. When perſons lead an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, honeſt, patient, chaſte and temperate life, they do glorifie God. Joh. 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glorifyed in that ye bring forth much fruit.</hi> In that way they ſhew forth the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of him that calls them out of darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his marvellous light. Math. 5.16. <hi>That men may ſee your good works and glorify your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in heaven.</hi> Sinful works reproach God, but holy works commond him. When Perſons have an holy Converſation they ſhew a fear of God. Eccl. 12.13. <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments.</hi> An holy life is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the goodneſs and righteouſneſs of the ways of God. Hoſ. 14.9. <hi>The ways of the Lord are right, and the juſt ſhall walk therein.</hi> By their Obedience they ſhew that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence Gods Authority: the language there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that God is their Lord and they are his Servants, that they will not put ſuch an affrent on him as to violate any of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; yea, by their Obedience they ſhew that they lay weight on the promiſes and threatnings of the Word; that they count it profitable to be Obedient, and dangerous to be diſobedient; that they depend upon the word of God.</p>

1. Reaſ. <hi>God deſerves it from them as well as from Elder People.</hi> It is to be deſired on Gods account: It is an honour due to his Name. Young Ones are bound to God as well as their Parents; they have no liberty to neglect the glory of God: God may challenge it from them, as well as from their Parents. Lam, 3.27. <hi>It is good for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.</hi> God is their Creater as well as of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Perſons. Eccl. 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the days of thy youth.</hi> They owe their Being to God, and becauſe they owe their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they owe their Obedience: and they live upon the Mercies of God, as well as Elder Perſons; they dwell on his Earth, breath in his Air, are enlightned by him, and tho' they are in their ſtrength, yet they depend upon the care of God, for their Food and Raiment, Life &amp; Health. God has <hi>nouriſhed &amp; brought them up,</hi> Iſai. 1.2. They are under covenant Bonds as well as Elder Ones. Deut. 5.2, 3. <hi>The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this Covenant with our Fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</hi> They are under firm ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to God: They will be covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers, if they neglect to glorify God: they are under covenant-encouragements; God is in a near Relation to them, He is not only their Fathers God, but their God alſo. Exod. 15 2. <hi>He is my God and I will prepare him an habitation, my Fathers God and I will exalt him.</hi> They are very injurious if they dont praiſe Him.</p>

2. Reaſ. <hi>It is a ſign of the preſence of God with his Ordinances.</hi> Chriſt has promiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his Ordinances. Math. 28.19, 20. <hi>Lo, I am with you alway to the end if the world.</hi> This is fulfilled in various degrees; and it is matter of great lamentation, when there is but a little bleſſing upon Ordinances; when the hearts of Men are made fat: as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9, 10. But when Young Men and Maids do praiſe the Name of God, it is a ſign that the Spirit of God is preſent among them. That is a great promiſe, Iſai. 59.21. <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed.</hi> And when Young Ones are praiſing God, it is a manifeſt token of Gods gracious preſence with the means of Grace. Here is a manifeſt token of the favour of God to the People: It is a great bleſſing. Iſai. 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy Seed and my bleſſing upon thy Offspring.</hi> This is more a great deal than for God to bleſs the labour of their hands. Godly Men are wont to Pray much for a bleſſing on Ordinances, they look upon that as a foundation of many other Mercies. And when Young Ones praiſe God, they take notice of the goodneſs of God in hearing their Prayers; it is a ſmile upon the People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſ. <hi>It gives great hopes of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the power of Godlineſs.</hi> If Young Ones carry religiouſly that is a foundation of hope for the time to come: tho' ſome of them may
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:001930_0101_0FBA1D90C8FFC988"/>die quickly, yet it is probable that many of them will live to old Age. They that are Young now are like to be the pillars of the Church, thirty Years hence. Antient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt die quickly, but if Young Ones are hearty in Religion; it is hopeful Religion will not die. There is reaſon to hope that moſt of them that are religious when they are Young, will continue to be ſo when they are Old. There is reaſon to hope that they that floriſh now in Gods houſe, <hi>will ſtill bring forth fruit in old age,</hi> Pſal. 92.13, 14. That <hi>when the outward man decays, the inner man will be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16. And therefore it is a great encouragement to ſee ſuch embracing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. If Religion be upheld in the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, it muſt be by thoſe that are Young now; the burden will lie upon them after a while.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Reaſ. <hi>It is an encouragement reſpecting their Salvation.</hi> When Young Ones carry looſely and corruptly, there is reaſon to fear their damnation; their feet go down to death, their ſteps take hold on hell. Therefore the wiſe Man gives that warning: Eccl. 11.9. <hi>Rejoyce O Young in thy Youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know thou, that for all theſe things God will being thee into Judgment.</hi> But when they have a religious Spirit and Converſation, they are in the way to Salvation. If God deſigns to bring Men to Salvation, he will make them
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:001930_0102_0FBA1D9243F9DE38"/>to ſeek after it: and more generally he makes them ſeek it in the days of their Youth; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their Manners, crying to God, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the Scriptures, waiting upon God in his Ordinances, are the Means to prepare Men for Eternal Life: And when the Spirit of Young Ones is much that way, there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to rejoyce in the hopes of their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>USE, I. <hi>Then there is great need that Parents ſhould train up their Children religiouſly.</hi> Parents are generally careful to bring up their Children to ſome Calling, that they may be fitted to do Service to themſelves, and others; but they ſhould be careful to beſtow religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education on them. Prov. 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> Eph. 6.4. <hi>Bring them up in the nurture and admenition of the Lord.</hi> Something is generally done that way, but with too much remiſsneſs. Neglects this way is one of the things, wherein the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the Land doth appear: many Parents are not religious themſelves, and it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they are negligent in the Education of their Children. But there is great need of it; Children are corrupt by nature; though they have natural Conſciences urging them to that that is good, yet they have depraved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions prompting them to evil. There is a natural contrariety in them to the ways of God.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:001930_0103_0FBA1D942C1241D0"/>Rom. 8.7. <hi>The natural mind is enmity to God.</hi> And there be many temptations to miſlead them: There be a multitude of temptations to draw forth their corruptions; and there is need of more care than many Parents do take, that they may praiſe the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By Inſtruction. It is not ſufficient that they are brought to Publick Worſhip, and that they be learn't to Read the Word of God,</hi> but Parents ſhould ſee that they profit by Publick Means, and they ſhould be inſtilling the Principles of Religion into them. <hi>Timothy</hi> had a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mother, and he was verſed in the holy Scriptures from a Child, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And as Parents ſhould inſtruct their Children in Principles of Faith, ſo alſo they ſhould teach them rules of Obedience. That was one of the deſigns of the book of Proverbs. Prov. 1.4. <hi>To give ſubtilty to the ſimple, to the Young man knowledge and diſcretion.</hi> The law of nature is much obliterated, and there is great need that the Precepts thereof ſhould be often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, that convincing light ſhould be ſet before them, that they be urged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with, and that rules be preſſed upon them. Prov. 31.2, 3. <hi>What my ſon, and what the ſon of my womb, and what the ſon of my vows, give not thy ſtrength unto women,</hi> &amp;c. Young People are giddy and heedleſs, and counſel had need to be often renewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By Example. Bad examples are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: had examples teach iniquity; irritate corruption, and make men bold to tranſgreſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:001930_0104_0FBA1D9544843448"/>And if Parents give bad examples to their Children, it will be no wonder if they tread in their ſteps. Men live by examples more than by Precepts. <hi>Jeroboams</hi> example did miſchief to all the ſucceeding Kings of Iſrael. But if Parents give good examples, that is a ground of hope, that Children will follow them; good examples are lovely &amp; amiable, and commend themſelves to the Conſciences of Children, the hearts of Men give an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to them, and are drawn on to a liking of thoſe ways; they look on the good examples of their Parents as the honour of their Parents and their honour, and the love they have to their Parents makes their good carriages more lovely in their eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By Reſtraint. It was</hi> Eli'<hi>s fault that he did not reſtrain his Children.</hi> 1 Sam. 3.13. <hi>His ſons made themſelves vile and he reſtrained them not.</hi> Parents, have authority to do it, and if other means will not do they muſt exert their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It is not enough for Parents, that they do not approve of the iniquities of their Children, they may not ſuffer them to carry ſinfully. A toleration of iniquity in Children makes the Parents culpable, and to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their ſins. Some Children are much more teachable than others, and there is no need of reſtraining them, but others are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet in ways of ſin, and it don't per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex their Conſciences to go directly againſt the commands of Parents; in ſuch caſes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents muſt reſtrain them: this is the way to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:001930_0105_0FBA1D9930674410"/>prevent the breaking out of iniquity, and to mend their hearts alſo. Fond indulging of Children is the way to ruine them: Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren left to themſelves do many times bring their Parents to ſhame.</p>
               <p>USE, II. <hi>Of Examination. Whether Young Men &amp; Maidens do Praiſe the Name of the Lord?</hi> It becomes us to take notice of this, that we may ſee what cauſe we have of rejoycing or of ſorrow. It is worth the while to obſerve not only how Rulers carry, and how the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People carry, but likewiſe to mind what Spirit doth appear in Young ones; they that are Young now are like to have a great influence upon Publick affairs after a while, and the better they carry themſelves, the more hope there is of their being ſerviceable after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Young ones had need particularly conſider, whether they do their duty in Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Name of God, whether they anſwer the juſt expectation of God and Man in this particular: Do you praiſe the Name of the Lord?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some are diſorderly in the Night time.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents make them work diligently in the Day time; but in the evening they gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in companies, and ſpend their time in unprofitable talk: They are like the beaſts that creep forth in the Night. Pſal. 104.20. <hi>Thou makest darkneſt and it is night, wherein all the beaſts of the foreſt do creep forth.</hi> It is hard to give an account how they ſpend their time,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001930_0106_0FBA1D9C409E8608"/>but they are diſorderly: when the Family at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Religious duties, they are abroad, and no account can be given of them. Is this to Praiſe the Name of the Lord? They ſhould joyn with the Family in confeſſing ſin, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mercy and acknowledging Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but they don't regard the worſhip of God: Can we think that theſe Perſons are conſcientious, in attending ſecret duties of worſhip? Neglects of Family worſhip are a great contempt of God: Are theſe perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the honour of God or the ſalvation of their own Souls? Have they any due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the commands of God? doth it lie upon their hearts to give God the Glory of their daily mercies? Do they not plainly manifeſt, that they have not the ſpirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? they run into danger. Prov. 27.8. <hi>As a bird that wandreth from his nest, ſo is a man that wandreth from his place.</hi> Is this for the praiſe of the Name of God, that when the Family go to bed, the Young Man is running about the Town? he has no buſineſs, it is for the ſatisfaction of ſome juſt; he throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into temptation, and ſometimes he gets a wound and a blot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some of them frequent the Tavern.</hi> The Tavern is a place of reſort: there is a great deal of company in the Evening, on wet days, and on publick days. There they are ſpending their time unprofitably: There is a great deal of vain, worldly, proud diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and corrupt communication: they
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:001930_0107_0FBA1D9E36C291E8"/>are ſwaggering &amp; vaporing; ſometimes they are jeering good Men, and ſcoſting at Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is this praiſing the Name of the Lord? Is this an honour to God? They are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time as the rule is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. They ſtand about the cup, till they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed one another. Iſai. 5.11. <hi>They continue until night, till wine enflame them.</hi> They drink till they are giddy, and ſometimes talk wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly; ſometimes they quarrel and reproach one another; is this to praiſe the Name of the Lord? Prov. 23.29, 30. <hi>Who hath wo, who hath ſorrow, who hath contentions, who hath babling, who hath wounds without cauſe, who hath redneſs of eyes, they that tarry long at the wine, they that go to ſeek mixt wine.</hi> At the Tavern they waſt what they have earned, the fruit of their labour is conſumed; and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptation to cheat &amp; extort to get more. Taverns are the nurſeries of prophaneſs: if the Men talk of Religion, they talk of it in an irreligious way; their diſcourſes are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury: God would not have the leſs honour if they were dead and rotten.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Some are given to wanton dalliances.</hi> Men and Maids will be in company together, toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; dallying; they are ſtirring up corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in one another. This is not to praiſe the Name of the Lord. They go to Meeting on the Sabbath day &amp; at night they are ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one another: If they would medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on what they have heard, &amp; pray over the word, that would be for their profit, but they
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:001930_0108_0FBA1D9FC9332DC8"/>get together, &amp; it is a ſhame to ſpeak of what they do. Eph. 5.12. <hi>It is a ſhame to ſpeak of thoſe things that are done of them in ſecret.</hi> This is not to praiſe the Name of the Lord. They watch for one anothers company, as the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle doth for its prey, &amp; are making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof. When they have been hearing of a Sermon, they get together and are gratifying their carnal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with wanton talk and geſtures; they throw themſelves into great temptations, and are in danger to commit Whoredom: there be many awful inſtances, of perſons that have brought blemiſhes upon themſelves, &amp; brought themſelves to ſhame thereby.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Some neglect the Worſhip of God.</hi> They come univerſally to hear the word of God upon the Sabbath, and generally at other times: how they do attend the ſecret duties of Religion, God &amp; their own Conſciences do know, there is reaſon enough to ſuſpect many of them; but there be ſcarce five or ſix of them in a Town, that do attend the Lords Supper. The Lords Supper is a Memorial of the death of Chriſt, therein <hi>we ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. Do theſe Men praiſe the Name of the Lord, when they turn their backs on this Ordinance, and refuſe to celebrate this Memorial of Chriſts Paſſion, and to give a teſtimony to the truth of the Goſpel? The Lords Supper is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace: God therein ſets his Seal to the ſaving vertue of the blood of Chriſt: and do they
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:001930_0109_0FBA1DA17960D7C0"/>praiſe the Name of the Lord, when they refuſe to receive the Seal of the Covenant? God in this Ordinance makes an offer of Chriſt as ſlain for our Redemption; and do they praiſe the Name of the Lord that refuſe to attend it? The coming to this Ordinance is an open ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the truth of the Goſpel; what is the neglecting of it then but an open denial of the truth of the Goſpel? Some it may be do neglect it from tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, fearing whether they have liberty to come; but many others do neglect it from a careleſs &amp; irreligious ſpirit, they neither come to it, nor are careful to prepare themſelves for it.</p>
               <p>USE, III. <hi>Of Exhortation, To praiſe the Name of the Lord. David</hi> calls on Young Men and Maids to do it; and indeed God calls on you to do it. This work is not left to old People, God expects it from you alſo: You may not ſay that elder People do it now, and you will take your turn when you are older, but heartily engage in this work: if it has been neglected hitherto, let it be neglected no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; don't rob God of his glory. It is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious employment to praiſe God; the Angels of Heaven do employ themſelves that way: this is a debt, you owe to God: he is worthy to be praiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.3.

If we look up to Heaven, there the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are praiſing God: Thoſe Morning Stars ſing together: the heavenly Hoſts do praiſe God: the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars of light. Look into the Air, there the Clouds &amp; Winds &amp; the Meteors praiſe God. Look unto the Earth &amp; the Sea, and all Creatures therein do give a teſtimony for God. Pſal. 145.10. <hi>All thy works ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> Indeed the Devils do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach God, thoſe curſed creatures are enemies to the honour of God; and a number of Men are drawn in to fall in with the ſame deſign. Will you ſeparate your ſelves from the reſt of the Creatures, to joyn in with the Devils and a crew of ungodly men? When the greateſt part of the world are agreed to exalt God, will you forſake them &amp; joyn with the Devil? It becomes you to ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103.21, 22. <hi>Bleſs ye the Lord all ye his hoſts, ye Ministers of his that do his pleaſure: Bleſs the Lord all his works, in all places of his dominion; bleſs the Lord O my ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This will be no burden to you when you come to die.</hi> The living know that they muſt die. You don't expect to continue here always: You are but Strangers in the world, and you don't know but you may die quickly; there is nothing in your Nature, or condition, or in the word of God, that doth ſecure long life unto you. <hi>Man is as graſs, &amp; the glory of man as the flower of the field that fadeth away,</hi> Iſai.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001930_0111_0FBA1DA65ABB5A70"/>40.6. And if you don't praiſe God, that will make it hard work to die: if you han't done the work that you were ſent into the World for, that will be heavier than the pains of death: it will ſting you to remember your life paſt: how will you dare to go before God to Judgment? It is a doleful condition, when you muſt die, and yet dare not die. Eccl. 5.17. <hi>He hath much ſorrow &amp; wrath with his ſickneſs.</hi> Conſcience will lay that charge upon you, Dan. 5.23. <hi>The God in whoſe hand thy breath is, and whoſe are all thy ways, thou has not glorified.</hi> And you will take up that lamentation, Prov. 5.12, 13. <hi>How have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof; I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ears to them that inſtructed me.</hi> But if you improve your time in ſerving God, that will be no affliction to you in the evil day, but a comfort; it will be an eaſe in death, a relief under your pains, a cordial againſt faintings. That was a great comfort to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he lay at the point of death. Iſai. 28.3. <hi>He ſaid, Remember now Lord I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> If you don't praiſe the Lord, you would (in vain) deſire that God would forget what you had done; it will be a terrour to you to remember and to think that God doth remember what you have done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If you dont praiſe the Lord, it will make your life uncomfortable. The ways of wiſdom are ways
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001930_0112_0FBA1DA8EFF6EA58"/>of pleaſantneſs, &amp; all her paths are peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>It is pleaſant to ſing praiſe to the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 147.1. It is agreeable to the nature of Man to walk in the ways of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Men are then in their element, it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of nature: &amp; it is agreeable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Man, that approves &amp; applauds an holy life. But unholy living is uncomfortable living. If Men neglect to ſerve God, they put themſelves upon the rack: if Men live a life of diſobedience, they live a miſerable life: they don't enjoy themſelves; corruptions are hard maſters. <hi>The wicked is like the troubled Sea that cannot rest, Iſai.</hi> 57 20. Every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a tyrant: Mens luſts are ſcourges to them. <hi>Wrath killeth the fooliſh man, &amp; envy ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſilly one.</hi> So, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, are troubleſome task-maſters. And a ſinful &amp; unſactifyed life is diſquieting to the Conſcience; ſuch men have the reproaches of their own hearts: Conſcience is chiding, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; upbraiding them. When they hear the rebukes of the word, their own hearts do eccho thereunto; and their own Conſcience is making apparitions of danger, &amp; threatning of them with the vengeance of God Some are more ſtupid than others, but upon many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Conſcience will be terrifying them, they have many frightful expectations. Job 15 21. <hi>A dreadful ſound is in his ears.</hi> They have aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preoccupations of hell. They are ſcared with Death &amp; of Judgment: Sometimes they think of the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever;
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001930_0113_0FBA1DAB86ED9710"/>ſometimes of being among Devils; ſometimes of the everlaſting flames; they carry their tormentor about with them: their hearts are many times meditating terror. <hi>They are all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God gave you reaſonable Souls for this end that you may praiſe the Name of the Lord.</hi> God has given rational Souls to you that you might underſtandingly praiſe the Lord. Surely God is angry with Men if they don't uſe their Souls to that end that they were made for: He will count them worthy to be deſtroyed. And this was the end of your Souls, they are fitted for this end, made capable to know &amp; praiſe God. Why do you imagine that God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued you with rational Souls? Was it only to keep your body from putrifying? The ſoul of a beaſt would have ſerved that occaſion. Some beaſts that have only ſenſitive ſouls live longer than Men do. Or was it that they might be caterers for the body, to contrive how to get Meat &amp; Drink and Raiment for the body, to be ſervants to the body, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for the gratification of your ſenſual appetite? had God no higher deſign than to prepare you to enjoy ſenſual pleaſures, or was it only to make you capable to rebel againſt him? The bruit creatures being deſtitute of rational Souls are not capable to rebel, they can't ſin or diſhonour God, and carry to his reproach: and did God advance you to an higher pitch of excellency, and give you a Soul of a ſuperiour nature, endued with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:001930_0114_0FBA1DAE4625BB00"/>faculties that you might carry like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? Did God make you better than the beaſts of the earth, that you might make your ſelves worſe than them? ſurely it was not worth the while for you to be made to diſhonour God. You were made to glorify God, and if this be not done by you, you don't anſwer the end of your creation. Other creatures attend what they were made for, and if you don't attend what you were made for, God may well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of making you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>You commend thoſe that have praiſed and glorified God.</hi> Men in former Generations have carryed themſelves differently; ſome have praiſed &amp; glorifyed God: So, <hi>Moſes, Noah, Samuel, Hezekiah, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> and you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol them; you count them wiſe and worthy Men; they are renowned in all Generations on that account; you look upon them that have ſerved God as the choiceſt of Men; if they were poor and perſecuted, yet you count them Men <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> Heb. 11.38. All Generations call them bleſſed. Others have neglected to praiſe &amp; glorify God: as <hi>Achan, Gehazi, Doeg, Ahitophel,</hi> and <hi>Demas, &amp;c.</hi> There have been great numbers of men that have neglected the ſervice of God, and been devoted to ſerve their carnal &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections; and you deſpiſe theſe men in your hearts, you count them fools &amp; mad men, ſome were rich, ſome of them learned, ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in honour; but you have a low opinion of them; you think, it had been better for
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:001930_0115_0FBA1DAF864D2CA8"/>them, if they had never been born. You paſs that cenſure on them, Pſal. 49.13 <hi>This their way is their folly.</hi> You count them among the fools in Iſrael; you wonder how they could ſatisfy themſelves, how they dared, how they were not aſhamed to live ſuch a life: they are deſpicable perſons in your eyes; &amp; juſt ſo Men will count of you, when you are dead: if you glorify God, they will bleſs you, if you don't, they will count you a miſerable Man. And will you commend ſuch as glorify God, &amp; not tread in their ſteps? will you condemn thoſe that have not done it, and yet imitate them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Great notice is taken in Heaven how you carry.</hi> The Angels have great occaſion to be converſant in this lower World; they are often coming and going, they are deſcending &amp; aſcending, as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw them in a Dream, Gen. 28.12. <hi>Being miniſiring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter to them that ſhall be heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Heb 5.14. And they are giving information how you carry your ſelves: and Saints that die and go to Heaven, are able to give an account of the behaviour of others in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from whence they come: One would think that you ſhould be concerned that the Saints in Heaven ſhould not hear an evil report of you: undoubtedly they are concerned about the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of Men upon Earth. Luk. 15.7. <hi>Joy ſhall be in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi> Saints that are in Heaven will be inquiſitive concerning the ſtate of Religion, and getting the knowledge how it thrives in ſuch a Country, and ſuch a Town; they will be asking after their Acquaintance, and after their Sons &amp; their Daughters; &amp; one would think that many of you ſhould be aſhamed to think what account muſt be given of you, to your
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:001930_0116_0FBA1DB1164CD4F0"/>friends, if you have any friends in Heaven: It may be ſome would be aſhamed that it ſhould be told at the next Town how they have behaved themſelves, much more ſhould they that it ſhould be told in Heaven. The account that muſt be given of many Perſons is, that they mind little but the World; they are nothing for Religion; they are ſwallowed up in the cares of the World; they have ſomewhat of a Form of goodlineſs, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Power; they are panting after the duſt of the earth; they don't ſavour of a gracious Spirit. They go to Meeting on the Sabbath &amp; at other times, but the cares of the World do choke the Seed of the Word. And the account that muſt be given of others is, that they are Phariſaical, Proud Creatures, mind little but their Ornaments: Or that they are of rude beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; when they ſhould be in bed they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in company with Wenches, or that they lie about the Taverns; that they are companions of fools. One would think it ſhould go to your heart, to conſider, what diſcourſe there is in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you; to have an ill name here is a ſhame, but it is more ſhameful to have an ill name in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: you may well bluſh to think that it ſhould be told in Heaven, that much pains has been taken with you, but that hitherto it is all in vain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>If you will not Praiſe the Name of the Lord upon Earth, you ſhall not do it in Heaven.</hi> Praiſing God is heavenly work; Saints &amp; Angels will ſpend an Eternity in Praiſing &amp; Magnifying God; they will be making Melody to the Lord; and you think they will be very happy, according to that, Pſal. 84.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will be ſtill praiſing thee.</hi> But if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to praiſe God here, God will not admit you among the holy ones there, that are praiſing him. There will be a glorious company in Heaven, &amp;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001930_0117_0FBA1DB2C402A838"/>you would fain be one among the reſt; you will beg to be admitted, you have deſires that way now, you have your pangs wherein you long to go to Heaven. Numb. 23.10. <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> And when you are going out of the World, you will cry earneſtly to God to admit you, and will fill your Mouths with arguments; but you will be rejected God will have no compaſſion on you, but will harden his heart againſt you. He will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what a life you led here, how you neglected to glorify him, how you did not own his Authority, you did not render to him the glory of his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; how you preferred other things before him: And he will ſtop his ears againſt your crys. He wont object againſt you that you were poor &amp; low in the World, or the unholineſs of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, but his objection will be, that you did not honour him. For he ſays, <hi>They that honour me, I will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. And he will not admit you. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.11, 12. The fooliſh Virgins <hi>ſaid, Lord, Lord open to us, but he anſwered &amp; ſaid, Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>If you won't praiſe the Name of the Lord on Earth, you muſt do it in Hell.</hi> It is commonly ſaid, that wicked men in hell will blaſpheme God; and I do not deny it: that is applyed to them, Rev. 16.11. <hi>They blaſphemed the God of heaven becauſe of their plagues, and becauſe of their ſores:</hi> Though that is ſpoken directly of Antichriſtians, when God brings his Judgments upon them. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men in Hell ſhall praiſe God: God will praiſe himſelf by executing miſery on them; he will ſhew forth his own glory when he executes revenge upon them; as he did when he brought his plagues upon <hi>Egypt: He cauſed his Name to be declared through the Earth.</hi> But beſides this he will extort praiſe from you: now you are
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001930_0118_0FBA1DB4C2B4C3A8"/>ready to flatter your ſelf as if you were in no danger; then you ſhall acknowledge that God is ſtronger than you; that there is no darkneſs now ſhadow of death, where the workers of iniquity ſhall hide themſelves; then you ſhall acknowledge your folly &amp; madneſs in withſtanding the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calls of God. You will be found likewiſe to own the Juſtice of God. Now Men have reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in their hearts againſt it; but then they ſhall be forced to give a teſtimony for it. Rom. 3.19. <hi>Every mouth ſhall be ſtopped &amp; all the world ſhall become guilty before God.</hi> As Pharaoh acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Gods Righteouſneſs. Exod. 9.27. <hi>The Lord is righteous, &amp; I &amp; my people are wicked.</hi> Before they would not believe the faithfulneſs of God in his threatnings; now they will ſay as, 1 Sam. 7.29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie nor repent, for he is not a Man that he ſhould repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>It may be objected, That it is not the manner of Young Men &amp; Maids to ſerve &amp; glorify God: if they ſhould do it they ſhould be ſingular: they must do as others do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is no vindication of you. Irreligion is wickedneſs though there be never ſo many that practice it. The multitude of Sinners is no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſication of ſin: neither is it any ſecurity: if hand joyn in hand the wicked ſhall not be unpaniſhed. Multitudes of Young ones are burning in Hell for their iniquities. If you heard their groans, you would have little heart to follow their example. Neither are theſe bad examples an inſuperable temptation. <hi>Samuel &amp; David, Solomon &amp; Joſiah,</hi> did vanquiſh this temptation, and ſo may you too.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Now is our only time to enjoy our pleaſures.</hi>

And it may be now is your only time, to ſecure eternal life: you have no aſſurance of any time hereafter to do it. The courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture don't ſecure it unto you. There is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from God to ſecure it to you: and you are warned to take the preſent time. Iſai. 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call you upon him, while he is near.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>It is not to be expected that we ſhould be as good us Elder People: we are not guilty of any great Extravagances: You would not have us to be as Religious and as Preciſe as Elderly Perſons.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If you be not better than ſome Elderly Profeſſors be, you will never enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Men go under an apprehenſion that a little Religion will ſecure Salvation, and ſo they give way to worldlineſs and lukewarmneſs, and looſe walking; and they that will run the ventue of it may: But aſſuredly the way to life is narrow: Some that have a Name that they live, are dead. There may be ſeriouſneſs &amp; ſobriety, and conſcientiouſneſs and affection, and zeal, and yet Perſons may be in a periſhing condition: it is a mighty change that prepares Men for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I am afraid that the unſavoury car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of ſome Elder Profeſſors, make ſome Young ones to harden their hearts, and to think that a little Religion will ſerve the turn; but you ſhould remember the words of Chriſt: Math. 5.20. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your righteouſneſs do exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, you ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>
