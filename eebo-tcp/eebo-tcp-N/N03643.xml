            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday, Feb.</hi> 22. This Day I intended to ſtay on Board to write Letters; but GOD being pleaſed to ſhew me, it was not his Will, I went on Shore again, and paid both the Miniſters of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> a Viſit; who received me very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately, and offer'd me the Uſe of the Pulpit. <hi>O, what a bleſſed Thing is it for the Clergy to dwell together in Unity!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At Eleven, went to public Prayers; and was much pleaſed to ſee many Officers and Soldiers attend the General to Church. <hi>Methinks Religion looks doubly amiable in Soldiers!</hi> After Prayers, din'd again with the General; who gave me an Invitation, as I went out of the Church. He treated me with uncommon Civility, and deſired me to preach the following. <hi>Sunday,</hi> which I promiſed to do. We had an elegant Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but my Thoughts were moſtly employ'd in pitying the Unhappineſs of great Men, who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004453_0006_100D9E64282EF8D8"/>
are in ſuch continual Danger of having their Table become a Snare unto them. I had an Opportunity of ſending a Packet of Letters, with my Journal, to my dear Friends in <hi>England; May the good Lord give them his Bleſſing!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Went in the Afternoon to viſit a Deſerter, who had ſent me a Letter, deſiring me to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for him with the Governour, he being apprehenſive he ſhould die for Deſertion, I intended to anſwer his Requeſt, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was ſo merciful, that he order'd him to be whipp'd only, which I thought Puniſhment little enough. <hi>O Sin! What Miſchief doſt thou make in the World!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Evening, I return'd as uſual on Board. Read Prayers, and expounded in the great Cabin. Buried a Child; made an Exhortation to the Soldiers, proper for the Occaſion. Wrote to ſome Friends at <hi>Deal,</hi> and went to Bed, with unuſual Thoughts, and Convictions, that GOD would do ſome great Things at <hi>Gibraltar. O that I was a pure Veſſel, fit for my Maſter's Uſe!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thurſday, Feb.</hi> 23. Continued all this Day on Board; did my uſual Duty in the Ship; and put my dear Friend <hi>B</hi>—'s Sermon into the Hands of two Officers at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> who came to dine on Board with Lieutenant <hi>D.</hi> They behaved very much like Gentlemen, and ſeemed pleaſed with ſerious Converſation. <hi>May the</hi> GOD <hi>whom I ſerve, add the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>to the</hi> Gentleman!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Friday, Feb.</hi> 24. <hi>Bleſſed be God, who this Day has ſhewn me, that he has heard my Prayer,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004453_0007_100D9E664192C560"/>
and not taken his Loving Kindneſs from me!</hi> — Before I reached <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> I prayed that God would open an effectual Door, at the Place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were going, and direct me where I ſhould lodge; and lo! this Day he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me! About Ten in the Morning Capt. <hi>M.</hi> came on Board, telling me that one Major <hi>S.</hi> a Perſon I never ſaw, had provided me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Lodging, at one Merchant <hi>B</hi>—'s, and deſired that I would come on Shore. I looking on this as a Call from Providence, received it with all Thankfulneſs, and went with Friend <hi>H.</hi> on Shore; but not without firſt praying GOD would direct us how to behave.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of the Town Major <hi>S.</hi> gave us the Meeting; conducted us to our new Lodgings, which were very commodious, and engaged us to dine with him, and Capt. <hi>M.

                  <p>About Eleven was introduc'd by Dr. <hi>C.</hi> to General <hi>C.</hi> who was very deſirous of ſeeing me: He receiv'd me exceeding kindly; and after a little ſerious Converſation, we went to Governor <hi>S</hi>—'s, and from thence to public Prayers; and was highly pleas'd to ſee ſo many Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Generals to Church. Dr. <hi>C.</hi> told me, he had not known Governor <hi>S.</hi> abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Prayers once theſe ſeven Years; except when he was hinder'd by real Sickneſs. <hi>O that all others would let their Light ſo ſhine before Men!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Retir'd in the Evening to our Lodgings. Had Family Prayer. Wrote ſome few Religious

Letters. Spent near half an Hour in ſerious Converſation with the People of the Houſe. Gave Thanks for the Bleſſings of the Day, and was ſoon convinc'd that God had ſent me hither of a Truth. <hi>Be careful for nothing; but in every,—even the minuteſt Thing, make your Wants known unto God; — for he careth for you.</hi>

                     <hi>Saturday, Feb.</hi> 25. About Six this Morning went with <hi>H.</hi> to the Church, to pray with ſome devout Soldiers, who I heard uſed to meet there at that Time, and with whom my Soul was knit immediately.— <hi>For all my Delight is in the Saints that are in the Earth, and in thoſe that excel in Virtue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had finiſh'd our Devotions, I made Inquiry into their State; and found that their Society had been ſubſiſting about twelve Years; and that one Sergeant <hi>B.</hi> (a devout Soldier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) now among them, was the firſt Beginner of it. At firſt (they told me) they uſed to meet in Dens, and Mountains, and Caves in the Rocks; but afterwards, on their applying for Leave to build a little Place to retire in, Dr. <hi>C.</hi> and Governor <hi>S.</hi> gave them the free Uſe of the Church, where they conſtantly meet three times in a Day; and pray, read, and ſing Pſalms; and at any other Seaſon when they pleaſe. — They have met with much Contempt; and are now in Deriſion, call'd, THE NEW LIGHTS; and glorious Lights they are indeed! For I convers'd cloſely with ſeveral of them, and they made me quite aſham'd of my little Proficiency in the School of Chriſt. Many have join'd with

them for a Time, but a ſervile Fear of Man (that Bane of Chriſtianity!) made them draw back. However, ſome continued ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, and tho' deſpiſed by the World, are, no Doubt, highly favour'd of GOD. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>S.</hi> countenances them much; and has ſpoke of them often to me with much Reſpect. <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> GOD, <hi>even the Father of our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who hath not left himſelf without Witneſs at any Place; but hath ſome every-where who ſerve him, and work Righteouſneſs!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sunday</hi> before we came hither, I was telling my Friend <hi>H.</hi> that I had Reaſon to think, by what had happen'd to me, that GOD had ſome Work for me to do at <hi>Gibraltar.</hi> He anſwer'd, there could not be much Good expected from among Soldiers. — I reply'd, No Doubt but God has ſome ſecret ones in all Places, who tremble at his Word. <hi>And, lo! he has this Day brought me to them. By this I know thou favoureſt me, O Lord, Thou King of Saints!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo another Society of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church, who in Contempt are called DARK LANTHORNS: It has ſubſiſted about a Year, and is made up of many ſerious Chriſtians, as I was inform'd. I did not think it proper to viſit them; but I ſent to them, as well as to the other Society, ſome proper Books. Had Religious Talk with ſeveral of them, and endeavour'd to unite both Societies together. <hi>O when will that Time come, when all Differences about Externals ſhall be taken away, and we all with one Heart, and one Mouth, glorify our Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST?</p>

I took that Opportunity of exhorting them all to <hi>take Heed to the Things that belong to their Peace.</hi> Some, I believe, were affected; but the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of them behav'd ſo careleſs, that I could not ſee a Difference between thoſe that have a Miniſter among them, and thoſe that have not.</p>

Many of them convers'd moſt Spiritually; and ſeem'd well acquainted with the Pangs of the New-Birth. <hi>May God perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts!

The Church, tho' very large, was quite throng'd; and GOD was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew me, that he had given extraordinary Succeſs to my Sermon. <hi>O how is the Divine Strength magnify'd in my Weakneſs!

                  </p>
                  <p>After Evening Prayers, (for there are none in the Afternoon) I went and expounded, pray'd, and ſung Pſalms with the Society, and had near thirty Hearers. <hi>May the Good Lord give it his Bleſſing!</hi>

I exhorted them to Love and Unity, and not to let a little Difference about a few Externals occaſion any Narrow-Spiritedneſs to ariſe in their Hearts. I adviſed them to come and hear me expound in the Church, which they did; and providentially the Leſſon was the 4th of the <hi>Epheſians</hi>; from whence I took Occaſion to urge on them, the Neceſſity of loving one another, with a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, diſintereſted Love; to be of one Heart, and of one Mind, and to join, without having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Perſons, in haſtening the Kingdom of our Lord JESUS CHRIST.

                  <p>I continued with them their whole Service; and ſpent moſt of my Time in ſecret Prayer to GOD, <hi>that the Veil might be taken from their Hearts; and that bleſſed Time might come, when his choſen People ſhould again be ingrafted into their own Olive-tree, and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>be ſaved!</hi>

                  <p>About Twelve, went to the Church, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Appointment; and made a farewel Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as GOD gave me Utterance, to a great Number of weeping Soldiers, Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then kneel'd down, and having recommended each other to the Care of GOD, I left them; went out and took my Leave of the two Generals.

                  <p>Viſited near twelve or fourteen ſick Perſons, and yet ſuch is GOD's Mercy to me, that though the Place where they lie, is much confined, and they catch the Fever one of another, yet GOD keeps me from Infection. <hi>The Way of Duty is the Way of Safety.

                  </p>
                  <p>Exchanged ſome bad Books that were on Board, (which I threw immediately into the Sea) for ſome good ones. Bleſſed be GOD! all I have found them with, (as yet) have been ready to ſurrender them up; and I find it by daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience more and more, that People who are thoroughly awakened to a Senſe of the divine Life, cannot bear to read any thing trifling; but throw away their uſeleſs Books, as thoſe did the Books of Divination and curious Arts, which we read of in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who were converted by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                     <hi>Monday, March</hi> 27. Laſt Night GOD was pleaſed to take away a black Boy of Capt. <hi>Wh—'s,</hi> after he had been ill of a violent Fever for ſome Days. — He was never baptized, but I had a Commiſſion from his Maſter (who
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004453_0032_100D9EA3508B65B8"/>
ſeem'd much affected at his Death) to inſtruct and baptize him, if it pleaſed GOD he ſhould recover; but GOD ſaw fit to order it otherwiſe: <hi>His holy Will be done!</hi> —</p>
                  <p>About Ten in the Morning, he was wrapped up in a Hammock, and thrown into the Sea. I could not read the Office over him, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; but Capt. <hi>M.</hi> order'd the Drum to beat, and I exhorted all the Soldiers, Sailors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as GOD gave me Utterance, to <hi>remember their</hi> CREATOR <hi>in the Days of their Youth, and prepare for the Time when the Sea ſhould give up its Dead, and all Nations be called together, to appear before the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD. <hi>O that they may be made wiſe by it! that they may lay to Heart what has been ſaid, and practically conſider their latter End!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had our bleſſed Saviour been here, I believe he would have wept to ſee what Havock Sin has made among us. <hi>Do thou, Lord, teach us ſo to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts to Wiſdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Day Capt. <hi>M.</hi> began to come at Six in the Morning, and join in Prayers on Deck, inſtead of having Prayers in the great Cabin. Surely our Soldiers will be without Excuſe, ſince their Captain leads ſo good an Example. Bleſſed be GOD, I have no Reaſon to complain of them, for they come very regularly twice a Day to Prayers; and an Oath ſeems to be a ſtrange Thing among them. Many Marks of a ſound Converſion appear in ſeveral on Board; and we live in perfect Harmony and Peace,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004453_0033_100D9EA5B0CEE368"/>
loving and beloved by one another. <hi>Surely, my Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Prayers are heard; continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in them, and you ſhall ſee greater Things than theſe; for</hi> GOD <hi>delights in the Proſperity of his Servants.</hi>

                     <hi>Friday, March</hi> 31. This being the Crucifixion of our bleſſed Lord, I preached a Sermon on the penitent Thief; and I hope God gave it his Bleſſing. We began Prayers later than uſual; ſo, before I had done, Darkneſs came upon us, which put me in Mind of that Darkneſs which overwhelm'd the World, when the GOD of Nature ſuffer'd. <hi>O that our Hearts may rend like the Rocks, and our Souls ariſe from the Death of Sin, as the Bodies of thoſe did from their Graves, to appear to many in the holy City, after our LORD's Reſurrection!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had a good Inſtance of the Benefit of breaking Children's Wills betimes. Laſt Night, going between Decks, as I do every Night, to viſit the Sick, and examine my People, I asked one of the Women to bid her little Boy, that ſtood by her, ſay his Prayers: She anſwer'd, his elder Siſter would, but ſhe could not make him. Upon this, I bid the Child kneel down before me, but he would not, till I took hold of his Feet, and forc'd him down. I then bid him ſay the Lord's Prayer, being informed by his Mother, he could ſay it if he would; but he obſtinately refuſed, till at laſt, after I had given him ſeveral Blows, he ſaid his Prayers as
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004453_0035_100D9EAB2AECA9A8"/>
well as I could expect. I gave him ſome Figs for a Reward, and lo! this ſame Child, tho' not above four Years of Age, came to-night upon Deck, when the other Children came to ſay their Prayers, to my Friend <hi>H.</hi> and he burſt out into a Flood of Tears, and would not go away till he had ſaid his too.</p>
                  <p>I mention this as a Proof of the Neceſſity of early Correction. Children are ſenſible of it ſooner than Parents imagine; and if they would but have Reſolution to break their Wills throughly when young, the Work of Converſion would be much eaſier, and they would not be ſo troubled with perverſe Children when they are old.</p>

                     <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 2. Roſe early this Morning, and join'd in Spirit with my dear abſent Friends, who were receiving the Holy Euchariſt, and celebrating our bleſſed Lord's Reſurrection. I find my not being in Prieſt's Orders is a great Hindrance to my Miniſtry; which will oblige me to return to <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as poſſible. <hi>The good Lord prepare me for that ſecond Impoſition of Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Preached a Sermon in the Afternoon on <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> ii.10. <hi>That I may know him, and the Power of his Reſurrection. O that we may all experience it in our Hearts! for without it,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as to us, is dead in vain.</hi>

Had ſome further Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the young Gentleman, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion I mentioned before, and who, I hope, is quickened from above. He told me, he uſed to wonder to hear me talk, that all our Thoughts, Words and Actions, ought to be dedicated unto God; but now he perceived what I ſaid to be true. <hi>How does the new Nature give us new Notions!</hi> It ſeems a difficult Task to the <hi>natural Man,</hi> to turn his whole Life into one continued Sacrifice; but the <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> does it with Eaſe. He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which as ſenſibly draws his Heart towards God, as the Load-ſtone attracts the Needle. <hi>Draw us then, O GOD, and our Affections will aſcend up after thee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About Eleven went on Board the <hi>Lightfoot.</hi> Pray'd with a ſick Man.

But few of the Ship eſcape! <hi>The good Lord make all their Beds in their Sickneſs!</hi> Had much of God with me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. The Heat uncommonly temperate, as it has been for ſome time. The Ship ſail'd all Day, as tho' ſhe was carried on the Wings of the Wind. Preached two Sermons, beſides my Expoſition at Six in the Morning, and I hope God ſet his Seal to them. Was well pleaſed to hear by my Friend <hi>H.</hi> (who is very active in carrying Things to the Sick) that the poor People between Decks pray'd heartily for me and Capt. <hi>M.</hi> who ſeems to improve every Day. And now indeed we live more comfortably in the great Cabin, than can eaſily be imagin'd. We talk of little elſe but GOD and CHRIST.

Drops of Sweat trickle down his Face! His Eyes looked ghaſtly, and the whole Man was in a bitter Agony! Capt. <hi>Wh</hi>— went down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Decks with me once or twice to ſee him, and I uſed the laſt Prayer over him ſeveral times. About Nine at Night he expired, I fear, without Hope; for he killed himſelf with drinking. <hi>O that all Drunkards would learn from him, to be wiſe in Time, and practically conſider their latter End!</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 15. This Morning I buried the dead Soldier, in Time of public Prayers.

I came; I ſaw; I rejoiced in Spirit, for his Soul ſeem'd full of GOD. Inſtead of being affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Approach of the King of Terrors, he welcom'd it, and ſaid he was going to his dear Redeemer. Then he fell, as it were, into a Trance, and pour'd out his Heart in repeating ſome very applicable Verſes out of the Pſalms, on which we thought he would have died. But lo! GOD brought him from the nethermoſt Hell! for that Inſtant the Fever left him, and he recover'd. <hi>O what Difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that feareth</hi> GOD, <hi>and him that feareth him not, in their laſt Hours!</hi> LORD, <hi>let me die the Death of the Righteous, and let my future State be like his.</hi>

                  <p>This Evening I was ſent for by a Sailor, who had been the moſt remarkable Swearer on board, and whom I in an eſpecial manner warn'd about two Days agone; telling him, I believ'd GOD would remarkably viſit him, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He laughed and ſaid, he hoped not. But to-night he ſent for me trembling, and burning with a ſcorching Fever; told me what grievous Sins he had been guilty of, and pray'd moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for Repentance.— Two or three of the ſame Stamp have been taken in the like manner. <hi>God grant they may flee from the Wrath to come!

                     <hi>April</hi> 18. Greatly delighted in ſeeing two Water Spouts. One of which ran along for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Miles, and, by the eſpecial Providence of GOD, eſcaped us. We ſaw it coming, and were ſurpriſed to obſerve a ſudden Calm for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Minutes round the <hi>Whitaker,</hi> when the other Parts of the Sea boil'd like a Pot. But ſurely the everlaſting I AM ſaid unto the Sea at that Inſtant, <hi>Let there be a Calm in that Place.</hi> For by that means our Ship was immediately ſtopp'd in her Courſe, and ſo the Water Spout paſſed by, before we came up to it; otherwiſe it would have torn our Sails in Pieces.

                  <p>After this ſeveral Squalls came upon us, which afforded me glorious Matter for adoring that great GOD, whom Winds and Storms obey. — The Sailors were in great Hurry and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but, to my Comfort, not one ſingle Oath was heard all the while. — A Proof this, that Sailors may pull the Ropes, without ſwearing; and that the Words ſpoken to them, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. — <hi>Bleſſed be God!</hi>

                     <hi>May</hi> 1. This Morning went out on Deck; after being confin'd to my Bed for a Week by a violent Fever, with which all, except three or four in the Ship, have been viſited. I was blooded thrice; vomited once, and bliſter'd; and, bleſſed be GOD, can ſay, <hi>'tis good for me that I have been afflicted</hi>; for as Affliction abounded, Conſolation much more abounded, and God enabled me to <hi>rejoice with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory.

                  <p>I hope I ſhall now experimentally ſympathize with thoſe that are ſick; and learn to be more tender-hearted to my Fellow Chriſtians. I am <hi>now made whole. May I ſin no more,</hi> but be more fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord, <hi>leſt a worſe Evil befal me.</hi>

I could have wiſh'd for a thouſand Tongues, to have ſounded a loud Alarm to my People; but the Sight of the Corps, and the Weakneſs of my Body, would but juſt permit me to read out the Office. <hi>Lord what is Man!

                  <p>THOUGH the Journals already publiſh'd, were printed without my Knowledge, yet as GOD has been pleaſed to let me ſee, by Letters ſent to me, that he has greatly bleſſed them, I now upon the Importunity of Friends, conſent to the publiſhing a Continuation of them, that thoſe pious Perſons who have interceded in my behalf, may ſee what GOD, in anſver to their Prayers, has done for my Soul.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that this, as well as every Thing elſe of ſuch a Nature, muſt neceſſarily meet with great Contempt from natural Men, who are Strangers to the Influences of the HOLY GHOST upon the Heart.

Many of them going out all Day and Night after him. — Aſſoon as I had refreſhed myſelf I went and viſited my Pariſhioners from Houſe to Houſe to return them Thanks for their Kindneſs to my Friends. An unuſual Joy appear'd in their Faces at my unexpected Return, and they were ready to ſay, <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth the glad Tidings of Salvation!</hi> At Evening Prayers (and a very large Congregation was preſent) I returned my dear Hearers hearty Thanks for the late Inſtance of their ſincere Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I publickly exhorted my Friend that was loſt to ſhew forth his Thankfulneſs not only with his Lips but with his Life, and deſired their Prayers to GOD for me that I might now more and more devote myſelf to my Bleſſed Maſter's Service, and ſtudy daily to purify my corrupt Nature, that I might be made an Inſtrument under him, of winning their Souls to GOD.</p>

                        <hi>Wedneſday, Auguſt</hi> 23. A Neceſſity was laid on me to Day to expreſs my Reſentment againſt Infidelity by refuſing to read the Burial Office over the moſt profeſſed Unbeliever I ever yet met with. — GOD was pleaſed to viſit him with a lingring Illneſs, in which Time I went to ſee him frequently. — Particularly about five Weeks agone, I asked him what Religion he was of, he anſwered, "<hi>Religion was divided into ſo many Sects he knew not which to chuſe.</hi>" — Another Time I offer'd to pray with him, but he would not accept it, upon which I reſolv'd to go ſee him no more; — But being told two Days before he dyed, that he had an Inclination to ſee me, I went to him again, and after a little Converſation, I put to him the following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. "<hi>Do you believe</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>to be GOD, the one Mediator between God and Man?</hi>" He ſaid, "<hi>I believe</hi> Chriſt <hi>was a good Man.</hi>" — "<hi>Do you believe the Holy Scriptures?</hi>"
<q>I believe, <hi>replied he,</hi> ſomething of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the New I do not believe at all.</q>

<q>Do you believe, Sir, a Judgment to come?</q>
He turn'd himſelf about and replied,
<q>I know not what to ſay to that.</q>
—
<q>Alas, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> Sir, if all theſe Things ſhould be true.</q>
— Which Words I believe, gave him Concern, for he ſeemed after to be very uneaſy, grew delirious, and departed in a Day or two. — Unhappy Man, how quickly was he convinced that all I ſaid was true. Now he and I are of one Mind. The Day after his Deceaſe he was carried to the Ground, and I refuſed to read the Office over

This Day went to <hi>Highgate</hi> with a Friend or two more, and read Prayers, preach'd and baptized a Child, and and catechiſed in a Houſe lately erected by the Inhabitants.

                        <hi>Monday Auguſt</hi> 28. This being the Day of my Departure, it was moſtly ſpent in taking Leave of my Flock, who expreſſed their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now more than ever. For they came to me from the Morning to the Time I left them with Tears in their Eyes, wiſhing me a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Voyage and ſafe Return, and gave me other Tokens of their Love. For they brought me Wine, Ale, Cake, Coffee, Tea, and other Things proper for my Paſſage, and their Love ſeem'd without Diſſimulation.</p>
                     <p>About Four in the Afternoon I went into the Boat provided for me by Mr. <hi>Cauſton,</hi> who with the Recorder came to my Houſe and took their Leave. A great Number of People came to the <hi>Bluff</hi> and wiſh'd me a good Voyage with all their Souls, and a ſpeedy Return; I thanked them, and having deſired their Prayers, bleſſed them in the Name of GOD and took my Leave.</p>

                     <p>Was much pleaſed with the Neatneſs of the Buildings, and the Largeneſs of the Place.

My Sphere of Action is now contracted into a narrow Compaſs. There are but few Souls on Board, and all that

<q>That he perceived their Voyage would be to their great Damage,</q>
has frequently been preſs'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now ſhewn me wherefore he gave me theſe previous Notices.—For on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night laſt, after we had ſailed 150 Miles, the laſt twenty-four Hours, about Eleven o'Clock aroſe a ſudden violent <hi>Eaſt</hi> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.— Moſt of them declared they never had ſeen the like before. The main Sail was ſlit in ſeveral Pieces, and ſeveral of the other Sails, and much of the Tackling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the moſt dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In ſhort, all was Terror and Confuſion, Men's Hearts failing

For I felt a ſweet Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in my Will, in Submiſſion to his. Many particular Promiſes GOD has made me from his Word, that I ſhould return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.—This is the firſt Day we have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <hi>Egyptians</hi> once ſaw. But I ſpent my Time in reading, and fervent Interceſſion for abſent Friends, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted myſelf much with the Remembrance of them; moſt of freſh Proviſions are waſhed over Board, and our Tackling much out of order, ſo that we have a Proſpect but of an indifferent Voyage. But bleſſed be GOD, the Proſpect pleaſes me. For now I ſhall learn, I truſt, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hardſhip like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>O LORD let thy Strength be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in my Weakneſs, ſay unto my Soul,</hi>

In the Leſſon were theſe remarkable Words, <hi>Return to thy own Houſe, and ſhew how great Things God has done unto thee.</hi> And again, <hi>It came to paſs that when Jeſus was returned, the People gladly received him, for they were all waiting for him.</hi> Theſe laſt Words were remarkably preſſed upon me at <hi>Savannah,</hi> when I was conſulting GOD by Prayer, whether it was his Will that I ſhould go to <hi>England.

Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our conſtant Food for ſome Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of ſome amongſt us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Neceſſities, yea, He ſo comforts me that many I believe are ſurpriſed at my Chearfulneſs. But when we are deſtitute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>

Soul,— <hi>After this they went Home, and ſung a Song of Thankſgiving, and praiſed the</hi> LORD <hi>in Heaven; becauſe it is good, becauſe his Mercy endureth forever.</hi> I hope my Friends will take care to fulfil this when we meet together on Shore.</p>

                        <hi>Wedneſday, November</hi> 1. This Afternoon, about four o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul before GOD, interceding for my Friends, and had been praying for a fair Wind, and Aſſiſtance in the great Work lying before me, News were brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being ſent to <hi>Daniel,</hi> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Faſting, and praying for the Peace and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Indeed I cannot ſay I have purpoſely, for theſe three Weeks, eat no pleaſant Food, or faſted, as he did; but our Food is ſo ſalt, that I dare eat but little, ſo that I am now literally in Faſtings often. <hi>O that I may improve this bleſſed Seaſon for Humiliation and extraordinary Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepar'd to approve myſelf a faithful Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, whether by Honour or Diſhonour, by evil Report or good Report.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as we found the Wind fair, we join'd in Thankſgiving, and in ſinging the firſt Part of the 34th <hi>Pſalm</hi> (new Verſion) which was very applicable to our Circumſtances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Requeſt of his
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004453_0078_100D9F14D5DEF408"/>
Diſciples, conſider'd the Multitude, and work'd a Miracle for their Relief; and at another Time, at the Interceſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> gave Water to the wandring <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> I truſt, now, has heard our Prayers, and ſent this Wind with a Commiſſion to bring us where he will ſupply all our Wants. <hi>If not, O Bleſſed</hi> JESU, <hi>thy Will be done. Give me Grace, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, to hold out my three Watches, and at the fourth Watch I know thou wilt come. Even ſo come Lord</hi> JESUS.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thurſday, Nov.</hi> 4. For theſe two Days laſt paſt, GOD has been pleaſed greatly to humble my Soul, and bring me low by Spiritual Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And to Day he has thought proper again to ſend us a contrary Wind, bleſſed be his Name. Our Allowance of Water now is but a Pint a Day; ſo that we dare not eat much Beef. Our Sails are exceeding thin; ſome more of them were ſplit laſt Night, and no one knows where we are; but GOD does, and that is ſufficient.</p>
                     <p>Laſt Night He lifted up the Light of his bleſſed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory; ſo that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly poſſeſs all Things. I am ſometime afraid leſt continued Abſtinence may occaſion a bodily Sickneſs. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing elſe I know will work for my Good. — What I moſt dread, is leſt any on Board ſhould charge GOD fooliſhly; but I check the firſt Motions I diſcern ariſing in any one's Heart, and endeavour to juſtify our good
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004453_0079_100D9F16690A31F0"/>
GOD, in all the Evil that he hath brought upon us. I put before them the Example of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> and caution them againſt murmuring like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the Waters of <hi>Meribah, And thus I endeavour to comfort and ſupport them with the Comforts wherewith I myſelf am comforted of GOD.</hi>

                     <p>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends aſk me, why I arrived no ſooner, I may truly anſwer, <hi>Satan</hi> hinder'd us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this ſtill gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be be open'd in <hi>England,</hi> for preaching the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel. <hi>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy worſt; thou mayſt toſs me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on every Side; but JESUS CHRIST is praying for me on the Mount. And when the Time appointed by the Father is come, and my Soul hereby prepared, he whom Winds and Storms obey, will ſpeak the Word; and then I ſhall have a happy meeting with my dear Friends!</hi>

                        <hi>Sunday, Nov.</hi> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated our Deliverance from the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> yet as our Circumſtances call'd for Acts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, I uſed Part of the Office of Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (beſides ſolemn Prayer and Pſalms three Times) and enlarged on theſe Words of St. <hi>James,</hi>

Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</q>
I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calm'd their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can ſay with the penitent Thief,
<q>That I ſuffer juſtly, and do not receive the ten thouſandth Part of the Reward due to my Crimes.</q>
                        <hi>LORD, remember me now thou art in thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom!</hi>

                        <hi>Monday, Nov.</hi> 6. Laſt Night, about ſeven o'Clock, GOD was pleaſed to ſuffer a violent Wind to ariſe, which would not permit me to riſe till this Afternoon, about which Time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in ſome meaſure to abate. Bleſſed be GOD through the Precaution uſed by our Ship-Mates, we ſhip'd but little Water, only we were driven ſome Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Proviſion for the Day; but thus <hi>Elijah</hi> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he faſted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not preſume to do ſo, yet if GOD ſtill brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I ſhall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <hi>LORD, I deſire not to be exempted from ſufferings, but to be ſupported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Tryals, lo, here I am, ſcourge me, try me as it ſeemeth good in thy Sight!</hi>

                     <p>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, leſs lively; But I truſt that is only owing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in God! And was he now to put it to my Choice, whether this Trial ſhould continue, or he ſhould ſend us a fair Wind, I ſhould humbly refer it to him again. <hi>For I know not what is beſt for me!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moſt in the great Cabin now begin to be weak and look hollow-Ey'd, yet a little while, and we ſhall come to Extremities; and then God's Arm will bring us Salvation. <hi>May we patiently tarry the LORD's Leiſure!</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
                     <p>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppreſſed in my Head; but at Night when ſome doubted what the End of this Viſitation would be, the following Verſes were with great Comfort preſſed upon my Soul.

                        <hi>Now know I that the LORD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth he his Anger forever.</hi> For theſe two or three Days laſt paſt, I have enjoyed an uncommon Serenity of Soul, and given up my Will to GOD.

                     <p>A little before our Proviſion came, I had been noting in my Diary, that I believed Deliverance was at Hand; for laſt Night and this Morning, I had the moſt violent Conflict within my ſelf that I have had at all.

                     <p>Why GOD dealeth thus with me, I know not now, but I ſhall know hereafter.

My Clothes have not been off (except to change me) all the Paſſage: Part of the Time I lay on open Deck, Part

on a Cheſt, and the Remainder on a Bed-ſtead cover'd with my <hi>Buffaloe</hi>'s Skin. Theſe Things, though little in themſelves, yet are great in their Conſequences; and whoever deſpiſeth ſmall Acts of bodily Diſcipline, it is to be feared, will inſenſibly loſe his ſpiritual Life by little and little.— Many inward Trials alſo GOD has been pleaſed to ſend me, which I believe, he has ſanctified to my great Good. I am now going on Shore, to the Houſe of a wealthy Gentleman, whom GOD has commanded to receive me. I may yet be expoſed to many Perils by Land e'er I ſee my dear Friends: But his Grace who has preſerved me from ſo many Perils by Water, will alſo be ſufficient for me on dry Land. Whilſt I continue on this ſide Eternity, I never expect to be free from Trials, only to change them: For it is neceſſary to heal the Pride of my Heart, that ſuch ſhould come: With a particular fear and trembling, I think of going to <hi>London.</hi> But he that preſerved <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the Den of Lions, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, will, I hope, preſerve me from the fiery Trial of Popularity, and from the miſguided Zeal of thoſe, who without Cauſe, are my Enemies. <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.

Here are alſo many Beggars, which I impute to the Want of Pariſh Proviſions for them. — At Evening Prayer we went to the Cathedral, and returned public Thanks for our ſafe Arrival. The Remainder of the Night was ſpent in neceſſary Buſineſs, refreſhing our Bodies, religious Converſation, and in writing ſome Things I ſtood in need of.</p>

                        <hi>Sunday, Nov.</hi> 20. Having ſent laſt Night to inform Dr. <hi>Burſcough,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> that I was lately arrived: At his Lordſhip's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I waited on him this Morning, and was received with the utmoſt Candour and Civility. At his Lordſhip's Requeſt, I preached in the Morning at the Cathedral, to a very numerous Audience, who ſeem'd univerſally affected, and full of Expectation that I would preach in the Afternoon; but Providence did not ſeem to open a Door. But why ſhould not a ſtrange Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter always offer his Service? I think it is a wrong Piece of Modeſty not to do it. For a Sermon from a Stranger, may do more good than many from thoſe the People are conſtantly uſed to.</p>
                     <p>After Sermon the Mayor ſent twice to invite me, but I was pre-engaged to the Biſhop, who kindly invited both me and my Friend, thanked me for my Sermon, and offered me the free Uſe of his Palace, and would have inſiſted on my accepting of it, had I not told his Lordſhip I was to leave <hi>Limerick</hi> in the Morning: <hi>Oh into what a wealthy Place has my good GOD brought me?</hi> How does he every where command ſome or
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:004453_0095_100D9F3D91957700"/>
other to receive me? As I was eating at Dinner, I was meditating on the Divine Goodneſs in ſpreading ſuch a Table for me, when laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> I was in Danger almoſt of periſhing with Hunger. But I thought at the ſame Time, if this was ſo great a Bleſſing, what an infinitely greater one will it be, after the Troubles of this Life, to ſit down and eat Bread in the Kingdom of GOD. <hi>O that I may be accounted worthy of that heavenly Banquet!</hi>

                        <hi>Monday, Nov.</hi> 20. Went about <hi>Limerick</hi> Town this Morning, to diſpatch ſome neceſſary Buſineſs. And found the good Seed ſown yeſterday, had received a Bleſſing from above. For all the Inhabitants ſeem'd alarmed, and look'd moſt wiſhfully at me, as I paſſed along. One ſubſtantial Tradeſman in particular even compell'd me to come in, and ſhewed me and my Friend uncommon Civilities, and told me how ſollicitous the People were for my ſtaying longer.— Another came to my Inn, and begg'd me to come and ſee him, which I did. — And the good Biſhop, when I went to take leave of his Lordſhip, kiſſed me, and ſaid theſe Words, <hi>Mr.</hi> Whitefield, <hi>GOD bleſs you, I wiſh you Succeſs abroad.

                     <p>FRIDAY, <hi>December</hi> 8. About Noon I reached <hi>London,</hi> was received with much Joy by my Chriſtian Friends, and joined with them in Pſalms and Thankſgiving for my ſafe Arrival. My Heart was greatly enlarged hereby.</p>

impreſſed upon my Soul. And now I begin to ſee the Wiſdom of God in it. For five Churches have been already denied me, and ſome of the Clergy, if poſſible, would oblige me to depart out of theſe Coaſts. <hi>But I rejoice in this Oppoſition, it being a certain Sign that a more effectual Door will be opened, ſince there are ſo many Adverſaries.</hi>

                     <p>Did not find the Pity I ought, upon ſeeing a Brother full of Self-love. <hi>Lord enlarge my narrow Heart, and give me that Charity which rejoices not in Iniquity, but in the Truth.</hi> — Perceived ſomething a little bordering on Envy towards my Brother <hi>H.</hi> — I find more and more, that true Humility conſiſts in being ſubmiſſive to thoſe, who are a little above, or a little below us.— <hi>Oh when ſhall I come to rejoice in others Gifts and Graces as much as in my own!

                     <p>Expounded twice or thrice every Night this Week. The Holy Ghoſt ſo powerfully worked upon my Hearers, pricking their Hearts, and melting them into ſuch Floods of Tears, that a ſpiritual Man ſaid, He never ſaw the like before.—GOD is with me of a Truth. Adored be his unmerited Goodneſs, I find his Grace quickening me more and more every Day. My Underſtanding is more enlightned, my Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more enflamed, and my Heart full of Love towards GOD and Man. — <hi>Oh! that the Scoffers of theſe laſt Days were not only almoſt, but altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe indwelling Corruptions!</hi>

In a ſhort Time I had above a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred very attentive Hearers, to whom I expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for above an Hour, for which they were very thankful. <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> GOD <hi>for this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Friday, Febr.</hi> 9. After Breakfaſt and Prayer with the Family where we lodged, I ſet out for <hi>Dummer</hi> (a Pariſh once for a little while under my Care) and met with near a Dozen Chriſtian Brethren, with whom we took exceeding ſweet Counſel, prayed, and ſung Pſalms, and eat our Bread with Gladneſs and Singleneſs of Heart. I wiſh all knew how chearful we, that are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be Chriſtians, live! And if the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning be ſo ſweet, What muſt the End of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving be? <hi>Oh the Goodneſs of</hi> GOD <hi>in thus bringing me back to the Places where I have been already!</hi> LORD <hi>melt down my frozen Heart with a Senſe of thy unmerited Love.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
                     <p>After having wrote ſeveral Letters, I returned with my Friends to <hi>Baſingſtoke,</hi> where I had appointed to expound. Accordingly, in the Evening I went to a large Room prepared for that Purpoſe, and expounded for an Hour. — The Place was very much thronged, many were very noiſy, and others did us the Honour of throwing up Stones at the Windows. But I ſpoke ſo much the louder; being convinced ſome Good muſt come out from a Place where Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is. <hi>I ſhould doubt whether I was a true Miniſter of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>was I not oppoſed. And I find it does me much Good. For it drives me nearer to my</hi> LORD <hi>and Maſter,</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>with whom I long to dwell.</hi>

They came, I believe, with a Deſign to puzzle me about the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; But alas, they ſoon ſhewed what Strangers they were to it. — For one was ſo full of Zeal, that he could not keep his Seat; and both were entirely ignorant of the Indwelling of the Spirit. One Thing they took Care to ſhew as much as poſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> That they had read the Fathers, (I ſuppoſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlations) but at the ſame Time denied Experience in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Poor Men! I pitied and told them, how they reſted in Learning, falſly ſo called, while they were Strangers to the Power of Godlineſs in their Hearts. At laſt, finding no Probability of convincing them, and being called away to Supper, I and my Friends took our Leave in Love, with true Concern to ſee what an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Spirit our Oppoſers are of. Afterwards we prayed for them, and endeavoured to bleſs GOD for making us to Triumph, through his dear SON, in every Place.</p>

greatly to praiſe him, and to pray for my dear abſent Brethren. — <hi>Indeed I love them in the Bowels of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                     <p>About Four in the Afternoon we returned to <hi>Baſingſtoke,</hi> in order to expound. And near Three large Rooms were filled. — We expected ill Treatment ere we returned home, and ſome did begin to interrupt me: But GOD enabled me to ſpeak with ſuch irreſiſtible Power, that they were quite ſtruck dumb and confounded. — Many ſaid, We will never oppoſe again. Others ſaid they would follow me whitherſoever I ſhould go; and the Hearts of GOD's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as well as my own, were filled with Joy unſpeakable. — <hi>This Night, I hope, Salvation is come to this Place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Expoſition, many Chriſtian Friends came to ſee me in a moſt affectionate Manner, and about Nine at Night we ſet out for <hi>Dummer.</hi> But no one can tell what Enlargement of Heart GOD gave me. — My Soul was full of inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Comfort and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. — I poured out my Heart before the Throne of Grace as I rode by the Way, and felt the Spirit of GOD working in me mightily, and enabling me to intercede moſt earneſtly for my dear Friends. LORD <hi>hear my Prayers, and let my Cry come unto thee.</hi> — In a ſhort Time we reached <hi>Dummer,</hi> and after having taken a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, I went to Bed full of Love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for the great Things GOD had done for my Soul.</p>

But that happy Hour is not yet come. There are many Promiſes to be fulfilled in me, many Souls to be called, many Sufferings to be endured, before I go hence. — Father, thy Will be done.</hi>

But he, in effect, gave me a Refuſal, telling me, <hi>that he could not lend his Church without a ſpecial Order from the Chancellor.</hi>— Upon this, I immediately waited on the Chancellor, to whom I had ſent the Night before. — But he told me frankly,
<q>that he would not give any poſitive Leave, neither would he prohibit any one that ſhould lend me a Church; but he would adviſe me to withdraw to ſome other Place till he had heard from the Biſhop, and not preach on that or any other Occaſion.</q>
I asked him his Reaſons. He anſwered,
<q>Why will you preſs ſo hard upon me? The Thing has given a general Diſlike.</q>
— I replied, <hi>Not the Deſign of the Orphan-houſe, — Even thoſe that diſagree with me in other Particulars, approve of that.

Why do not the Clergy ſpeak the Truth, that it is not againſt the Orphan-houſe but againſt me and my Doctrine, that their Enmity is levelled.

                        <hi>Saturday, February</hi> 17. Read Prayers and expounded the Parable of the Prodigal Son at <hi>Newgate,</hi> to a great Number of People; and afterwards was much refreſhed by the coming of a dear <hi>London</hi> Friend, and the Receipt of ſeveral Letters; for the Writers of which, I with many others immediately kneeled down and gave Thanks. One Thing affected me much in their Letters, <hi>viz.</hi> Their News of a great Oppoſer's being given over by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians. — <hi>Alas poor Man!

At Ten, I preached at <hi>St. Warburgh</hi>'s with great Freedom, and to a large Audience. — Bleſſed be GOD, I thought yeſterday I ſhould not have the Uſe of any Pulpit; but GOD, who has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands, diſpoſed the Reverend Mr. <hi>Penroſe</hi> to lend me his, who thanked me for my Sermon; and the Reverend Mr. <hi>Gibbs</hi> ſent to me, and offered me the Uſe both of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> and <hi>St. Mary Ratcliff.</hi> — The latter of theſe I accepted of, and preached to ſuch a Congregation as my Eyes never yet ſaw, with great Liberty and Demonſtration of the Spirit. — Many went away for want of room; and Mr. <hi>Gibbs</hi> and his Lady were exceeding civil both to me and Mr. <hi>Seward.— The LORD reward them for this their Love.</hi>

I anſwered, I thought that Cuſtom was grown obſolete: And why, pray Sir, replied I, did not you ask the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergyman this Queſtion, who preached for you laſt <hi>Thurſday?</hi> He ſaid that was nothing to me. — He then read over Part of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Office, and thoſe Canons that forbid any Miniſter preaching in a private Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— And then he asked me what I ſaid to them? I anſwered, that I apprehended thoſe Canons did not belong to profeſſed Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> — But he ſaid they did. — There is alſo a Canon, ſaid I, Sir, forbidding all Clergyman to frequent Taverns and play at Cards; why is not that put in Execution? Why does not ſomebody complain of them, ſays he, and then it would. — When I asked him why I was thus taken particular Notice of, (referring to my printed Diſcourſes for my Principles) He

                     <p>Being taken ill, juſt before I went to the Chancellor, in my Return home, I found I had not ſo much Joy as Peace.

And to ſhow how little I regarded ſuch Threatnings, after I had joyned in Prayer for the Chancellor, I immediately went and expounded at <hi>Newgate</hi> as uſual; where GOD gave me great Joy, and wonderouſly pricked many to the Heart, as though he would ſay, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it.</hi> — After this we dined with ſeveral Chriſtian Friends with the kind Keeper of the Priſon, and rejoyced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly at the Thoughts, that we ſhould one Day or other ſing together in ſuch a Place as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did. — GOD <hi>prepare us for that Hour.

                     <p>In the Evening I expounded at <hi>Baldwin-ſtreet</hi> Society, but could not get up to the Room without the utmoſt Difficulty, the Entry and Court were ſo much thronged. <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> GOD, <hi>the Number of Hearers much increaſes; and as my Day is, ſo is my Strength.</hi> To Night I returned home much more refreſhed in my Spirits than in the Morning when I went out. <hi>I was full of Joy, and longed to be diſſolved, and to be with</hi> JESUS CHRIST; <hi>but I have a a Baptiſm firſt to be baptized with.

uncommon Freedom and Power at <hi>Newgate,</hi> and collected Thirty-nine Shillings for the poor Priſoners; and being invited by many Colliers, at three in the Afternoon I went to a Place called the <hi>Fiſhponds,</hi> on another Side of <hi>Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> where about two Thouſand were gathered together. The Sight pleaſed me much; and having no better Place to ſtand upon, the Wall was my Pulpit, and, I think, I never ſpoke with greater Power. <hi>My preaching in the Fields may diſpleaſe ſome timorous bigotted Men; but I am throughly perſuaded it pleaſes GOD, and why ſhould I fear any Thing elſe.</hi>

                     <p>At my Return home, I was much refreſhed with the Sight of two pious Friends. After ſome Converſation, they went with me to a Society, where I prayed and expounded for above an Hour, and then ſpent the Remainder of the Evening with them and many other Chriſtian Brethren, in warming one anothers Hearts by mutual Exhortation, and ſinging of Pſalms. <hi>Oh that Senſualiſts knew the Pleaſure of a religious Converſation! I am ſure they would no longer eat Huſks with Swine, but return home to feed on the fatted Calf.</hi>

Having left my dear Brother <hi>Hutchins,</hi> whom I ſent to for that Purpoſe, to ſupply my Place during my Abſence; after many kind Salutations, Pſalms and Prayers on both Sides, Mr. <hi>Seward,</hi> myſelf, and another Brother, took Leave of our <hi>Briſtol</hi> Friends, and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:004453_0164_100D9FD3069A6630"/>
got to the <hi>New Paſſage</hi> in a ſhort Time. Here we ſtaid and refreſhed ourſelves, and endeavoured to go off in the Boat about Noon; but the Wind not permitting us, we took this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of writing to many of our Chriſtian Friends, and exhorting them to lay hold on JESUS CHRIST by Faith.</p>
                     <p>At the Inn where we put up there was an unhappy Clergyman, who (ſo far had his Corruptions dominion over him) would not go over in the Paſſage-Boat becauſe I went in it. <hi>Alas!</hi> thought I, <hi>this very Temper would make Heaven itſelf unpleaſant to that Man, if he ſave me there.</hi> I was likewiſe told, that in the publick Kitchin, he charged me with being a Diſſenter; when a little after, as I paſſed by, I ſaw him ſhaking his Elbows over a Gaming-table. <hi>I heartily wiſh thoſe who charge me cauſeleſly with Schiſm, and being righteous over-much, would conſider that the Canon of our Church forbids our Clergy to frequent Taverns, to play at Cards or Dice, or any other unlawful Games. Their indulging themſelves in theſe Things, is a ſtumbling Block to Thouſands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Supper, in the Evening, I called the Family of the Inn together, and was pleaſed to ſee near twenty come to hear the Word. GOD enabled me to ſpeak and pray with Power, and having diſperſed ſome Extracts from our Church Homilies amongſt them, I and my Friends went early to Bed, being apprized that we were to be called up betimes. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, for any Opportunity of doing good.</hi>

                     <p>The Town, I ſoon found, was apprehenſive of my coming; and therefore, whilſt I was giving a Word of Exhortation to ſome poor People at the Inn, who hanged upon me to hear the Word, Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> went to aſk for the Pulpit? but being denied, we pitched on the Town-Hall, which Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> got by his Intereſt; and at four in the Afternoon, I preached from the Judges Seat to about four hundred Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Moſt were very attentive; but ſome mocked: However, I offered JESUS CHRIST freely even to them, and ſhould have rejoyced if they would have accepted of him; but their fooliſh Hearts were hardned. <hi>LORD, make them Monuments of thy free Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After I came from the Seat, I was much refreſhed with the Sight of my dear Brother <hi>Howel Harris</hi>; whom, though I knew not in Perſon, I have long ſince loved in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST, and have often felt my Soul drawn out in Prayer in his Behalf.</p>

Immorality, and an indefatigable Promoter of the true Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST. About three or four Years GOD has inclined him to go about doing good. He is now above Twenty five Years of Age. Twice he has applied (being every Way qualified) for holy Orders; but was refuſed, under a falſe Pretence, that he was not of Age, though he was then Twenty-two Years and ſix Months. About a Month ago he offered himſelf again, but was put off. Upon this, he was, and is ſtill reſolved to go on in his Work; and indefatigable Zeal has he ſhewn in his Maſter's Service. For theſe three Years (as he told me from his own Mouth) he has diſcourſed almoſt twice every Day for three or four Hours together; not authoritatively, as a Miniſter; but as a private Perſon, exhorting his Chriſtian Brethren. He has been, I think, in ſeven Counties, and has made it his Buſineſs to go to Wakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to turn People from ſuch lying Vanities. Many Ale-houſe People, Fidlers, Harpers, <hi>&amp;c. (Demetrius</hi> like) ſadly cry out againſt him for ſpoiling their Buſineſs. He has been made the Subject of Numbers of Sermons, has been threatned with publick Proſecutions, and had Conſtables ſent to apprehend him. But GOD has bleſſed him with inflexible Courage: Inſtantaneous Strength has been communicated to him from above; and he ſtill continues to go on from conquering to conquer. He is of a moſt Catholic Spirit, loves all that love our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and therefore he is ſtiled by Bigots, <hi>a Diſſenter.</hi> He is contemned by all

                        </gap>rs. Many call, and own him as their ſpiritual Father, and, I believe, would lay down their Lives for his Sake. He diſcourſes generally in a Field; but at other Times in a Houſe, from a Wall, a Table, or any Thing elſe. He has eſtabliſhed near thirty Societies in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and ſtill his Sphere of Action is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged daily. <hi>He is full of Faith, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When I firſt ſaw him, my Heart was knit cloſely to him. I wanted to catch ſome of his Fire, and gave him the right Hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with my whole Heart. After I had ſaluted him, and given a warm Exhortation to a great Number of People, who followed me to the Inn, we ſpent the Remainder of the Evening in taking ſweet Counſel together, and telling one another what GOD had done for our Souls. My Heart was ſtill drawn out towards him more and more. A divine and ſtrong Sympathy ſeemed to be between us, and I was reſolved to promote his Intereſt with all my Might. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we took an Account of the ſeveral Societies, and agreed on ſuch Meaſures as ſeemed moſt conducive to promote the common Intereſt of our Lord. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, there ſeems to be a noble Spirit gone out into</hi> Wales; <hi>and I believe, e'er long there will be more viſible Fruits of it. What inclines me ſtrongly to think ſo is, that the Partition Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down, and Miniſters and Teachers of different

Communions, joyn with one Heart and one Mind to carry on the Kingdom of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. — <hi>The LORD make all the Chriſtian World thus minded. For till this is done, I fear, we muſt deſpair of any great Reformation in the Church of GOD.</hi> — After much comfortable and encouraging Diſcourſe with each other, we kneeled down and prayed, and great Enlargement of Heart GOD was pleaſed to give me in that Duty.</p>
                     <p>This done, we eat a little Supper, and then, after ſinging a Hymn, we went to Bed, praiſing and bleſſing GOD, for bringing us Face to Face. I doubt not but <hi>Satan</hi> envied our Happineſs. But, I hope, by the Help of GOD we ſhall make his Kingdom ſhake. GOD <hi>loves to do great Things by weak Inſtruments, that the Power may be of GOD, and not of Man.</hi>

But I cannot ſay their Arguments for omitting the outward Signs of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, and for having no outward Call to the Miniſtry, were at all convincing: However, they wiſhed me good Luck in the Name of the LORD, and we parted from each other very lovingly.

                        <hi>Friday, March</hi> 23. Dined with many Quakers at <hi>French-hay,</hi> who entertained me and my Friends with much Chriſtian Love; but we could by no means agree about the Diſuſe of the two outward Signs in the Sacrament, nor of their abſolute refuſing to pay Tithes. — But I think their Notions about walking and being led by the Spirit are right and good. <hi>I ſhould rejoyce to find all Quakers thus minded. Much Sincerity and Simplicity ſeems to be amongſt them. — But I think, at the ſame Time, they inſiſt ſo much upon the inward Life, they place too much Religion in their not uſing Externals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After Dinner, I went and preached at the <hi>Fiſh-ponds,</hi> as uſual, where were many Coaches, and about as great a Number of People as before. GOD gave me great Freedom and Power. I was longer than common both in my Prayers and Sermon. — Many, I believe, were affected. — After I came home, I viſited two Societies, where GOD was pleaſed to give us great Tokens of his Preſence; and the Way up to the laſt Room was ſo exceedingly thronged that I was obliged to go up by a Ladder through the Window.</p>

with their Mites, that I wanted ſomebody to hold up my Hands. — The Chearfulneſs with which they gave is inexpreſſible, and the many Prayers they joined with their Alms, I hope, will lay a good Foundation for the Houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be built. — After this, GOD brought me to ſome more of his own dear Children, and I ſpent the Remainder of the Evening in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to a Society, where almoſt all were drowned in Tears, when I mentioned my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to them. — <hi>The good LORD, ſend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body amongſt them to water what his own Right Hand hath planted.

                        <hi>Sunday, March</hi> 25. GOD <hi>will work, and who ſhall hinder?</hi> I am ſhut out of the Priſon, and my Siſter's Room was not large enough to contain a fourth part of the People who came to me on a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning. But GOD put it into the Hearts of ſome Gentlemen to lend me a large Bowling-Green, where I preached to about five Thouſand People, and made a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for my poor Orphans, till my Hands were quite weary. — <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> GOD, <hi>that the Bowling-Green is turned into a Preaching-place. This, I hope, is a Token that Aſſembly-rooms and Play-houſes will ſoon be put to the ſame Uſe. O may the Word of GOD be mighty to the pulling down of theſe ſtrong Holds of the Devil! All that love our Lord</hi> JESUS, <hi>I am ſure, will ſay,</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p>Preached at <hi>Hannam</hi> to a larger Congregation than ever, and preached again in the Afternoon to upwards (as was computed) of 23000 People.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:004453_0182_100DA0021B1EC3A8"/>
I was afterwards told, that thoſe who ſtood fartheſt off could hear me very plainly. <hi>Oh may</hi> GOD <hi>ſpeak to them by his Spirit, at the ſame Time that he enables me to lift up my Voice like a Trumpet!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About eight I went to the Society in <hi>Nicholas-ſtreet,</hi> I with great Difficulty, at laſt got up into the Room, which was extreamly hot. GOD enabled me to ſpeak with much Freedom and Power; and at the Cloſe of my Exhortation, I recommended a Charity-ſchool, which was opened by this Society to-day. I collected at the Door myſelf, and few paſſed by without throwing in their Mites. — <hi>Yet a little while, and I hope</hi> Briſtol <hi>will be as famous for Charity ſchools as</hi> London. <hi>We muſt not deſpiſe the Day of ſmall Things. Bleſſed be</hi> GOD, <hi>for the Strength of this Day. The Lord make me humbly thankful.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Monday, March</hi> 26. Still GOD has pleaſed to give me freſh Tokens of his Love. Letters are ſent me, and People come to me continually, telling me what GOD had done for their Souls by my unworthy Miniſtry.</p>
                     <p>At four in the Afternoon, I preached again at the <hi>Bowling-Green,</hi> to, I believe, ſeven or eight Thouſand People. The Sun ſhone bright, and the Windows and Balconies of the adjoining Houſes were filled with H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arers. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly enlarged in Prayer, and ſo carried out beyond myſelf in preaching, eſpecially when I came to talk of the Love and free Grace of JESUS CHRIST, that I heartily wiſhed it was in my Power that Moment to place all my Enemies
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:004453_0183_100DA0051DA8C9E8"/>
at the Right Hand of GOD. The Concern the People were in is inexpreſſible. — An hearty Groan goes through them all when any Thing affecting is ſpoken; and I am ſure, that Thouſands come not out of Curioſity, but a ſincere Deſire of being fed with the Milk of the Word — Afterwards, I again collected for the Orphan-houſe, and it was near an Hour and a half before the People could go out. Many were very faint becauſe of the Throng, which was ſo exceeding great, that they trod one upon another.</p>
                     <p>At eight I haſted to <hi>Weavers Hall,</hi> in <hi>Temple-ſtreet,</hi> which was procured me becauſe the Society Rooms were too little. I was almoſt faint before I could get in through the Croud; but GOD enabled me to ſpeak with uncommon Freedom, and was with us of a Truth. — I believe there might be a thouſand Hearers.— <hi>Well may the Devil and his Servants rage horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Their Kingdom is in Danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After I had done, I went to a Chriſtian Houſe, where many waited for me; and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Tueſday, March</hi> 27. At four this Afternoon, being invited ſeveral Times, I preached in a Yard belonging to the Glaſs-Houſes, where many dwell, who (as I was informed) neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation conſiſted of many Thouſands, and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:004453_0184_100DA00780B8AD58"/>
GOD enabled me to lay before them his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Promiſes; ſo that none might either deſpair or preſume. <hi>O that I may be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Wind was not ſo well ſet to carry the Voice as uſual; but however, I was ſtrengthened to cry aloud, and take my laſt Farewel.—As I was returning home, it comforted me exceedingly, to hear almoſt every one bleſſing me, and wiſhing me a good Voyage in the Name of the Lord.—And indeed my Heart is ſo knit to <hi>Briſtol</hi> People, that I could not with ſo much Submiſſion leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Wedneſday, April</hi> 8. Preached this Morning with Power, to a much larger Congregation than we had laſt Night. Several Servants of GOD ſaid, they never ſaw the like before.— Whilſt I was preaching, I ſaw the People melted into Tears, and, by their Looks, ſhewed that the Divine Preſence was amongſt them.— We ſhall ſee greater Things than theſe: For almoſt every Day Perſons of all Denominations come unto me, telling how they interceed in my Behalf. And it ſhall now be my particular Buſineſs, wherever I go, to bring all the Children of GOD, notwithſtanding their Differences, to rejoyce together. <hi>How dare we not converſe with thoſe that have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi>

As touching the Law, ſo far as outward Morality went, he was blameleſs; concerning Zeal, oppoſing the Church. My Proceedings he could not like, and he had once a Mind, he ſaid, to write againſt Mr. <hi>Law</hi>'s Enthuſiaſtic Notions in his <hi>Chriſtian Perfection.</hi> — But lately it has pleaſed GOD to reveal his dear Son in him, and to caſt him down to the Earth, as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> by eight Days Sickneſs; in which Time he ſcarce ever eat, or drank, or ſlept, and underwent great inward Agonies and Tortures. — After this, the Scales fell more and more from the Eyes of his Mind. — GOD ſent a poor travelling Woman, that came to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

preach CHRIST and thoſe Truths ſtraightway in every Synagogue, which once he endeavoured to deſtroy. — He is a Gentleman of a very large Fortune, which he has now devoted to GOD. And I write this, to ſhew how far a Man may go, and yet know nothing of JESUS CHRIST. — Behold, here was one who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended on the Means of Grace, exact in his Morals, humane and courteous in his Converſation, who gave much in Alms, was frequent in private Duties; and yet, till about ſix Weeks ago, as deſtitute of any ſaving expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, as thoſe on whom his Name was never called, and who ſtill ſit in Darkneſs, and the Shadow of Death. <hi>Bleſſed be GOD, that although not many rich, not many mighty, not many noble are called, yet</hi> ſome <hi>are. — Who would but be accounted a Fool for</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s ſake?

The ſtanding in the Judge's Place, and ſpeaking from thence, gave me awful Thoughts of GOD; and the Conſideration that I was ſpeaking in the Name of our great High Prieſt and Judge, animated me very much. <hi>Oh that I had a thouſand Tongues, they ſhould all be employed in his Service.</hi>

in Spirit to haſten hither, and now I found the Reaſon for it. For alas! the Enemy had got great Advantage over three of our Chriſtian Brethren, and driven them to deny CHRIST's viſible Church upon Earth. They had ſo far influenced and deluded Mr. <hi>Kinchin,</hi> a ſincere and humble Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, that I found, through their Perſuaſion, he had actually quitted his Fellowſhip, and intended to reſign his Living. — This, I muſt needs confeſs, gave me a great Shock: For I knew what dreadful Conſequences would attend a needleſs Separation from the eſtabliſhed Church.— As for my own Part, I can ſee no Reaſon for my leaving the Church, however I am treated by the corrupt Members and Miniſters of it: For I judge of the State of a Church, not from the Practice of its Members, but its primitive and public Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. — And ſo long as I think the Articles of the <hi>Church of England</hi> are agreeable to Scripture, I am reſolved to preach them up without either Bigotry or Party Zeal. — <hi>For I love all that love the</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>

of the Living at <hi>Savannah,</hi> which is in the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Dioceſe, a ſtronger Licence than that implicite one, by which Hundreds of the inferior Clergy are by his Lordſhip permitted to preach: However, for Peace Sake, I declined preaching in the Church; but after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Service was over, I preached in the Churchyard; being aſſured my Maſter now called me out here, as well as in <hi>Briſtol.</hi>— The ſecond Leſſon was <hi>Acts</hi> the xxiv. which contained the plauſible Speech <hi>Tertullus</hi> made againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> a Ringleader of the Sect of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> which GOD applied cloſely to my Heart.

                     <p>About Four in the Afternoon I was taken ill and deſerted, which I always look upon as a certain Preparative for ſome approaching Mercy. —And ſo this was; for after GOD had enabled me to preach to about Twenty Thouſand for above an Hour at <hi>Kennington,</hi> he inclined the Hearers Hearts to contribute moſt cheerfully and liberally towards the Orphan-Houſe. — I was one of the Collectors,—and it would have delighted any one to have ſeen with what Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cheerfulneſs the People came up both Sides the Eminence on which I ſtood, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Coach Doors to throw in their Mites. — Surely GOD muſt have touched their Hearts: —For when we came home, we found we had collected above Forty Seven Pounds, amongſt which were Sixteen Pounds in Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; for which we endeavoured to give hearty thanks. — GOD was pleaſed to pour into my Soul a great Spirit of Supplication, and a Senſe of his free diſtinguiſhing Mercies ſo filled me with Love, Humility, and Joy, and holy Confuſion, that I could at laſt only pour out my Heart before him in an awful Silence.—It was ſo full, that I could not well ſpeak. <hi>Oh the Happineſs of a Communion with</hi> GOD!</p>

                           <p>I received your Letter, which was a full Anſwer to my Queries, and give you my hearty Thanks for the Trouble you have taken upon you (the only Gratitude I can at preſent pay) but he, whom I have perfectly at Heart, will ſupply the Deficiency to you, and will not ſuffer a meritorious Act to go unrewarded.

But alas! they eſteemed my Friends as much mad as the young Man, and frankly told them, both I and my Followers, in their Opinion, were really beſides themſelves. My Friend <hi>Seward</hi> urged the
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:004453_0236_100DA0443B5AE688"/>
Example of the young Perſons, who called the Prophet that was ſent to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> King, a mad Fellow; — of our LORD, whom his own Relations, and the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> took to be mad, and beſides himſelf; — and <hi>Feſtus</hi>'s Opinion of <hi>St. Paul.</hi> — He further urged, that when young People were under their firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakenings, they were uſually tempted by the Devil to run into ſome Extremes. But all ſuch Language confirmed the Gentlemen more and more, that Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> was mad alſo. And to prove that the young Man was certainly mad, they called one of the Attendants, who ſaid, when Mr. <hi>Periam</hi> firſt came into the Place, he ſtripped himſelf to his Shirt, and prayed. — The Reaſon of this, as Mr. <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was, that he might i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In the midſt of the Conference, ſome Way or other, they mentioned his going to <hi>Georgia,</hi> and ſaid, if I would take him with me, they would engage that his Father ſhould give Leave to have him releaſed. — A Day or two after, Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> waited upon his Father, who gave his Son an excellent Character, and conſented to his going abroad. — After this, he waited upon the Doctor, who pronounced him well.— And to Day he waited again upon the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:004453_0237_100DA045D26EE328"/>
Committee, who behaved very civilly, and gave the young Man a Diſcharge.</p>
                     <p>He is now with me, and I hope will be an Inſtrument of doing good.— The Hardſhips he has indured at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> will, I hope, prepare him for what he muſt undergo abroad. — And being now not ignorant of <hi>Satan's</hi> Devices, he will be better qualified to prevent his getting an Advantage over others. Before I leave my Account of him, I cannot help telling what Uſage he met with at his firſt coming into <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem.</hi>— Being ſenſible within himſelf, that he wanted no bodily Phyſick, he was unwilling at firſt to take it; upon which, four or five took hold of him, curſed him moſt heartily, put a Key into his Mouth, threw him upon the Bed, and ſaid (though I had then never ſeen or heard of him) <hi>you are one of Whitefield's Gang,</hi> and ſo drenched him. — I hear alſo, that there was an Order given, that neither I, or any of my Friends, ſhould be permitted to come unto him. <hi>Good GOD! how ſhortly will that Day come when theſe unhappy Men ſhall be heard to cry out,</hi>
                        <q>We Fools counted their Lives Madneſs, and their Ends to be without Honour! How are they num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the Children of GOD! How is their Lot among the Saints!</q>

Chriſtian lay under to have ſome particular Calling, whereby he may be a uſeful Member of the Society to which he belongs. — We all agreed to this unanimouſly; as for my own Part, I think, if a Man will not labour, neither ought he to eat. <hi>To be ſo intent on purſuing the one Thing needful, as to neglect providing for thoſe of our own Houſholds, in my Opinion, is to be Righteous overmuch.</hi>
