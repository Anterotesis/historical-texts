            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have here another Attempt to confute the great Errors of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> wherein, I think, ſufficient is ſaid to make it appear to any ſerious and conſiderate Perſon, <hi>That that People are not led by the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they do ſo plainly, and it muſt be added ſo prophanly deny the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003489_0004_0FF84C420C68C5E8"/>I. They deny that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in the outward Elements of them, <hi>Water, Bread and Wine,</hi> are Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And yet it is here made plain and Evident from the expreſs Words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With Reſpect to Baptiſm, that Water and the Spirit are joyned together, and both made neceſſary to our Regeneration: And what Chriſt has joyned together, <hi>Joh. iii 5.</hi> let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Man preſume to put aſſunder.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the Apoſtles underſtood outward Water to be commanded, by their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſing of it, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Phillip</hi> did, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> allow, and yet pretend it is not neceſſary: Do they think, that the Apoſtles would have uſed Water, if they had not thought it neceſſary? Would they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to do it, if they had not been aſſured it was the Mind and Will of their Maſter, that it ſhould be done.</p>
            <p>And as Chriſt joyned Water and the Spirit <hi>Joh. iii 5.</hi> to St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns <hi>The Waſhing of
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003489_0005_0FF84C44E1CA9AB0"/>Regeneration</hi> with <hi>The Renewing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Tit. iii 5.</hi> which muſt mean Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Water in Baptiſm, joyned with the Sanctificaticn of the Spirit; For to ſay that by <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Waſhing of Regeneration</hi> is meant the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Renewing of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> where the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> are mentioned at the ſame Time, is to make Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpeak Nonſence; for it makes them ſay, <hi>We muſt be born of the Spirit, and of the Spirit: We muſt be renewed by the Holy Ghoſt, and by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Which is ridiculous. The Quakers therefore are very Prophane in making Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpeak Nonſence, and in ſeparating what they have joyned together, and in making that needleſs which Chriſt has made neceſſary, who ſo evidently required both <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the <hi>Spirtt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. With Reſpect to the Lord's Supper, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can he plainer, than that we are requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Eat Bread</hi> and <hi>Drink Wine,</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt's Death, litereally</hi> as well as <hi>ſpiritually:</hi> For the Quakers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves don't deny but that Chriſt adminiſtred
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003489_0006_0FF84C4736441AE8"/>the outward Elements: And it is clear, that be commanded expreſsly ſaying. <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi> Luk. xxii 19. Yet the Quakers reject this Command of Chriſt, and will not do it in Remembrance of him. They allow that St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant outward <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> whereby we are <hi>to ſhew forth Chriſt's Death till he come,</hi> and then ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly pretend he was not yet come ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though he had long before ſent his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to 'em: And on the other Hand they ſay, he is now long ſince come, though that Text evidently means his coming to <hi>Judgment,</hi> and can be meant of nothing elſe, ſince he was long before that come both perſonally and ſpiritually: Yet they, I doubt willfully, ſhut their Eves and ſay they will not ſhew forth the Lord's Death by that outward Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Thus Water Baptiſm and the Supper of Bread and Wine are as plainly required as Words can make them; and I defy the <hi>Quakers</hi> to ſhew in what Words, they could have been more plainly expreſſed, if it had been Chriſt's Deſign to command them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003489_0007_0FF84C48CB833848"/>In ſhort, I think it muſt be very plain to any unprejudiced Perſon, that by the ſame Method of Interpreting Scripture as they uſe againſt Water Baptiſm, and Bread and Wine, they may Interpret away all the Doctrines of Chriſt, and even his own Humane Nature of Fleſh and Flood it ſelf, and may ſay that it was all only ſpiritual, and there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne but a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that be only <hi>died ſpiritually,</hi> as that Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper are only ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: and thus indeed <hi>George Fox,</hi> their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Teacher firſt taught. And then where is Chriſtianity? It is all Deluſion and nothing but parable and Allegory; but dreadfull deluſions theſe are. Let therefore every ſerious Perſon beware of the fatal Tendency of theſe Doctrines that deny the literal Meaning of theſe plain Commands of Chriſt, of Water Baptiſm and Bread and Wine. for,</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is plain that ſince they deny theſe expreſs Commands of Chriſt, what ever they pretend they are not led by the Spirit of Chriſt;for his Spirit would teach them, that they are his Laws and that they muſt be Obedient to them, if they would be ſaved: Inſtead of which they make a mere Mock of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:003489_0008_0FF84C4AF82BAF38"/>Let therefore the people of God diligently read what is here offered, and take care not to be deceived by theſe Seducers, who would tempt them to deny their Baptiſm, and conſequently to deny Chriſt by denying his ſacred Laws and Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>tually</p>
            <p>I HAVE taken no Notice of <hi>James Mott's</hi> Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii 21. becauſe I ſaw no Argument in it; but am ſince told, that Paragraph is reckoned by 'em the fineſt flower in his Book; and therefore I will offer a Word or two upon it in this Place. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, v. 20. — <hi>Fight Souls were ſaved by Water. v.</hi> 21. <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ike Figure whereunto Baptiſm doth now ſave us. James Mott ſays, The Water of Noah's Flood was ſent to deſtroy, and not to ſave. That it was the Ark that was ſaving, and the Water deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I refer to his Book, without reciting the whole Paſſage, p. 11, 12. From whence I conclude he would infer, that what <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were ſaved by, was no Type of Water Baptiſm, becauſe the Type was not <hi>Water,</hi> but <hi>the Ark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if <hi>James</hi> had been a very little learned in the <hi>Greek,</hi> he might have found out that nothing in all that 15 <hi>vers</hi> could be pitched upon for the Type but the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which Baptiſm is expreſsly called the Antitype, for in the Original it is <note n="†" place="bottom">Omega</note> 
               <hi>HO ANTELUPON BAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISMA</hi> rendered <hi>The like Figure whereunto Baptiſm, &amp;c. HO</hi> being a Relative of the Neuter, muſt have an Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the ſame Gender in the preceeding Verſe, which can't be the Ark, for that is Feminine, but the Water only, which is Neuter. So that St <hi>Peter</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant <hi>that Water</hi> as a Type of Baptiſm, and not the Ark: And if he did not ſpeak Senſe, <hi>J. Mott</hi> muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute it with him.</p>
            <p>BUT it is ſufficient for me to obſerve, that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſtrained himſelf for the Alluſion, by ſo much the Stronger is the Argument for Water Baptiſm,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:003489_0012_0FF84C53B745A880"/>since Water is expreſsly mentioned as the Type, even at the Riſque of his own Reputation, if the Quakers muſt ſtand Expoſitors.</p>
            <p>AND when <hi>J. Mott</hi> in the ſame Paragraph expounds the Reſurrection of Chriſt, to be a ſpiritual raiſing up of Chriſt in the Soul: What ſhall we think he deſigns to make of the moſt demonſtrative Prove of our Religion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And he will do well to tell us. how he will allegoriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the following Words. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right Hand of God</hi> &amp;c. If the Reſurrection be ſpiritual and inward, the Aſcenſion muſt be ſo too. The Evidences of our Religion would ſoon be demoliſhed, if they were left to theſe ignorant Allegorizers. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have no Occaſion for ſuch Evidences; if it will ſerve only to turn Men's Minds inward, to ſuch Manifeſtations as may be found there, without any Thing outward: For whatever they pretend of other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not preach ſuch Doctrine, Chriſt referred Men to his Works, as the fulleſt Proofs of his Doctrine; and the Apoſtles preached the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, that God raiſed him up, not in their Hearts, but out of the Grave.</p>
            <p>BUT I will now add no further upon this, but only ask <hi>J. Mott,</hi> what he imagines St. <hi>Peter</hi> would think if he was now upon Earth, to find his own plain eaſy Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thus wreſted by the <hi>Unlearned and U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> ſays, <hi>are ſome Things hard to be underſtood?</hi> His Schollar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip carried him ſometimes above vulgar Capacities, but little did the plain Fiſherman think, his Writings ſhould meet with the ſame Fate, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii 16.</p>
            <p>I SHOULD have added ſome things farther in the Dialogues, but found them ſwell to a Bulk faſter than
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:003489_0013_0FF84C55DBAD6360"/>expected; perhaps I may find Occaſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſpeak the Words of Truth in Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and aſſert nothing but ſuch plain Facts as are known to every Body, and if you deſire it I will bring plentiful Proof of 'em. It is very hard Men muſt be called Railers, for ſaying of People that are openly and boldly wicked, <hi>that they are ſo.</hi> That the Quaker Teachers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Men that have been exceſſively wicked, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious, and debauched, needs no Proof but their own publick Confeſſions, from Time to Time. And as to others that turn <hi>Quakers</hi> and become firſt and foremoſt in the Herd, you and I can tell of our own Knowledge, ſo far as we are acquainted, that they are People that have lived
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003489_0018_0FF84C60C3D88710"/>without God in the World, People that never had any ſerious Sence of their Duty to God, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Religion; that never lived up to what they profeſſed to believe; whoſe Irreligion and Wickedneſs has been the greateſt Scandal, to the Religion they were rekoned of: Theſe Things <hi>Tremulus</hi> you know as well as I, to be ſorrowful Truths: And if you want more Proof, I will call them in directly.</p>

                  <p>Thou need'ſt not call Evidences, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what thou intendeſt, and I don't deny the Matter; many ſerious good People are Converts from a State of Irreligion and Wickedneſs; and our Teachers often tell us their Experiences, how very wicked their Hearts and Lives were, before it pleaſed God to pour his Spirit mightily, upon them, which led them into the Way thou call'ſt <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>

But beſides, ſhe was very remiſs and negligent for a long time, in attending that Worſhip of God which ſhe believed it her Duty to be conſtant and unmoveable in: And when People grow careleſs and negligent of their Duty to God, and more and more remiſs, inſtead of improving and growing in Grace, it is no wonder if God abandon them to Error and Deluſion.</p>

                  <p>This was undoubtedly a Ground of her Remiſſneſs and Neglect; and we may well think it almost unaoidable that it ſhould be ſo: But if People vountarily put themſelves into a State of unavoidable Temptation, they have no Ground to depend upon God's Grace, to preſerve them from Error and Wickedneſs. Religion, being the Means of our Eternal Salvation and Happineſs in the Fruition of God, ſhould be our chiefeſt Care and Concern; and no Wordly Intereſt or Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould induce us to put our ſelves under Diſadvantage in this reſpect: And for a Woman eſpecially, to diſpoſe of herſelf for Life ſo as to put herſelf voluntarily under ſuch a Clogg and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſment in the Affairs of Religion, ſhews, that her Care for her Body, is greater then that for her Soul, which is a great Wickedneſs: This one Care St. <hi>Paul</hi> recommends above all others in Chriſtans marrying, that it ſhould be with thoſe of their own Religion: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii 39. <hi>She is at liberty to marry to whom ſhe will, but only in the Lord.</hi>

But when we ſee by what Steps, they had prepared and ripened them ſelves for Vengeance, it will be no Matter of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to find them abandoned by God, and given over to the ſtrongeſt Deluſions; that is, permitted to the power of the Devil, to be actuated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by him, ſo as to become his mere Tools and Engines in ſeducing others, who are in the like preparatary Dipſoſitions; thus filling up the I leaſure of their Wickedneſs, they become Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Deſtruction.</p>

For tho' ſome Sinners by the Grace of God become true Penitents, yet great Wickedneſs is ſo far from recommending Men to God's ſpecial Favour, that on the contrary, it gives Ground to expect his ſevere Judgment, and Dereliction in Error, when Men perſiſt long in their Wickedneſs and Irreligion, after proper Means and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities afforded them for their Conviction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming.

                  <p>It was never the Work of God's Spirit, but the whims of Quakers Brains, to call any mere internal Action or Motion <hi>Chriſtian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> or the Baptiſm that Chriſt has inſtituted in his Church: This is a device of their own.

Such Men may feel Motions and inward Impulſes, but they come rather from the Devil than from the Spirit of God.

                  <p>Thus while they are teaching outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and preſcribing Men's Duty in the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Part, they juggle them into a Belief, that they have no outward Teaching, but all is in ward and from Gods Spirit, and not from any Man; and certainly all the Labours of all your Teachers are wholy uſeleſs upon this Principle; but the Matters of Fact are falſe, and you cannot but know them ſo; they depend upon outward Teachings as much as others.

and receive. If all Men have a Light or Spirit within them, teaching them all Things, why don't they leave them to that Teaching? or elſe why do they impoſe ſuch Falſhoods upon the World, that they depend upon an inward Spirit, and turn People to that, and not to outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men?

And though they perſwade them againſt ſome outward Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we believe and teach to be neceſſary, yet they have outward Performances of their own inſtead of them; they pretend to pray as loud as other People, and hold forth their Principles and teaching with a Voice that may be heard with outward Ears, without being in 'em; they have Weekly Meetings, and Monthly and Yearly &amp; Quarterly, according as the Sun paſſeth through the ſeveral Signs in the <hi>Zodiak:</hi> Thus they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Times and Seaſons, Days and Months and Quarters, according to their own wicked Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, honouring their own Traditions above the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003489_0046_0FF84C9CE5C6A780"/>
inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf: For though an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſanctifying Work of the Spirit upon the Soul be neceſſary, as we believe and teach, yet out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Worſhip and Honour are required of us, and the Inſtructions of holy Scriptures are neceſſary to eſtabliſh our Faith and direct our Practice, and for the explaining and enforcing theſe, Chriſt has appointed his Miniſters, who ought to be received as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and their Buſineſs is to teach Men the Way of Salvation, which no ways hinders the Teaching of God's Spirit in the Hearts of his faithful People, but cooperates with it. And ſo far as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers labour to ſet aſide the Uſe and Neceſſity of ſuch outward Teaching, they impeach the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and take part with the Devil, who would gladly overthrow the whole Chriſtian Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy.</p>

themſelves into ſuch a ſtupid State of Expectancy, with a perſwaſion that the firſt ſudden Impreſſion upon their Minds will then certainly come from Chriſt, and be a Motion of his Spirit, they have delivered up themſelves to the Power of the Devil, in the moſt eſſectual manner that can be; for, as they have no reaſon to think that Chriſt will thus dart Impreſſions upon their Minds, ſo they may be aſſured the Devil will be ready to do it, when he has an Opportunity of being received as Chriſt himſelf, and thus to have the Advantage of Guiding them as he pleaſeth; and we may well think he has Craft enough to carry on the Juggle, when he is entred ſo fairly, by inſinuating that all is for the Glory of God, and Benefit of their Souls to which he is leading them: This is the moſt effectual Deluſion. —</p>

                  <p>We allow, and our Miniſters Preach the Neceſſity of an inward Work of the Spirit as much as any People can do, and our Uſe for Water in Baptiſm, as it is deſigned to ſignify this, can be no more Hindrance thereto than our Savour's uſing outward Water with a ſpiritual Significancy, in the Inſtance we mentioned but now; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may ſee <hi>J.

But whatever Neceſſity there is of an inward Work of the Spirit, in order to Mens being ſaved eternally, yet thoſe Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Tempers, be they what they will, that are thereby wrought in us, are never meant by the Word Baptiſm in ſcripture.</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> only obſerves, that it was an Argument with him to admit the Gentiles to the Priviledge of Baptiſm with Water, becauſe he ſaw that Chriſt had accepted them, by beſtowing the ſame Gift upon them that he had beſtowed upon the Diſciples at firſt, which was in fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his gracious Promiſe; this he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and when he ſaw the like ſpecial Favour granted to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſe, he could not but think them worthy to be admitted into the Society of Chriſt's Church, by that Baptiſm Chriſt had inſtituted, which was with water. In all theſe Places there is not one Word ſaid of Chriſt's Inſtituting Spirit Baptiſm, as you call it, or that the Apoſtles underſtood the Baptiſm Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to be ſpiritual without Water.</p>

                  <p>According to the literal Signification of the Word Baptize, it implies an outward applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which can't be underſtood of any Thing but Water, eſpecially conſidering Water was then made uſe of in Baptiſm. <hi>Baptizing</hi> ſignifies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Waſhing</hi> or <hi>Immerſion,</hi> thus our Savious ſays, the <hi>Jews</hi> held <hi>the Waſhing of Cups and Platters, Mark.</hi> vii 4.

In the firſt Chapter of this ſame Epiſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> finding Fault with the Party-Names and Diviſions among them, uſeth this Argument to convince them they ought to be united and o di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into parties, that they were not baptized into the Names of thoſe after whom they called themſelves, particularly to thoſe that ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> to diſtinguiſh themſelves from thoſe who ſaid they were of <hi>Apollos</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> he fars to them.

firey Tongues overſhadowing them; and there was nothing called Baptizing with the holy Ghoſt without this miraculous Appearance, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhall ſee this upon a Congregation of Quakers, accompanied with the ſame inward Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as we read <hi>Act.</hi> ii. we will conclude they have been baptized by Chriſt himſelf with the holy Ghoſt and with Fire, and will take this for ſuch a clear Proof of Chriſt's accepting their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that none forbid Water that they may receive the Baptiſm Chriſt has inſtituted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title Men to the Priviledges of his Church, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> argues in the Caſe of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> but if after that they ſhould refuſe Water, I ſhould ſay of them, <hi>they have received the Grace of God in vain:</hi> But what is the Work which the Quakers call Repentance and Converſion in Compariſon of the viſible Deſcent of the holy Ghoſt? It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, nor have they any Thing among them that ever had the Name of Baptiſm in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo far are they from the Conditions of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi 16.</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhew forth he Lord's Death till he come; I ſuſpect the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers realty believe no coming of Chriſt but what 7. <hi>Mott</hi> calls in Spirit in them, nor no Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt but in their Souls. And if Chfiſt is not to come bodily and viſibly, then neither did he aſcend viſibly and bodily; and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of making theſe Things merely ſpiritual and allegorical (if the Quakers do ſo) is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Foundation of our Hope, and make the Apoſtles all Lyars, and the Faith of Chriſtians all vain. But let J. Mott for once be in the Right, if by Paſſovcr he means the Supper of the Lord, out Saviour celebrated it with his Diſciples to ſhew they ſhould ſeed upon his Body and Blood ſpiritually, when he ſhould be ſpiritually in them. And certainly for a Maſter to do a Thing before the Eyes of his Servants, to ſhew them hew to do it, is a very proper familar and eaſy Way of Inſtructing, and thus indeed we believe our bleſted Saviour taught his Diſciples what he in tended they ſhoul]dl do in order to make a ſhew or Memorial of his Death: But would not any Body think then. they ought to do as they were ſhewd? Which was to perfrom an outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003489_0079_0FF84CE707B60F60"/>
with a ſpiritual Signification. And without ſuch outward Action, they never can do as they were ſhewed. And it is very plain that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Church of Chriſt ever ſince, have obſerved our Lord's Direction in this Point, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome Popiſh Corruptions which our Church hath reformed according to the primitive Model) and eſpecially may we find plain Inſtruction in this Mater from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Directions to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> whom he commends for obſerving the Ordinances as he had delivered 'em to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi 2. And though in reſpect to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he finds Fault with ſcme Irregularities in their manner of Celebration, yet he is ſo far from intimating an Indifference as to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf, that he aſſerts the Divine Inſtitution <hi>v.</hi> 23. And what he had received in Command from Chriſt. lie goes on to relate to them, which is an outward taking the Bread and Cup, and after giving Thanks and Bleſſing, to bid them all real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cat and Drink, to ſhe forth the Lord's Death, which as he exhorts them to <hi>v.</hi> 26, 28. ſo in the preceeding Chapter he relates ſuch Effects and Benefits of receiving theſe outward Symbols of Chriſt's Body and Blood, as muſt certainly prove an Inſtitution of perpetual Uſe and Neceſſity, 1 Cor. x 16, 17. <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we breaks, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? For we

                  <p>The Epiſtles to the ſeveral Churches were adapted to ſome particuler Emergencies, and we are not to imagin, they contain all Inſtructions the Apoſtles gave to theſe Churches; but as they preached one Religion every where, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whatever is delivered as Chriſtian Doctrine or Inſtitution to one Church, the ſame was taught in all the reſt, and particular as to this Epiſtle, we find that all Chriſtians in every Place are concerned in the Contents of it, it is a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Epiſtle, directed to the <hi>Corinthians, with all that in every Place call on the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i 2. And the Benefits of this Inſtitution here mentioned are ſuch as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for all Chriſtians, and therefore the Celebration a Duty for all; and accordingly we read that the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> ii 24.
