            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But some ingenious and well meaning Persons having employ'd their Pens that way, from the generous Motives and Views of promoting the publick Good, I perswade my self 'tis a good Omen and Presage of the future Happiness of a Country, especially when it appears in private Persons, who for the most Part may be presum'd to be free from the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass of sinister Interest; whereas publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Publick, and which they too often sacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice, to the great Damage, if not Ruin thereof.</p>
            <p>But since nothing of what has been wrote on this Subject, has been so publick and common as is necessary to render it of publick Service and Advantage; and considering Trade is of the last Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Good and Prosperity of any Country, and how much it has languish'd for divers Years past in the Colonies ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Delaware</hi>; insomuch that Trade not only sunk, but most of the middling People, and divers good House-keepers, as well as the inferiour Rank labour'd under inextricable Difficulties, Silver and Gold the only Legal Currency, being almost totally exhausted, or kept up, that thro' the Scarcity thereof, the Farmer to pay a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this present Year 1724. It may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to enable divers Inhabitants on both Sides the River to engage in Foreign Trade which will not only be our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Relief, but a Means to restore us to our former flourishing Condition by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing and encreasing our foreign as well as Domestick Trade, which is what only can compleat ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These Thoughts of late have been the Subject of my serious Deliberation; and indeed I have been sorrowfully affected when I have considered that this River which was settled with a sober, religious and industrious People, who were of no mean Circumstances in their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, should be so soon reduc'd to so low a Condition as of late we were; which how to retreive in Time is the Design and

            <p>In Order thereunto, 'twill be necessary to consider what the true Riches of any Country does consist in, or whence we may be truly denominated rich or wealthy, that so we may not amuse our selves with Chimerical Notions or imaginary Riches in a Matter of so great Importance as our present Happiness, and of that of our Posterity, in which we shall observe some Methods the better to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.

For I just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly date the Fall of Flour from the Time of the Farmer becoming Boulters; but this only by the bye.</p>
            <p>But to return. The Manufacturing of all our Wheat is rather to be wished than expected, for when far greater Quantities of Wheat were exported than of late, we had sufficient to manufacture and supply all our Plantations in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; and those Markets of late have been glutted to that Degree, that the Merchant and Boulter complain of Loss there as well as the Farmer by the low Price here, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Numbers of Estates that were encumbred, tho' many but for small Debts from which they could not extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves till the Expedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Value of the Produce, Land will rise, and be more valuable, which is what must make these Provinces really rich, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we are but nominally so, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we might have a Million of Paper-Money.</p>
            <p>From these Considerations, proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ought to be thought on to advance the Price of Wheat, and to enable the Farmer to live; for if he sinks, at long Run, all sinks. 'Tis by his Labour as already observ'd, Trade must be support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Land render'd valuable: The Merchants Interest is inseparable from the Farmers; and if he cannot make an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by raising of Grain, he'll make the less, and endeavour to cloath himself without much Use of their Stores or Shops. And if the Chain of mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is broken, twill be the Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of both: Therefore we offer an Expedient which will be the Advantage and Encouragement of the Trader and Farmer, whose Interest we shall imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally regard in Prosecution of this Essay.</p>
            <p>We humbly propose to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002697_0021_0FE5F23023388290"/>
the Legislative Authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces on <hi>Delaware,</hi> that a Bounty of <hi>per</hi> Bushel be paid for all Wheat which shall be exported to any Parts of the Continent of <hi>Europe;</hi> as to <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Italy</hi> is a Market for that Species. By this Means Encouragement will be given to find out new Markets: The Bounty to be raised by a Land-Tax, or a Duty on Rum, or as the Honourable Assemblies may think fit. Tho it may be objected, that the Country cannot bear a Land-Tax, yet 'tis not to be doubted but as by this Means there will less Quantities be sent to the Islands, this will abate the Glut, and consequently what goes, will fetch the better Price. Hence the Country may easily bear a Land-Tax, when most probably they will be re im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd by the Advance of the Price of that Grain to what of late it has been, or in Reason can be expected, whilst the <hi>West Indies</hi> is the only Markets we depend on, where the Markets for our Country-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of late has been so low that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ballance with them with all our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as already <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having this further to offer to mature Consideration on this Branch; That whereas all Ships bound hither from <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> come empty, or in their Ballast, this is a dead Weight to the Adventurer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merchant or Owners, and Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Navigation; for by this Means unless Wheat sells high, we have no Encouragement to send, having no Prospect of Advantage by Returns, which frequently helps a bad Market. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we humbly propose to their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies the Governours of these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to use their Instances at home, with his Majesty our Sovereign King <hi>George,</hi> that he would be graciously pleased to permit all <hi>English</hi> Bottoms carrying Wheat to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to return back with Salt into this River; and this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will be no ways detrimental to the Navigation of <hi>Great Britain</hi> (to which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002697_0023_0FE5F23A95646120"/>
we shall propose nothing injurious) for by this Opportunity the <hi>British</hi> Traders will be on an equal Foot with the <hi>Baltick</hi> Traders, who by Loading home Salt, on which they are sure of making a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Voyage, have the Advantage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derselling what Wheat goes from hence, since otherwise the Profit of the Voyage solely depends on the Exports, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by Returns.</p>
            <p>This we take to be the only Means to advance the Price of Grain which of late has been so low, that the Farmer has been reduc'd to the Brink of Ruin, and which will be his inevitable Fate without some timely Remedy.

            <p>This Consideration induces us to hope and expect their continued Endeavours to exert themselves on an Occasion so conducive to the Benefit and Prosperity of the People they govern, especially, as we just now observed, that the Thing proposed will be no Disadvantage or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Trade and Navigation of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to which we know these Gentlemen have a constant due Regard, and are not known to deviate from the Instructions transmitted to them, relating
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002697_0026_0FE60C3B91DA5FA0"/>
to Navigation and Trade. This we think is not an unnecessary Digression.</p>
            <p>But to return to this Branch of our Trade: We have this Caution to propose relating to the Bounty; that it be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any <hi>New-England</hi> Vessels trading here; for we not being so well situate for Trade, lying so far up a River, they will fetch our Wheat, manufacture it, and send it to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> continue the Glut of that Market, and under-sell us, which will frustrate the Good End here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intended. The same Caution may be observed with respect to the <hi>Madera, Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and other Western Islands, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose very much on the <hi>English</hi> Trade, tho' we have less Need of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities than they have of ours; also the Returns being Wine, the Merchant has the Opportunity of advancing on his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Case of a low Market for Grain. The proposed Bounty therefore ought to be for such Grain only as is exported to the Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> in Order as has been said to find out new Markets to prevent cloying the <hi>Caribbees.</hi> And that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002697_0027_0FE60C3E2076F578"/>
this may not be thought an impertinent Proposal, we have the Example of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to warrant us in this very Case, whose Example, as has been observed, we may safely copy after, who by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <note n="*" place="bottom">12 <hi>Car.</hi> II.14 <hi>idem.</hi>

It were to be wished it were retrieved by brewing of what is very good, tho' it cost the more; but 'tis to be fear'd that

to be encouraged by a Bounty, whether it be manufactured here or exported, in both which Respects it will much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Advantage and Benefit of these Countries, not only by imploying Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by what is manufactured for the River Use, but as it is proper Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and fit to make Returns, which will help very much towards a Ballance with <hi>England</hi>; for, by how much soever is made into Cordage here, our Demands thence will be the less, and the Surplusage will supply so far our Wants of other Goods. And the more Species of Growths we have to employ our Land, the more it will enhance the Value thereof which renders us the richer: And tho' here is not much Land proper for raising Hemp without chargeable man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p n="3">
               <q>3. Whereas if you make Returns in Melasses, as the Cost is far less, so the more will the Ballance be in your Favour, and consequently the more <hi>European</hi> Goods, Silver or Gold, will be brought home for Ballance, or Bil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to which it may be added, that it will give us the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of other new Markets among
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002697_0043_0FE60C69D3BDD158"/>
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Settlements, from whom we have Melasses at a very cheap Rate, and will be not one Quarter the Cost of Rum, which, how far the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance may be in our Favour, is obvious to every intelligent Reader.</p>
            <p>RICE is another Specie of Grain, this Country is capable of, which grows and thrives very well here on new Land, with no other Tillage than what Barley requires, and is sown after the same Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which is easier, and with less tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than in <hi>Carolina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Mankind are rational Creatures, and as such are most adapted for Society, Commerce and Dealing, so Providence seems to have decreed various Climates for different Productions of Nature for a mutual Intercourse and Dependance on each other by exchanging the Growth of one Country with another, which is the Foundation of Traffick and Dealing. But in Case we were to raise that Grain here, it would in some Measure break that Chain of Intercourse and Dealing betwixt us and them. Therefore tis rather
<pb n="45"
                   facs="unknown:002697_0044_0FE60C940E7F3E20"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be desir'd, that we should purchase that Specie of them, if upon an equal Foot, as they do the Produce of our Province from us: But <hi>Carolina</hi> is very ungenerous in this Case, for tho' we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose nothing on their Rice, Pitch, Tarr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all comes free into this River; yet they clogg our Beer and Flour with exorbitant Duties. For these Reasons it would not be amiss for us to endeavour the making of Rice here, unless they will permit the Produce of our Province exported among 'em to be free, as we do their Imports here. And it were to be wish'd, that as the Government at home have past Acts for the universal Rates of Silver in <hi>America</hi>; so if all the Ports in <hi>America</hi> were free to all <hi>British</hi> Subjects, we conceive it would very much advance Trade and Navigation in general.</p>
            <p>THE other Things propos'd as Matter for Trade, come under the general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament of spontaneous Productions, of which the Principal is Timber, which tho' of little Value as it stands in the Woods,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002697_0045_0FE60C69E360C340"/>
by Labour it may be rendred and made valuable by the Artist for Domestick Use by the Cooper, Joyner, Turner, House-Carpenter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is proper to make Returns for <hi>England,</hi> either gross, as large Pines for Masts for Ships, which tho' cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome and bulky the more it employs Ships and promotes Navigation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to render it yet of more Value and fit for Merchandize, is by converting it into Cooper's Timber and Plank of several Sorts, not only for Domestick Uses as are proper to employ Artificers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Value will be augmented by the Labour of divers of the Inhabitants, but for Exportation, which will also promote Navigation.</p>
            <p>This may be done at all convenient Places by erecting Mills. For this we have two large Rivers, namely <hi>Dell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h with vast Quantities, being easily sent down either by Flotes or Rafts at a small Charge; <hi>West-Jersey</hi> being stor'd with Pine for Boards and Ship Timber, and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002697_0046_0FE60C7094718158"/>
their Clay-bottom Swamps with noble Timber for Keels and Plank, not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any in <hi>America.</hi> And their Cedar Swamps in Time will be a Treasure: Their Pine also is proper for Pitch, Tar, Rozin, as well as Boards, not to omit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Products of this River, <hi>viz.</hi> Beef, Pork, Butter, Cheese, Bread and Flour which are Staple Merchandize.</p>
            <p>Another spontaneous Production of Nature, of which we have a doubtful Prospect of, is Copper, in the Search whereof much Labour, Time and Cost has been spent, as also on Metals of a superiour Value; for strong is the Power of Imagination, that every glistering Stone was thought Gold, and every glaring Thing Silver. But</p>
            <p>IRON the most useful of all spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Production comes next under Consideration. From Experiments made, we have great Plenty, and very good, both for Ship-Work and Husband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002697_0047_0FE60CC5CF8C50F0"/>No one Metal is so universally service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and useful to Mankind: For tho' Nature has furnish'd us with Hands, which a great Philosopher has stil'd <hi>The Instrument of Instruments,</hi> how much should we fall short of these excellent Uses and Services Nature has adapted them to, were we deprived or ignorant of this excellent Metal, the Natives here are pregnant Instances thereof.</p>
            <p>The judicious <hi>Locke</hi> observes of what Consequence
<q>the Discovery of one natural Body and its Properties may be to humane Life, the whole great Continent of <hi>America</hi> is a convincing Instance; whose Ignorance in useful Arts, and Want of the greatest Part of the Conveniences of Life, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that abounded with all Sorts of Natural Plenty, I think may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to their Ignorance of what may be found in a very ordinary despicable Stone, I mean the Mineral of Iron, and whatever we think of our Parts and Improvement in this Part of the World, where Knowledge and Plenty
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002697_0048_0FE60C70A2C9D2A0"/>
seem to vie each with other; yet to any one that will seriously reflect on it, I suppose, it will appear past Doubt, that were the Use of Iron lost among us, we should in a few Ages be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably reduced to the Want and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the ancient savage <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> whose natural Endowments and Provisions, come no Way short of those of the most flourishing and polite Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that he who first made known the Use of that once contemptible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, may be truly stiled <hi>The Father of Arts and the Author of Plenty.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To which we shall add this further Observation in Praise of the Usefulness and universal Benefit of it to Mankind, namely its Magnetism, to which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is owing the Discovery of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> to the <hi>Europeans</hi>; for how is it possible a Course could be directed thro' the vast Atlantick Ocean without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, since Navigation was so difficult to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in their narrow Seas? It may not be an idle Speculation to the curious to consider those admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002697_0049_0FE60C71B26BCE70"/>
Qualities of sympathetical Attraction, and Antipathetical Repulsion of the Load-stone, which is a Species of Iron. And here we shall conclude with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Manufactury of Iron will employ such a Number of People as will be Consumers of Provision and <hi>English</hi> Goods, as well as Timber, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent lies so remote from great Rivers, that in clearing of Land great Quantities are burnt to waste, which now by being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred useful on this Occasion, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come valuable, and consequently will proportionably augment the Value of Lands.</p>
            <p>This will vastly contribute to the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of these Countries, we having Plenty of Oak, at least twelve Sorts, tho' the best is that which grows in Clay-Swamps, its Leaf form'd much like the Chesnut, but not so large, for the most Part grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tall, is, (as remark'd) fit for Keels and Plank, with crooked Timber which chiefly grows on Up-Land, (of which White-Oak is the best) being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Matter for building of Ships. In like
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002697_0050_0FE60C71C61DA0C8"/>
Manner, if we attain to Plenty of Iron, we are capable to carry on the Hull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Foreign Materials, as also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Tackle and Rigging with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas for Sails. Of what immense Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this will be to <hi>America,</hi> is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any one the least skill'd in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Affairs. And we flatter our selves, who ever lives to see half a Century will find a great Part of <hi>Europe</hi> furnish'd with Ships from <hi>America</hi>; and this we dare predict from very probable Grounds and Reasons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> were the People who formerly found it much to their Account to build Ships for other Nations. <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> bought of that Republick, tho' scarce any of the Materials of Building were the Product of their Country; so that they made that Want a Foundation for Trade, and a great Imployment it was to their Ships into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Seas to fetch Timber, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002697_0051_0FE60C76F4475CA0"/>
and Victualling, sold to other Nations. <hi>England</hi> indeed out of a just Emulation to the great Advantages accruing to them thereby, and wisely considering how much it would be to the Advantage of the Nation to promote Building of Ships and Navigation, did in Effect prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Buying of Ships of Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by rendring all Foreign built un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to trade to the Plantations, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Plantation-Built) being capable of building her own Ships, having the same or greater Advantages than the <hi>Dutch.</hi> But <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Necessity still, and build in <hi>Holland,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>England:</hi> And as Timber in most Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> grows scarce, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> not having sufficient for Cask for their Liquor, it will be soon wasted. Within our Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>England</hi> was furnish'd with Ship-Timber and Staves from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and now so great is the Change, that <hi>Ireland</hi> has not for their own Use as appears by the Supplies from this River. Therefore 'tis a strong Presumption the <hi>Europians</hi> must

build in some Parts of <hi>America.</hi> And since the Southern Parts have not Plenty of Timber for these Uses, our Northern Parts will be most capable to furnish them with Ships and Ship-Timber.</p>
            <p>Hence, if once we are in a Condition to equip from the Growth and Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>America,</hi> as also with Naval Stores, this will be of huge Advantage to the <hi>British-America.</hi>

            <p>LIME-STONE, we have in great Plenty, of which Store of Lime is made, which gives the Opportunity to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to build good Stone and Brick-Houses in Town and Country.

            <p>ISING-GLASS we have also, which may serve for Window-Lights, and is much better for Lanthorns than either Glass or Horn, especially for Ships, it not being affected with Noise of Guns, nor scorch'd with Heat, as the latter is.

            <p>What we have now to consider is, PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PER-MONEY, which, how far it has been conducive to restore Credit, relieve the Exigencies of divers Freeholders and Inhabitants of this Province, and revive the languishing State of Trade, with divers other Advantages, is already intimated. Yet we are not the richer simply by this Paper-Money, otherwise than as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to those good Ends, it being only a Part of the real Estates we had before, which lay useless as to Trade, and is now turn'd into a trading Currency, to supply the Want of Cash, which (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what we had in the Country, and the excessive Use of Foreign Liquors, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of more useful Commodities) we were so far drain'd of, as not to have any Thing like a competent Quantity to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Trade and Credit amongst our selves.</p>
            <p>It is then the Produce of our Country, in which our Riches does consist, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation of our Trade, and that wherewith we must pay for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

            </p>
            <p>We know some Persons that profess Skill, will tell us this would be a Clog upon Trade: But by their Leave the abundant Use of it has been very destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Welfare of this Province. The Discouragement Foreign Brandy meets with in <hi>Great Britain</hi> is a Clog upon Trade too, but the wise and honourable Legislature there well know it is a Trade that would be no ways advantagious to the publick Interest of the Nation; and if we could have been but so happy as to copy after them so far as to clog the injurious Parts of Trade in Time, and had continued so doing, I suppose we should never had Occasion for a Paper-Currency, (which by former Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities) is now made so absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that Trade and Credit together would inevitably sink without it; and if it be said that we have the Ballance of

Trade with the <hi>West-Indies</hi> in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and that some Cash is still brought from thence, it makes but very little for us to have an Hundred Pounds in Cash from those Parts where we send the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Part of our Country-Produce, and want a Thousand Pounds elsewhere, (which we take to be near our Case of late Years) and certainly such Trade must end in our own Ruin; for if so much of the Country-Produce, as is exported will not pay for all that is imported, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we trade, the poorer we shall be; we speak of the Publick, for tho' some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons may make a present Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage out of its Ruins, yet they too in their Turn must needs have a Feeling of the publick Calamity. But due Care ought to be had to preserve the Value of our Paper-Currency, otherwise it will prove an Injury to the Creditors, and be an Injustice in the Debtors to pay their Debts in what is not of the Value it ought. But this Inconvenience will easily be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by continuing the Care already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Security, and also restricting

the Sum in a due Proportion to the Trade of this River; for a great Excess in that Respect will inevitably debase the Value of it, tho' a reasonable plenty is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous in encreasing Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which cannot thrive without it.</p>
            <p>The very great Abundance of Silver and Gold in any Place lessens the Value of it, tho' it may still retain the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, or be called so much <hi>per</hi> Ounce as it was before, yet a greater Quantity of it must be given for all Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibles. On the other Hand, the too great Scarcity of it enhances its Value by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing the Price of Vendibles to the other Extream, that even the Husbandman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot live by his Labour, for the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Cash makes few Buyers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently miserable Markets, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways they might be tolerably good.</p>
            <p>We are told the <hi>Portuguese</hi> of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the excessive Quantity of Gold brought from <hi>Brazil</hi> to keep up the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of it, and that this is no ways impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, let us for once make (what may be thought) an extravagant and wild Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis:

Let it be supposed these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries abounded with Gold Mines, in as great plenty as we have of Iron Stone, we must necessarily conclude, that Gold would lose much of the Value it now bears, and much more if it were confin'd to this River, as our Paper-Credit is, which is a Consequence no ways strain'd, but must be acknowledged by all judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Persons to be self-evident.</p>
            <p>Hence we conceive it will be the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of those Governments to emit no more Paper-Money than the Trade of these Colonies call for, it being That, which, together with the good Security given by those Persons who take it out of the Offices, will undoubtedly keep up its Value. This, with humble Submission to the Honourable Legislative Bodies in these Colonies is not intended as a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is humbly offered to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Consideration.</p>
            <p>The extravagant Exchange that has lately been given for Gold, has been wrongfully charg'd on our Paper-Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with this Insinuation, that it was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002697_0059_0FE60C7FD503BED8"/>
so much below the Value it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out at, as Gold is advanc'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is most evident to have been occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the exceeding Scarcity of Gold, and the great Want of it to make Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; for when several Persons at one and the same Time were busied in buying up what Gold they could hear of, they advanc'd the Exchange to four Times as much as it was but a short Time before, and could not get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> much as they would have done neither; which is still a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof of the miserable Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we should have been under without a Paper-Currency, and that very few Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could have been in Houses, Lands, Stock, Country-Produce, and the like, which could never have been adapted to answer all the Necessities of Trade.</p>
            <p>HORSES, the most serviceable of all Animals to the Use of Mankind, we have hitherto omitted. But finding from the Example of some Neighbouring Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies they are proper for Trade, and that great Numbers to a considerable Value, are frequently shipp'd off to the <hi>French</hi>

and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as well as <hi>English</hi> Settlements to the Southward, where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and accommodated with good Pasture, to secure to themselves a good Breed both of Horses and Mares; and if the Success an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not by shipping off, yet it will be of Advantage to these Colonies to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Breed for our proper Uses, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially comely and well pac'd Horses for the Saddle. By this Means we shall not need to buy of our Neighbours who drain from us yearly considerable Sums, which by Industry and Care, as above, may be saved: And 'tis not improbable but in Time we may acquire such a Breed

as may be proper for Transportation to those Markets where they are vendible. This only as an Experiment for the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and thoughtful Farmer to put in Practice; 'tis Experience must recommend it for a general Service and Advantage to this River.</p>
            <p>Having thus far discours'd of most of the Branches of Trade we are capable of, there is yet one great Encouragement, to adventure in the Discovery and Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of new Markets; more safe to the industrious Adventurer; namely an <hi>Insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance-Office</hi> in one or more of these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; which is the interesting of divers in the Loss or Profit of a Voyage, and is now become so much the Practice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that Insurance may be had in divers Cases as well against the Hazards at Land, as Casualties at Sea, which must be acknowledged not only to be safe, but a great Encouragement to adventure; for it may so happen that a Person may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time adventure his ALL, and then in case of a Loss he may be rendered unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a future Trade, to the Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

of the publick, and (it may be) to the Ruin of himself; whereas could he get a part of his Interest either of Ship or Cargo insured, (tho' in Case of safe Arrival he parts with a part of his Profit, yet) in Case of Loss, he is secur'd of such part as he insureth, which may be a sufficient Bottom to begin a new Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: How far this may conduce to the Trade of this River, is obvious to any Man of Thought. Now whereas there has been some Attempts made at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> which dropt and prov'd abortive, (for what Reasons we never could learn) we humbly propose to the Legislature that an Office be erected and supported by a Fund arising out of the Interest of the Loan-Office. This will be a good and safe Bottom, and cannot be easily over-set by a few Losses; and we conceive will contribute to keep up the Value of our Paper-Credit by promoting of Trade, Navigation and Building of Ships, and in Consequence, of great Advantage to this River: Which we refer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Merchant.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:002697_0063_0FE60C8C725A6950"/>AND now for a Close to this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, from a Consideration of the Causes of the Decay of Trade and the languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition of the Country; the Ways and Means of Redress will not be found very difficult, much less impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, if happily the Premises be duly observed: For as in Diseases of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body, the Knowledge of the Cause is half the Cure, so there needs no other Direction but a diligent Application to correct those noxious Humours which continue to feed the Distemper, of which having as fully discuss'd as the intended Brevity would admit, we refer back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, tho' we think this short Summary may not be altogether improper.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Ballance of Trade is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially necessary to restore us to our former flourishing Condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Encouragement of Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Trade and Navigation, and raising the Value of our Country-Produce.</p>

            <p n="4">4. As necessary thereunto the Farmer must endeavour the raising all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Species of Growths these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are capable of, as the necessary Funds for a flourishing Trade.</p>
            <p>AND here we address our selves to the Farmer, that as 'tis by his Diligence and Industry that this River must be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with a Stock for Trade, whether of Beef, Pork, Grain, Bread or Flour, as becomes honest Men, who value the Credit of their Country. Let those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commodities be well saved, well pack'd, sound and merchantable, this will tend to their Honour and Interest: And to all worthy and generous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that they would abstract from private Views, and prosecute such Trade as may be beneficial for the publick, as well as themselves.</p>
