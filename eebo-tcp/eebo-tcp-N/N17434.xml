            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>BEHOLD how great a matter a little fire kindleth! The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; a world indeed, ſuch is its power. How dangerous a weapon then is this little member! and how nice and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as well as important an affair, muſt be the conduct and regulation of it! If the iſſues of life and death are from thence, we ought to look well to it, to ſee that the current be reſtrained to its proper channel; that nothing flow from thence, but what may tend to the faireſt iſſue, and end in life, immortality and happineſs. But is it poſſible that ſo much can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the tongue? are words ſo pregnant with happineſs or miſery? words which are but a breath of tranſient air! Yet by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022549_0004_0FB946ACC4F082D8"/>
But let us come to a cloſer examination of the matter. Let us inquire how this great power came to be lodged in this little inſtrument, the tongue; and in what ſenſe, and how far it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſident in it. Let us ſee what are the uſual offices and employments of the tongue. The avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed office of this little uſeful and ſignificant member of the human frame is, to expreſs the conceptions of the brain; and its employment takes in the whole extent of language; comprehending at once, praiſe and obloquy; worſhip and execration; mirth and ſorrow; harmony and diſcord. Therewith bleſs we God, even the Father of all things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with curſe we men, who are made after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God. Therewith may we on the one hand make confeſſion to ſalvation; and on the other defile our whole body, and inflame or ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature. And in all this, it is ſuppoſed to act under the influence of the heart; and in the worſt caſes, I believe it generally does. External expreſſions of virtuous and pious ſentiments, cannot always be depended on for their truth and ſincerity. Men may think it neceſſary to make an appearance
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022549_0005_0FB946AE723787A0"/>
of good qualities, of which they are not in reality poſſeſſed; but the caſe muſt be widely different on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion. There is no end to be ſerved in a man's appearing worſe than he is; and the rancor of the heart will ever be conſidered as the probable ſource and fountain of the malediction of the tongue. Thus are death and life in the power of the tongue. For on the very ſame principle that men ſhall give account of, and conſequently receive the equitable puniſhment for every idle word they ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall alſo receive the applauſe and reward that is due to a juſt and proper regulation of ſpeech; and by their words be juſtified, as well as condemned. With what apparent view; for what evident purpoſe, was this inſtrument of ſpeech made a part of the human fabric? Phyſically ſpeaking, to enable man to expreſs his wants; to acquaint his fellow-animals with the otherwiſe illegible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his heart; in a word, to render him a converſable ſociable creature. But with reſpect to moral and religious ends, there were much higher and more noble views.</p>
            <p>THE Lord hath given man a tongue, that he might praiſe him therewith. The firſt principle
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022549_0006_0FB946AFDB063A68"/>
view of the creation of man, of his being endowed with ſuch high and noble faculties; ſuch peculiar excellencies; was doubtleſs the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Supreme Being. Man is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ineffable goodneſs. Every faculty he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, is the donation of unbounded benevolence. Will not this ſuggeſt to him, that the proper and natural employment of thoſe faculties, is to give glory, honor and thankſgiving to that Being from whom they are derived? What then are we to ſay to ſuch perſons who pervert thoſe very powers which were given them for the beſt and nobleſt, to the worſt and vileſt of all purpoſes; who employ that tongue to blaſpheme and diſhonor that Being whom it was given them to praiſe; to confuſe and deſtroy that ſociety which they were formed to ſupport and adorn? Is not this putting the moſt glaring affront on the author of our being? Is not this perverting the courſe and order of nature in the moſt groſs and palpable manner? Is not this in ſhort, oppoſing the expreſs views of providence, and deſtroying the apparent end and deſign of our creation? What ſhall be done to thee, O thou falſe tongue? Falſe in the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022549_0007_0FB946B1297A1A60"/>
trueſt and moſt extenſive latitude, falſe to all views; ſocial, moral, or religious; and falſe to thy father, friend and benefactor. What ſhall be done to thee? Even mighty and ſharp arrows, and hot burning coals, ſhall be the fatal but juſt reward of thy perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But who are they that have done this great wickedneſs? Is this however to be aſked, when our ſtreets are filled with curſing and blaſphemy; when execrations and oaths intrude themſelves into every article of diſcourſe; when they become the moſt conſiderable part of every general converſation; when even our women and infants become remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; remarkable by the worſt brand of infamy, for a ſhocking proficiency in the language of hell? I know not whether thoſe who are addicted to this pernicious vice in any degree, are at all to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with, upon the principles of reaſon and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſurely not the latter. The rule by which any practice ſtands ſo ſolemnly condemned, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be diſallowed before the practice can become ſo general; and if this is the caſe, then farewell reaſon too. The connection is ſo cloſe between thoſe inſeparable friends, reaſon and religion, that human
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022549_0008_0FB946B2A34017F8"/>
power is too weak to diſingage them; and divine approves of the union. But as it is to be hoped there are but few ſuch, and that the practice of that deſtructive vice of common curſing and ſwearing, is more generally owing to the want of duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, or perhaps of rightly underſtanding the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature and future conſequences of it; I ſhall therefore proceed to lay before you, a few of the moſt obvious and moſt concluſive arguments which may be urged againſt it; from the reſpective conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations both of reaſon and religion. With reſpect to the latter, it is certain that nothing can be more forcibly prohibited; more formally condemned; or more ſolemnly denounced againſt, through the whole ſyſtem at leaſt of the chriſtian law. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this law has ſtrictly forbid us to ſwear at all, by any kind of object, either in heaven or on earth; not even by our own heads, how much leſs then by the great and venerable name of that tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Being, who firſt formed and who upholds all things. If the inanimate heavens are not to be called upon thus vainly, becauſe they are his throne; if to the very ſenſeleſs earth, we owe this ſolemn
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022549_0009_0FB946B42B662738"/>
reverence, becauſe it is his footſtool; how dreadful a profanation muſt it be to invoke the ſacred name of the great King himſelf, from whom alone both throne and footſtool receive their ſanctity.</p>
            <p>So great a ſtreſs is laid upon it by the Apoſtle, that he commands it to be avoided, even above all things. Above all things, my brethren ſwear not. And of ſo much importance is the government of the tongue conſidered by him in another place, that he ſcruples not to pronounce it entirely deſtructive of all religion, and abſolutely incompatible with the eſſential qualifications of a true and ſincere chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. If any man among you ſeemeth to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, i. e. profeſſes a belief of the doctrines and a regard to the rules of the goſpel; yet if that man bridle not his tongue, but is licentious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in his ſpeech, launching out into oaths, execrations and blaſphemies, depend upon it thoſe profeſſions are inſincere. What little appearance he makes of religion, is vain; and what hopes and expectations he may form from it, vain and abſurd; groundleſs and deluſive. As for curſes, how ill do they become the mouth of him who profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022549_0010_0FB946B5B844B190"/>
a diſciple of the meek and benevolent Jeſus whoſe doctrine and whoſe life breathe nothing but love and bleſſing. Whoſe example forbids us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reviled to revile again; and whoſe repeated precepts, poſitively enjoin bleſſings, even in return for curſes received; and prayers for ſpiteful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious treatment. Even under the law it had been long ſince expreſsly forbidden to take the name of the Lord in vain; and a ſevere vengeance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſuch as ſhould be hardy enough to violate the precept. The prophet Hoſea ranks the ſwearer with the atheiſt, the thief, the murderer and adulterer. But it is needleſs to multiply prooffs that the practice of common profane curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is wholly indefenſible on the ſide of religion. If there is any force in words, nothing is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly or ſolemnly prohibited. And what can be expected from the open violation of thoſe repeated prohibitions, but the puniſhment annexed to ſuch offences; the vengeance particularly denounced againſt ſuch glaring and abſolute affronts upon the ſupreme governor and legiſlator? The Lord will not hold him guiltleſs who taketh his name in vain.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022549_0011_0FB946B71DC67F60"/>
And in what degree of guilt he ſhall be held, let the holy Pſalmiſt in ſome meaſure inſtruct us.— As he loved curſing, ſo ſhall it come to him. As he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be far from him. As he cloathed himſelf with curſing like as with his garment, ſo let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones; let it be to him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. Thus we ſee the imprecations of the curſer, whether they be levelled at himſelf or not, will ſtill retort upon himſelf in their fulleſt influence.</p>
            <p>HIS miſchief ſhall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing ſhall come down upon his own pate, ſays the Pſalmiſt. Hear how aptly this is confirmed by the ſon of Syrack—A man who uſeth much ſwearing, ſays he, ſhall be filled with iniquity, and the plague ſhall never depart from his houſe. If he ſhall offend, his ſin ſhall be upon him, and if he acknowledge not his ſin, he maketh a double offence, and if he ſwear in vain, he ſhall not be innocent; but his houſe ſhall be full of calamities. This is the word that is cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022549_0012_0FB946B96FB0C550"/>
about with death. Were we even deſtitute of theſe frequent, expreſs and ſolemn cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt profaning the name of God, certainly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt inform us that we cannot be guilty of a more bold affront to the Supreme Being, than to invoke him on every the moſt trivial and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent occaſion, or to ſport with the great and awful character of him who gave beings to all worlds; and how immenſely does it exaggerate this guilt, if that ſacred authority be appealed to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name be proſtituted in atteſtation of the moſt impudent and daring falſhoods. But that this is too generally the caſe with common ſwearers, need not be obſerved to you; nor will they themſelves, if they have the leaſt ſenſe of ſhame or modeſty, dare to deny it. The vice of common ſwearing is then, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, by an apparent violation of his expreſs commands, moſt provoking to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being. But do we provoke God? What motive have we for it? Hath he ever injured us? On the contrary, are we not the creatures of his bounty? Do we not depend upon him for life and all things which pertain to it? Doth he not diſpenſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022549_0013_0FB946BDAA782D58"/>
to us the various bleſſings of nature and providence with a moſt bountiful hand? What encouragement have we to it? Are we ſtronger than he? Can we over-rule his juſt reſentments? Can we ward off the ſtroke of vengeance? The ſwearer then in this reſpect, ſtands doubly convicted of folly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himſelf, by expoſing himſelf to ills which he knows not how to avoid or endure.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>ſecondly,</hi> it is injurious to men; not only to thoſe individuals who are the particular objects of curſes and execrations, but even to ſociety in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; becauſe by ſwearing the land mourneth, ſays the prophet. The ſin is of ſo deep a dye, as to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion national viſitations, by ſword—famine—or peſtilence. He therefore whoſe crimes are ſo fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant as to bring on public vengeance, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bane and peſt to ſociety; a public enemy; a traitor to his country; and ought to be treated as ſuch. After this conſideration, it is needleſs to mention the comparatively trivial guilt of indecency. When a man has done his endeavour to deſtroy the peace of his country, it is littte to ſay, that he wounds the ear of every rational and religious man; that he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022549_0014_0FB946C1D3AED180"/>
deſtroys the peace of every good man; and puts the groſſeſt affront upon his underſtanding, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining him with the language of hell.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE we ſhould aſk the ſwearer, what poſſible plea can you urge in ſupport of this ſhocking and abominable practice? We are not to expect from him any rational or ſatisfactory anſwer. For will he pretend views of profit or worldly advantage? Who ever heard of wealth, honor, or reputation, acquired in this way? It is true, in caſes of direct perjury, ſomething of this kind may often be the conſequence; but the common ſwearer has nothing to do with this: And few I believe will pretend to ſay, that they have ever made a friend; procured a legacy, inheritance, place, penſion, or donation, becauſe they were remarkable proficients in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. On the contrary, this argument lies againſt him ſtrongly, in more reſpects than one; for it is not only repugnant to the laws of God, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by our laws, that all offences of this nature ſhall be puniſhed: So that a man gets nothing by this practice, but poverty as well as infamy. As to his gaining honor, the portion that comes to his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022549_0015_0FB946C3278343D0"/>
ſhare, is to be ranked in the moſt abject and loweſt claſs; among the very dregs and outcaſts of the people. Is fame and reputation his view? Here perhaps he may ſucceed better; but yet he muſt wait a little for his harveſt, 'till he is received into that ſociety, where alone he can find fit companions for him, and where it may be conſidered as ſome kind of excellency perhaps (ſuch as it is) to be moſt a devil, and to come neareſt the grand pattern of blaſphemy and impiety. Perhaps the ſwearer may imagine that oaths give grace and ſpirit to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and to himſelf the character of courage and vivacity. But who are to be his judges? The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible part of mankind, who have the beſt right to that office. He muſt not appeal to, and the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned themſelves dare not publickly ſide with him, were they ever ſo much inclined by opinion, which I am perſuaded they are not. The only creatures who are likely to favor him on this occaſion, ſeem to be the inhabitants of a certain region, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably blaſphemy is the reigning wit. But let him enjoy the applauſe of devils unenvied; few will grudge him his admirers, who conſider that every peal of laughter thus raiſed, will coſt him a groan
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022549_0016_0FB946C4A2247A80"/>
in the internal priſon; and the mirth which is to ſucceed it, ſhall conſiſt in weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth. I will not ſuppoſe that there can be a wretch ſo abandoned as to aſſert that there is a pleaſure, a ſelf-ſatisfaction in common ſwearing; in blaſpheming the ſacred name of the great God; in violating poſitive ordinances, as well human as divine. Sure devils themſelves cannot derive agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſations from ſo ſhocking a practice. In ſhort, in every light it can be viewed; in all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conſiderations; common ſwearing is the moſt irrational, the leaſt defenſible, of any in the whole catalogue of human vices: For it expoſes a man to the hearty contempt and abhorrence of every good man; to the loſs of his property by the penal laws, if the magiſtrates and the ſober part of the people would have ſpirit enough to put them in force; and to the certain loſs of all that is truly valuable, even eternal happineſs hereafter, from the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of an injured God; without the leaſt triffle in the world in exchange for them; without the poſſibility of attaining either pleaſure, profit, honor, or any other uſeful acquiſition by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It has not even the common pleas of other
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022549_0017_0FB946C61F9DE710"/>
vices to be urged in its behalf. There are ſeveral crimes which a man may, with ſome little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of advantage, charge upon nature; but here every thing of that kind is out of the queſtion; and neither conſtitution nor appetite will ſtand him in any ſtead. For certainly a man will not think of ſaying that he has a conſtitutional propenſity to blaſpheme; as the prodigal, the miſer, the wanton, &amp;c. may urge for their reſpective vices; or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to ſwear, as the glutton avows to the delights of his palate. Perhaps every ſyllable he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly urge in his excuſe, may be reduced to theſe three pleas;—<hi>paſſion—habit</hi>—and <hi>inadvertency.</hi> But I would not have him build much upon either of them; for in the firſt place, whatever is in itſelf abſolutely evil and unwarrantable, can never ſatisfy or excuſe what reſults from it. A man ſwears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is in a <hi>paſſion:</hi> But why is he in a paſſion? Does he not know that intemperate anger is itſelf almoſt one of the greateſt faults a man can be guilty of? Does not he know that it ſtands expreſsly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the letter of ſcripture, which tells him he muſt be ſlow to wrath? That furious anger was not made for him that is born of a woman; that he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022549_0018_0FB946C7AC13BCB8"/>
ſhould be angry and ſin not. Does he not know that the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God? Will a man then ſwear becauſe he is in a paſſion? And one great prohibition is on this very account; leſt he ſhould be tempted to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and to take the name of his God in vain. If a man ſays he ſwears by dint of <hi>habit,</hi> this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the caſe ten times worſe; for an habitual cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of ſinning, is certainly a greater degree of guilt than an occaſional lapſe. But how did he acquire that habit? Was it not by an apparent failure in his duty, both to God and man? But be this habit ever ſo ſtrong, he muſt ſhake it off, reaſon as well as religion requires it; nay, his own ſafety demands it of him, unleſs he has a mind to experience the truth of another neceſſary deduction, and run without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought into eternal ruin, becauſe he has a habit of deſerving it. Even <hi>inadvertency</hi> will not ſerve his turn; when a man thinks it a ſufficient excuſe for a ſervant who has neglected his buſineſs, for that ſervant to reply, it was owing to his not troubling his head about his directions; then may he himſelf be allowed to urge the plea of inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency for ſwearing and taking God's name in vain,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022549_0019_0FB946C9270C98E8"/>
in open contempt of the moſt ſolemn, moſt expreſs and frequent commands to the contrary. You ſee then how the affair ſtands, without the leaſt counter-balance of profit or pleaſure, either preſent or future; the certain gain may be reſolved into contempt, ignominy, and perhaps poverty here—chains and darkneſs, vengeance and eternal miſery hereafter. It is not too late for the moſt deſperate to retrieve himſelf; but for him who is a blaſphemer of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to perſiſt in it but one moment longer, may be attended with the moſt fatal and deplorable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Let me adjure therefore all ſuch as are conſcious of any guilt in this reſpect, by all that they themſelves hold dear, to give the obſervations that I have made their due force. Not to look upon any affectionate remonſtrances on this head as a matter of courſe, or mere words only; but the effect of a real and ſincere concern for their preſent and future well being. And though I would if poſſible hope, that we ſhall meet with but few occaſions to employ it; yet I muſt not omit to deſire the hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the magiſtrates and all ſober minded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in endeavouring to ſuppreſs this horrid and pernicious vice, by applying another kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022549_0020_0FB946CAA13173A8"/>
to ſuch perverſe, obſtinate and wicked wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as ſhall be deaf to theſe. You know what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the legiſlator hath put into our hands; let every one reſolve to uſe it to the utmoſt, on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which may offer for the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures; that the character pointed at by the wiſe man, may not be applied to us: He heareth curſing and bewrayeth it not. O that there was indeed ſuch a ſpirit in us, though we were to ſlay every one his man, who joins to Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor; that the iniquity may be done away from the congregation! for on thoſe terms only will the Lord return to his wonted diſplays of mercy and indulgence, and the plague be ſtayed from Iſrael.</p>
            <p>CONSIDER what you have heard, and may the Lord give us underſtanding in all things.</p>
