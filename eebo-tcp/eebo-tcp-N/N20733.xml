         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PROPHECIES, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> OF Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A FEW Nights after he was ſentenced to be beheaded on Tower-Hill, which was on the 22d day of Auguſt, 1651, ten days before his appointed time, by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which he received at the bar; being one night viſited by two of his intimate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or boſom friends, as he himſelf call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they began to complain of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of the times, and the maſicious uſage of time-ſerving brethren; to which Mr. Love anſwered,—"And think you this is an evil time? No, No; this is the very time, when grace and true godlineſs can be diſtinguiſhed from hypocriſy. Many have followed Chriſt, hitherto, for the loaves, and are now turned back for the roughneſs of the way, and the ſore trial and tribulation, which others met with, who are gone before them.</p>
            <p>"There are many in London, at this very day, who think to go to Heaven in their gilded coaches, and who have denied Chriſt's
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:027229_0003_0FD3CC7291EBC4C0"/>cauſe before men (againſt whom I now wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and Chriſt, in his never failing word, has promiſed to deny all ſuch before his Father and the holy Angels. This is the time to diſcern between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not. They formerly were my familiar acquaintances, in fellowſhip and in ſweet converſe. I ſent this day to have a few words with them, here in the priſon, but they would not come; for their countenances are fallen, and their conſciences wounded; they cannot look me in the face; becauſe I knew of their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was a witneſs of their perjuration. But, ah! how will they look the bleſſed JESUS in the face, in the morning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection? What anſwer or excuſe will they have for what they have done? O fooliſh people! who think to eſcape the Croſs, and come to the Crown! I tell you nay: you muſt all ſuffer perſecution, who follow the Lamb. We muſt be hated of all nations, for Chriſt's ſake. We muſt go through great tribulation, and through the fiery furnace of affliction, before we can enter the land of joy and felicity. Know ye not, that the ſouls that were ſlain for the teſtimony of Jeſus, are placed under the Altar. Happy, happy are thoſe men at this day, and ever ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake in a right
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027229_0004_0FD3E80B17854D20"/>way, i. e. through love to his cauſe, and an honeſty of heart; and not through pride and hypocriſy, without the root of the matter, to have it ſaid they died martyrs. Theſe are they who will miſs their mark. I am now pointed out by many to be in a deſtitute and forlorn condition; but I would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change my ſtate, no, not for all the glory that is on earth. I find my Redeemer's love ſtronger in my bonds, than ever I did in the days of my liberty: I am as full of love and joy in the Holy Spirit, as ever a bottle was filled with new wine. I am ready to cry out, the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me. I will not take upon me to propheſy; nevertheleſs, the Spirit of the Lord cauſeth me to utter.—This uſurped authority, now in the hand of Cromwell, ſhall ſhortly be at an end.
<note n="*" place="bottom">It contined only four years.</note> England ſhall be bleſſed with meek kings, and with a mild government, and powerful preachers. But good ſermons to them will be but as muſick to a ſleepy man; they ſhall hear, but not underſtand, nor lay the word to heart, to practiſe it in their lives, and walk by it. O England! thou ſhalt wax old in wickedneſs; and thy ſins abound like thoſe of Sodom; thy voluptuouſneſs ſhall cry aloud for vengeance; and the Lord ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027229_0005_0FD3E80C54EB7BE8"/>threaten and chaſtife thee;
<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1665 the Plague raged in London, and carried off 87,000 perſons. This was followed, the next year, with the great Fire, 1666, which raged for three days, and burnt 13,000 houſes, and deſtroyed 700 ſtreets.</note> yet in mercy and love will he look upon thoſe who fear him, and call upon his name; he will ſpare and ſave them alive in the day of his anger, when the wicked ſhall be ſifted from amongſt you, as the chaff is ſifted from amongſt the wheat. Out of thee, O England! ſhall a bright Star ariſe,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Uncertain; ſome ſay Whitefield; ſome the Society in Scotland for propagating the Goſpel; others that the time of its accompliſhment hath not come.</note> whoſe light and voice ſhall make the heathen to quake, and bow with ſubmiſſion to the Goſpel of Jeſus. He ſhall be as a ſound of thunder in the ears of the wicked, and as a lantern to the Jews. to lead them to the knowledge of Jeſus, the only Son of God, and the true Meſſiah, whom they ſo long miſtruſted; for the ſhort work ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, which the Lord is to make upon the earth, in the latter age of the world, cannot be far off. Obſerve, my dear friends, while you live, my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the dates in the book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and in Daniel, which the Spirit of the Lord led me into; for the Lord will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027229_0006_0FD3E80DED5C07B0"/>reveal it to ſome of his own, e'er that time come; for the nearer the time is, the ſeals ſhall be taken away, and more and more ſhall be revealed to God's People; for the Lord doth nothing without he reveal it, by his Spirit, to his Servants the Prophets. He deſtroyed not the old world without the knowledge of Noah.—He did not overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Abraham. I do not mean now, that any new Prophet ſhall ariſe: But the Lord by his Spirit ſhall canſe knowledge to abound among his people, whereby the old prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhall be clearly and perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And I die in that thought, and really believe that my calculation will be found true, on the Revelation by St. John, and the prophecy which St. Jerome copied off, and tranſlated out of the Hebrew Language, as it is written on Seth's Pillar in Damaſcus; which pillar is ſaid to have ſtood ſince and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, and was built by Seth, Adam's ſon, and written by Enoch the Prophet; as likewiſe the holy precepts, whereby the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs walked, before the law was given to Moſes, which were alſo engraven on the ſaid Pillar; whereof many Jews have copies, in their own language, written on parchment, and engraven on braſs and copper, This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is entitled, "A ſhort work of the Lord's, in the latter age of the world."</p>

            <head>The laſt Words of the Reverend <hi>CHRISTOPHER LOVE.</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Laurence Jury, London,</hi> who was beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill, Auguſt 22, 1651,</hi> in the time of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under pretence of his plotting againſt it. His words on the ſcaffold were theſe.</head>
            <p>"ALTHOUGH there be but little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and death, yet this bears up my heart, there is little between me and heaven. It comforted Dr. Taylor, the martyr, when he was going to execution, that there were but two ſtiles between him and his Father's houſe: There is a leſſer way between me and my Father's houſe, but two ſteps between me and glory. It is but laying down my head upon that block, and I ſhall aſcend upon a throne. I am this day ſailing towards the ocean of eternity, through a rough paſſage to my haven of reſt; through a red ſea to the promiſed land. Methinks I hear God ſay to me, as he did to Moſes, <hi>Go up to Mount Neho, and die there;</hi> ſo to me, <hi>Go up to Tower-Hill, and die there.</hi> Iſaac ſaid of himſelf, that he was old, and yet he knew not the day of his death; But I cannot ſay ſo; I am young, and yet I know the day of my death, and I know the kind of my death, and the place of my death alſo.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027229_0009_0FD3E813EC4BC860"/>I am put to ſuch a kind of death, as two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous preachers of the goſpel were before me, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle. They were both beheaded. I read, Rev. xxth, 4th, <hi>The ſaints were beheaded for the word of God, and the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> But herein is the diſadvantage which I lie under, in the thoughts of ſome; they judge that I ſuffer not for the word of God, or for conſcience, but for meddling with State matters.—To this I ſhall briefly ſay, that it is an old trick of Satan, to impute the cauſe of God's people's ſufferings to be contrivements againſt the State; when, in truth, it is their religion and conſcience they are perſecuted for. The Rulers of Iſrael would have put Jeremiah to death upon a civil account, though indeed it was only the truth of his prophecy that made the rulers angry with him; and yet upon a civil account they pretended he muſt die; becauſe he fell away to the Chaldeans, and would have brought in foreign forces to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade them. The ſame thing is laid to my charge, of which I am as innocent as Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah was. So Paul, though he did but preach Jeſus Chriſt, yet his enemies would have him put to death under pretence that he was a mover of ſedition. Upon a civil account my life is pretended to be taken away; whereas, it is becauſe I purſue my
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027229_0010_0FD3E813F24A1D70"/>covenant, and will not proſtitute my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and conſcience to the ambition and the luſts of men. I had rather die a covenant-keeper, than live a covenant-breaker.— Beloved, I am this day making a double exchange: I am changing a pulpit for a ſcaffold, and a ſcaffold for a throne,—And I might add a third, I am changing the preſence of this numerous multitude upon Tower-Hill, for the innumerable company of ſaints and angels in Heaven, the holy Hill of Zion; and I am changing a guard of ſoldiers for a guard of angels, which will receive me, and carry me to Abraham's boſom. This ſcaffold is the beſt pulpit that ever I preached in. In my church pulpit, God, through his grace, made me an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring others to heaven; but in this pulpit he will bring me to heaven."</p>
            <p>Afterwards he ſaid, "Though my blood be not the blood of nobles, yet it is Chriſtian blood, miniſter's blood; yea more, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood. I magnify the riches of God's grace and mercy towards me, that I, who was born in Wales, an obſcure country, and of obſcure parents, ſhould be ſingled out to honourable ſufferings. For the firſt fourteen years of my life, I never heard a ſermon preached; yet in the fifteenth year of my life it pleaſed God to convert me. Bleſſed

I had rather be an inſtrument to bring ſouls to heaven, than that all nations ſhould bring tribute to me.—Formerly (ſaid he) I have been under a ſpirit of bondage; yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have had more fear in drawing out a tooth, than now I have for cutting off my head. When fear was upon me, death was not near; now, when death is near to me, my fear is evaniſhed.—I am comforted in this, though men kill me, they cannot damn me; though they thruſt me out of the world, yet they cannot ſhut me out of heaven.— When I have ſhed my blood, I expect the full declaration of the remiſſion of ſins through the blood of Chriſt. I am going to my long home, and ye to your ſhort homes; but I ſhall be at my home before you be at yours."</p>
