            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The unfortunate perſon, whoſe death is the ſubject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiry, was maſter of an American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, called the <hi>Eagle,</hi> which ſet off the 15th of September, in the laſt year, with a cargo of tobacco, bound for France; the ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at that time, conſiſted of Capt. <hi>William Little,</hi> the deceaſed, and ten other perſons, of whom three died, very ſhortly after the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel quitted the harbour; there were left on board the maſter, and ſeven other perſons, the two priſoners at the bar, the two Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032308_0006_0FF1BC8667C6E450"/>
whom you have ſeen produced at the bar, and three other perſons, who will be produced to you as witneſſes, in ſupport of this proſecution. Gentlemen, nothing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erial occured, in the proſecution of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yage till on the 27th of October laſt; when at twelve o'clock at night, <hi>Little,</hi> the maſter, and three other perſons on board, that will be produced as witneſſes, went below to ſleep; on being relieved from their watch by the two priſoners at the bar, and the two Spaniards. Gentlemen, on that night we charge that the deſtruction of this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſon, was effected, in the manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the indictment; and we charge the priſoner at the bar, Cole, with being the hand employed in this murder; and the priſoner, Colley, with being the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the chief actor in this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous conſpiracy againſt him, and the two Spaniards with being aiding, abetting, aſſiſting, comforting, and maintaining, the ſaid Cole and Colley, to commit the ſaid murder. Gentlemen, the body of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate perſon, after the murder was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, was dragged on deck, and afterwards thrown over board. The manner in which this foul tranſaction came to the poſſeſſion of the other witneſſes on board the ſhip, for you will pleaſe to obſerve there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſes of the tranſaction, but thoſe engaged in it; ſeveral of the converſations that paſſed between the priſoners and the witneſſes, I ſhall leave to be detailed by them, and the other, as the perſons engaged in

this buſineſs are tried ſeparately. It appears to me, that many of thoſe tranſactions, and of thoſe converſations, which I ſhould oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe have ſtated, as compoſing the general hiſtory of this buſineſs, would be rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applicable, on account of this ſeparation, in which the priſoners are brought to the bar; it will however, not be improper for me to ſtate to you, that in the morning after the murder had taken place, one of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at the bar aſſembled the men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that he then told them, they would go into the firſt port <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ey could reach, and ſell the cargo, and divide the profits amongſt them; he went down and took paſſeſſion of 245 dollars, which were in the deceaſed's cheſt, and afterwards divided the deceaſed's clothes among the crew, ſome of which were cut in a variety of places; and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the mate, entered in the Logg-Book, that he deceaſed on the 27th of October, of a yellow fever; the ſhip arrived at the Iſle of Wight; after which it will be proved, that the priſoner Colley attempted to make an alteration of the entry of the death he had recorded before, and ſtated, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed's death happened at a former period; he there diſpoſed of the dollars for forty-five guineas, and divided among the crew, five guineas each; this circumſtance of the entry of the death of the deceaſed, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er particulars, which appeared of a myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, various and inconſiſtent repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the cauſe of his death, excited ſuſpicions in the mind of the American

Agent and Conſul; and theſe repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being further inveſtigated, they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the diſcovery I have ſtated to you. Gentlemen, the Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty have, nevertheleſs, thought it a duty which they owed to general juſtice, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute an enquiry into this buſineſs, and to commit it to the judgment of a jury; and you will diſcharge your duty, by pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that verdict on the priſoners at the bar which your conſciences ſhall warrant you to form.</p>

            <p>You was alarmed with the ery of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?—Certainly I was.</p>

            <p>Upon your oath, why did not you alone get up?—Why did not I, a man does not know what to do.</p>
            <p>Why there were three of you in the ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and the captain was within twelve feet of you?—Ye, and there were two bulk heads between us.</p>
            <p>And neither you nor Caſſada nor Hart went to his aſſiſtance?—They two did not hear me, I did not know they were there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was lying thinking what to do.</p>

            <p>Did you try to ſee whether they were or not?—I did not.</p>
            <p>At that time when you firſt heard it, you heard the voice of one man that was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain?—He was the only voice I heard ſpeak out then, I heard only the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains voice in the Cabin, ſpeaking to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in the Cabin, Colley was on deck.</p>
            <p>Then there was one man in the Cabin? —I do not know there was any more; I heard him ſay Frank, let me lay down and die quietly, I did what I ſuppoſed was beſt, then Hart was awaked and he went up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deck, I do not know who awaked him; I never ſpoke nor ſtirred.</p>
            <p>Did Hart call you when he was touched? —He only ſald what is the matter, is there a ſquall upon deck; he never ſaid a word to me.</p>
            <p>Was there any light?—No, I concluded he was touched by <hi>ſinging out,</hi> I could not ſee the man's face, but I could ſee he had no ſhoes nor hat on, I could not ſwear to the mans backſide, he turned his face from me.</p>
            <p>Now after this you was afraid that ſome of the Spaniards would do you a miſchief, and you ſaid you would got a plank and walk overboard?—Certainly.</p>
            <p>And Colley ſaid there is no need of that, the Captain is gone?—Yes.</p>
            <p>That quieted you at once?—It quieted me ſo that I made up to him.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032308_0030_0FF1BCD32F9146D0"/>Wight?—I was a young fellow on board, I acted as ſecond mate when the captain was alive, to give him a call as any other man would, I was not ſo good a ſeaman as ſome of them.</p>
            <p>How came you to take ſeven guineas and a half of this money, when the others had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly five?—There were forty guineas, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had only five.</p>
            <p>How came that?—I do not know.</p>
            <p>You aſked no queſtions?—No.</p>
            <p>You took the ſeven guineas and a half? —It was put in my hand.</p>
            <p>Did you refuſe it?—I did at firſt, but I took it afterwards.</p>
            <p>Then you gave an account of the death of the Captain?—I had it in black and white before that.</p>
            <p>And you ſwore to it?—I ſwore to what was true, to the beſt of my knowledge.</p>
            <p>What you ſwore, then, was true, to the beſt of your knowledge, was it? do not ſay that I do not underſtand you?—Yes.</p>

oath of ſomething? did not you there ſwear, that the captain died of a yellow fever?—I do not know that his name was put in there, that he died of a yellow fever.</p>

            <p>Will you ſwear that you and Caſſada did not ſwear that he died of a yellow fever?— I cannot ſwear I ſwore ſo; if I did, I did not underſtand it, it was not to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Did you not all three ſwear poſitively, that the Captain met with his death on the voyage, and that he died of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?—I do not remember it, it was about the cargo that we went.</p>
            <p>Did you go to the Cuſtom-houſe at all, or to the Iſle of Wight, or Portſmouth?—I went to each of them.</p>
            <p>At which of them did you take oath?— At both; one was concerning getting the veſſel out of quarantine, and the other was about the cargo.</p>
            <p>Now, in which of them did you ſwear the Captain died of a yellow fever?—It is in neither of them.</p>
            <p>Will you ſwear it is not?—I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>Did not you attend to what you ſwore? —I did not underſtand it.</p>
            <p>Was not it read over to you?—Yes; that may be I might not underſtand that word, that the Captain died of a yellow fever.</p>
            <p>Will you ſwear it was not giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the captain's death at all?—I will

not ſwear it was not there; I will not ſwear any thing about it.</p>
            <p>Was not it read to you?—Did not I tell you it was read to me? I told you it was read to me.</p>
            <p>Was it read to you?—Yes.</p>
            <p>You ſigned it; did not you put your mark to it?—What if I did? I ſigned two papers there, one at Portſmouth, &amp; the other at the Iſle of Wight.</p>
            <p>But which of them contained an account of the Captains death, you do not know?— I do not know that either of them did.</p>
            <p>Will you ſwear they did not?—I cannot ſwear any thing about it.</p>

            <p>Was Cole by?—No, Michael ſaid to me the cook had killed the captain, then I went to aſk of Cole, he ſaid Michael did it, when I aſked for my life, Colley ſaid nobody ſhould hurt me.</p>
            <p>What did Michael ſay to you when you aſked him to ſpare your life?—He ſaid the ſame as Colley ſaid, that no body ſhould hurt me.</p>
            <p>Did you obſerve Cole's hand?—Yes, I ſaw it out; I aſked him how he came by it,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032308_0048_0FF1BD0BB4ABBBF0"/>

            <p>Where was it?—About the ſtairs, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ladder; then Mr. Colley came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and unlocked the captain's cheſt. I was the cook then, becauſe Frank Cole could not cook.</p>

            <p>What became of the captain's clothes?— I do not know; Mr. Colley gave me two ſhirts, two pair ſtockings, and a waiſtcoat. He gave them among all of us. Then I ſaw one jacket, I was very cold, and I took it myſelf and a waiſtcoat; then Colley told me he ſhould charge me a guinea and a half for it. I took the clothes, but another day when we were at quarantine, I wanted to give them back again; he took a piece of rope and gave me a blow. He aſked me what is that to any body, nobody has any thing to do with that. He took the clothes, and I was obliged to hold my tongue. He ſaid to me, nobody has any thing to do with theſe clothes, they belong to nobody. When

I went to aſk for a ſhirt then Colley gave them me back again.</p>
            <p>Was there any money divided among you?—Yes, Colley gave us five guineas a piece. I received five guineas.</p>
            <p>Where had Colley got that money?— He changed it out of the dollars, I reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, he did not tell me ſo; we had five guineas a piece; what Dearborn and Mr. Colley had, I do not know, I was before the maſt; the two Spaniards and the two blacks had five gvineas a piece as well as me.</p>
