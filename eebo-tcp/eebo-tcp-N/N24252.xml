            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE abundant diffidence and anxiety, which, at all times, ſo juſtly belong to me, are, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, partly loſt in the flow of ſympathetic joy and gratitude, which animate my heart to felicitate you on this happy meeting. While ſome of our fellow-creatures are roaming in the gloomy foreſt as beaſts of prey; or, in wild enthuſiaſm and dark ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, celebrating the rites of idol and unknown gods; or exulting, with barbarous pleaſure, in the excruciating torture of captive enemies: while mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are draging out a miſerable exiſtence in the dreary countries of ignorance and deſpotiſm, or more awfully bleeding under the curſed laſh of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and others, with unfeeling hearts, wantonly rioting upon theſe ſufferings of their brother-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the bounties of Heaven: while thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are armed with the implements of death in order
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032062_0006_0FF109DD8DDC85E0"/>to cut and mangle the bodies of their fellow-men, and to ſhed each others blood, and whole nations are experiencing all the horrors of war: we, my Friends, in the ample enjoyment of national liberty, proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and peace, are, this day convened by an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion connected with every thing great and valuable to man. This day, by the munificience of an all-wiſe and directing Providence, we celebrate the Ded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ication of a literary inſtitution: an inſtitution, which, by the grace of God, we would ſacredly conſecrate to literature, virtue, and the true dignity of man. Every circumſtance of the occaſion is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to touch the moſt noble feelings of our nature; to ſublime our hearts to the throne of God on the ſwift wings of gratitude and love. And while the occaſion irreſiſtibly claims a tribute of gratitude to the Father of lights and God of all grace; at the ſame time, it claims more irreſiſtibly, if poſſible, our moſt ardent prayers; that the God of ſcience, order and virtue, would enable and diſpoſe us ever to hold in view the ſublime objects to which our inſtitution is, this day, ſolemnly conſecrated; and that thoſe, who are more immediately concerned, may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed from on high, with all that wiſdom and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which, from time to time, may be neceſſary to direct the inſtitution in the ways of truth and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Neither can thoſe, who are intimately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the proſperity of the Academy, reſt its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to knowledge and virtue, on thankſgiving
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032062_0007_0FF109E180087BE0"/>and prayer alone; they will be conſtrained, from the powerful voice of duty and intereſt, to co-operate with the all-bountiful hand of Providence, by their moſt ardent reſolutions, and ſpirited exertions.</p>
            <p>THUS congratulating each other on the opening of our promiſing Seminary, and, together with thankſgiving, by prayer and pious reſolutions, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly dedicating it to literature and morality, our minds are naturally arreſted by the great, the all-intereſting ſubject of Education—Here the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of education, at once, opens upon our view a wide field, rich with many of the moſt intereſting particulars.</p>
            <p>EXPATIATING in this delightful field, the objects which education ought to embrace firſt catch out at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Theſe objects, I conceive, are, principally. Literature and Morality: by the former to inform and direct the underſtanding; by the latter to melior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the heart, to conform the affections, will, and conduct to the rules of rectitude, or will of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and great Moral Governor.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER might have been the reaſon, either ſome deficiency in thoſe who have been employed in conducting youth, or an idea that the heart is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable otherwiſe than by an immediate miracle of the Divine hand, or ſome other reaſon, it is a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy truth, that the morality of youth has not been conſidered, ſo much as their literature, the province of the inſtructor. While unwearied pains
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032062_0008_0FF109E3C5BB1250"/>have been taken to give learning to youth, to give them ſkill in the arts, and knowledge in the ſciences; the habitudes of the heart, their diſpoſitions, taſtes, and ſentiments, on which moral character is grafted, have been too much neglected. There is doubtleſs great connection between truth and virtue, between the underſtanding and the moral habitudes of the ſoul; ſo that by informing the underſtanding there is ſtrong probability that the morality will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: yet it muſt be confeſſed that this connection is not an inſeperable one; ſince we have the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſometimes, to ſee gentlemen of the firſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abilities, the loweſt ſunk in depravity and vice. We have the unhappineſs, ſometimes, to ſee ſouls widely expanded in knowledge, awfully macu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the dark ſhades of vice; angels in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, devils in conduct. Hence we ſee educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is deſigned to prepare youth for the ſequel of life, to render them uſeful, reſpectable, and happy, will be immenſely deficient, unleſs it be profeſſedly extended to their morality, as well as their literature. The conſtitution of human nature proves the propriety and importance of doing this. The prominent principles of our nature are thoſe of Imitation and Habit. Youth are ever learning to do what they ſee others around them doing, and theſe imitations grow into habits. Fact and experience prove to us that every function of the body, every faculty and capacity of the mind are, more or leſs,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032062_0009_0FF109E553D12690"/>affected and directed by imitation and habit. How infinitely important then is it, in early youth, when every power, and capacity is pliable, and ſuſceptible of any direction or impreſſion, ſo to manage educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that imitation may turn the young mind to virtue as well as knowledge, and habit confirm him in both. Not only then are we to educate our youth in arts and ſciences, but alſo, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEING ſo convinced of its conſequence, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear adding Manner, as another object which education ought to embrace. Tho' the head be filled with ſcience, and the heart with ſentiment, though knowledge and virtue mark every trait of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, conſtraint and aukwardneſs of manner will, in a meaſure, render the perſon forbiding and repulſive, leſſon his influence, and detract from his uſefulneſs. Hence while education ſtrives to form the mind to learning and virtue, it will not fail to embelliſh both with the ornaments of eaſe and grace of manner. One bleſſed with ſuch an education, will command that influence which his ſubſtantial acquirements juſtly challenge, and will diffuſe, wherever he goes, light, virtue, love and joy.</p>
            <p>HAVING pointed at the great objects which edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ought to embrace, the importance of it will more fully appear by opening our eyes upon that dignity and happineſs which the Creator deſigned for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. When we analize man, raptures of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032062_0010_0FF109E721986B08"/>joy and gratitude muſt fill our hearts to ſee what greatneſs, ſublimity, glory and happineſs our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator deſigned for him! The erect poſture, the curious and wonderful ſtructure, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding countenance of man, all indicate the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior powers of his ſoul. As an intellectual being, how wonderful is man! Through his ſenſes, as ſo many windows to his dark body, the knowledge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world is beamed upon his mind. By reflecting on the powers and operations of his own mind, he riſes to a knowledge of the ſpiritual world, of angels, of God. By diſcernment and reaſoning he ſees the agreement and diſagreement of his ideas; the broad effulgence of knowledge and truth illumine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand his ſoul. Curioſity urges his ardent purſuits of knowledge, and, through an equiſite ſenſe of truth, his feelings are enraptured with her view. By mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory he calls from oblivion ſcenes that are paſt; from experience corrects his errors, and reenjoys the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of life. His imagination wings his ſoul with fire; traverſes all that is grand and ſublime in the univerſe; aſcends the ſkies, ſurveys the ſhining orbes and bright intelligencies of immenſity, and, from nature, riſes to nature's God. As an active and moral being, ſtill more wonderful is man! His body, formed to a variety of operation, is pliable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergetic; his mind is quick and powerful as the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric ſpark. His ſoul is winged with the moſt animating paſſions. Deſire of happineſs and averſion to miſery,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032062_0011_0FF109EBDB25EF98"/>love and hatred, hope and fear, rouſe all the faculties of man, and command his greateſt, nobleſt exertions. Implanted in the heart is conſcience, the monitor of Heaven, as by the hand of God, diffuſing peace and joy through the virtuous ſoul; and puniſhing vice by the torture of remorſe, and the awful forebodings of guilt. Thus endowed, man has the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made capable of religion; of riſing to a knowledge of the inviſible God, the Creator and Governor of the univerſe, of his attributes and will; capable of the ſublime affections of piety, of gratitude and love, adoration and obedience. To complete the dignity and happineſs of man, God hath conſtituted him a free and moral agent; while ſupporting, delegated to his mind an ample, an unembarraſſed power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all his active faculties. So exalted is the human race in the ſcale of beings, that while the Creator, of his other works ſaid, They were very good; of man He ſaith, In the image of God created He him! If we, for a moment, look without us, we ſhall be ſtill farther convinced of the dignity and happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for our race. Man is conſtituted king of earth. Hence the revolving ſeaſons, the air and fouls of heaven, the vaſt ocean and its inhabitants, and the cattle upon a thouſand hills, all beſpeak his glory. But if we juſt glance an eye of faith into our holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, what has hitherto been ſaid of human great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwindles to a point. Here we find <hi>life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> beyond the grave, <hi>brought to light.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:032062_0012_0FF109EE2E3B4420"/>Here we find, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things,</hi> the dignity and happineſs, <hi>which God hath prepared for</hi> the virtuous. And, what is more than all, that all the human race might be raiſed to this inviſible height of perfection, the bleſſed Emmanuel, the only Son and image of God, left his throne in heaven for a humble reſidence on earth; aſſumed humanity, and even died to diſembarraſs us from thoſe depravities, which might ſully our glory.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the greatneſs and value of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch her powers and capacities. But where, in this world, is much of all this known, or realized and enjoyed? The experience of fact replies, only there, where have been enjoyed the bleſſings of ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation. All theſe intellectual, active, and moral powers and capacities, experience ſhows us, are under the influence of the great principles of IMITATION and HABIT, which Deity, for the wiſeſt purpoſes, implanted in our nature; and hence, by the powerful hand of a well-directed education, and due attention, may be vaſtly heightened and improved; or, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and vicious indulgence depreſſed, enervated, if not finally deſtroyed. Let us, for a moment, look at the ſavage of the wilderneſs natively poſſeſſed of all this dignity and value of nature, but untouched by the moulding hand of education. Deſtitute of all the arts of civilized life, he roves a naked animal in the uncultivated foreſt. His intellectual powers ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032062_0013_0FF109F02AA45608"/>unexerciſed and undirected, his ideas, his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and his knowledge are confined within the ſmall compaſs of his chaſe. His paſſions undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, are ungovernable, impetuous, and awful. Ignorant of his own origin and value, of God and religion, he adores the ſun and ſtars, and bends his knee to the rude image formed by his own unſkilful hand. And not only is the heart, which embraces the whole family of man, conſtrained to weep over millions of the human race, who, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of education, are low ſunk in barbarity; but even in civilized life, where the means of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the light of religion are enjoyed, even among the highly privileged Americans, the tear of humanity is frequently ſtarted, to ſee many of our brethren, ſome of whom the moſt excellent of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's works, through the neglect of education, and by bad example, in a ſituation almoſt as pitiable as that of the roving Tartar. How infinitely different is the character of him, whom a well-conducted edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and due attention, and the grace of God, have brought upon the ſtage of action! In him all the noble powers and capacities of human nature are improved and exalted, and ſtill progreſſing. Truth and knowledge illumine and expand his mind. His underſtanding is broad as the heavens. Swayed by reaſon, his imagination and his paſſions are calm, and regular as the heavenly orbs. Unſhackled by ſuperſtition, his candour is diffuſive as the light. His
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032062_0014_0FF109F283BF07B8"/>conſcience unhurt by the Torpedo of vice, is tender and delicate as the ſenſitive plant. Freed from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, his faith, founded on evidence, is firm as the overlaſting mountains. Flowing from conviction, his morality is ſteady as the ſun in his courſe. His zeal and devotion, being according to knowledge, are, without enthuſiaſm, uniform, rational, ſublime. Such an one is dignified and happy in himſelf, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable to his connections, uſeful to the world, loved, and reſpected by all, bleſſed of Heaven, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the ſociety of angels in the city of God.</p>
            <p>BUT the field of the importance of education is not yet fully explored. Widening our view upon nations, ſtill greater objects arreſt our attention. What but the bleſſings of education raiſe the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and civilized nations of Europe ſo far above the roving tribes of Africa? Tho' the arts of civilized life may originate from neceſſity, yet it is by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of knowledge that their principles are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated, without which they never will be carried to any conſiderable perfection. The principles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded by mechanical philoſophy have given birth to all that variety of machinery by which labour is abridged, and the arts of life improved. Commerce very much owes her exiſtence to the advancement of ſcience. By this means the vaſt ocean is navigated, the moſt diſtant nations, which it flows between, made acquainted with each other, and their various productions exchanged to the advantage of both. In
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032062_0015_0FF109F5E4AD9278"/>ſhort, "in civilized life every thing is effected by art and ſkill," both which, in a great meaſure, are the gifts of education—"Whence, by the way, a perſon who is provided with neither, (and neither can be acquired without exerciſe and inſtruction) will be uſeleſs; and he that is uſeleſs will generally be, at the ſame time, miſchievous to the community. So that to ſend an uneducated child into the world is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the reſt of mankind; it is little better than to turn out a mad dog, or a wild beaſt into the ſtreets."</p>
            <p>BUT the infinite importance of education, in a national view, appears in ſtill brighter colours, from this eternal truth, That the mode of government in any nation, will always be moulded by the ſtate of education. The throne of tyranny is founded on ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Literature and liberty go hand in hand. Every ray of knowledge which darts through the dark cloud of ignorance that reſts on an inſlaved nation, threatens death to the deſpot. The dark ages of goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eciſm opened an ample field for eccleſiaſtical tyranny. While the Pope of Rome and his ſatellites eſtabliſhed, in the ignorant minds of Europe, the doctrine of the Pope's infallibility, that he was Peter's ſucceſſor, vicegerent of Chriſt, and held the keys of heaven, the kings of Europe trembled before him, and laid their treaſures at his feet. As the ſun of ſcience has been riſing upon Europe, the papal throne has been melting; and the proſpect now is, that his holineſs will ſoon be no more. In thoſe dark ages alſo, the ridiculous
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032062_0016_0FF0D388CA2D31B0"/>doctrine of the divine right of kings being inſtilled into the ignorant mind, the authority of deſpots became the authority of God, and their ſubjects prepared tamely to ſuffer every indignity. But as the increaſe of knowledge has gradually given thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions better notions of the equal rights of men, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny has been proportionally declining. Let general information, and a juſt knowledge of the rights of man be diffuſed through the great bulk of the people in any nation, and it will not be in the power of all the combined deſpots on earth to enſlave them. Of this truth France may be an example. Of the influence of education on government, the hiſtory of our own nation affords us a moſt happy ſpecimen. Convinced of the vaſt conſequence of literature our pious anceſtors gave the earlieſt attention to the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their youth. By this means, information was generally diffuſed through the Colonies, and many of our citizens were profound in ſcience, the rights of man, the hiſtories of nations, and political wiſdom. Thus guarded, vain were the attempts of Britain to oppreſs us. Separation was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; independence the iſſue. Guided by the ſame potent hand of literature, our lives are crowned with a government which ſecures to us all the bleſſings of ſociety, and civil liberty. That we may tranſmit to poſterity our happy government pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, let the glories of education ever be our theme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032062_0017_0FF109FA8B5BBED0"/>
WERE it not unneceſſary to ſay more on this head, the ineſtimable value of education would ſtill vaſtly magnify by viewing its connection with our holy religion.</p>
            <p>THOUGH at firſt, chriſtianity was miraculouſly ſent from heaven to earth, by the hand of a glorious mediator, the continuation and propagation of it, in the world, depends, under Providence, almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on education. "Chriſtianity is an hiſtorical reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, founded on facts which are related to have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon diſcourſes which were held, and letters which were written, in a remote age, and diſtant country. The records of theſe things are preſerved in languages, which have long ceaſed to be ſpoken in any part of the world." Obvious it is then that education, and moſt probably the clergy, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to perpetuate the evidences of our holy religion, and to interpret thoſe ancient writings, in which this religion is contained.</p>
            <p>NOT to dwell longer on this moſt copious head; filled with the infinite conſequence of education to man, the mind is naturally turned, and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excited to conſider the way and means by which it may be moſt ſucceſsfully advanced.</p>
            <p>ONE of the moſt important particulars is, that the great work of education be begun in early life. As ſoon as the powers and capacities of the mind begin to unfold, the directing and foſtering hand of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be applied. The time of human life is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032062_0018_0FF109FCDA55DA10"/>too ſhort and valuable to ſuffer a moment of it to paſs away without improvement. Beſide, the work of acquiring a good education, filling the mind with knowledge, and moulding it into virtuous habits, is a work of vaſt labour. Life is ſhort; ſcience and improvement infinite.</p>
            <p>NOT only ſo, but ſuch is the conſtitution of nature, the young mind can not be ſtationary. The great principles of imitation and habit will operate. Hence, if the ſkilful hand of education does not, as its faculties unfold, turn the mind right, by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe principles, they will, through bad example and indulgence, turn it wrong. And, what is more, the turn, which the young mind receives while it is tender and pliable, and its powers and capacities are unfolding and maturing, is very ſtubborn, and, probably, will, in a meaſure, continue until, and, awful thought! beyond death. Perhaps under five years of age, ſome impreſſions and principles are ſet upon the mind and manners of the child, which he will carry through life. Experience has, long ſince, drawn this obſervation into a decided maxim. A great poet expreſſes thus:
<q>
                  <l>"Tis education forms the common mind;</l>
                  <l>"Juſt as the twig is bent, the tree's inclin'd."</l>
               </q>
And one, who, for almoſt three thouſand years, has been renowned for his ſuperior wiſdom, has left us this all-intereſting maxim, in ſtill more deciſive terms. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032062_0019_0FF109FFE3C10F98"/>and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe principles it is that we ſo urgently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend early education. Upon theſe principles it alſo is, that a late education is encumbered with many embarraſſments. Entering late upon education, the Scholar not only has his learning to obtain, but bad habits and erroneous prejudices to correct. Very few have abilities adequate to the arduous taſk. Though ſuch an one may become accurate in theory, it is lucky if his old habits do not cauſe him to blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in practice. Though his knowledge may be fine, he is very liable to have his manner conſtrained, and his execution bad.</p>
            <p>FEMALE education is another particular very eſſential as a means to its general, and far advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>WE have ſeen, education ought to begin with the beginnings of underſtanding. At this eventful period of life, the little folks are in the arms of their mothers. Has the mother been well educated, is the tender parent a good preceptreſs, the fortunate child is at the beſt ſchool in the univerſe, while in its mother's lap. As the faculties of the young mind expand, ſhe will with a delicate and ſkilful hand nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and direct it to knowledge and virtue. The pupil being conſtantly with, and ſtrongly attached to the mother, will aſſume her as an example of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and imitate her every look, word, and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe imitations will ſoon grow into habits,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032062_0020_0FF10A016E8A8530"/>and probably fix traits upon the child's mind, ſpeech, and manners, which will be durable as life. Hence the maxim, as is the parent ſo is the child; and hence the inconceivable conſequence of female educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>BESIDE, ſuch is the happy conſtitution of nature, that wherever Ladies are highly improved by a well directed and refined education, there the gentlemen will ſoon become ſo. It is an aphoriſm, which it muſt be confeſſed carries much truth with it, that the fair part of creation rule the world. Would they, guided by the wiſe dictates of a virtuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, give their approbation only to thoſe who were, (conſidering their circumſtances) duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and virtuous, we might venture to affirm, ſcarcely an uneducated, irregular man would be ſeen in ſociety. Permit me then, Ladies, to ſay, on you it very much reſts to fix the boundaries of human im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. The Creator hath put it in your power to reform the world. Let not the idle, diſſipated cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſhare your careſſes, and the work is done. Doing this, you will have the honour of doing more than all the magiſtrates, moraliſts, and preachers in the world.</p>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the dignity, value, and happineſs a good education adds to the human mind, how ſurpriſing it is that, in this, one half of the human race have been ſo baſely neglected!—eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we conſider how a refined education in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032062_0021_0FF10A03CB5CA930"/>them reforms the world. This doubtleſs is a trait of barbarity. In the ſavage ſtate, where ſtrength is honour, the delicate female is depreſſed far below the dignity of her rank. As civilization and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement advance in families or nations, female education gains ground, Ladies aſſume their proper rank, and command reſpect. Happy am I to obſerve this trait of barbarity in our country, rapidly wearing away. May that glorious era ſoon commence, when a virtuous and refined education ſhall adorn the fair daughters of America—then diſſipated gallantry ſhall be baniſhed ſociety, and modeſt virtue be triumphant.</p>
            <p>IT is obvious to obſerve, that Good Inſtruction is another very eſſential particular in the means of advancing education.</p>
            <p>IT is as eaſy for the ſcholar to learn right as wrong. Let him be taught right, and his learning will be ſo of courſe. Whether he be ſo or not, the ſcholar, as he ought, thinks his teacher is right; follows his precepts, and copies his example. On theſe truths the following general rule is erected for the election of Inſtructors: Such a character, as you would wiſh your child to be, chooſe for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor. Would you wiſh your child to be a blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer and a gueſſer in learning, without points or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy; thus let his inſtructor be, and the work is done. Would you wiſh him vulgar in his diction, horrid in his pronunciation, and aukward in his manners; then chooſe an inſtructor of ſuch a mould.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032062_0022_0FF10A062445C828"/>But, as better ſuited to this enlightened age, in which we have the happineſs of living, do you wiſh, as I am perſuaded you do, to have your children right and accurate in their learning, eaſy and graceful in their manners, and ſentimental and regular in their morals, then chooſe for their Inſtructor, a ſcholar, and gentleman, and a chriſtian, and your ardent and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wiſhes, by the bleſſings of Heaven, will be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>IT is moſt painful and gloomy to the patriot and philanthropiſt, to obſerve, that the inſtuction of our youth has, through miſtake, or deficiency of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, too generally fallen into inadequate hands. But we are animated, happy in the conſideration, that the good ſenſe of the people is now rapidly correcting this miſtake. Raptures of enthuſiaſm fill our hearts in anticipating the golden era, when So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateſes ſhall again be ſchool-maſters.</p>
            <p>BUT in addition to good inſtruction, there muſt be great attention and exertion on the part of the ſcholar.</p>
            <p>WHERE the work to be performed is great, the time to perform it in ſhort, and the reward ample, every poſſible exertion is naturally called into act. This, my young Friends, is your ſituation, who are making the firſt advances in education. Your object, as you have already ſeen, is moſt great and noble: it is the improvement of your natures in every thing amiable, virtuous, and praiſe-worthy; that you may
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032062_0023_0FF10A086319E2B8"/>be ſatisfied with, and happy in yourſelves, joy to your parents, honor to your inſtructors, uſeful in this world, and happy in the next. To obtain that good education, which ſecures theſe great objects, is an amazing work: a work which calls for your greateſt attention, care, reſolution, induſtry, and moſt ardent prayers. Many difficulties are to be encountered, many ſelf-denials aſſumed. The hill of a literary and virtuous education is, in ſome parts, ſteep, crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and laberious. But be not diſcourage; its aſſent is more eaſy as you advance, and its ſublime ſummit is irradiated with a broad effulgence of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. On this ſummit fix your eyes, and no exertions will ſeem too great, no attention tedious.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY will this laborious attention be urged upon you, by the conſideration of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of youth. When the age of manhood arrives, as it ſoon will, the great objects of life, profeſſion, domeſtic eſtabliſhment and cares, duties to your country, and extended connections will crowd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and command your attention. The age of youth, when the mind is free from all theſe cares, is the time which God hath appointed to obtain education, and prepare for manhood. This time is too ſhort and precious to ſquander a moment of it, in uſeleſs trifles and amuſements. It is a miſtake that youth is the age for idleneſs and diverſion: it is the age for education, on which depend your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity, and greatneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:032062_0024_0FF10A09FA95A288"/>
I have reſerved for the laſt place, one of the moſt eſſential means to the promotion of literature, I mean, that of the encouragement and patronage of Government, and gentlemen of diſtinction and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
            <p>HONOUR and profit are objects which have a very commanding influence on the minds of men. Let the government of a nation, and its able cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, who have theſe to beſtow, amply confer them on teachers, and virtuous literary merit; and that nation will ſoon become diſtinguiſhed in ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation—Gentlemen of the firſt character and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will aſpire to the noble profeſſion of inſtructing youth—Youth will be animated, enthuſiaſtic in their attention, and thouſands of citizens emulous in the courſe of improvement. The golden ages of literature, which are immortalized on the page of hiſtory, in Greece, Rome, Florence, France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, all are replete with facts which teſtify to us the vaſt conſequence of this encouragement and patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But we need not go to diſtant ages and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the proof of this; our own proſperous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try affords us a ſufficient one. Thoſe States in the Union are the moſt diſtinguiſhed for the general dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of information, where the Legiſlature of the State and able individuals have been the moſt active and liberal in their encouragement and patronage. I preſume we ſhall not injure our ſiſter ſtates if we ſay Maſſachuſetts juſtly claims a rank among thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032062_0025_0FF10A0BAB8AD5D8"/>of this deſcription. Numerous, noble and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed are the monuments of her exertion in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of education. On theſe we might exhauſt the language of panegyric; but the recent inſtance of the liberal patronage of literature, which ornaments Briſtol County, and felicitates our preſent meeting, more immediately commands out gratitude, and claims a tribute of acknowledgment. The voice of duty is, let the magnanimous ſentiments of patriotiſm be a grateful return—The voice of duty alſo calls for a grateful tribute to the noble patronage of individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, with whom the Government have intruſted their character and liberal depoſite—And, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, with my own, I ſhall gratify the feelings of my audience, if I add, as another claim of our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the ſpirited, but, diſintereſted exertions of a diſtinguiſhed character,<note n="*" place="bottom">General <hi>DAVID COBB,</hi> who removed from <hi>Taunton</hi> is <hi>Gouldſbury,</hi> in the <hi>Province of Maine,</hi> a few weeks before the Academy was opened.</note> who now bleſſes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clime.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to ſay Gentlemen, by accepting the honourable appointment of Truſtees to our infant Seminary, you accept a great and Solemn truſt. The expectations of the community are juſtly upon you. On you it reſts to manage the Inſtitution, that it may, under your auſpices, effect the all-important objects for which God, and our Legiſlature deſigned it; the diffuſion of knowledge and virtue, among our fellow citizens. Your taſk is arduous, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility is great; but the dignity of the object, will not fail to animate the generous heart with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032062_0026_0FF10A0E0FD10AB0"/>zeal, and unremitting perſeverance. With ſuch an object in view, you have on your ſide the good wiſhes and ardent prayers of all the virtuous; you have on your ſide, the Providence of that God, who is the great Father of Lights, and Conductor of the Univerſe. Perſevere then with the ſame ſpirited, noble exertions with which you have begun; that Briſtol Academy may, in the diffuſion of literature and morality, be a great and permanent bleſſing to the county and community, and hold an honourable rank among the flouriſhing Seminaries which adorn and bleſs our country.</p>
            <p>IMPRESSED with grateful ſentiments for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and candour of this large and reſpectable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and convinced of the infinite conſequence of education to us all, I cannot but beg leave, in the cloſe of our ſubject, again to call your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it. It is from the want of education, that, notwithſtanding the native dignity of human nature, millions of our race are now low ſunk in barbarity; clothed with the unwrought ſkins of animals, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, as beaſts of prey, by the precarious events of the chaſe, covered with little elſe than the canopy of heaven, expoſed to all the elements of nature, hoſtile, and awfully cruel in their diſpoſitions, ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of their origin, or deſtination, of the one only living and true God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, worſhiping idols, and living and dying but a little exalted above the beaſts of the foreſt. It is from the want of education, and ſo of a juſt knowledge of the rights of man, that almoſt the whole of the human race have, from their firſt creation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032062_0027_0FF10A1121D41478"/>day, been draging out exiſtence under the iron ſceptres of tyrants and deſpots, and bleeding under the curſed laſh of ſlavery. It is from the want of education, or from an erroneous one, that the pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus has been ſo baſely maculated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed with ſuperſtition and abſurdity. The kingdom of antichriſt was laid in ignorance; and by this the Pope of Rome, for more than a thouſand years, ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the horrid ſceptre of eccleſiaſtical tyranny, over all the nations of Chriſtendom. It is from the want of a right education, that we have the humiliation and great unhappineſs, to ſee many of our fellow citizens inveloped in darkneſs and prejudice; many wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the demands of idleneſs and poverty; many moſt ſhockingly debaſed in the corruptions of obſcenity; many, for their outrages on ſociety, draging the chain in the horrid dungeon, or ſuſpended on the ſhameful gallows; many devoted to diſſipation, and the gratification of ungovernable appetites and paſſions. In ſhort, it ſeems not too much to ſay, that almoſt all the vices and evils of life may be traced back either to the want of an education, or an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous one.</p>
            <p>BUT how refulgent is the contraſt of a right education! By this all the dignified faculties of man are improved, and directed towards that exalted ſtate of perfection and happineſs for which the Creator deſigned him. By this he becomes conſcious of his own dignity, and riſes into ſelf-ſatisfaction, and enjoyment. By this he becomes uſeful to the world, a crown of glory to his friends, and reſpected and loved by all. By this he becomes acquainted with
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032062_0028_0FF10A136ADCC358"/>the wonderful works of God, which are every where ſpread around him—and by this he becomes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our holy religion, is impreſſed with its precepts, and directed to heaven. By education nations enjoy all the bleſſings of ſociety. Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, manufactures, and commerce, which bleſs mankind with all the neceſſaries and conveniencies of life, are perfected by the all-powerful hand of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. By this alſo the government of a nation is moulded, and its citizens riſe to a knowledge of the rights of man, and the enjoyment of civil liberty. In ſhort, by this only, a nation is made happy at home, and reſpectable abroad.</p>
            <p>SUCH then, my friends, being the immenſe value of education, let all embark in its cauſe. Let government, and able individuals offer their patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and encouragement. Let parents exhauſt their tendereſt affections in this glorious work. Let teachers realize and carefully diſcharge the amazing reſponſibility which lies upon them. Let both ſexes equally ſhare in thoſe exertions; let them be begun early, and no time be loſt. Let youth be impreſſed with the value of a good education, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious attention neceſſary to acquire it. Let their exertions be meaſured by the greatneſs and value of the work, and the brevity and value of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life, and correſpondent to the anxious wiſhes, prayers and exertions of their parents and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. As all of us are equally intereſted in the great and common cauſe, let us, in heart and hand, unite to advance it, and the bleſſigns of God will attend us.</p>
