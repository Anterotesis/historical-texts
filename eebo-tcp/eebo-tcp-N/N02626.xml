            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS not at all improper to add a Treatiſe of the Day of Grace, to a Diſcourſe concerning Converſion. This is the only time wherein he that turns will be accepted: Oh therefore receive not the Grace of God in vain. Though the ſinner by his iniquity is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved far away from God, the Gulph not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is not yet fixed. We are caſt out by Nature in a far Country indeed, but this Country is not Hell, though juſt upon the borders of Hell: a return is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto our Fathers houſe; and upon our return how joyfully ſhall we be embraced!</p>
            <p>One principal reaſon why Time is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding precious, is, becauſe it contains the
<pb facs="unknown:003114_0003_0FF087098670B268"/>
Day of Grace. This preſent time, though ſo very ſhort, is of greater value than an whole Eternity hereafter; for then mercy will be out of reach, and Reprobates unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably concluded in ſin, and under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy load of divine vengeance and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the Day of thy gracious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation: Waſte it not away in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or which is worſe, in doing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for there is another Day a coming, which will be a Day of darkneſs and of gloomineſs, a Day of diſtreſs and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if Grace and Salvation be neglected.</p>

                  <p>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>

            <p>THE time was now approaching in which our Lord was to make his Soul an offering for ſin, and to teſtifie his love to his Sheep, by laying down his life, to redeem theirs from death, which by going aſtray they had deſerved. And <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Stage, on which Chriſt was to act the greateſt part, both of ſorrow and affection. Well might he cry out, <hi>Behold ye that paſs by; Was ever Grief,</hi> and <hi>Was ever
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003114_0004_0FF086824C02EF98"/>
Love like Mine?</hi> Unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he comes moſt willingly, though he foreſaw the Croſs and ſhame. The Head was forward to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf, that hereby the ſufferings of the Members might be prevented. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was foretold by the Prophet, his approach is not with outward pomp and ſplendour; but he is meek and lowly, riding upon an Aſſes Foal. Thus he that thought it not robbery to be equal with God, made himſelf of no reputation, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this end, that we might be raiſed and exalted.</p>
            <p>When he was juſt at the deſcent of the Mount of <hi>Olives, the whole multitude of the diſciples began to rejoyce, and to praiſe God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had ſeen, v.</hi> 37. They cry <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, and bleſs the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, ſaying, Peace in heaven and glory in the higheſt, v.</hi> 38. Even through the darkeſt cloud of Chriſt's Humiliation, ſome beams and rayes of this Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of this Lord of glory, did break forth. The Phariſees are offended at the Diſciples Acclamations, and <hi>deſire Jeſus to rebuke them,</hi> v. 39. Unto which unreaſonable requeſt of theirs he makes this reply, <hi>That if theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out, v.</hi> 40. As if he had ſaid, My Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003114_0004_0FF086824C02EF98"/>
my Doctrine, my Actions, my Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ſo evident, that they who are not as ſtupid as the ſtones themſelves muſt needs be convinced.</p>
            <p>At laſt he comes within view of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the ſight of this faithleſs, ungrateful and obſtinate City, where ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had been kill'd, and which now it ſelf was ſo near to deſolation, raiſes a ſorrow in his ſacred breaſt, ſo that in the midſt of his Diſciples triumph he burſts out into tears, ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known; even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words expreſs how our Lord was affected towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Inhabitants. His commiſeration is very great, and 'tis joyned with a kind of exprobration or upbraiding of them: he pities their ſad eſtate, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids their ignorance, and folly, in not minding the things which would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their peace and welfare.</p>
            <p>The text may be thus divided.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Saviour mourns: <hi>When he came near, he beheld, and wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Perſons over whom: <hi>The City of Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The cauſes why, and they are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They know not, no not they</hi> who had ſo much means of knowledge, <hi>the things that belonged to their peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003114_0005_0FF08680C4B4B258"/>2. They improved not, but neglected <hi>Their day</hi> of viſitation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This neglect and ignorance of theirs being wilful, was puniſhed with a greater degree of blindneſs, <hi>Now they are hid from thine eyes,</hi> and that was a judgment moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable.</p>
            <p>Beloved, I am to ſpeak of the Day of Grace, I wiſh you may all know the things which concern your peace, elſe <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s puniſhment may be alſo yours; the day may be gone, the lights of the Sanctuary may be put out, and the things of your peace may be hid from your eyes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall illuſtrate the words of the Text by this enſuing Commentary upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City.</hi> The nearneſs of a miſerable object does affect the ſight and heart: And as with his eyes he ſaw the City, ſo by the eyes of Propheſie he ſaw the City beſieged, the enemy caſting a trench about it, and keeping it on every ſide; he foreſaw how it would be laid even with the ground by <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, and not ſo much as one ſtone left upon another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he wept over it.</hi> Theſe tears ſhewed the truth of his humane nature, and how (iniquity excepted) he was in all things made like unto his brethren. Our Lord
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003114_0005_0FF08680C4B4B258"/>
could hunger, and groan, and weep, and dye, but ſin indeed he could not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. It was the deſire of Chriſt to execute the Office which his Father had put him in, which was to be a Gatherer and a Saviour of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>: But when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thoſe Sheep transformed into Wolves, ready to devour their own Shepherd, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily reſolved to periſh, and to refuſe the ſalvation which he brought them; 'tis no wonder if he did not hold his tears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saying, If thou hadſt known, even thou.</hi> There is a mixture of grief and indignation in Chriſt, at the ignorance and perverſneſs of miſerable <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and this made his ſpeech to be abrupt and imperfect. <hi>Calvin</hi> tranſlates <hi>O ſi cognoviſſes!</hi> Our Lord wiſhes that they had known what ſo highly and nearly concerned them. But 'tis plainly implied that they <hi>knew not</hi>: and this is that of which the Prophet long ago complained, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Ox knows his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people do not conſider.</hi> This is very emphatical. As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, O thou <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> who haſt enjoyed ſo many means and mercies, and haſt ſlighted and abuſed them all, notwithſtanding all former folly and unkindneſs to God, to thy ſelf, I wiſh that <hi>even thou,</hi> wouldſt at laſt have open'd thy
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003114_0006_0FF086F803B3E810"/>
eyes and ears, and become wiſe unto thy own ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At leaſt in this thy day.</hi> That was a day of ſpecial viſitation. God who at ſundry times and in divers manners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, in that day ſpake unto them by his Son. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many Meſſengers and Servants which were ſent, had been deſpiſed and perſecuted to the death by them, yet at leaſt the Son ſhould have been reverenced. This was <hi>their</hi> day, a time in which they might have been accepted, a day in which ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was brought near to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The things which belong unto thy peace!</hi> Peace (according to the Hebrew phraſe) does imply all the parts of happineſs, the principal whereof does certainly lie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to, and enjoying God. But the way of peace and reconciliation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Juſtification by faith in Jeſus, they knew not. An humbled Meſſiah, who was <hi>to make Mens peace by the blood of his Croſs, Col.</hi> 1.20. they hid their faces from, and eſteemed him not: Being puffed up with their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and external priviledges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, they would not ſubmit unto the righteouſneſs of faith which is revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003114_0006_0FF086F803B3E810"/>
               <hi>But now they are hid from thy eyes.</hi> Chriſt here Sets forth the ſpiritual judgment which they lay under, and likewiſe removes the ſcandal and offence which his infirm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples might be apt to take, becauſe <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> did reject him. They had long refuſed to look unto the Lord, that they might be ſaved; and now God ſends them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear, and hearts that they ſhould never underſtand. This is a very ſore and yet uſual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Men receive the grace of God in vain, and are reſolved to walk contrary to the light which ſhines about them.</p>
            <p>The Text does yield ſeveral points of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding full of pity and compaſſion.</hi> His weeping here over <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> ſhews how kindly affectioned he was towards them, and is towards others in miſery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord does grant unto ſinners a Day of Grace, in which pardon and life are proffer'd to them, and may be obtained by them.</hi> If thou hadſt known in this thy Day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>To know in this Day of Grace the things which belong to our peace, is our great happineſs and wiſdom.</hi> If <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been ſo wiſe, her ruine would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Souls being thus left under darkneſs, their ſtate is wretched and deplorable.</hi> Our Lord with tears laments this ſad condition of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The firſt Doctrine is this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is exceeding full of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi> The tears which he ſhed prove this; and if tears will not ſatisfie, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you may behold him ſhedding of his blood.</p>
            <p>This compaſſion of Chriſt extends it ſelf to them that periſh, as well as unto thoſe he ſaves.</p>
            <p>To them that periſh, his compaſſion is ſeen in four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In cauſing the Light whereby he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to ſhine upon them.</hi> 'Tis a mercy that the loſt are told of a Saviour, that they are informed how ſin hath cauſed their miſery, and Chriſt is ſufficient to cure it. <hi>Tender mercy appears, that the Day ſpring from on high does viſit them that ſit in darkneſs, which can guide their feet into the way of peace, Luke</hi> 1.78, 79. They need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven,</hi> to underſtand the means of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003114_0007_0FF086864DEEA680"/>
fallen Mans recovery? <hi>The word is nigh,</hi> which can give a ſufficient information. 'Twas the great advantage of the <hi>Jews, that to them were committed the Oracles of God, Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. But now thoſe Oracles are pronounced more fully and plainly; and to enjoy them is the priviledge of ſuch, as in a Land of light have their lot given them. It was great mercy towards <hi>Capernaum,</hi> that ſhe was lifted up to Heaven, that ſuch words were ſpoken, that ſuch works were done in her; and becauſe ſhe improved not the mercy, how does our Lord upbraid her?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts compaſſion towards them that periſh is ſeen, <hi>in calling and inviting them to come to him:</hi> The Marriage-feaſt is prepared, and the ſervants are ſent into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, to invite all to come, and partake of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>Wiſdom cryeth without, ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth her voice in the ſtreets, ſhe cryeth in the chief places of concourſe; How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity? and ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? turn ye at my reproof,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. we read, <hi>Wiſdom hath killed her beaſts, ſhe hath mingled her wine, and furniſhed her table, ſhe hath ſent forth her mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſhe cryeth upon the higheſt places of the City; Whoſo is ſimple let him turn in hither; as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003114_0008_0FF08699227580B0"/>
for him that wanteth underſtanding, ſhe ſaith unto him, come eat of my bread, and drink of my wine which I have mingled; forſake the fooliſh and live, and go in the way of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> Thus ſinners are called after, and though Dogs, yet the ſame bread which is prepared for the Children is proffer'd to them; the ſame ineſtimable benefits of Chriſt, as pardon, peace, grace, glory, are tendred to them, which believers have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of; with the ſame eye-ſalve their eyes ſhall be anointed, with the ſame tried gold they ſhall be enriched; with the ſame white rayment all their nakedneſs ſhall be covered, if they will but come and cloſe with Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſts compaſſion towards them that periſh is ſeen, <hi>in waiting long that be may be gracious</hi>; he knocks at the door, and he <hi>ſtands</hi> knocking there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. He ſtands <hi>till his head is filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</hi> He ſees how Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath admiſſion at his pleaſure, and unto <hi>Mammon</hi> at firſt approach the door is ſet wide open to receive him, but againſt Chriſt 'tis lock'd and bolted; and yet his love and patience overcomes theſe indignities, and he waits ſtill to ſee, if at laſt ſinners will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their own good, and entertain him. Chriſt by his Spirit ſtrives long, checking
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003114_0008_0FF08699227580B0"/>
them from ſin, moving them to duty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating the reaſonableneſs of converſion and obedience, the danger of continuance in their provocations. Chriſt does not go away at the firſt repulſe, nor curſe the Fig-tree for the firſt years unfruitfulneſs, but he digs about it and dungs it, and expects a great while, before that ſentence be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt's compaſſion towards them that periſh, is ſeen, <hi>in wiſhing, when for their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap> they are given over to themſelves, that they would have hearkened and obeyed.</hi> Thus he weeps and wiſhes, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had known what they were ignorant of. And <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when for their deafneſs unto, and refuſing of God, they were given up to their own hearts luſts, and ſuffer'd to walk after their own counſels, the Lord wiſhes, <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my ways! Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12, 13. Thoſe that periſh will have no reaſon to complain of Chriſt, but of themſelves; he wanted not pity, but to themſelves they were unmerciful.</p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place; the compaſſion of our Lord is manifeſted, and that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to them that are ſaved; they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Veſſels of mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003114_0009_0FF08691D9AFED80"/>1. <hi>Chriſt receives thoſe he ſaves, though they come home in rags</hi>: The beggarlineſs of the Prodigal did not hinder his Father from running to him, and embracing him. Their emptineſs of worth doth not ſtir up his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but his pity. Chriſt hath enough, and to ſpare for them. Sinners ſhould not keep off from Chriſt, becauſe they cannot bring any grace of their own to commend them: He can put comelineſs upon thoſe, who by ſin are never ſo much deformed. When we come to our Lord we are over ſpread with a leproſie, (iniquity is fitly called by that name) and all our righteouſneſs is as filthy rags; now what mercy is it, that he takes away our filthy garments, and puts upon us the robe of his own righteouſneſs, and from that worſt ſort of leproſie doth make us clean?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt makes reconciliation for the ſins of thoſe who are ſaved by him.</hi> And conſidering what wo and miſery ſin unpardon'd expoſes the Children of Men to, 'tis an act of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to make an atonement for it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and faithful High-Prieſt, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</hi> That load of <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> which elſe would ſink them into the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003114_0009_0FF08691D9AFED80"/>
loweſt Hell, the Lord Jeſus takes off from the Heirs of ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt heals the wounds which their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enemies have made.</hi> The good <hi>Samaritan</hi> had compaſſion upon the Man that fell among thieves, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. Our Lord finds us in a worſe caſe; what wounds have our luſts and Satan made in our ſpirits? and truly they are incurable by any but this Phyſician. When the fiery Serpents had ſtung the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they looked unto the Brazen Serpent, and looking, they were healed preſently. That Brazen Serpent ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified Jeſus Chriſt; and although Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be never ſo much ſtung; yet He can expel the poyſon, and aſſwage the pain and anguiſh, and make the Conſcience firſt pure, and after peaceable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt gives reſt unto them that labour, and are heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11:28. Many are the burthens of Believers; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to caſt all their burthens upon him, and he promiſes to ſuſtain them. The curſe of the Law is a burthen, but <hi>Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems them from the curſe of the Law, being himſelf made a curſe for them, Gal.</hi> 3.13. They groan under the dominion of ſin, the bondage of corruption, but the Son of God pulls down ſins dominion, and makes them free indeed. Their poverty and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003114_0010_0FF0870E957BCD38"/>
cauſes them to ſigh and complain; but Chriſt Jeſus unlocks his unſearchable riches, which are ſuperabundantly ſufficient to repleniſh them. And he that commands <hi>the rich in this world, to be ready to diſtribute, to be willing to communicate,</hi> ſurely himſelf will in no wiſe be a Niggard of his ſpiritual Treaſures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt ſuccours thoſe he ſaves, in their temptation.</hi> In the Hour of temptation they very much need his pity and aid, and they have both. <hi>Dido,</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> ſpake thus to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who were caſt upon her Coaſts,

Hark to the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 18. <hi>For in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he knows how to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> He knows that believers enemies are above their match; that ſin, and the world, and the God of it would be too hard for them; therefore his own Power doth reſt upon them, which brings them out of the field more than Conquerours.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The ſecond follows, <hi>That the Lord does grant unto ſinners a Day of Grace, in which pardon and life are proffer'd to them, and may be obtained by them.</hi> If thou hadſt known in this thy day. This day we read of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7, 8 <hi>Wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Now Gods voice is heard, and that heart is both wicked and fooliſh, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens it ſelf. See alſo 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>We then, as workers together with him, beſeech you, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain: for he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccour'd thee; Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation</hi> Thoſe words (<hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccour'd thee</hi>) are ſpoken by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto Chriſt his Son. Chriſt himſelf had (in ſome ſenſe) a Day of Grace, in which the Father was well pleaſed with him; in which the Sacrifice, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up once for the ſins of all, was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; in which his ſtrong Cries for himſelf, that he might be carried through the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work of Mans Redemption, were heard; and accordingly he was ſuccour'd, and enabled to work out a compleat ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Children of Men. And hence it comes to paſs, that unto them alſo a day
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003114_0013_0FF08714795D93D0"/>
of grace is granted, in which they may be accepted, and ſalvation is brought near them, that they may lay hold upon it.</p>
               <p>My work in the handling of this truth will be: Firſt, to ſhew upon what account the Seaſon of Grace is called a Day. Secondly, to declare what are the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Day of Grace. Thirdly, to lay down the properties of it. Fourthly, I ſhall give ſome reaſons why ſuch a Day is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then conclude with the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Upon what account the Seaſon of Grace is called a Day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in regard of the light that then ſhines.</hi> The Son of Righteouſneſs is riſen, and this Day is made by that Suns ſhining. <hi>Light</hi> from the Goſpel <hi>ſprings up unto them, which</hi> elſe would have <hi>ſat in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death, Matth.</hi> 4.16. By this, light things are diſcover'd which were hid from Ages and Generations. Gods eternal counſel to glorifie his Grace in the pardon, adoption, cleanſing and ſaving of Men that have all ſinn'd, and thereby come ſhort of his glory, is by this light made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The light of Nature is but weak and dim, and cannot make it day; it gives ſuch a diſcovery both of God and ſin, as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003114_0013_0FF08714795D93D0"/>
to leave thoſe that ſin againſt God without excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. But the way how enemies may be reconciled it cannot ſhew. Nay, becauſe the firſt Covenant ran thus, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> the light of Nature doth ſtrongly incline us to put a confidence in our own works, than which nothing is more contrary to the Goſpel of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>But though the Light of Nature be apt to lead out of the way, as well as imperfect, the Light of the Goſpel is ſufficient. All that are now in glory made uſe of this Guide in their paſſage through the world. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. doth make a compariſon between the Light of Nature, and that of the Word: From the Heavens, Firmament, Sun, and Moon, and other Creatures, ſomething of the Glory of God may be diſcover'd: but then after he adds, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect</hi>; as if he had ſaid, From the Word ſhines forth a greater light, than from the Sun, and Moon, and Stars; a light, which guides infallibly to the Light that's everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And this Light is one thing, which makes the Day the text ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in that it is deſign'd for working.</hi> When the day comes, <hi>though the beaſts gather themſelves, and lay them down in their dens, yet Man ariſes
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003114_0014_0FF086A0BA0ED6B8"/>
and goes forth to his work and labour till the evening, Pſal.</hi> 104.22, 23. In like manner, this day of the Goſpel; though they, who are brutiſh, lay them down in the bed of eaſe, and fall aſleep in carnal ſecurity, yet ſuch as have the underſtanding of Men, will go forth unto their work and labour; and ſurely they who have luſts to mortifie, a world to overcome, a devil to reſiſt, and ſouls to ſave, have work enough to do. <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the day idle?</hi> (ſays our Lord in the Parable) <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6. Spiritual ſloth is now unſeaſonable and unreaſonable. Now is the time, and the only time, for working; <hi>Whatever therefore our hand finds to do, we ſhould do it with our whole might.</hi> The Painter gave a good reaſon, why in his Piece he was ſo accurate, <hi>In Immortalitatem pingo,</hi> I paint for Immortality; intimating, that the picture he made, was to continue in view after he was dead and gone: So we ſhould ſay, <hi>In Aeternitatem operamur,</hi> Our days work is for Eternity, therefore we dare not trifle. The Church is likened unto a Vineyard, and every one ſhould be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>in regard of the brevity and ſhortneſs of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi>; It cannot exceed the term of natural life, and how ſhort that is experience ſhews,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003114_0014_0FF086A0BA0ED6B8"/>
and the Scripture to affect us, doth expreſs by ſeveral notable ſimilitudes: Says the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>What is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. And <hi>Job</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Now my days are ſwifter than a poſt, they flee away; and ſee no good; they are paſſed away as the ſhips of deſire, as the Eagle that haſteth to the prey.</hi> How faſt doth the Poſt ride? how ſwiftly doth the Ship ſail? what haſte doth the hungry Eagle make to the prey? Such ſpeed, O Man, O Woman, thou art making towards another world. The Day of Grace ſhortens as thy life ſhortens; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the opportunities thou haſt loſt with grief, condemn thy folly, and be ſo wife as now to redeem time, by doubled care and diligence.</p>
               <p>And as this Day of Grace cannot exceed the bounds of life, ſo it may come to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod before. Long reſiſting of the Spirit, and ſtanding out againſt the means of Grace, the Lord may, and often doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, by reſolving, his Spirit ſhall ſtrive no longer, and that to the working of Grace, the means ſhall never be made effectual: The accepted time is not an <hi>Age,</hi> but a <hi>Day,</hi> and much of this day is gone already. Now as the Traveller being ſtraitned, as to time, makes the greater ſpeed, ſo ſhould we
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003114_0015_0FF086D40E9C3FE8"/>
in our Chriſtian race; we ſhould lay aſide the clogs of the world, and the <hi>weights of ſin, that we may run with</hi> the greater freedom and <hi>patience, Heb</hi> 12.1.</p>
               <p>We may obſerve great difference in the days of the year; very long they are in the midſt of Summer, in compariſon with what they are in the depth of Winter. And verily ſuch an inequality there is between the day of grace, which ſome have, and which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do enjoy. And what knoweſt thou, O ſecure ſoul, who reckoneſt upon a long ſeaſon yet to come, but that thy day of grace may prove as it were a Winters day, having not half ſo many hours, as to others are allotted! Rouze up thy ſelf therefore, and looſe no more of that time which is ſo exceeding ſhort at longeſt, and may be ſo much ſhorter than thou imagineſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Seaſon of Grace is called a Day, <hi>with relation to the night that is coming</hi>; and when the night is come, thy main work cannot be done, if then it be undone; and if it be undone, thou thy ſelf art undone for ever. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me while it is day</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>the night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, when no Man can work, John</hi> 9.4. When the day of the righteous concludes, they reſt from their labour, and their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; and though the night of death
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003114_0015_0FF086D40E9C3FE8"/>
overſpreads their earthly tabernacle, yet their ſpirits are made perfect, and 'tis an everlaſting day of glory with them. And on the other ſide, when the day of the wicked comes to a period, either they are left under invincible blindneſs, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and obduration; and how can they work then, unleſs the works of darkneſs? or elſe death finiſhes both the day of life and grace together, and then 'twill be too late to think of working, for they will be bound hand and foot, and thrown into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When you hear of a day of grace, withal remember, that the night and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are haſtning; and if ſo, for you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay that great buſineſs, for which this day is afforded, ſhews the worſt and moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious imprudence. Let me ſpeak to you in the words of our Lord, John 12 35. <hi>Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, leſt darkneſs come upon you; for he that walketh in darkneſs knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, I am to declare the priviledges of the Day of Grace. Theſe are priviledges of ineſtimable value: the loſs of theſe, and of the hopes that ever they will be again enjoyed, is one thing which makes Hell ſo ſad a place. A time of trade and thriving in the world, a time
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003114_0016_0FF086AFE2A7BFF8"/>
of peace, and plenty, and outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though to be pray'd for and prized, yet it is nothing near ſo much to be prized as <hi>the accepted time,</hi> as <hi>the day of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The priviledges of the Day of Grace are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>One is the enjoyment of the Word of God.</hi> Becauſe of this <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old was look'd upon as priviledg'd above the whole earth beſides, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.10, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments to the Children of Iſrael; he hath not dealt ſo with any nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them.</hi> The Saints in Scripture, whoſe eyes were more fully open, and whoſe judgments were more clear, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the worth of things, what an eſtimate do they put upon the Word of God! What was <hi>David</hi>'s judgment concerning it? He ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte! yea, ſweeter than honey to my mouth</hi>: And ver. 72. <hi>The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thouſands of gold and ſilver.</hi> Indeed this whole Pſalm may be called a Pſalm of praiſe, that is to ſay, of the Word of God; and <hi>David</hi>'s judgment is not to be undervalued, who is called, <hi>A Man after God's own heart.</hi> Holy <hi>Job</hi> eſteemed this Word at an high rate, when he made that profeſſion, it was valued <hi>more than his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003114_0016_0FF086AFE2A7BFF8"/>
food, Job.</hi> 23.12. Hence comes that Wiſdom, which the Topaz of <hi>Aethiophia</hi> cannot equal, and the price whereof is above Rubies.</p>
               <p>Now in the Day of Grace this Word is vouchſafed; you both have it to ſearch into it your ſelves, and you have it opened and applied by the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You may ſearch into it your ſelves.</hi> How many thouſands under Antichriſtian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, enjoy not this priviledge, to have the Scriptures in a known tongue? The Word is the Souls food: Cruel Papiſts! who deny the ſoul bread. The Word is the Key, which unlocks the Treaſures both of Grace and Glory: Cruel Papiſts! who take away the Key of knowledge, enter not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hinder thoſe that would. The Word is the Souls weapon, whereby the Wicked One is overcome: Cruel Papiſts! who took this weapon out of its hand, and ſo betrayed it into the hands of Satan. Though the command of Chriſt be expreſs, to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, Joh.</hi> 5 39. Though the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Let the Word dwell in you richly, Coloſ.</hi> 3.16. Though <hi>Timothy</hi> from his childhood was admitted to, and made acquainted with <hi>the Scriptures, which made him wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Though <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (with whom the other
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003114_0017_0FF08716070AA0A8"/>
Fathers generally as to this particular, agree) doth tell us, <hi>Hom.</hi> 9. <hi>in Epiſt. ad Col.</hi> That all evils are cauſed by the Scriptures igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Yet unto how many, under Popery, are the Scriptures denied?</p>
               <p>It was thus in this our Land not many ſcores of years ago, Romiſh darkneſs as thick here as in other places: But now the Buſhel is taken off from the Lamp of the Word, all may be enlightned and directed by it, which fooliſhly ſhut not their eyes againſt it. You have the Word in your houſes, in your hands; Oh that it were in more heads and hearts! You may daily have recourſe to this Word, for counſel, for quickning, and comfort; and if you will but give up your ſelves to it, that Promiſe ſhall aſſuredly be fulfilled; <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.22. <hi>When thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keep thee, when thou awakeſt it ſhall talk with thee.</hi> As the Word doth guide and guard them that entertain it, ſo it talks with them, it tells them of ſuch things, as draw forth their deſires, inflame their love, put them upon labour, and fill them with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>You have this Word opened and applied by the miniſtry of the Goſpel.</hi> Miniſters are yet with you, and that's a great priviledge, for <hi>with them</hi> Chriſt hath promiſed <hi>to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003114_0017_0FF08716070AA0A8"/>
to the end of the world, Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> 'Tis their buſineſs to divide the Word, and to give to every one his portion. They foreſee the ſtorm, and warn the wicked to turn and fly unto a place of refuge, they encourage thoſe who have true (though but weak) grace, and ſhew how thoſe Promiſes and Comforts, which they hear of, belong to them, though they are ſo apt to thruſt them away from themſelves. Miniſters, they do both bind and looſe, they bind the impenitent and unbelieving ſinner under the curſe, under wrath, and he is bound in Heaven; for the ſentence that the Goſpel paſſes upon him, is in Heaven ratified. But if the impenitent ſoul is broken, mourns for ſin, loaths it, leaves it; if the unbelieving ſinner, which before rejected Chriſt, receives him, then Miniſters have commiſſion to looſe him, whom before they bound, and he is looſed in Heaven; whom the Word declares juſtified, to be ſure the God of Heaven hath acquitted. And truly Miniſters bind with this deſign, that afterwards they may looſe; they denounce threats, that, ſinners being awakened and contrite, they may apply the Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe Ambaſſadours of Chriſt, come and intreat you to be reconciled unto God, and as they inform you upon what Articles he
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003114_0018_0FF0871794320370"/>
will be at peace with you, ſo they uſe many Arguments to work upon your conſciences and affections; they will not let you alone in your vanity, but Sabbath after Sabbath cry to you, and tell you, that when you ruſh into ſin you ruſh into a battel, and 'tis againſt that great God, who muſt needs be too hard for you: Who ever fought with him, and got any thing but blows, wounds and death? <hi>Who ever hardned himſelf againſt him and proſpered? Job</hi> 9.4. They are ever commending Jeſus Chriſt to you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how able, and how willing he is to ſave you, and how certain you are to be damn'd without him. And is it not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be thus importuned for your own good? to have bleſſedneſs and life in a manner obtruded and forc'd upon you? Now Meſſengers of Peace are ſent in this Day of Grace; now glad tidings are brought, that God is willing to be reconciled; but when once you come to the Region of darkneſs below, ſuch tidings will never come to your ears more.</p>
               <p>The greatneſs of this priviledge, to enjoy the Word, will further appear, if the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects of the Word of God are duly conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003114_0018_0FF0871794320370"/>1. <hi>The Word of God doth make the ſimple wiſe,</hi> Pſal. 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth underſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> Thoſe, whom Satan before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool'd, putting them off with husks inſtead of what is ſolid and ſatisfying, are by the Word made too wiſe for this ſubtle Serpent: Now they are undeceived, and perceive how little fruit they have had of their evil works, therefore they are aſhamed of them, and of their own folly, in giving way to them. The Word diſcovers the pearl of price to them, and makes them wiſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they ſell all to purchaſe it: This wiſdom which the Word infuſes, <hi>is not of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, which come to nought,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. The great ones of the earth may be prudent, in chuſing and ordering the means, for the attaining of the end which they aim at, but in the choice of their end, they diſcover the greateſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. All that greatneſs and glory, which they deſign, and themſelves alſo, will come to nought; Death will certainly and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily contract all their honour and power, and cover it with thoſe two words, <hi>Hic jacet,</hi> Here it all lies buried. But the wiſdom, which the Word imparts, makes us to look higher, <hi>at a better and more enduring ſubſtance, at an inheritance which never fades away:</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003114_0019_0FF086B851F57920"/>
And the word ſhews, how by ſanctification we may be prepared for that inheritance; and thoſe who are made meet to be ſo, ſhall at length be made partakers of it. While the Day of Grace laſteth, thou mayſt be made wiſe to ſalvation; but if this be not improved, <hi>in the greatneſs of thy folly thou ſhalt go aſtray, and dye without inſtruction,</hi> Prov. 5.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou Word doth raiſe the dead to life.</hi> That Voice, <hi>Ariſe ye dead and come to Jeſus,</hi> muſt needs be powerful, ſince upon it follows the firſt Reſurrection; <hi>John</hi> 5.25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> At the hearing of this Word of God, the Conſcience, which was before ſtupid, is ſtartled; the heart, that was all of ſtone, becomes a heart of fleſh, it is tender and ſenſible, it feels the weight of ſin and of the curſe, and longs to be freed from both, though before it matter'd neither. A new principle of grace is put into the Soul, whereby it is inclined towards God, and acts for him. The Lord is breathed after, and there is a deſire to pleaſe him now, as there was formerly to pleaſe the Fleſh, by fulfilling the Luſts of it. O diſmal ſtate to lie dead in ſin! to be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003114_0019_0FF086B851F57920"/>
ſenſeleſs and unconcern'd under ſuch a load! But that's a life indeed, to be alive to God. And while this Day of ſalvation continues, thou mayſt be queſtioned; but if this be loſt, the ſecond death will be thy portion, and then Life will be eternally far from thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Word doth cleanſe thoſe defilements, which nothing in the world can do away. The Word of God</hi> is compared to <hi>fire,</hi> and to an <hi>hammer; as an hammer</hi> it breaks the rocky heart, and then as <hi>fire</hi> it melts the heart, and from its droſs doth purifie it: <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean, through the Word which I have ſpoken to you.</hi> In the <hi>Word,</hi> as in a <hi>Glaſs,</hi> we may behold the abominable filthineſs, and vile ingratitude, that is in ſin; and alſo the <hi>beauty of holineſs</hi> is preſented to our eye; no wonder then, if the former be abhorr'd, the latter deſired. Beſides, the Word holds forth a Promiſe from the Lord himſelf, <hi>to make the ſinner clean,</hi> and that <hi>from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both of the fleſh and ſpirit, Ezek.</hi> 36.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. The Day of Grace is a day of healing; now thou mayſt be purged and cured of thy ſpiritual plagues; but if this ſeaſon be neglected, thou wilt dye of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This Word doth afford ſuch peace and joy, as the creatures cannot yield.</hi> Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, cannot yield ſuch <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e comfort.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003114_0020_0FF087191F849698"/>
Hark to <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.111. <hi>Thy teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have I taken as an heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> In ſenſual mirth the heart is ſad, miſgives, and is unſatisfied; but the Word makes the very heart joyful. In the Word, we may ſee at preſent the reconciled face of God, the frowns and other ſigns of anger gone, and it ſpeaks plainly of fuller manifeſtations, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater pleaſures, which are reſerved for hereafter, and the lively hopes of theſe, which are ſo near, as well as ſure and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, may well make the heart to leap for joy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This Word is able to build up thoſe who are converted, and to bring them ſafe unto their Country:</hi> 'Tis a means to increaſe the grace, which 'tis a means to work: As it is <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible ſeed,</hi> whereby we are regenerated and begotten again, ſo it is <hi>the milk</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we grow and thrive in holineſs. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.32. <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</hi> I might add, That even thoſe whom the Word doth not ſavingly change, yet it prevails upon many times a great way, it brings them near to the Kingdom, and 'tis their own fault that they miſs of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:003114_0020_0FF087191F849698"/>And ſeeing the Word of God hath ſuch effects, that the enjoyment of it is a great priviledge, is without controverſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <hi>is the preſence of the Spirit.</hi> The Word, and all other Ordinances, without the Spirit, are but like the carcaſs without the ſoul. He makes the <hi>Word quick and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and ſharper than a two-edged Sword,</hi> which alſo would be found but a dead and inefficacious Letter. 'Tis obſerved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hotter Climates, that when the Sun is up, and begins to ſhine, and ſcorch more vehemently, there is alſo a Wind ariſes to fan and cool the dwellers there, elſe thoſe Regions would be uninhabitable. In like manner, where the Sun of the Goſpel ſhines, there is the Wind of the Spirit; and theſe his gales, how refreſhing, how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are they? The acceſſes of the Spirit are much to be obſerved and eſteemed; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his concurrence, no advantage will be reaped by all the means of grace we uſe.</p>
               <p>If the ſeveral operations of the Spirit are conſider'd, 'twill be very evident what a priviledge of the Day of Grace this is, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his preſence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to convince.</hi> Though the ſecure ones of the world had rather be let alone to ſleep on and cannot
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003114_0021_0FF0870785E12850"/>
endure to be jogged by conviction; yet theſe convictions are great mercies. What the Spirit doth convince the world of, our Lord informs us, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. <hi>And when he is come, he will reprove or convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs and of judgment: of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me; of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more; of judgment, becauſe the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> The Spirit convinces Men of <hi>ſin</hi>; he ſhews the evil in it, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it, and among other ſins, that grand one of unbelief, that is to ſay, their rejecting Chriſt ſo long, and ſlighting and refuſing the remedy he proffers, is in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſet home upon their hearts to their affliction and humbling. He convinces likewiſe of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> as well as of ſin. He diſcovers the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all ſin may be covered; and this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs appears to be compleat and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe Chriſt is gone to his Father. Chriſt undertook by his ſufferings to ſatisfie for our offences; and if the ſatisfaction had not been full, he would never have been rid of the Curſe, which, ſin being imputed to him, was laid upon him; neither would his righteous Father have ſuffered him to have ſit down in the Throne with him. But now ſince he is gone to his Father, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003114_0021_0FF0870785E12850"/>
ſet down in the Throne, we may conclude, he hath paid the utmoſt farthing of our debt; and through him the Father is ready to ſhew grace and favour to us. And if the conviction and ſight of ſin caſt down, the diſcovery of this righteouſneſs may again revive. 'Tis a happineſs to ſee our ſcores, ſince we are ſhew'd a way how to have them all croſs'd; were it not for the ſight of the one, we ſhould never mind the other.</p>
               <p>Again, the Spirit doth convince of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> By <hi>Judgment</hi> we may underſtand, the condemnation of the impenitent and unbelieving, who, though they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſin, continue in ſin; and though Chriſt be proffer'd, ſtill refuſe to embrace him. <hi>The Prince of this world is judged,</hi> and condemned; and ſhall theſe, who ſin againſt a remedy (which the Devil never did) eſcape? No certainly, <hi>God, who ſpared not the Angels which ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, knows how to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgment to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 9. Or elſe by <hi>Judgment</hi> we may underſtand, the Government and Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>All power is given to him,</hi> and <hi>Judgment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his hand. Satan, the Prince of this world, is already caſt out</hi> and overcome. And if he <hi>hath ſpoiled principalities and powers,</hi> certainly <hi>all his foes will be made his foot ſtool.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:003114_0022_0FF086C55BC91D08"/>
Well then, it highly concerns all to ſubmit unto the Scepter of Chriſt, ſince elſe they will be daſh'd in pieces by him. And in this Day of Grace, Chriſt is ready to paſs by former rebellions, if you now will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to renew.</hi> 'Tis a difficult matter to charge an heart that is ſo unconceivably wicked as Mans is; and yet the Spirit doth effect this change; he ſhews his mighty power, in cauſing a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment love to be turned into a perfect hatred. Sin, which was lov'd better than the ſoul, better than ſalvation, the heart by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is turn'd againſt it, and how earneſt are the cries that it may not reign, no, nor live any longer! And Holineſs, againſt which there was a very ſtrong, though unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble antipathy, is now hungred and thirſted after; there is a tide which runs upwards, contrary to the former ſtream which ran downward. The Lord hath thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which before ſin and the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. <hi>The deſart is become as Sharon,</hi> and in the ruines which corruption hath made, there is a Temple for the Spirit of God to dwell in. The Day of Grace is the only time to be made new creatures in. Now thy earthly heart will be made heavenly, thy impure heart cleanſed, thy mind, which
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003114_0022_0FF086C55BC91D08"/>
was vain, carnal, enmity againſt God, may be made ſerious, and to approve, and ſubject it ſelf to the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis the work of the Spirit to guide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> They who are the children of God, are led by him, and 'tis <hi>in the way everlaſting that he leads them</hi>; they are directed into ſuch a path, as will certainly bring them to the everlaſting enjoyment of the Eternal God. Neither doth he only guide, but ſtrengthen; the Spirit puts might into their inner man, and makes them to hold on their way, till they come to the bleſſed end of it. <hi>We have all like ſheep gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, Iſa.</hi> 53 6. But in this Day of Grace, the Spirit is near, to chalk out a path, in which we cannot miſs of happineſs, and to help us over all the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, and difficulties, which are caſt in our way. The Spirit doth alſo comfort as well as ſtrengthen: He ſheds abroad the ſenſe of the love of God into the heart; and ſuch a joy iſſues from this ſenſe of love, that tribulation cannot turn into ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Many of them that periſh, have experience, while this Day of Grace continues, of the Spirits workings.</hi> The Spirit doth uſe a kind of holy violence, to hinder them from pulling down vengeance upon themſelves. Thus he did ſtrive with the old world in the day
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003114_0023_0FF0871BB9916188"/>
of their viſitation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. <hi>Chriſt was quickned by the Spirit, by which alſo he went and preached unto the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah.</hi> This place is wreſted, and may ſeem diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but the meaning is plainly this, That Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, by which Holy Ghoſt, accompanying the miniſtry of the ancient Patriarchs, he preached unto the impenitent ſinners of the old world, whoſe ſpirits are now impriſoned in hell, becauſe in their life time they were diſobedient to the Spirits voice, all the while the long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God did wait upon them. Thus the Spirit likewiſe did ſtrive with the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael, but they rebelled, and vexed the holy Spirit of God, Iſa.</hi> 63.10. 'Tis not an unuſual thing, for the Spirit to enlighten and awaken the Conſcience, to clap chains and fetters upon corruption, for a while, that it breaks not forth as formerly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain unto a frequent performance of duty. But the Soul hankers after its beloved luſts and vanities, grows weary of the Spirits reſtraint, grudges the time and pains which duty takes up, and wiſhes that the Spirit would go away, and accordingly the Holy Ghoſt departs from him. However this is

true, that the Spirit works much, and would more, were he not reſiſted. That's the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond priviledge of the Day of Grace, the preſence of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace, <hi>is liberty to come to the Throne of Grace.</hi> All fleſh is now invited to the Hearer of Prayers, and their prayers ſhall be regarded, if they no longer regard iniquity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Lord now is near, and may be found, Iſa.</hi> 55.6. His merciful nature inclines him to come to the help of them that need it. As he is near to give them that grace which they cry for, ſo to give them grace to cry after a right manner. We cannot ſo much as come that we may be help'd, unleſs we are help'd to come. The Lord is within hearing of all that call; who ever ſought him ſeriouſly and ſought in vain? He is ſo near as to hear our very wiſper'd ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to take notice of the inward groanings of our ſpirits, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.9. <hi>Lord, all my deſire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome may object, <hi>Doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, that the Lord and his ſalvation are far from the wicked? and therefore wicked ones have no encouragement to come to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, But if the wicked Man doth cry, that he may be renewed, and that his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003114_0024_0FF0871E445A6140"/>
both as to the guilt and practiſe, may be put far away from him, then the Lord will draw near immediately.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>God is not only in this day of grace willing to be found, but he ſeeks after us</hi> John 4.23. <hi>The true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> Fervent prayer is delightful muſick in his ears, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2 14 <hi>O my Dove, that art in the clefts of the rocks, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs; let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> The Lord is pleaſed to ſee us gather about him, and to hear us cry for this, and that, and the other mercy, ſince his mercies are ſo great a multitude, that he hath enough and enough for all. Nay, the Lord himſelf doth ſeek to us, and <hi>beſeech us to be reconciled,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And if he intreat us to accept of mercy, ſhall not we ſpeed in our intreaties for the obtaining of it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The promiſe which God hath made may now be pleaded.</hi> This is the time to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Covenant. <hi>Lord! thou haſt promiſed to blot out iniquity as a cloud; Oh when ſhall this cloud be ſcatter'd, that I may walk in the light of thy countenance! Thou haſt promiſed a new heart; when ſhall this heart of mine be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged! when ſhall it burn with love to thee, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003114_0024_0FF0871E445A6140"/>
indignation againſt ſin, which doth offend thee! Lord! Thou haſt promiſed to take away the heart of ſtone, and to transform the adamant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fleſh; Oh, why am I ſo hard and ſtupid! why, ſince I have ſinned ſo much, ſhould I ſorrow ſo little! Again, Thou haſt promiſed to make me clean; Lord, when, Oh when, will it once be!</hi> Thus may we urge the Promiſes, and he that made them will give us cauſe to adore his faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p>The worſt of Men, <hi>the chief of ſinners,</hi> may urge the promiſe of a new heart, and of waſhing from filthineſs, as long as <hi>they ſeek unto the God of Iſrael to do this for them, Ezek.</hi> 36.37. and are ſo far wrought upon, as to deſire to be ſanctified; the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſhall be made good to them, if their unbelief of God's power and truth be not an hinderance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Now in this Day of Grace the great High-prieſt ſtands ready to intercede for us.</hi> Never any ſincerely begg'd for pardon and for grace, but Chriſt pray'd that Prayer over again, and a gracious return was made to it. The Spirit alſo is ready to help infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to fill our hearts with ſuch deſires as ſhall be ſurely ſatisfied; and truly we have to do with a God, who of the beſt things, which are moſt needful, moſt deſireable, is always moſt liberal. Now are the <hi>mollia
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003114_0025_0FF0873F93AA9778"/>
fandi tempora,</hi> the times to ſpeak and ſpeed; but when this gracious ſeaſon is gone, ah then the loudeſt cries will be in vain; God will hear, Chriſt will intercede, the Spirit help no more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <hi>That now the way is open to the Kingdom.</hi> As you may come to the Throne of Grace, ſo 'tis poſſible to get into the Throne of Glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> Our Lord doth ſtand, as it were, with a Crown of Life in his hand, and ſays, <hi>Believe in me, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue faithful to the death, and this Crown ſhall be put upon your heads.</hi> The Kingdom is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the ſure way to the Kingdom is revealed. <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> that is, ſuch a bleſſed and glorious life, as will never by death have a period; and if you <hi>ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, and patiently continue in well-doing,</hi> this eternal life ſhall aſſuredly be given you.</p>
               <p>The fooliſh Virgins had a Day of Grace as well as the wiſe: The Bridegroom came, and the door was open; if they had been ready, they might have entred; but having loſt the opportunity, they knocked at laſt, but it was too late, the door was ſhut, and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003114_0025_0FF0873F93AA9778"/>
they were ſent away with, <hi>I know you not,</hi> Mat. 25. We read of <hi>a Ladder that reached from earth to heaven</hi>; now there is a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of climbing up thither: But there is no Ladder that reaches from hell to heaven: If this preſent day of ſalvation be loſt, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf alſo will be loſt for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another priviledge of the Day of Grace is this, <hi>That during this ſeaſon the ſtate of the wicked is not unalterable.</hi> 'Tis true, the Holy Ghoſt expreſly ſays, that impenitent and unbelieving ones are <hi>condemn'd already, John</hi> 3.18. Sentence of condemnation is paſt, but it may be repealed, if they at laſt are brought to mourn for their rejecting of a Saviour, and with their hearts <hi>believe in the Name of the only begotten Son of God</hi>; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this faith will be freedom from condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> There was condemnation hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them as well as to others, but now there is none, for they are in Chriſt, and ſhew it, by renouncing the luſts and works of the fleſh, and giving themſelves up to the Spirits guidance.</p>
               <p>They whom ſin hath ſet at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Chriſt, are called to come to him; and while this Day of Grace laſts,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003114_0026_0FF087219E5EDF30"/>
that word holds good, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> But when this day is done, then 'twill be, <hi>I will in no wiſe receive.</hi> The Lamb himſelf then will be full of wrath, and that's dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Lamb can pacifie the anger of God, but who can appeaſe the Lambs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? When the only Reconciler is himſelf irreconcileable; when the only Interceſſor is inexorable; when the only Saviour pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth with everlaſting deſtruction, what hope of help remains then?</p>
               <p>But as yet 'tis poſſible for Rebels to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a pardon, and to be made children. Though thou haſt ſinn'd thy ſelf near to hell, yet thou haſt not ſinn'd thy ſelf into hell. Though ſin hath abounded, if thou art brought by the entring of the Law, to a ſence how thy offences have abounded, <hi>Grace will much more abound, Rom.</hi> 5.20. The Lord hath turn'd and chang'd as bad as the worſt of you, and that which hath been done may be done again, ſince his hand is as mighty to ſave, and his Grace as free as ever.</p>
               <p>I have done with the priviledges of this Day of Grace. In the third place follow the properties of it, which are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This Day of Grace is uncertain, as to its duration,</hi> 'tis more uncertain than the day of life, for that may end before this doth:
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003114_0026_0FF087219E5EDF30"/>
Nay, the Day of Grace may be paſt, while the very means of Grace continue. The acceptable time was paſs'd with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Prophet was ſent to preach among them. Hark what a ſad Commiſſion he had, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Go make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed.</hi> 'Tis dreadful when the Word ſhall make the ear more deaf, and the Light the eye more blind, and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means the heart more groſs and ſtupid.</p>
               <p>The Sons of <hi>Eli</hi> had outſtood their day, and yet after this their Father admoniſhes them, and endeavours to reclaim them. They were laſcivious, and <hi>made themſelves vile</hi>; and <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid, <hi>'Tis no good report I hear of you, my ſons, ye make the Lords people to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him; but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for him? Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they hearkened not unto the voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi> When Drunkards, Sorcerers, Liars, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Worldlings, are reproved often, and will not hearken, who knows but the ſeaſon of mercy may be ended, and the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſlay them, to damn them: And if at the hearing of this they are unconcern'd,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003114_0027_0FF086D281A87FE0"/>
there is greater cauſe to fear (though we cannot abſolutely conclude) that 'tis ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>The day of grace is uncertain: the means of grace may be before you are aware re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The golden Candleſtick doth not ſtand ſo faſt in any place, as that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be took away. Tremble at that threatning uttered to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.5. <hi>I will come unto thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi> And although Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces remain, a bleſſing may be withheld from them. Thou doſt not know but every call may be the laſt time of asking, and Chriſt may for ever after hold his peace; and therefore preſently give conſent to be eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him; thou doſt not know, but that every motion of the Spirit may have his laſt ſtriving with thee, and if thou ſtill reſiſteſt, the Spirit may take his leave, and ſay, <hi>Fooliſh Soul, go on in ſin, go on to hell, I will not ſtrive any more to hinder thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Day of Grace is exceeding precious</hi>: This is the very flower and cream of time. What's the reaſon the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> begs, the Lord would <hi>teach him to number his days aright? Pſal.</hi> 90.12. What's the reaſon one Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time?</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:003114_0027_0FF086D281A87FE0"/>
Eph. 5.15, 16. and another adviſes, <hi>Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. Surely theſe holy Men ſaw more in time, than moſt in the world are aware of; they were ſenſible, the preſent time contains the Day of Grace; and that eternal Glory muſt now be got, or loſt for ever. If there were no hope at all of being reconciled unto God, of obtaining mercy, and finding grace, alaſs our time would be of no value! But we may without prejudice to truth affirm, that time is more precious than gold; for now only Chriſt, who is ſo precious, is to be received; now only the Soul, which is ſo precious, is to be ſecured.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calls this the <hi>accepted time, and the day of ſalvation:</hi> If now we come the Lord will accept us, and give his Son, himſelf, and freely all things to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Salvation, which ſince we are loſt we ſo much need, ſhall not be denied. This Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is called, <hi>Salvation of the Soul, Heb.</hi> 10.39. The better part, the Jewel which the Deſtroyer principally aims at, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to make his prey, is ſecured. This ſalvation alſo is affirmed to be <hi>great, everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſalvation to the uttermoſt.</hi> From the greateſt evils the heirs of ſalvation are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, everlaſtingly delivered, and that good work which is begun in them, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003114_0028_0FF087234D507668"/>
to the uttermoſt, and all of them ſhall ſtand in Glory, as ſo many Monuments of Power, and Mercy, and Grace, unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And is not the Day of Grace preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince a day of ſuch ſalvation?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This Day of Grace is a Day of Power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power.</hi> The Arm of the Lord is now revealed, in making the report of the Goſpel to be believed; the ſame power is exerted in raiſing a ſinner to the life of faith, that was ſhewn in raiſing up Jeſus our Lord from the dead. Strong holds are pull'd down, reaſonings againſt Religion, as if it were either abſurd, or intollerably burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, are ſilenced. Thoſe luſts, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bare all the ſway, have a deadly wound, which ſhall not be healed again. Sins do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is overthrown, and the world is overcome, 'tis now under foot, which uſed to have its ſeat in the very heart. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers find this day a day of power. They are powerfully drawn to Jeſus Chriſt, and as powerfully upheld and ſupported by him.</p>
               <p>And of this power the ungodly are not without ſome taſte and experience. Mighty convictions and reſtraints for a while they have, but by degrees they grow ſtupid, and get looſe again, and then fulfil their fleſhly
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003114_0028_0FF087234D507668"/>
and their worldly luſts with the greater ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs; juſt as water being dam'd up, when that reſtraint is taken away, doth run with greater ſtrength and ſpeed for having been reſtrained.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This Day of Grace it is but one, when this is gone, another is not to be expected</hi>: In Nature there is a viciſſitude of day and night, even at midnight 'twill not be many hours before the morning, and the light return, <hi>Soles occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere &amp; redire poſſunt</hi>; but the night which follows after the Day of Grace is everlaſting. The abuſed light of the Goſpel will be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with that which is called, <hi>The black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> Life indeed will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again at the general reſurrection, but another ſeaſon of mercy will not be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed. The Day of Grace is like the Dove, which <hi>Noah</hi> ſent the third time out of the Ark, when once 'tis flown away, 'twill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more. What mean the careleſs world to ſport, and play, and ſin away this golden ſeaſon? Every moment that ſlips by you is irrevocable; and 'tis but a little while, and the whole ſtock will be ſpent of this accepted time: Oh improve ſome of it, at leaſt, before it be all gone.</p>
               <p>If after death you were certain to be ſent into the world again, and to hear the joyful ſound of the Goſpel again, and that the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003114_0029_0FF08726583E67D8"/>
Lord again would try you, and wait that he might be gracious, then preſent carleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were not altogether ſo much without apology. But ſince immediately upon your diſſolution, you muſt go to your long, your eternal home, either of weal or wo, Oh let Eternity, which is juſt at the door, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, before this your day be ended.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the Properties of the Day of Grace. In the fourth place I am to lay down the Reaſons, why ſuch a Day of Grace is granted. Several reaſons of this may be aſſigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>One ſhall be drawn from the Son's Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taking our nature on him.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that unto Man ſuch kindneſs is expreſſed. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Verily, he took not on him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham, Heb.</hi> 2.16. He was made in the likeneſs of Men, therefore mankind is the dearer to him. There is a difference put between apoſtate Angels and fallen Men; I ſpeak even of thoſe, that through their own wickedneſs and folly miſs of ſalvation. The reprobate Angels never had a remedy provided, nor a Day of Grace afforded; Chriſt aſſumed not their nature, but as ſoon as ever they had ſinned, they fell, like lightning, ſuddenly, in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003114_0029_0FF08726583E67D8"/>
of an eye, from Heaven to Hell. But Man was not thus dealt with; even thoſe whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>Veſſels of Wrath fitted to deſtruction, are yet endured with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, Rom.</hi> 9.22. Their ſalvation is in it ſelf really poſſible, I ſay, <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> though all things conſider'd, there is an impoſſibility of any other event, than the deſtruction of ſinners continuing in their rebellions; and this real poſſibility of ſalvation will make them caſt the whole blame of their perdition on themſelves, that the day of ſalvation was trifled away, and the ſalvation of that day was neglected.</p>
               <p>This matter may be made more obvious and plain by a ſimilitude. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26. admoniſheth the Centurion, who was to conduct him to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the voyage they were about to make, would be with much damage and hurt, not only of the lading and ſhip, but alſo of their lives. Who can deny, that the tarrying in the Haven where they were, and where they might have been in ſafeguard, was in it ſelf really poſſible? and they could not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lay the blame of their ſhipwrack on God's decree and determination, but upon their own raſhneſs. In like manner ſinners are admoniſhed, that if they go on in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs 'twill be to their hurt and eternal
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003114_0030_0FF086DD175217C0"/>
damage, not only of their lives, but alſo of their ſouls. Who can deny, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from ſuch and ſuch ſins is really poſſible? therefore God's decree is not to be blamed (which brings no coaction upon the will of Man) but Mans own perverſneſs, if he is wrack'd, and miſcarries to eternity.</p>
               <p>We read of the <hi>kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards Man appearing, Tit.</hi> 3.4. The Son of God was manifeſted in the fleſh of Man; and upon this ſcore it is that light comes into the world, and ſhines even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe dark ſouls that are unwilling to comprehend it, and ſalvation is proffer'd alſo unto them that refuſe to embrace it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the power of God may be known.</hi> His power is much ſpoken of in the Goſpel, and believers feel the wonderful effects of that power. We are inform'd of a twofold Creation, the firſt and the ſecond, the old and the new: In the firſt Creation, the power of God was glorious indeed, in making the world out of nothing; but here, as there was nothing to help, ſo there was nothing to reſiſt this power of God: But in the new Creation, in making new creatures, there is a great oppoſition and reſiſtance met withal, and how glorious is the power of God that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it? What wonders are wrought in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003114_0030_0FF086DD175217C0"/>
this Day of Grace by the hand of the Lord? He not only ſays, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> where darkneſs is, but where darkneſs is loved: He not only ſays, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> to them that are dead, but to them that are unwilling to be raiſed. <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> and <hi>oppoſition</hi> likewiſe are to be found in ſinners, when the Lord firſt comes to work upon them. The Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock cannot endure the yoak, though hereby its life is lengthened; for the beaſt that works not is fatted immediately for the ſlaughter. A ſinner is likened <hi>to a bullock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to the yoak, Jer.</hi> 31.18. he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a great reluctancy and unwillingneſs to yield; now in turning ſuch an one (with whoſe corruption and luſts Satan joyns, to hinder converſion) the power of God is the more to be admired.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Day of Grace is granted <hi>for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of divine goodneſs and mercy.</hi> The Lord is ſaid to <hi>delight in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18. therefore he allows a day, in which mercy may be had, and now it is to be obtained or never. It is not ſmall mercy that raiſes the ſons of Men out of thoſe depths of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into which they are fallen: <hi>Great is thy mercy towards me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; and the greatneſs of it is demonſtrated, <hi>for thou haſt redeemed my ſoul out of the loweſt hell.</hi> And if the unworthineſs of Man be duly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003114_0031_0FF0872DAA000F58"/>
conſidered the freeneſs of this mercy is to be admired, as much as the abundance of it. Mercy is free, as well as plenteous; 'tis expreſſed not only above deſert, but without deſert, nay contrary to deſert; therefore according to that ancient Fathers phraſe, 'tis <hi>Omni modo gratuita,</hi> free every way, Hence it is, that Saints have uſed that as an argument to obtain mercy, which one would have thought ſhould have quite diſcouraged them from entertaining any hopes of it, namely, <hi>the greatneſs of ſin.</hi> Pſal. 25.11. <hi>For thy Name ſake pardon my iniquity, for it is great</hi>; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I know 'tis thy deſign in this day of grace to manifeſt and to magnifie thy mercy; and the greatneſs of my ſin will ſerve to ſet thy mercy higher; the richneſs and freeneſs of it will be the more wondred at, becauſe ſhewn to a groſs tranſgreſſor.</hi> Mercy, nay, abundant mercy is expreſſed in juſtifying the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in quickening the dead, and <hi>begetting them again to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. And this is the only ſeaſon; if it be not now laid hold on, it will be clean gone for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the Lord's long-ſuffering and forbearance may be wondred at.</hi> He is an eye-witneſs of all the wickedneſs that is done againſt him; he hates all the ſin he ſees, and can eaſily take vengeance upon the committers of it; he
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003114_0031_0FF0872DAA000F58"/>
ſtands not in the leaſt need of any of them, and yet he ſpares them, and that a great while: Oh how great is the ſtock of his Patience! <hi>Lord, what is Man, that thou doeſt forbear him ſo long, ſince thou canſt ſo eaſily cruſh him? How comes it to paſs, that thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt call after him to benefit him, ſince thou canſt not be benefitted by him? and notwithſtanding many Provocations, art unwilling he ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh?</hi> Oh wonderful Patience, that will leave the abuſers of it without any the leaſt Apology; and that will be matter of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting marvel to thoſe, who hereby are led unto Repentance!</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Day of Grace is granted, <hi>that the Righteouſneſs of the Lord in thoſe Severities, which are ſhew'd upon the impenitent and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, may be the more evident and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> He will be juſtified when he ſpeaks, though never ſo amazing a Sentence be utter'd by him; <hi>he will be clear when he is judged:</hi> Sinners who had a day of Grace and loſt it, an acknowledgement will be extorted from them, that they are juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, with the loſs of endleſs Bleſſedneſs, which they frequently heard of, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſlighted.</p>
               <p>When God ſhall thus plead with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent at his Bar; <hi>Did not I give you a day as well as others? Did not I call you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe?
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003114_0032_0FF086E30BD01FC8"/>
Did not I ſtretch forth my Hand, and you diſregarded me? Did not I give you Counſels, and Reproofs, and you ſet them all at naught</hi>? And thereupon ſhall bid them depart away, never to ſee his Face more: How will all the Saints and Angels approve of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and cry, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, becauſe thou haſt thou judged!</hi> and the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent will not have one Syllable to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>Now I deſcend to the Application: And I ſhall begin with ſome Conſectaries, that may be drawn from the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In this day of Grace, to ſleep is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. Let us not ſleep, as do others,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>but let us watch, and be ſober, for they that ſleep ſleep in the Night, and they that are drunken are drunken in the Night; but let us who are of the Day be ſober, putting on the breaſt-plate of Faith and Love,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.6, 7, 8. How long wilt thou ſleep, O ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Conſcience? when wilt thou awake? ſhall nothing force thine Eyes open? The Enemies of our Salvation are far from ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they ply their Buſineſs to bring about our ruine, and ſhall not we awake for our own ſecurity? How can we watch, unleſs we are awake? And if we are not vigilant, how certain are we to be devoured by the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003114_0032_0FF086E30BD01FC8"/>
roaring Lion? <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light</hi>; and light being given to ſee withal, <hi>ſee that thou walk circumſpectly.</hi> The Sun of Righteouſneſs is up, and ſhining, therefore we ſhould be up and doing. Sloth in this mid-day of the Goſpel is unſuitable as well as dangerous; the Apoſtle therefore cautions againſt it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them, who through faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience inherit the promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lethurgy of the Conſcience is a ſore malady; when the Sinners heart is ever and anon ready to drop aſleep, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Means which are uſed to rouze it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But though Threatnings, though Judgments will not awaken ſome, that are ſeized upon by the Spirit of Slumber, yet I'll tell you what will do it; The ſight of an angry ſin-revenging Judge upon the Tribunal; the ſeeing and feeling of the Torments of Hell, will awaken them that are moſt faſt aſleep in Sin: What, wilt thou ſleep upon the pit's brink? Uſually Sinners fears leaſt, when becauſe of the nearneſs of Evil, they have moſt reaſon to be afraid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How much beſide themſelves are they, whoſe whole employment is the works of darkneſs in this day time?</hi> The Apoſtle exhorts us, <hi>to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003114_0033_0FF086F644405930"/>
caſt off the works of darkneſs, and to put on the armour of light, Rom.</hi> 13.12. Light is a kind of armour, for the light making a diſcovery of ſins deceitfulneſs, the heart is hereby arm'd againſt temptation; but becauſe moſt do love their evil deeds, therefore they hate the light which doth diſcover and reprove them. Alas, that ſuch bad work, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Satan and divers luſts is, ſhould have ſo many hands to it! The works of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs are rightly termed, <hi>the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; the actors of them fly the light, for when they are ſeen they cauſe ſhame; and from God, who is light, they hinder us: allowance of theſe, and fellowſhip with him are inconſiſtent; moreover, unto <hi>outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> theſe works have a moſt certain ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
               <p>Now ſhall a Day of Grace be conſumed in ſins drudgery? This was given as a day of ſalvation, and ſhall we in it work out our own condemnation? Shall it be ſpent in making ſure of Hell, and <hi>treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath?</hi> When the Lord doth grant us a day to make our peace, ſhall we give this day to Satan, and do nothing, but by wicked works more alienate our ſelves, and make the wall of ſeparation higher? If the ſeaſon that was allotted for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mercy be abuſed, only to the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003114_0033_0FF086F644405930"/>
of ſin, and augmenting of miſery, this will argue you guilty of ſuch a folly and madneſs, as muſt be confeſs'd beyond hyperbole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What cauſe is there of thankfulneſs for ſuch a Day of Grace?</hi> The Iſraelitiſh ſervants prized the year of Jubilee, and much more ſhould we this, <hi>acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> Liberty and freedom from our ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is now offer'd, and may be obtain'd, if you will not let ſin and Satan boar your ears, as it were; if you ſay not, as moſt do, <hi>We love theſe maſters, and we will not leave them.</hi> The greatneſs of our obligation to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for this Day of Grace, will be further evident, if theſe things are weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The light doth ſhine more clearly in this our day, than it did of old.</hi> The ancient Jewiſh Church enjoyed but the dawning, or at moſt, the early morning of this Day of Grace, but we the noontide of it; many ſhadows of good things to come they had, whereby thoſe things were obſcurely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; but we have under the Goſpel the ſubſtance exhibited, and the ſhadows are flown away. <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great Prophet of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had a vail upon his face, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that his was a more dark diſpenſation; <hi>but we all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of God, are
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003114_0034_0FF086EC939A72A8"/>
changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Chriſt is now more fully diſcover'd, his ſweet Offices more explain'd, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious benefits more gloriouſly diſplayed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We ought to be thankful that this our day hath ſo long laſted.</hi> The Lord long ago might have <hi>given us up to a reprobate mind,</hi> nay, fetter'd us in chains of darkneſs, becauſe of our hating knowledge, and <hi>holding the truth in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> 'Tis a wonder, that having ſinned ſo much againſt the light, we have not ſinn'd the light away. I read, that at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s requeſt, <hi>the Sun ſtood ſtill in the Firmament, and haſted not to go down for an whole day, Joſh.</hi> 10.13. And have not we had experience of the like miracle of Grace? Hath not the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſtopt his courſe, not haſting to go down? How long hath Chriſt ſtood waiting? and ſtill he ſtands proffering both light and life, and light and life ſhall be given to them that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the value of ſuch offers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Eſpecially we have cauſe to praiſe, if this Day of Grace hath been effectual, and we have been made the children of light, and of the day.</hi> Moſt even in this Day of Grace, are blinded by <hi>the God of this world</hi>; the Goſpel is to them an hidden Goſpel; but if the <hi>Lord, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003114_0034_0FF086EC939A72A8"/>
hath ſhined into our hearts,</hi> and hath <hi>called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> ſure we have abundant reaſon <hi>to ſhew forth his praiſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. If he had not enlightened our eyes, we ſhould have ſlept the ſleep of death as well as others. Was there not a time, when we did not ſee either our ſin, or our extream danger? Was there not a time when we were as unſenſible of the worth of ſouls, and of our need of Jeſus, as the moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ones? Oh wonderful love, that he hath made the difference, and diſtinguiſhed us from others! that hath illuminated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted us, when others are ſuffer'd ſtill to run on blindfold towards ruine!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Since ſuch a Day of Grace is granted, <hi>the ſpecial ſeaſons of it ſhould be improved.</hi> The whole is precious, but ſome ſeaſons are more golden, and to be eſteemed at an higher rate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Seaſon of Youth.</hi> This is the fitteſt time to ſow the ſeed of Grace, that it may bring forth the fruit of life and glory. The journey towards the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is long, the diſtance which ſin hath ſet us at from our Creator is great, therefore to be ſetting forth betimes is a great part of wiſdom: The Lord doth take it well, when in our youthful days we make choice of him. <hi>Samuel, Obadiah, Joſiah, Timothy,</hi> have a
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:003114_0035_0FF087355554D4A8"/>
commendation given them, that they knew, and loved, and feared God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; that they abſtained from, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe luſts and vanities, with which youth moſt commonly is enſnared and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The time of youth is a time of ſtrength, vigour and activity; then you will either do much for God, or much againſt him. In the ſervice of ſuch a Maſter as the Lord is, how well will your ſtrength be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Activeneſs will here become you. Early remembrance of God will prevent abundance of ſin, which might cauſe bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many years after. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me,</hi> ſays <hi>Job, and cauſeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth, Job</hi> 15.26. and it will have great influence to your ſtedfaſtneſs with God all your days.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta, recens, ſervabit odorem</l>

               </q>
               <p>The cask retains the ſcent of that a long time after, which was firſt put into it, when 'twas new. And in like manner, if youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful years are ſeaſon'd with grace, the <hi>gray hairs will be found in the way of righteouſneſs</hi>: Prov 12 6. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003114_0035_0FF087355554D4A8"/>
from it.</hi> Add alſo, that in the time of youth ſin is more eaſily pluck'd up, becauſe it hath not taken ſuch deep root. Age and cuſtom will make evil, like the ſpots of the Leopard, and the blackneſs of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> which no water can waſh away. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Confeſſions, l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 5 doth make this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, <hi>E<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

To ſee young faces ſet towards <hi>Sion,</hi> the way thither being diligently enquired after; to behold children turn Soldiers in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare, fighting under Chriſts Enſign, making the Tempter flee from them, taking Heaven by ſtorm and violence; what a brave ſight is it!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Seaſon of Health is another ſeaſon to be improved.</hi> Then the body is a more fit
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003114_0036_0FF086F4BA81EBA8"/>
inſtrument to ſerve the ſoul in the Lords ſervice. The time of ſickneſs is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a time of ſpending; therefore in health you ſhould be treaſuring up good ſtore of Grace. Now you may attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick Ordinances, you may come to Gods Houſe, and ſit down at his Table; but ſickneſs will deprive you of ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Now you ſhould be labouring for Grace, and trying your grace, that you may not be deceived with what is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. You ſhould be ſo wiſe, as to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the evil day of affliction and infirmity a coming, and beg beforehand for ſuch a meaſure of Faith as may make you ſtand, ſuch a meaſure of Patience and Submiſſion, that there may not be the leaſt repining thought againſt God; but whatever your trials are, that you may not faint, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiece in the wiſdom and grace of him, by whom you are chaſtized. Beg alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for a ſenſe of his Love, and when you ſee the rod in your Fathers hand, none of the ſtripes will be intollerable. Let health be thus improved: And to perſwade you, conſider, that what you do in the day of health will be more upon choice, and not upon force, and conſequently your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity will be the more evident; whereas if you are forced to ſeek the Lord by his
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003114_0036_0FF086F4BA81EBA8"/>
ſmiting of you, whether your hearts are right, may be ſuſpected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Seaſon of ſpiritual Plenty ſhould alſo be with care and diligence improved.</hi> When heavenly Manna falls thick about your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, ſhall none at all be gathered? When ſo much ſeed is ſown, ſhall the Fowls of the Air be ſuffered to take all away? or if you do receive this ſeed, ſhall it be choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the world, and bring forth no fruit to perfection? Let every one in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think thus with himſelf, <hi>How many ſcores of Sermons have been preached to me? how many warnings have I had? how many reproofs have been given me? how often have I been exhorted to obedience? how many prayers have I joyned in? But what fruit have I to ſhew of all? What grace have I gotten? what luſt have I got the maſtery over? Where's the faith, the love, the zeal, the holineſs and humility, which might have been attained if theſe means of grace had been, as they ought to have been, improved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ordinances in abundance are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed: ſhall they be but prices in the hands of fools? Where the Lord gives ſo much, to be ſure he will require the more. Oh lament your paſs'd non-proficiency, and for the future let your whole heart be in every duty; be moſt earneſtly deſirous to get
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003114_0037_0FF087373AEBFC00"/>
ſomething from God every time you draw near to him. You neglect your own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, when you do his work negligently. Ordinances are the pipes through which grace is conveyed to thirſty ſouls; there is never a duty you engage in, wherein this truth ſhould not be conſidered and believed. <hi>In this duty God can give me that which is of greater worth than the whole world;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon you would not in Ordinances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but obtain the benefit of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lords Day is another ſpecial Seaſon of the Day of Grace</hi>; let it not be prophaned, but husbanded to the beſt advantage. They who keep holy the Sabbath day, and find the Lord owning that ſanctification of his day, by ſanctifying, and quickning, and refreſhing their hearts upon it; as they are clearly convinced, ſo they are glad the Sabbath is moral, they would not it ſhould be otherwiſe. 'Tis but reaſonable they ſhould give the Lord one day in ſeven; and no day is ſo much their own, ſo much for their ſpiritual, which is the trueſt gain, as this which they give to him: It may not only be called <hi>the Lords day,</hi> but <hi>the Souls day</hi> likewiſe. Worldly thoughts, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and employments, which on other days are allowed, be now forbidden, that the Soul with greater intenſion may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003114_0037_0FF087373AEBFC00"/>
and proviſion made for it. Now Gods mouth is open, he ſpeaks to us; his ear is open, we may ſpeak to him; and if we hear and obey his voice, he will not fail to hear and grant our requeſts. The priviledge of enjoying Sabbaths, one of our Engliſh Poets doth no leſs piouſly than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly ſet forth.</p>

'Tis a notable paſſage of <hi>Gregory, Hom.</hi> 12 <hi>is Evang.</hi> If every one knew (ſays he) when he were to go out of this preſent world, then he might more reaſonably allot this part of his time for pleaſure, and that for repentance, <hi>Sed qui poenitentiae veniam ſpopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, peccanti craſtinum non promiſit.</hi> But he that promiſes pardon to them who repent of ſin, hath not engaged to give another day to them that go on in ſin. Let two things here be laid to heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Preſumption is the way to make the Day of Grace altogether unavailable.</hi> Men will not ſeriouſly mind eternity, while they think they have time enough before them. Thou who reckoneſt upon many Sabbaths yet to come, and upon many Sermons yet to be heard, the preſent Sabbaths are loſt, and the preſent Sermons are little heeded, leſs practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and thou thy ſelf leaſt of all profited.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Preſumption is the way to ſhorten this Day of Grace, and to haſten the everlaſting nights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</hi> The evil ſervant that ſaid in his heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>The Lord of that ſervant will come in a day that he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> him, and in an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:003114_0039_0FF087390935F0D0"/>
that he is not aware of,</hi> much ſooner than he was aware, <hi>and cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, Mat.</hi> 24.48, 40, 50, 51. The rich Man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preſumed upon many years, but he had not many hours of his time remaining; God called him <hi>Fool,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>This night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> If an earthly Maſter bid his ſervant go and work to day, and he anſwer, he will ſet about his work a week, or a month hence; how can the Maſter chuſe but be provoked? he juſtly turns that ſervant out of doors, allowing him no longer time to tarry. The Lord, in like manner, bids the Sons of Men to work to day; If they anſwer, Many years hence 'tis time enough; How can he chuſe but be incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his diſpleaſure may cauſe the ſeaſon of mercy to end ſuddenly.</p>
               <p>Now that I may further ſtrike at and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this preſumption, I ſhall propoſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer one Caſe of Conſcience. <hi>When have ſinners cauſe to fear that the Day of Grace is growing towards evening, and ready to conclude with them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. One ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is, <hi>long and unbewail'd unfruitfulneſs</hi>: When they who have lived under the means
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:003114_0040_0FF0873B6B274D60"/>
of Grace, are either empty Vines, or bring forth fruit unto themſelves: when the Lord hath come, not three years only, but ten, twenty, thirty years together, ſeeking fruit, but hath found none; and (which is worſt of all) their barrenneſs is not their burthen; 'Tis to be feared, that the axe will ſpeedily be laid to the root, that they will quickly but cut down, and be made fuel for that fire that is unquenchable. You have a notable Parable of a Vineyard planted in a very fruitful hill, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>'Twas fenced, the ſtones were gathered out; but when grapes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, behold nothing but leaves, and wild grapes,</hi> ver. 4. But upon this God reſolves <hi>to take away the hedge, and his vineyard ſhall be eaten up, to break the wall, and it ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down; he reſolves to lay it waſte, it ſhall not be pruned nor digged, there ſhall come up briars and thorns, and the clouds are commanded to rain no rain upon it,</hi> ver. 5, 6. You that have been long unfruitful, and this hath never troubled you, how ſoon may the clouds be commanded to rain no rain upon you? how ſoon may the influences of heaven be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether withheld from you? how ſoon may barrenneſs be your puniſhment, which is your ſin, the Lord in judgment reſolving, that never fruit ſhall grow upon you?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:003114_0040_0FF0873B6B274D60"/>2. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>great ſecurity.</hi> The old world were thus ſecure, when the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtrive with them. Great ſecurity was the forerunner of the <hi>Jews</hi> rejection. They would not believe their ſins were ſo heinous, or that God was ſo much diſpleaſed with them; they would not believe the Meſſiah, who told them of their maladies, and proffer'd to cure them. And the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tells us, <hi>becauſe of unbelief they were broken off,</hi> Rom. 11.20. And ſuch ſecurity will go before the end of the world, when the Day of Grace ſhall conclude with all, and when time it ſelf ſhall be no longer: How far are ſecure Souls from being in a ſecure ſtate? <hi>When they cry peace and ſafety, how ſuddenly may trouble and deſtruction come upon them, which they ſhall not eſcape?</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>unlamented indifferency, whether or no it do continue.</hi> If you are of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſpirit, whether you enjoy the light, or it be put out in obſcurity; whether you hear the publiſhers of glad tidings, or whether their mouths be ſtop'd; there is reaſon to be afraid the Lord is about to diveſt you of thoſe priviledges, which you know not how to value. If you look upon ſpiritual dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003114_0041_0FF086FC20B74650"/>
as no plague, which is infinitely worſe than that of <hi>Egypt</hi>; if you eſteem the famine of the Word (which is worſe than <hi>a famine of bread,</hi> or <hi>a thirſt of water, Amos</hi> 8.11) no ſuch great judgment, as long as from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral judgments you are exempted, this is a moſt wretched temper of ſoul; and the Lord muſt needs be angry, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercies and favours are ſlighted; and what puniſhment more probable or equal than to be deprived of them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ſign that the Day of Grace is near an end, is <hi>contradicting and perſecuting of the Lords Meſſengers.</hi> We read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. of a Marriage feaſt prepared, ſervants are ſent forth to invite many to the Marriage; ſome, who were invited, took thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and intreated them ſpightfully. Could the King which made this Supper bear this? No, he was wrath, and did deſtroy theſe perſecutors, and none of them were permitted to partake of thoſe good things he had provided, and once proffer'd to them. That is a dreadful text, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. <hi>But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets until the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and there was no remedy.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the multitude flock to hear them; when
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:003114_0041_0FF086FC20B74650"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw the multitudes, they were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with envy, and ſpake againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine; but the Apoſtles ſeeing them reject the Goſpel, and them, in ſuch a way, make this reply, <hi>It was needful that the Word of God ſhould be firſt ſpoken unto you, but ſince you put it from you,</hi> you ſhall not be troubled with it, <hi>lo, we turn to the Gentiles,</hi> Acts 13.45, 46. and then to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did the light ariſe and ſhine forth, and the <hi>Jews</hi> were left under darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Another ſign the Day of Grace is near an end, if not quite ended, is <hi>obſtinacy in ſome opinions, which are damnable.</hi> When fundamental truths are denied, when all means uſed to reclaim and turn the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, through prejudice, do but confirm and harden them, how near to deſperate is their caſe? When the Lord ſends ſtrong deluſions to any, and they believe a lye, Oh 'tis to be feared he intends their ruin, and that <hi>their judgment will now linger,</hi> will not ſlumber long: 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned, who believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Error may extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the light of the Goſpel, and cauſe the Ordinances of God to be ſlighted, the Word to be caſt aſide, and the Spirit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003114_0042_0FF08679DBE914A0"/>
and leave ſinners to the ſeduction of Satan, and the imagination of their dark and fooliſh hearts. Let me therefore ſpeak to you in the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 17. <hi>Ye therefore, beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Another fatal ſign, that the Day of Grace is near its period, is <hi>an habit of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding.</hi> Hark how the Lord upbraids his people with this; and after, they are told of their deſperate ſtate; <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4, 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Laid, ſhall they fall and not ariſe? ſhall they turn away, and not return? why is this people of Jeruſalem ſlidden back with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual backſliding?</hi> And then it follows, ver. 20, 21, 22. <hi>The harveſt is paſt, the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved. For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am black, aſtoniſhment hath taken hold upon me. Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Phyſician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd?</hi> There are many Profeſſors, who ſome times look <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, and have ſome common work upon them, but after do draw back, and by often doing ſo contract ſuch a ſearedneſs, that they make light of doing ſo. They do poſſibly under ſome awakenings confeſs their ſins, but quickly
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:003114_0042_0FF08679DBE914A0"/>
return to the commiſſion of them again; they are convinced 'tis their duty, and yet they will not be perſwaded to do the work of the Lord vigorouſly; they are convinced of ſuch and ſuch ſins, and yet they will not be diſſwaded from following after them. They may have a <hi>form of godlineſs,</hi> but they will not be brought under the <hi>power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor give their conſent to be ſincerely and thorowly ſanctified. Divers motions and proffers of aſſiſtance they have had from the Spirit, but all in vain, they are bent upon backſliding. Surely then they have juſt ground to fear, that ſentence is ready to be, if not already pronounced, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus concerning the Signs when the Day of Grace is declining and drawing towards night. Preſumptuous ſoul, if thou findeſt in thy ſelf any of theſe ſigns, Oh ſtartle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly at the diſcovery, and before the laſt hour of the day be ended, enter into, and labour to purpoſe in the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond word of Caution is this, <hi>Don't raſhly conclude the Day of Grace is paſs'd, and that the Sun is already ſet upon you.</hi> This
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003114_0043_0FF087059E503930"/>
is an extreme contrary to that of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ones, which tempted and troubled ſpirits are very prone to run into. They are ready to take up <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint, only with ſome ſad variations, <hi>Oh that I were as in months paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the days when God would have preſerved me! when his candle ſhined upon my head, and by his light I might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of darkneſs! The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was then with me; he call'd upon me to turn, and was ready upon my turning to hear my calling to him. But now I cry, and he doth not hear me; I ſtand up, and he regards me not: I have ſo bitterly provoked him to leave me, that I am afraid he is now gone for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three things are here to be conſider'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>No man can certainly conclude concerning another, that his day is paſs'd.</hi> If we conſult the Scripture, we ſhall find thoſe that have gone far in wickedneſs at laſt reclaimed; therefore we ſhould not deſpair of the worſt. Indeed the pride and ſtubbornneſs of the ungodly makes us fear that all our labour will be in vain, yet we ſpeak ſtill, <hi>and exhort and reprove with all long-ſuffering,</hi> 2 Tim 4 2. becauſe with God all things are poſſible; and thoſe ſheep that are gone much aſtray, ſeemingly paſt reach, he can lay hold of, and bring home again to the ſold.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:003114_0043_0FF087059E503930"/>2. <hi>No man ought to draw ſuch a ſad conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in reference to himſelf, that the ſeaſon of mercy is quite expired.</hi> Though our election may be made ſure, yet reprobation is not preſently to be diſcover'd: Though upon thy comparing thy heart and life with the Word of God, thou mayſt know of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty thou haſt no grace; yet thou haſt no warrant to ſay, thou never ſhalt have any: As filthy as thou have been waſhed; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy as thou have been ſanctified; as guilty as thou have been <hi>juſtified in the Name of the the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When Satan peſters you with thoughts, that there is no help remaining, but the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time is all ſlipt away, rather hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>; for Satan is a liar; and becauſe he is ſo buſie about you, 'tis a ſign that he is afraid of looſing you; if he knew certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that your day of viſitation were gone, he would be ſure of you, and ſo he would be quiet, and not as he doth, moleſt and trouble you.</p>
               <p>But for the further relief of thoſe, who are apt to diſcourage themſelves, and to damp their own endeavours after grace, by thinking the day is ended, and 'tis now too late, I ſhall do two things. Firſt, <hi>Lay down ſome probable ſigns.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Some
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003114_0044_0FF0870B0ECAAEA0"/>
certain ſigns of this Day of Grace's continuance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>probable ſigns</hi> of its continuance are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When the heart is inclined to ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der powerful means, who knows but by the word of faith which you attend upon, the grace of faith may be wrought in you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When ever and anon the heart is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Conſcience awakened by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Lord doth not let you alone in your iniquities, nor ſuffer you to ſleep quietly and undiſturbedly the ſleep of death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When thoſe falſe grounds of hope, which you have built upon, are more and more diſcover'd; when you are made to perceive the vanity of confidence in your ſelves, or in your own righteouſneſs, and that 'tis not enough to be ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the worſt are; and that the name of Chriſtians ſignifies nothing, unleſs you <hi>depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Who knows, but that being beaten off from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient bottoms, you may at length be ſettled upon the right foundation, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When there is a great fear leaſt the Day of Grace ſhould be paſt, 'tis to be hoped that 'tis not paſt. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the next war far from any ſuch fear. Uſually ſouls are leſt ſenſeleſs, when the Lord leaves
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:003114_0044_0FF0870B0ECAAEA0"/>
them. Of the old world, and of <hi>Sodom</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>They eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded, they married and were given in marriage,</hi> and minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but things of this nature, though the floud was ſo near the one, and fire rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to conſume the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When ſinners are inquiſitive what they ſhall do to be ſaved, 'tis probable at leaſt, that the day of ſalvation is not terminated, but ſalvation is near, and may be obtained, if the terms on which 'tis proffer'd are not quarrel'd at, but ſubmitted to as good and equal.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> place follow the <hi>certain ſigns</hi> that the Day of Grace is not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This day is not paſs'd when the Soul is for peace with God upon any conditions.</hi> If this be the yielding frame and temper of thy heart, certainly thou doſt not only know, but alſo art willing to do the things which belong unto thy peace. If this be thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Lord! Doth a right eye offend thee? it ſhall be pluckt out; doth a right hand offend thee? it ſhall be cut off: Thoſe ſins that ſeem moſt ſweet and neceſſary, as long as thou hateſt them, that is ſufficient to diſcommend them, I am reſolved to love them no longer!</hi> Thou haſt no reaſon to give up all for loſt; No, no,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:003114_0045_0FF0873E0ABC2B40"/>
being thus made willing to <hi>caſt away every tranſgreſſion, iniquity ſhall not be thy ruin,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Exek.</hi> 18.30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Day of Grace it is not paſs'd, <hi>whon the ſinner ſets open the door of his heart, that Chriſt the Lord may enter.</hi> The promiſe is moſt ſure, <hi>If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and ſup with him, and he ſhall ſup with me, Rev.</hi> 3.20. Chriſt complains of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>They would not come to him that they might have life</hi>; but if any are made willing to come, the waters of life are open, and none that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhall be denied them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is a thirſt come, and whoever will, let him drink of the water of life freely.</hi> Doſt thou know Chriſt? Art thou acquainted with his Kingdom as well as his Prieſthood? and art thou willing to have his Kingdom ſet up in thy heart, and thy very thoughts and affections brought into obedience and captivity? Art thou willing thus to receive him? Certainly thou ſhalt be received by him, and <hi>have power to become a child of God,</hi> John 1.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Day of Grace is not paſs'd, <hi>if Grace be deſired above all things in the world.</hi> If the edge of thy appetite towards the things that periſh is turn'd, if the pearl of price be indeed of price in thy eſteem;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:003114_0045_0FF0873E0ABC2B40"/>
if that be thy will and deſire, which is <hi>the will of God, even thy ſanctification</hi>; ſurely the Spirit is ſo far from having left thee, that he is in thee: 'Tis he who raiſes this <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi> which as it <hi>ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> ſo it argues thy eſtate bleſſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Day of Grace is not paſs'd, <hi>when the heart is grieved for the miſpence of ſo much of this day, and is willing to live the reſt of it to the will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. If you judge that the time paſt of your life doth ſuffice, nay, more then ſuffice, to have been fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and diſobedient to God, and to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd and ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, and if you reſolve to dedicate the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your lives in the fleſh to the Lord, that he may diſpoſe of it, certainly the Lord will accept both of your time and you: Though you come in late, ſo it be but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, into the Vineyard, you ſhall receive a penny; and diligence in your Maſters work will be rewarded with your Maſters joy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third word of Caution is this, <hi>Take heed of being ſtrengthened and emboldned by the general practiſe to idle this Day of Grace away.</hi> We read concerning <hi>Laiſh, That the People dwelt careleſs, after the manner of the Zid<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nians, quiet and ſecure,</hi> Judg. 18.7. And truly
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:003114_0046_0FEFA82DA947BFC0"/>
this is the manner of moſt in the world, careful poſſibly they are about many things, but as to the main thing utterly careleſs: Their time is of little, and their ſouls of leſs value in their judgments. But that the humour and cuſtom of the world may not be followed, let theſe conſiderations be ponder'd by you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The moſt in the world are blind.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, they are void of counſel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any underſtanding in them, <hi>they are not wiſe to conſider their latter end,</hi> Deut. 32.28, 29. nor the worth of that gracious ſeaſon, in which alone preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made for it. And ſhall we write after the Coppies which a company of fools ſet us? Shall we follow the blind, that quickly will fall into the ditch, and have not eyes to ſee their danger?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The moſt are unbelieving, a froward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, children, in whom there is no faith,</hi> and from this root of infidelity doth ſpring their prodigality of the day of Grace. Did they indeed believe that death will make an end of them, but that after this is finiſhed, another life will follow, either of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt joy, or of as great ſorrow; and that joy or ſorrow in the next world will be their lot, according as the preſent ſeaſon is, or is not improved; certainly they
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:003114_0046_0FEFA82DA947BFC0"/>
would be more ſparing of that which is ſo precious. Oh the ſecret paganiſm that is in the hearts of multitudes! they live as if Eternity were a fiction, and Hell a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but will it be thought a fable, when they feel the tortures of it? And what ſhall we tread in the ſteps of ſuch Infidels? No, <hi>we are to follow,</hi> not the unbelief, but <hi>the faith of others,</hi> Heb. 13.7. <hi>Whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Are not many, who are ſuch ſpendthrifts of this Day of Grace, ſelf-condemned?</hi> How often doth Conſcience reproach them for their ſpiritual ſloth? and 'tis very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to go in that way, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do frequently condemn themſelves for: Idleneſs is a ſin which leaves behind it a great deal of regret and diſſatisfaction in the heart; 'tis common for the ſlothful to hear a voice behind them, ſaying, <hi>Time is a treaſure that ought not to be thus fooliſhly, and to no purpoſe, waſted.</hi>

                  <hi>USE III.</hi> Of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>Let me perſwade all to a ſerious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this day of their gracious viſitation. The Arguments to prevail are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This day is continually paſſing:</hi> Your glaſs is running every moment, whether you ſleep
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:003114_0047_0FEFA870A09B1390"/>
or wake, are in company or alone, are vain or ſerious, do pray or ſin, it never ſtands ſtill: And when once your glaſs is run, 'twill never be turn'd again, but taken down immediately. Your days are but an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth; and whether of this hand breadth there be an rich remaining, is a queſtion. <hi>Time</hi> is not unfitly <hi>pictur'd with wings,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it flies ſo faſt away; and <hi>bald behind,</hi> becauſe you cannot catch hold of it to pull it back. The beſt part of this day is uſually at firſt; <hi>if we ſeek unto the Almighty betimes, Job</hi> 8.5. we are the more ſure to find him; and this ſhould engage you to a more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy trading with this precious talent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You all muſt be reckoned with, how you have husbanded this gracious ſeaſon.</hi> Oh what a caſe will the ſlothful ſoul be in, when death gives him a ſummons; and he hears that word, <hi>Render an account of thy ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for thou mayſt be no longer ſteward.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt needs very much amaze the ſinner, when it ſhall before the Judge bring in ſuch Indictments as theſe againſt him. <hi>So much of this day of ſalvation was ſpent in immoderate recreations: So much in carnal and ungodly company: So much in eager purſuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deceitful riches and pleaſures of this world: So much in making proviſion for the fleſh, that the vile and baſe luſts of it might be fulfilled:
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:003114_0047_0FEFA870A09B1390"/>
So much in proud and towring imaginations: So much in amorous and filthy muſings: So much in vain and rotten communication: So much in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and Ale-houſes, and in the Harlots habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: So much in tricking and adorning the body: And Chriſt and the ſoul were all the mean while neglected and forgotten. Often ask thy ſelf this Queſtion</hi>; Do I ſpend my Day of Grace after ſuch a manner, as I may account for it at laſt with comfort? Such thoughts would make you ſerious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let the diligence of the earthly minded, in improving the worlds day, ſhame you out of your idleneſs in this day of ſalvation.</hi> If the greedy tradeſman hears of an excellent bargain, what madneſs doth he count it to neglect the ſeaſon wherein he may have it? He that is covetous of preferment, 'tis no ſooner offer'd than accepted: Oh, ſay ſuch, <hi>We muſt catch occaſion by the fore look, we may never have the like again.</hi> Alas! that Men ſhould be ſo wiſe in trifles, and ſuch fools in the greateſt matters! Now is the time of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; you may be advanced to the dignity of Children, and Heirs of God: Now is the time to grow rich towards God, to lay up ſuch a treaſure, that will never fail, that none can take away from you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the apprehenſions which others have of this Day of Grace be conſider'd by
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:003114_0048_0FEFA86D7ABF5A38"/>
you. Here I ſhall bring ſeveral Speakers upon the Stage, delivering what their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and thoughts are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hearken to the awakened Soul, whoſe eyes are newly forced open by the Spirit: <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any; I have not the underſtanding of a Man: Many years I have liv'd, and as many I have loſt, in ſin and folly: A treaſure I have been entruſted with, but I have been cheated of it by a deceitful heart, a deceitful world, and a ſubtle Serpent: I remember oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities have followed thick one upon another, of getting grace, but none were laid hold upon: There was nothing I ſlighted more, than that which leaſt of all deſerv'd my ſlighting: O that my paſt days could be again recall'd, they ſhould be ſpent after another faſhion: But inſtead of that, what cauſe have I to fear, that the Lord may allow no more time, ſince that which he hath allowed hath been ſo unprofitably conſumed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hearken to the ſerious Chriſtian: <hi>How great a work have I to do, and how ſhort a time to do it in? How vaſt is eternity, which depends upon this moment? Lord! the world is not worth my time and pains in compariſon of thy ſelf, and that Grace and Glory which thou haſt revealed. Now is the time to fly from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire, and to gain the life that's everlaſting; and to ſcape the one, and gain the other, ſhall be my lifes main buſineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:003114_0048_0FEFA86D7ABF5A38"/>3. Hearken to a rouzed ſinner juſt going out of the world: <hi>Oh! my head doth ake, my heart is ſick, my eyes are dim, my breath is ſhort, a general trembling ſeiſes on me, and all do ſhew, that this earthly houſe of my tabernacle is upon the point of being diſſolved: And muſt I now be forced away? O my ſoul, to what place art thou removing? Hark! I hear a dreadful ſound within; Conſcience ſpeaks language full of horror. Alas! Is the ſentence now paſt, Cut down the tree that brought forth none but evil fruit? Muſt I go preſently to the Bar of God, who have nothing but provoked him all my days? May I not be ſpared a few years, or months, or weeks longer,? Oh call time again; I never ſaw thy worth till now: If I might be again reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and reſtored, Oh how often would I pray, and how earneſtly would I cry for mercy and grace? how carefully would I hear and practiſe? But this I ſhould have done before, 'tis now too late to think</hi> — and there he ſtops, his ſoul flies away, and leaves his body a clod of earth.</p>
               <p>And now Brethren, are your hearts ſtill maſtered? 'Tis to be hoped concerning the worſt in this Congregation, that their day is not quite gone; but who knows whether this may not be the laſt hour; and if now you will not, your own ſpirits may be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of you, of Gods Spirit may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:003114_0049_0FEFA834C8379F58"/>
from you. You will wiſh at laſt, as others have done, that the day of ſalvation had been valued, let it therefore be no more neglected.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, <hi>If you will not improve the Day of Grace, you can reaſonably expect nothing but a day of wrath.</hi> When mercy hath acted its part towards ungodly ones, and being ſtill refuſed, makes its <hi>Exit</hi>; then fury and indignation enters upon the ſtage; but of that tragedy there will be no end. Whole eternity will be taken up in feeling the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of divine diſpleaſure, and in bewailing the loſs of that Day of Grace, wherein this anger might have been appeaſed.</p>
               <p>I have done with the ſecond Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The third follows: <hi>To know, in this Day of Grace, the things which belong to our peace, is our great happineſs and wiſdom.</hi> If <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> had been thus wiſe, ſhe would not have been, as ſhe was, rejected. <hi>If thou hadſt known,</hi> ſays Chriſt: The defective ſpeech is thus to be made up, If the things of thy peace had been underſtood by thee, O <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> thy ſtate would have been as happy as now 'tis woful; inſtead of being cut off, thou wouldſt have been ſtill as near to God and as dear as ever; inſtead of having his
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:003114_0049_0FEFA834C8379F58"/>
wrath poured out upon thee to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that mercy, which hath been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten proffer'd, had aſſuredly been beſtowed, if thou hadſt not fooliſhly ſhut thy eyes, ſo as not to ſee either the value, or thy own need of mercy. A text ſomewhat parallel to this we have, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17, 18. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy One of Iſrael, I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way which thou ſhouldeſt go: Oh that thou hadſt hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been us a river, and thy righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall firſt open to you the nature of peace: Secondly, manifeſt what are the things which belong to our peace: Thirdly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the doctrine: Fourthly apply it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I am to open to you the nature of peace.</p>
               <p>This is a ſubject no leſs profitable than pleaſant, <hi>Dulce nomen pacis,</hi> the name of peace hath a ſweet ſound. <hi>Peace</hi> implies a bleſſed conjunction between heaven and earth, between the Creator and us his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and, which follows here-upon, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and quietneſs in our hearts, ſo that thoſe diſturbances and diſorders, which were cauſed by ſin, are becalmed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:003114_0050_0FEFA85919138E40"/>
The firſt of theſe, namely, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Heaven, is the principally intended peace, which Chriſt ſpeaks of; but the other, namely, Quietneſs within, follows upon this, and is the ſuperſtructure upon this foundation.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore firſt explain the nature of <hi>Peace above,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Peace within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Peace with God above</hi>: When I ſpeak of peace with God, 'tis ſuppoſed that by nature God and we are at varience, and ſin is the make-bate between God and man. Sin is a thing that not only cauſes commotions and tumults here below; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>From whence comes war and fightings among you? comes it not hence, even of your luſts that war in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>? Jam. 4.1. but it alſo ſets Heaven and Earth at odds; it ſo beſots the potſherds of the earth, that they venture to contend with him that is their Maker, and who can eaſily daſh them all in pieces. Sin hath ſet us at a vaſt diſtance from God, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thruſting us further from him; yet we may have peace, if we will indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him: Though we have provoked him to be an enemy, yet he is not ſuch an enemy as is irreconcileable: Hark what language he utters, Iſa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.4, 5. <hi>Fury is
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003114_0050_0FEFA85919138E40"/>
not in me; let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi> Peace with God is here promiſed; God himſelf is ready to ſtrengthen us, that we may make peace with him; and the more abundantly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us, he ſayes, <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> that is, towards them who are willing to be reconciled, and to rebel no more, he is not at all furious, but gracious and eaſie to be intreated, though their awakened and fearful hearts are prone to imagine the Lord is made up all of anger.</p>
               <p>This Peace with God, ſeveral things are implied in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Peace with God implies <hi>the removal of his wrath.</hi> All ſin is pardon'd and done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the blood of Chriſt, and guilt being cover'd, the Lords anger ceaſes, for ſin is the only provocation to him. See how theſe are joyned, the forgiveneſs of ſin, and the taking away of wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.2, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou haſt covered all their ſins, Selah. Thou haſt taken away all thy wrath, thou haſt turned thy ſelf from the fierceneſs of thine anger.</hi> The flaming ſword is removed, and the Lord ſays, <hi>Draw nigh to me, and I will draw nigh to you.</hi> We read, as of a Gulph fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and damned ſpirits, ſo of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:003114_0051_0FEFA868F3D25B80"/>
middle wall of partition between God and unregenerate ſinners; the former, namely, the Gulph, indeed cannot be paſſed thorow; but the latter, the middle wall, may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and 'tis broken down when our peace is made: His wrath abides on thoſe that will not believe, that refuſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; but his anger ceaſes towards them who believe and yield to him. Thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they, who are eaſed of ſuch a load as the wrath of God!</p>
               <p>Speak O ye troubled Conſciences, is not this anger your greateſt trouble, and that which makes the deepeſt wounds? Speak, O Hells Inhabitants, is not divine wrath a puniſhment too heavy for you to bear? is not this the weight which ſinks you loweſt in the bottomleſs pit? Finally, hear what Chriſt ſpake when he felt the diſpleaſure of his Father, <hi>My Soul,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> Well may they rejoyce, who through Jeſus are freed from this diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace with God implies <hi>an intereſt in his love.</hi> His love is every whit as great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who are at Peace with him, as before his wrath was. We may ceaſe to be angry with another, and yet not have any great affection for him. But where the Lord turns away his wrath, the ſtream of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003114_0051_0FEFA868F3D25B80"/>
his love doth run amain. The time of our reconciliation and returning is called <hi>a time of love</hi>: And this love is the more to be admired, becauſe it finds us in our blood, which makes us deſerve loathing; it finds no beauty, no comelineſs at all in us, but what it puts upon us. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>rich mercy,</hi> and <hi>great love,</hi> which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled have an intereſt in, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt: by grace ye are ſaved.</hi> This love of God is exceeding liberal, it ſets open his fulneſs which is ſo all-ſufficient, and we may come, and take what we need at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>And as they, who are at peace with God, have an intereſt in his love, ſo this love doth enkindle love in them to him again: The unreaſonable enmity of their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God is cured; the ſoul lifts up it ſelf to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. which before very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably doated upon the World, and much more unreaſonably upon its own luſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Peace with God implies <hi>the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſure and everlaſting Covenant between him and us.</hi> As the Lord makes this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſo he makes over himſelf in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; He becomes ours, and he takes us for his own, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Now when I paſſed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003114_0052_0FEFA85F05C5C0B0"/>
by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs; yea, I ſware unto thee, and entered into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> This Covenant is ſtyled <hi>the Covenant of Peace.</hi> The Lord being once a friend will never become an enemy! he will be merciful to the unrighteouſneſs of them that are in Covenant with him; and as he had engaged not to leave and forſake them, ſo he hath promiſed to put his love and fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not leave and forſake him: they are apt to be unſteadfaſt, 'tis well they have to do with a God that is faithful and changeth not; to this is owing their perſeverance and their bleſſedneſs. That's a ſweet place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. <hi>For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> Oh that our hearts were but ſet to ſtudy this Covenant of our God! How precious, how ſuitable are the Promiſes of it! We are guilty, defiled, troubled, weak and loſt creatures, but in this Covenant, Pardon, the Spirit, Peace, ſtrengthening Grace, and eternal Salvation are made over. And he that hath promiſed can as eaſily perform as promiſe. Nay, Chriſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:003114_0052_0FEFA85F05C5C0B0"/>
this Covenant by his death, ſo that it cannot be altered. Our Lord at his death engaged his Father to be a Friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that did or ſhould believe in him; and therefore that he will be a ſure and never failing Friend, may ſecurely be built upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Peace with God implies, <hi>his taking us into a new and near relation to himſelf.</hi> He makes us his Children, and ſurely then we ſhall abide in his houſe for ever. He not only ſays I will be <hi>a God to you,</hi> but alſo, <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. Well may we wonder with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God</hi>! Thoſe who are at peace with God are eſpouſed unto Jeſus Chriſt, unto ſuch, a Bill of divorce ſhall never be given. And as Chriſt becomes their Husband, and God their Father, ſo they conſent to carry it like Children, to love and fear the Lord in a child like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to follow fully and hard after him; they are willing to be faithful unto Chriſt, and to be ſubject unto his commands, which are far from being grievous.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Peace with God implies <hi>freedom of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him.</hi> Thoſe who proudly harden
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:003114_0053_0FEFA85CA127BF48"/>
themſelves in ſin, the Lord beholds them afar off, but he is nigh to thoſe whoſe peace is made; ſuch are invited not only to come, <hi>but to come with boldneſs to the throne of grace</hi>; and mercy and grace to help ſhall not be denied them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> They may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcouragement approach to God, and tell him of their temptations; He is ready to ſuccour them: they may tell him of their weakneſs, he is ready to ſtrengthen them with might in their inward man; they may tell him of the diſtempers, which they are burthen'd with, he is ready to heal them; they may ſpread their deſires before him, he is ready to fulfil the deſire of the humble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10 17. <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Soul, whoſe peace is made hath freedom of acceſs to God, ſo God hath freedom of acceſs unto the ſoul. When Chriſt knocks, the heart opens; when the Spirit moves, he doth prevail; when God comes to dwell, the heart yields it ſelf to be his Temple and habitation; and how much hereby is the ſoul dignified and advanced? The ſinner it no longer fooliſhly ſtubborn, he denies the Lord nothing; when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires his heart, his deſire, his love, none of theſe ſhall be kept backary longer from him.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:003114_0053_0FEFA85CA127BF48"/>6. Peace with God <hi>implies fellowſhip and communion with him.</hi> There is a kind of a <hi>commonneſs</hi> between God and them that are reconciled to him; whatever is in God is theirs, becauſe <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called their God,</hi> Heb. 11.16. They have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in his Power, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Mercy, and fulneſs, and they are ſenſible of the bleſſed effects of theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lords Attributes. God having given them himſelf, what will he refuſe to communicate? He is ever manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and beſtowing thoſe bleſſings upon them, which Aliens never do receive. He deals not towards them with a ſparing hand; the promiſe runs thus, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. And this is certain, that the more open our mouths are, the more open will the hand of God be.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what Peace above, what Peace with God is.</p>
               <p>In the next place I am to ſpeak of Peace within.</p>
               <p>'Tis natural to Man to be his own enemy and tormentor. He that was poſſeſſed with unclean ſpirits, 'tis ſaid no Man could bind him, no not with chains, but he was in the Tombs and Mountains, crying and cutting himſelf with ſtones, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.5. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a child of diſobedience, in whom the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:003114_0054_0FEFA84D3AE0C4E8"/>
Prince of the power of the Air worketh, will not be bound, will not be hindred from doing his ſoul harm; thoſe cords of reſtraint that the Word caſts upon him, he breaks aſunder and caſts away; he is continually cutting and wounding his own Conſcience, and if he be not quickly tranſlated out of this eſtate, he will quickly give himſelf the fatal blow. As long as any are enemies to God, they are alſo their own adverſaries; but when they leave off fighting againſt God, they ceaſe warring againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Peace within is very comprehenſive, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things are therein included.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Peace within comprehends <hi>calmneſs in the Conſcience:</hi> This calmneſs follows upon the apprehenſion and ſenſe of our peace with God, and that now he is in his Son reconciled. A reproaching Conſcience is a fearful companion; we cannot fly away from Conſcience, it is always with us; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened 'twill ſpeak boldly, and tell us our own, be we never ſo proud or high in the world, and the ear is forced to hear Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence's accuſations; when God gives it a command to ſpeak, how impoſſible is it for us to impoſe ſilence on it? Oh what a ſtorm doth the remembrance of manifold ſins, with their manifold aggravations, raiſe in
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:003114_0054_0FEFA84D3AE0C4E8"/>
the Conſcience? how amazed is it to ſee ſo much guilt, and God ſo much and ſo juſtly incenſed? But when God by his Spirit doth ſay, <hi>Soul, though ſin hath abounded, my grace doth ſuperabound; thy debts are all paid, thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are all pardoned.</hi> Then the ſtorm cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and there follows a great calm; Then Conſcience lays aſide the whip of ſteel, wherewith before it laſh'd it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Conſcience acquits the ſinner, becauſe God hath firſt juſtified and abſolved him. Sins which are paſt are remitted, and inſtead of continuing in ſin, the heart is changed, and is ſincerely deſirous to have it ſlain; and this godly ſincerity Conſcience gives teſtimony to, the effect of which is peace and joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Our rejoicing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience.</hi> Conſcience tells us of our duty, and urges us to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it; now when Conſcience is heeded by us, and what we do for God our very hearts are in it, Conſcience will not condemn, but approve us, and this will qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et us; for ſays the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace within comprehends <hi>ſatisfaction in the heart. Solomon,</hi> while making trial what ſufficiency was in the things under the Sun, was far from peace within, vanity was
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003114_0055_0FEFA85B00DF9260"/>
the fruit of all his labour, and his ſpirit is ſo far from being ſatisfied, that 'twas filled with vexation. But when God doth give himſelf to us, whom our hearts muſt then needs look upon as a proportionable happineſs, as a ſufficient portion, Oh then we are come to our centre, and are at reſt. When the Soul ceaſes to tire and weary it ſelf in purſuing after the creatures, and is fixed upon God, who is a Sun, a Shield, an exceeding great Reward; who is the God of all grace, and calls us to eternal glory; who cannot only ſatiate our deſires, but do exceedingly above our deſires and thoughts, according to that power which worketh in us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. Then, then our peace abounds, and paſſes all underſtanding. The heart is exceedingly pleaſed with its choice, having made choice of God; it would not exchange conditions with the greateſt graceleſs ones in the whole world.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd indeed, that in this only the back parts of the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> are ſeen, and little of him in compariſon is to be enjoyed: Yet this is certain, that <hi>Gods little</hi> is much more than the <hi>worlds all</hi>: The enjoyment of the Lord in part, affords more peace and ſatisfaction, by ten thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, than the creatures are capable of yielding; and that ſatiſfaction, how much is
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003114_0055_0FEFA85B00DF9260"/>
it heightned by the aſſured hopes, that at laſt we ſhall be fully ſatisfied?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Peace within comprehends <hi>an agreement in our wills to the will of God.</hi> 'Tis but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſince Gods will is ſo high, ſo holy, ſo good, our wills ſhould ſtoop and ſubmit; and we cannot have peace but in that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and refuſes to be ſubject to the Law and Word of God: Nay, by that very Law the corrupted heart is irritated and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, 'tis the more forward to ſin, becauſe forbidden to tranſgreſs: He was not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Man's nature, who ſaid,
<q>Nitimur in vetitum ſemper, cupimuſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gata.</q>
We are very prone to do that which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and to deſire what is denied us: And while the heart is thus irritated by the Law, alaſs! the ſinner is like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt: <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandment, doth work all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence,</hi> Rom. 7.8. But now what peace is there, when our hearts are reconciled to our duty, when we do not quarrel at, but love the Law, and wiſh, Oh that our ways were directed to keep it! How can there be peace within, unleſs there be ſome ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:003114_0056_0FEFA84F72838C90"/>
between our ſpirits and Gods Word and Ordinances? unleſs what was before look'd upon, without cauſe, as a burthen and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, be now eſteem'd as a priviledge and advantage?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Peace within comprehends <hi>ordinateneſs in the affections.</hi> Our paſſions and affections, being corrupted by ſin, are very tumultuous and unruly; and except theſe are tamed and brought into right order, we ſhall not know peace. Thoſe are ſome of the worſt kind of ſlaves that are enſlaved by their own affections. How is that Man hurried, who is under the power of worldly or unclean deſires? His fleſhly and his worldly luſts do ſo take up his time and pains, that they will not permit him to eat, or drink, or ſleep, and much leſs pray in quiet. How is that heart rent and torn, that is by inordinate love glued to any creature, when of that creature 'tis deprived? Oh the overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſorrow which follows upon love that is exceſſive! What a rack and torture is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? What an evil is fear? many times worſe than the evil feared: And ſo I might inſtance in other affections.</p>
               <p>If the world be compared to a State, and the life of man to a part which he acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, we may truly ſay, that a wicked man doth act the part of a <hi>Self-puniſher,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:003114_0056_0FEFA84F72838C90"/>
by giving way to his corrupt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he contributes ſo much to his own diſquiet.</p>
               <p>But 'tis the work of the Spirit of God to renew theſe affections; the anger and ſorrow are turned againſt and on ſin, the love and the deſire are towards God: And as here there is no danger of exceſs, ſo there is a certainty of enjoyment: The heart ſits looſe from the world, and the world is not able to diſturb that peace which it hath in God. None are more free from trouble than thoſe that are moſt maſters of their own affections: And well may the Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is peace and joy,</hi> Gal. 5.22. ſince he brings our affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Peace within comprehends a <hi>ceaſing to be our own foes.</hi> When are we our own foes? Surely when we ſide with Satan againſt our ſelves, when we cheriſh thoſe luſts that war againſt our own ſouls. The Vipers off ſpring do eat out the Vipers bowels; and ſinful luſts, in like manner, will deſtroy at laſt thoſe in whom they are bred and foſter'd. Oh let us all be reconciled to our ſelves, and not continue any longer the greateſt acceſſories to our own miſery.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed now what Peace is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:003114_0057_0FEFA8423AF2D5E8"/>In the ſecond place I am to manifeſt what are the things which belong unto our peace.</p>
               <p>'Tis in the Goſpel that theſe things are revealed, which therefore is called the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tiding of good things.</hi> Herein is contained an Embaſſage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: The God of peace proclaims to the world what an inclination he hath to be a friend and Saviour to the children of men, and informs them upon what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles a peace ſhall be made and eſtabliſhed between him and them. The Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is here ſilent; the Heathens by the light of that could never find out the way, how Divine Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and an attonement for ſin made. Nay, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law of God ſpeaks not a word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: The Law teacheth our duty, convinceth of tranſgreſſion, thunders out curſes againſt tranſgreſſors, and they would be left under the curſe, if the Goſpel did not tell them how to be redeemed from it, and how Grace, and Mercy, and Peace may be obtained.</p>
               <p>There are three things which the Goſpel reveals concerning our peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is the Mediator or Peace-maker, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:003114_0057_0FEFA8423AF2D5E8"/>2. <hi>What are the conditions of this Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How we may attain to an aſſurance of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. One thing which we muſt know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our peace is, <hi>Who is the Mediator or Peace-maker between God and man, and he is Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> I Tim, 2.5, 6. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ignorant; a crucified <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (though his crucifixion was neceſſary to his making of our peace) they hid their faces from, diſeſteemed. Chriſt crucified was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs, but to them that are reconciled and ſaved, he is the power of God, and the wiſdom of God: Hence 'tis that the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to know nothing beſide him. All things that are revealed in Scripture muſt be known with relation to Chriſt, elſe our knowledge will be uncomfortable and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advantage.</p>
               <p>What good will it do us to hear that God is gracious and merciful, unleſs in Chriſt he be reconciled? what good, to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of heaven and glory, unleſs Chriſt, who hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> do open the door that we may enter? What good, to hear of the Promiſe, unleſs in Chriſt
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:003114_0058_0FEF968D4D8E0C08"/>
they be Yea and Amen to the glory of God? Finally, what will it benefit us to hear of the priviledges of the Goſpel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs through Chriſt we are admitted to them? There is an excellency in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt our Peace-maker, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which the Apoſtle counted all things but loſs and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus is our Peace maker by a threefold means. His <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,</hi> and <hi>the communication of his benefits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt Jeſus is our Peace-maker by <hi>means of his ſatisfaction</hi>: For the iniquity of his people was he ſmitten, and the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their peace was laid upon him: He was ſent on purpoſe to be a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4 10. <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to reconcile both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto God, by the blood of his Croſs, and to have ſlain the enmity thereby. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, as ſilver and gold, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, but the blood of Chriſt was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient price for our redemption.</p>
               <p>We may conceive ſuch a kind of dialogue as this, between Juſtice, and Chriſt, and Man who hath offended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Divine Juſtice thus begins: <hi>Bring forth the Soul which hath ſinned that it may dye: A
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003114_0058_0FEF968D4D8E0C08"/>
righteous Law hath been broken, and 'tis but righteous that the curſe ſhould be inflicted: Here are not one, or two, but thouſands of ſins upon record: Now therefore I am reſolved to whet my glittering ſword, and my hand ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately take hold on vengeance, and I'll make the ſinner know to his coſt, what 'tis to provoke the Lord to jealouſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt anſwers; <hi>Hold Juſtice, ſtay thy hand! thoſe ſins thou ſpeakeſt of, they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto another, therefore the Soul muſt not dye that's guilty of them: The debt it great, but I undertake to pay it all; where thou art wronged, it ſhall be put wholly on my account, I am reſolved to be the ſinners Security, I am content to be made ſin for him, though I knew none, though I never was my ſelf in the leaſt guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Unto this Juſtice replies, <hi>Then, O thou Son of God, I muſt ſheath my ſword in thy bowels, I muſt wound, and bruiſe, and afflict thee where ever I find ſin, though but imputed, I can't forbear to puniſh it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt anſwers again; <hi>Do Juſtice, ſtrike, and ſpare not; I am willing to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſinners wounds may be cloſed and cured; I am willing to dye that he may live; I am willing to undergo the curſe, that he may receive the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Upon this the ſinner wonders and
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:003114_0059_0FEFA86239907728"/>
cries out, <hi>Oh love that paſſeth knowledge! My Lord, my Saviour! ſince thou haſt given thy life a ranſom for me, I am reſoled to truſt in thee, and to lay the ſtreſs of my ſalvation no thee, I expect and deſire favour and pardon no other way, than by thee, who art both the Price and the Prince of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is our Peace-maker by <hi>means of his interceſſion.</hi> As his ſatisfaction is one, ſo his interceſſion is the other part of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office. He ſeconds his ſufferings by his interceſſion; and we may be confident his interceſſion will be prevalent, becauſe of that love which his Father bears him, and becauſe by his ſufferings he hath purchaſed whatever he intercedes for. <hi>Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is our Advocate with the Father,</hi> I John 2.1. He preſents before his Father the compleatneſs of his ſatisfaction, and how he hath endured the Croſs and ſhame, and drank off that whole Cup which his Father put into his hand, and fulfilled all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; how he did, and ſuffered all that was required of him, and all this, not for himſelf, but us. Whereupon the Father looks upon us with an eye of love, he is pacified towards us; and as he is Chriſts God and Father, ſo he is ours too: <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Go tell my brethren, I aſcend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:003114_0059_0FEFA86239907728"/>3. Chriſt is our Peace-maker <hi>by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his benefits</hi>: He is made unto us wiſdom, and then we ſee the way of reconciliation: He is made unto us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſin is no longer imputed, and that quarrel which Juſtice had with us comes to an end: He is made unto us ſanctification, and then the holineſs of God ceaſes to be our enemy, and we no longer hate that holineſs; there is a ſweet agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our renewed nature and an holy God, and his holy Law, which he would have us walk according to. They that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, love God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his holineſs, and they love the Word of God upon the ſame ſcore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.139, 140. <hi>My zeal hath conſumed me, becauſe mine enemies have forgotten thy words: Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loveth it.</hi> Finally, Chriſt is made unto us redemption, that's a fourth benefit reckoned up by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. He makes us free indeed, becauſe he frees us from that which is ſlavery indeed, he delivers us from the bondage of corruption, and cauſes us to become the ſervants of God and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. And now we are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Gods Sovereignty and Authority, we own him as our Lord, who as he hath right to rule us, ſo 'tis our honour, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:003114_0060_0FEFA86BEE38B3E0"/>
out freedom to be ruled by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As we muſt know who is our Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, ſo what are the conditions of our peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One condition is <hi>godly ſorrow:</hi> And as the Lord doth grant us peace, ſo he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth work this and the other conditions of it. If we will be reconciled, we muſt mourn for our offending and provoking God to be an enemy. The eye of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can look every way but inward, and ſhall the eye of our mind never look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward neither? Were our hearts but more acquainted with themſelves, they would be more broken and contrite hearts: How deeply is the Law of ſin engraven there? and this Law of ſin forbids whatever the Law of God commands, and commands whatever the Law of God forbids. The moſt venemous creature is not more full of poyſon, then our hearts are full of enmity againſt the Lord, and reprobateneſs to what is good: This corruption of our nature is not a thing which hath lain dorment and idle; no, but as a Fountain perpetually ſends forth water, ſo from the heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed evils abundantly, whereby the man is defiled. 'Tis difficult to reckon up the ſins of one day, or of one duty; and how vaſt
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:003114_0060_0FEFA86BEE38B3E0"/>
then is the total ſum of our whole lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations? Oh break hard heart for ſhame! who haſt ſo often broken the moſt equal laws, and broken thorow ſo many obligations to obedience. If the offending God be made light of, this will anger him more than all thy other offences.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another condition of our Peace is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi> When the Jaylor was under the ſenſe of Gods anger and wrath, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd with the fears of damnation, and cry'd out, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved? Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> made this anſwer, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16.30, 31. How much is faith preached up in the Goſpel? and unto Chriſt our faith is directed, for 'tis in him that God is well pleaſed, and 'tis through that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son alone, that he will be at peace, and well pleaſed with us: If we expect favour or mercy any other way, but thro' Jeſus, that very expectation is ſufficient to be an eternal impediment to our obtaining of either. The Lord hath made Faith one great condition of our peace and ſalvation, for two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Man being thus reconciled and ſaved by believing, <hi>all the glory redounds to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:</hi> Mans boaſting is utterly excluded: The hand of faith is an empty hand, it
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:003114_0061_0FEFA839AE068050"/>
brings nothing along with it; but it receives Chriſt, <hi>and with him, and for him, freely all things.</hi> Faith exalts Chriſt, and abaſes the ſinner, and makes him ſee, that he is wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and naked, and that to Chriſt he muſt thank be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for every thing, he muſt thank himſelf for nothing.</p>
               <p>Man being thus reconciled and ſaved by believing, his peace with God is laſting, his ſalvation ſure, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure. Adam</hi> was at peace with God when firſt created; but ſince the continuance of peace depended upon the conſtancy of his obedience, peace and life were ſoon loſt by him. But faith puts our peace and ſalvation in the hands of another, in the hands of Chriſt, he undertakes to be <hi>the finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. He hath promiſed to keep us from falling, and <hi>to confirm us to the end,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8. And the believer reſts upon this word of promiſe, which will never fail him.</p>
               <p>That's the ſecond condition of peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another condition is, <hi>Converſion with the whole heart to God.</hi> How often doth the Spirit cry out, <hi>Turn and live?</hi> And though the Lord was bitterly provoked, yet upon
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003114_0061_0FEFA839AE068050"/>
his peoples returning, he promiſes to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Go and proclaim theſe words towards the North, and ſay, Return thou back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe my anger to fall upon you, for I am merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever.</hi> Our returning to him muſt be without delay, without deceit; we muſt not divide our hearts between him and ſin, between him and Mammon, but we muſt conſent to be <hi>wholly his,</hi> and never to leave him any more; but if through infirmity we do fall, we muſt look unto the Lord to pity, and pardon, and heal, and raiſe us. To turn away from God ſo as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, is inconſiſtent with peace. Thus you know theſe things, which are the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your peace; let me add, <hi>Happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It concerns us to know, <hi>how we may attain to an aſſurance of Peace.</hi> The ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be ſafe without this aſſurance, but withal 'twill be diſconſolate. Now 'tis the Spirit who makes this diſcovery: We read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>of peace and joy in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt.</hi> Peace and joy are the fruits of this bleſſed Comforter. In Scripture the Saints are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30. And their being thus ſealed, as it denotes their
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:003114_0062_0FEFA8450A7D7878"/>
diſtinction from the reſt of the world, their being approprieted unto God, and the value that is put upon them; ſo it ſerves to confirm them in that preſwaſion, that God is their, and they are his. There is indeed a privy Seal of his gracious Decree, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord Knoweth them that are his.</hi> But afterwards, when the Spirit works upon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we are ſealed in a more diſcernable way. Now the work and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Spirit in ſealing and bringing thoſe, who are reconciled, unto an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of peace, I ſhall declare.</p>
               <p n="1">1. the Spirit convinces us to ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of our worthleſneſs and weakneſs, and bows our hearts to a ſubmiſſion to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, and draws us to a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit ſanctifies and cleanſes us from the filthineſs, in which we wallowed, and cauſes us to yield obedience to the commands of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Spirit doth more and more ſtir up and increaſe the grace which he hath wrought, ſo that the actings of faith, and love, and hope, and zeal, are the more ſtrong and ſenſible.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:003114_0062_0FEFA8450A7D7878"/>4. The Spirit doth diſcover the truth of theſe graces, leting us ſee, that our hearts do prize Chriſt, and breath after God, and after a greater degree of likeneſs to him, as the Saints in Scripture have done before us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then peace and joy follows. But here we muſt underſtand, that this peace is twofold. Firſt, more weak, mixed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. Secondly, more raviſhing, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and triumphant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a peace <hi>more weak, mixed and imperfect,</hi> which is for our ſupport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and this is common with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when they ſtir up themſelves, and ſeek the Lord with their whole deſire, as they did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. Seldom is a duty performed with our heart and might, but ſome degree of peace and ſatisfaction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the Spirit giving ſome intimation, and raiſing a ſecret hope, that God through Chriſt doth accept of us. Oh who would not labour ſince there is ſuch peace and reſt attends it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a peace <hi>more raviſhing, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and triumphing.</hi> How brightly doth the light of Gods countenance then ſhine upon us! How ſweet is that love, the ſenſe of which the Spirit ſheds abroad in the heart! <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. What confidence have we then in God! How do we admire the richneſs of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:003114_0063_0FEFA83DB3939918"/>
his grace! how low are we in our own eyes, being aſtoniſhed that ſuch vile creatures ſhould be ſo advanced! How do we then deſpiſe the worlds delights, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin! How forward are we to obey, and to walk in all Ordinances blameleſs! How undaunted at danger, and at death, which will but increaſe our pleaſures, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us much nearer to the Lord, than here we are capable of approaching! Thus 'tis by the Spirit that peace is ſpoken to us; and if we would attain to this peace, we muſt heed the Spirits counſels, we muſt readily cloſe with his motions, we muſt gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his help and aſſiſtance, we muſt give up our ſelves unto his guidance.</p>
               <p>In the third place follow the reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Why, to know the things of our peace is our great happineſs and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>a true knowledge of theſe things will be practical and induſtrious</hi>; It will very much affect the heart, and quicken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, in ſeeking peace before it be too late: A right underſtanding of it, will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a buſineſs of ſuch eternal conſequence, from being any longer neglected by us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:003114_0063_0FEFA83DB3939918"/>2. Becauſe <hi>of the evil which unavoidably follows, if of the things which concern our peace we are ignorant.</hi> The ignorant ſoul is wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly careleſs, it matters not whether God be a friend or foe; as if his loving kindneſs were not to be valued; as if his wrath were not to be feared; and at laſt, the ſoul miſſes of mercy, which it doth not regard, and falls ſuddenly and irrecoverably into the pit of deſtruction, which it dreams not of, nor endeavours to prevent.</p>
               <p>Now follows the Application.</p>

               <p>There are two great leſſons which we may learn from this Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One leſſon is this, <hi>That believers are the wiſeſt and happieſt ſouls, for the things of their peace are underſtood by them.</hi> Thoſe things which are hid from the prudent of the world are unto theſe diſcover'd: I know they are accounted children and babes by the carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, but in the end they will be found to have had of all others the greateſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, the fartheſt reach, the trueſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:003114_0064_0FEFA836F29BCF80"/>
haſt revealed them unto babes; even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Peace is a thing which all ſeek after, but moſt are miſtaken in judging what is peace, and are wofully deceived in the way to it: Only the believer hits right, for he is led by a Guide that leads only into truth.</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed found by experience, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are uſed to blind and deceive the believer himſelf; but he is too wiſe to be put off with peace and happineſs only in ſhew.</p>
               <p>Many things do proffer peace to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pleaſures do uſe this charming language. <hi>What is it, O Man, which thou ſeekeſt for? Is it quiet and ſatisfaction? Come taſte the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which gratifying thy ſenſes will afford: Is it not fine to glitter in ſilk and ſilver bravely? to be clothed in purple and fine linen, and to fare ſumptuouſly and deliciouſly every day? Who are more free from care and trouble, than thoſe who chaunt to the ſound of the viol, who drink wine in bowls, who eat lambs out of the flock, and calves out of the midſt of the ſtall, and after lay them down upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their couches? Come, come, away with needleſs ſcruples, indulge unto thy appetite, pleaſe thy ſenſes, whatever thy eyes deſire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not from them, and quench thy longing flame in</hi> Dalilah's <hi>embraces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:003114_0064_0FEFA836F29BCF80"/>Unto this the believing ſoul replies: <hi>Death is climbing up at the windows, the Judge ſtandeth before the door, Eternity is juſt at hand; and, O all ye ſenſual pleaſures, can you laſt any longer than a ſhort ſeaſon? Where is the Glutton that fared deliciouſly, that had as much as heart could wiſh? Is he not tormented in the flames? Oh deceitful pleaſures, which cheat Men of eternal joys, and drill them along to endleſs torments</hi>!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wealth and worldly greatneſs do alſo make big offers: <hi>Wouldſt thou, O Man, have peace? then ſeek a great eſtate, joyn houſe to houſe, and field to field, let thy coffers be cram'd with ſilver and gold, endeavour to be ſome body in the world: Doeſt thou not know how many eyes, how much reſpect riches and honour will draw after thee? Let this be thy aim, to live in plenty and eſteem, and to leave a name behind thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto this alſo the believing ſoul anſwers: <hi>To expect peace and contentation from worldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, is as abſurd, as to hope to ſleep quietly in a bed of thorns. Who ever attained to greater earthly glory than</hi> Solomon? <hi>whoſe treaſures did ever more abound? yet he himſelf diſgraces all his own wealth and honour, by calling them, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. At laſt the Lord calls to the Believer, and thus ſpeaks to him: <hi>Is it happineſs, O Man, which thou art ſearching after? Look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, who am the God of love and peace: The
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003114_0065_0FEFA8526E715BC8"/>
creatures have but empty breaſts, are but broken ciſterns; but I have ſtore of living waters to quench thy thirſt, and ſatisfy thy longing: Sin is the diſturber of thy peace, therefore let ſin be caſt away with hatred, and trouble, that ever thou didſt give it entertainment. Come, come to me without delay, I will be to thee a God, I will be all unto thee; thou ſhalt never lack as long as I am all-ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon the ſoul yields: <hi>Thou art my haven, O my God; till I am arrived at thee I am in a ſtorm, and every moment in danger to be caſt away; in thee only, through thy Son, I can have peace; Oh therefore let me be glew'd to thee, that nothing may cauſe a ſeparation</hi>! well may the believing ſoul return unto its reſt, ſince God is his, and the peace which is made ſhall never quite be broken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another leſſon which we may learn is this, <hi>The wretchedneſs of the ungodly, for theſe is no peace to them</hi>; Iſa. 57.21. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, unto the wicked.</hi> And the more wicked, the leſs peace, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you continue wicked, the leſs hopes that ever there will be any. I grant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that 'tis ordinary for wicked ones to cry peace to themſelves; but this falſe and imaginary peace is as bad, nay worſe, than none at all.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:003114_0065_0FEFA8526E715BC8"/>1. The peace of the wicked <hi>is founded upon ignorance</hi>; they know not what cauſe they have to fear and be troubled; the ſins which they commit, the God whom they every hour provoke, and the vengeance unto which they are liable, is not in all their thoughts: <hi>Theſe things they are willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This peace of the wicked, <hi>many times 'tis the conſequent of judicial hardneſs</hi>; their eyes are ſhut, their conſciences are caſt into a dead ſleep, and are become paſt feeling; no wonder if they enjoy a kind of quiet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This peace of the wicked <hi>is a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to their obtaining of true peace:</hi> while they imagine their ſtate is good and ſafe enough, they will not ſeek to have it alter'd, by means of this the ſtrong Man armed doth keep the houſe in more quiet and ſecure poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This peace of the wicked <hi>is but of every ſhort continuance</hi>; 'tis chaſed away like a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dream or night viſion, and the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wo and trouble will be the more intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, becauſe unlookt for it will come upon them.</p>
               <p>A peace the wicked have, but 'tis without ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and worſe than none: True peace what have they to do with, as long as the wickedneſſes, which are practiſed, delighted in, and pleaded for, are ſo many?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:003114_0066_0FEFA84B9E398C80"/>1. <hi>The ungodly have no peace in life.</hi> The Lord is their enemy, he hates them, is angry with them, Walks contrary to them. Hark how he proclaims war, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold, I even I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and will execute judgments in the midſt of thee.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> So the words may be inverted. If God be againſt us, what doth it ſignifie who is for us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Much leſs have the ungodly any peace at death. The end of the perfect and upright is peace; but the tranſgreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed together, the end of the wicked ſhall be cut off, Pſal.</hi> 37.37, 38. Then their hopes will prove a Spiders web, their confidence as the giving up of the ghoſt. Perhaps when the ſnares of death are upon them, the pains of hell may get hold of them, Conſcience may be affrighted, and they may be like wild Bulls in a Net, full of the fury of the Lord, and the rebuke of God: But if they dye ſtupid, there is the leſs hope; if there are no bands in their death, 'tis the more certain they will be bound immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, and thrown into the lake of fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Judge will not find the ungodly in peace:</hi> No, no, they were not diligent or deſirous to be cleanſed from their ſpots and filthineſs. How many ſins unrepented of will accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to the Tribunal? which will prove
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:003114_0066_0FEFA84B9E398C80"/>
them enemies to God, and which with a loud united voice will cry for vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And will they find any peace in hell, into which with a curſe they muſt depart?</hi> Can there be any eaſe, any reſt taken in thoſe devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flames? How many things will the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have to trouble them? All the Wrath of God ſtirr'd up againſt them: The glory of his power manifeſting it ſelf in their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The reflections of Conſcience upon the proffers of peace and life, which were once made, but madly, ſottiſhly deſpiſed, and which ſhould never, never be made more: Oh how will they be troubled, and bowed down, and mourn, and wail, and weep eternally.</p>

               <p>O that you would be perſwaded unto peace! Many arguments I may fill my mouth with, to prevail with you to he reconciled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do but conſider ſeriouſly, <hi>what kind of enemy the Lord is,</hi> and that conſideration will make you afraid, that he ſhould be your enemy any longer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You cannot fly from his reach.</hi> Though you exalt your ſelves as the Eagle, though you ſet your Neſt among the Stars, yet from
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:003114_0067_0FEFA83337516850"/>
thence the Lord can bring you down, <hi>Obad.</hi> 4. Though you ſhould go down to the bottom of the Sea, and hide your ſelves at the earths centre, yet there his hand can take you. If you imagine that any refuge can ſecure you from God, that refuge will be found a lye, and will deceive you. The Lord does fill both heaven and earth, nay the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him, how then is it poſſible any ſhould fly from him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You cannot reſiſt his power.</hi> Far ſtronger creatures than you, were not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the God of heaven: The Dragon fought and his Angels, but how eaſily were they overcome? After that <hi>Jehu</hi> had ſlain <hi>Joram</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> we read that the Elders of <hi>Samaria were exceedingly afraid, and ſaid, behold two Kings ſtood not before him, how then ſhall we ſtand?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.4. So may I ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Angels that excel in ſtrength, ſtood not before the Lord, he caſt them, when they ſinned, into chains, which they can never bread aſunder; And how then ſhall man be able to ſtand, who dwelleth in a houſe of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt, and who is cruſhed before the moth? Sinner! God will certainty be too hard for thee, thou canſt no more reſiſt his
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:003114_0067_0FEFA83337516850"/>
power, than a feather can bear up againſt a whirlwind, or dried ſtubble defend it ſelf from the fierceſt flame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You cannot bear his indignation.</hi> How doth <hi>David</hi> faint end cry out, when a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Gods anger was ſtirred up againſt him? <hi>Remove thy ſtroak away from we, I am conſumed by the blow of thy hand, Pſal.</hi> 39.10. And if a little be ſo intollerable, what will the whole weight be? The Prophet brings in the unſenſible creatures, as if they had ſenſe, fearing and quaking, when the Lord doth ſhew his wrath, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his preſence, yea, the world and all that dwell therein; who can ſtand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that heart is worſe than rocky, which doth not tremble before him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He can engage all the creatures againſt you.</hi> He is the Maker and alſo the great Commander of the Hoſt of Heaven and Earth.

               <p n="5">5. He hath acceſs unto your very ſpirits, and can wound and fill your ſouls with horror. When the Lord impreſſed his anger upon the heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> how reſtleſs was he? though a covetous man, he flings away his ſilver, <hi>that</hi> would not eaſe him: his life is a burthen, and with his own hands he puts an end to it. <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear</hi>? and wounds <hi>there</hi> the Lord can give you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>His power will reach his enemies in the next world:</hi> Nay, then his hand will be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of all; God will lay on load upon his adverſaries, and not in the leaſt ſpare them: His patience will then be at an end, his goodneſs totally and eternally withdrawn; and how low then will his vengeance weigh them down? Such an enemy the Lord is, and this is one argument to perſwade you to peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be mindful of the dependance you have upon him.</hi> In him you live, and move, and have your being, and if he ſhould withdraw his viſitation, your life would preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and vaniſh: And is it ſafe, or a wiſe
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:003114_0068_0FEFA846B0828C70"/>
part in you, to provoke that God to be your enemy, in whoſe hand your breath is, and who can take it out of your noſtrils when he pleaſeth? He can looſe the ſilver cord, he can break the golden bowl, and require your ſouls at your hands, without giving you an hours or a minutes warning. Whoſoever you fall out with, methinks you ſhould get and keep in with God, for 'tis his patience and mercy which keeps you out of the grave and hell; of both which, by reaſon of ſin, you are in great danger.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The condeſcenſion and ſtooping of God is admirably great, in beſeeching ſuch as you to be reconciled:</hi> And ſhall he intreat in vain? Shall the malefactor be beſeeched to accept of a pardon, and refuſe it? That is a text that ſhould work upon the moſt refractory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you, in Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> What is it come to this, doth God beſeech, and Chriſt pray, that we, who are ſo mean and ſo vile, would be friends, and ſhall we continue rebels? <hi>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord!</hi> for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, than the earth or ſtones, are much more ſtupid. To ſlight the proffer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to diſobey the command to come for it, is both a fault and a folly inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:003114_0069_0FEFA82F2FE14748"/>
but to be deaf to intreaties, is worſt of all; this goes neareſt unto God when his condeſcenſion and kindneſe is diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and abuſed, and upon this abuſe the greater contempt, and anger, and hatred muſt needs follow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider what kind of friend the Lord is:</hi> I might be large in deſcribing his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which they who are acquainted with him ſee and admire. Three things at preſent I ſhall mention.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is ſuch a friend, <hi>whoſe love is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent.</hi> That ſweet name (which is as an oyntment poured forth) he calls himſelf by, <hi>The God of love and peace,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. Nay, he is ſtiled <hi>Love</hi> in the abſtract, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.</hi> Whatever returns of love we make, thoſe returns fall infinitely ſhort of the love of God from whence they come. Indeed it is as poſſible to equal him in ſtrength, in wiſdom, or any other of his perfections, as to equal him in love. Oh let this love of God be as a loadſtone to draw yours, and as a whetſtone to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is ſuch a friend, <hi>whoſe fulneſs can never he exhauſted.</hi> The Sun, although it hath ſhined ever ſince the Creation, yet 'tis as full of light as ever it was. And tho'
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:003114_0069_0FEFA82F2FE14748"/>
the Lord hath ſupplyed the wants of all them, whom he hath made his friends from the beinning, yet his ſtock and ſtore is not at all diminiſhed; His wiſdom is never po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their greateſt difficulties; when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers know not what to do, and their eyes are unto him, he knows what to do for them: His power can raiſe them out of the loweſt deep; his all-ſufficiency can give to the uttermoſt of their deſires, nay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more than it hath entred into their hearts to deſire or conceive: Who in his wits would not leave a vain world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful luſts, to come to ſuch a friend as God hath always ſhewed himſelf to be?</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is ſuch a friend, <hi>as will laſt when all other friends fail.</hi> He is the Lord who changes not: He can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as ceaſe to be faithful; and the faithfulneſs of God towards his friends, will make them alſo faithful; he will not turn away from them, and he will hold them faſt that they ſhall not depart from him. The Lord is moſt conſtant; the Ordinances of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars are not ſo immutable as the Promiſes he hath made. <hi>Men of low degree are vanity, men of high degree are a lye, Pſal.</hi> 62.9. But God is true: Wealth may take wings and fly away, proſperity may vaniſh ſo as to be forgotten, fleſh and heart
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003114_0070_0FEF96930506D1C8"/>
may fail, but the Lord will be a friend and a portion for ever. Oh conſent to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſince ſuch a friend hereby will be gained.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, <hi>If God be at peace with you, he will ſhield you from all other adverſaries</hi>; he will wreſt thoſe weapons out of your own hands, whereby you endeavoured your own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he will give a deaths wound to ſin, that it ſhall not be your death. And though the world, and the God of the world, fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, they ſhall not be able to prevail: Nay, their very enmity ſhall befriend you, <hi>and God will turn to good what they do mean for evil.</hi> 'Tis admirable to conſider, how the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of the Lords people, though they have the <hi>intenſion</hi> of enemies, yet are forced to <hi>act</hi> like friends, and do a kindneſs unto Saints by thoſe means, whereby they thought to have injured and deſtroyed them. Juſt as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, when they would hinder his promotion, ſold their brother into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he arrived to that honour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foretold was the matter of their envy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Gods late diſpenſations, in a way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do call upon you aloud to ſue for peace.</hi> He hath diſplayed his Flag of Defiance, and the Motto of it hath been, <hi>Peſte, Ferro, &amp; Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, By Plague, and Sword, and Fire</hi>; By all theſe the Lord hath been fighting with us and our ſins, and rebelling againſt him is the
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:003114_0070_0FEF96930506D1C8"/>
ground of the quarrel. The Sword was drawn, which devoured fleſh, and dyed red the Sea with blood. The Quiver was opened, and out flew the Arrows of the Peſtilence; and what ſlaughter did thoſe Arrows make? Heaps upon heaps the Deſtroyer kill'd, many thouſand went down to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Death. We were ready to conclude, when the Plague was over, that God had done with us, but we were miſtaken: A Fire was kindled in his wrath, which the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the ſtatelieſt buildings could not ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: How did the flames roar? what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock did they make? In three days ſpace, <hi>London</hi> was no more like it ſelf, than the dead bones, which have lay'n in the grave for ſeveral years, are like unto the Man, when he was alive, and in his greateſt ſtrength and beauty.</p>
               <p>When theſe effects of his diſpleaſure are look'd upon with a conſiderate eye, who can doubt that God was angry? and how little hath been done to appeaſe his wrath? 'Tis high time to beg for mercy, and to abandon whatever is a bar in Mercy's way. Oh that <hi>London,</hi> Oh that <hi>England,</hi> would know the things that belong to their peace! We are not brought ſo low but we may be brought lower, if we provoke the Lord to continue ſtill an enemy.</p>

Conſider, <hi>as yet there is a poſſibility of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled ot God:</hi> His Arms are open and ſtretched forth, if you will but caſt your ſelves into them: If the moſt wicked will but forſake their ways and thoughts, and return to the Lord, he will have mercy upon them; and though ſin hath abounded, he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. Oh what would the damned give, that mercy were but poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obtained? 'Tis great mercy that you have not ſinn'd your ſelves beyond the reach of mercy: But if the favour of God and peace with him be neglected, how quickly may you be concluded under ſin and wrath, and your ſalvation become as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is the ſalvation of thoſe who are in Hell?</p>
               <p>I hope by this time your ears will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily open to hearken to ſome Direction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now you may have your peace with God made.</p>
               <p>The Directions are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ſenſible of, and bewail that enmity which is between God and you.</hi> You have unnaturally rebelled and riſen up againſt your Father that made you. Thoſe members which he formed, you have yielded as weapons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; thoſe powers which he hath indued your ſouls with, you have employed ſinfully: You have diſhonoured him in your bodies and ſpirits, whereas you ſhould have
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:003114_0071_0FEF969164931920"/>
glorified him in both. You are unjuſtly and unreaſonably the Lords enemies; what hath he done to deſerve your hatred? for which of his kindneſſes do you fight againſt him? But the Lord is juſtly an enemy to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your tranſgreſſions againſt him have been ſo many and ſo mighty. That you ſhould have hearts alienated from ſuch a God, ſo holy and gracious, and to whom you owe all that you are and have, it ſhould make your hearts break and melt within you; and that you have engaged this God againſt you, ſhould be eſteemed an evil and a bitter thing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let your cries be ſtrong for peace</hi>: Reſolve never to give over, till he whom you have provoked to be your enemy, is become your friend. If you would have an intereſt in the favour of God, that favour muſt be intreated, and that with your whole heart; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.58. <hi>I intreated thy favour with my whole heart; be merciful to me according unto thy word.</hi> The condemned priſoner at the bar, if there be hopes of ſpeeding, how doth he implore the Judges mercy? The beggar, who is ready to ſtarve for hunger, how doth he make a noiſe, <hi>Bread, bread, for the Lords ſake, bread!</hi> And you have more cauſe to cry for peace with God; for if you live and dye enemies, you are everlaſtingly undone. And to hearten
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:003114_0072_0FEF968F1B15F5C0"/>
you to prayer, let that Scripture be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5. <hi>For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The meditation of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be uſed.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That Chriſt came and preached to them which were far off, and to them which were nigh,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. that is, both to the Jews and Gentiles: And that peace which he preached, by his blood he purchaſed. The blood of Chriſt hath a voice, which voice is loud, and peace is the thing which his blood cries for. You muſt expect peace no other way but by the blood of the Croſs. Believe that this blood of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, is ſufficient to make an atonement for your ſin; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing encouraged by the proffers and promiſes which he hath made in the Goſpel, be ſure to truſt in him, to be your Advocate with the Father, and he will not fail to mediate your peace; who ever believed on him and was confounded? Chriſt is ſtyled the <hi>Prince of Peace, Iſai.</hi> 9.6. which ſhews that he hath an uncontroulable power to make peach, when, and for whom he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let the deſign of God in the Goſpel be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as matter of encouragement:</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to reconcile the world unto himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:003114_0072_0FEF968F1B15F5C0"/>
world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</hi> One great thing which keeps men off from God, is an unbelieving fear, that he is averſe from peace, rather forward to take vengeance upon the ſinner, then ready to forgive his ſin. But have they, who entertain ſach fears, ever look'd into the Goſpel? If the Lord were ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to kill and deſtroy, why hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a City of refuge? why did he refuſe to ſpare his Son? why doth he proclaim himſelf a God abundant in loving kindneſs, goodneſs and truth, who hath mercy for thouſands, and forgives iniquity, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſin? The more firmly you are perſwaded of his kindneſs and compaſſions, the ſooner you will yield to him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Lay hold upon the Lords own ſtrength, if you would have your peace made.</hi> Conſult the forecited place, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Or let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me.</hi> Though by the ſtrength of the Lord, we may underſtand Chriſt Jeſus, who is called, <hi>the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. Yet I rather think the Holy Ghoſt doth intimate to us in that place, that unleſs God doth draw us to himſelf by his own ſtrength, we ſhall never choſe with
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:003114_0073_0FEFA86F0F2E65F8"/>
him, but ſtill continue at a diſtance and enmity. Your neck is ſo much like an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron ſinew, that a leſs ſtrength than that of God is inſuffient to bow it to his yoak. Deſire therefore, that this arm may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, whereby your naturally ſtubborn ſpirits may be made tractable and obedient.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Reſolve to cover and keep nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord hath been provoked.</hi> He that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth his ſins ſhall not proſper. And as ſin, which is the cauſe of war, muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, ſo you muſt <hi>leave the tents of Rebels</hi>; you muſt ſhake off your acquaintance with them that are the Lords profeſs'd enemies, and become companions of thoſe that fear him.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="unknown:003114_0073_0FEFA86F0F2E65F8"/>
to perſwade believers to endeavour after an aſſurance of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſigns are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>True peace follows after contrition and trouble for ſin.</hi> Thou art at peace; but waſt thou ever troubled? if not, 'twere well if thy peace were gone, and trouble in the room of it. Thou art troubled at thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral loſſes, and when thy expectation from the creatures is fruſtrated; affliction alſo is troubleſom, and acknowledg'd an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but were thine eyes open to ſee the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſin? was thy heart ever troubled for it? If guilt be made light of, if future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be not thought on, nor feared, if thou art unſenſible that ſin is a plague, and 'tis not noyſom to thee, if thy offending of God be the ſmaleſt matter of a thouſand, as long as thou feeleſt nothing of his hand, certainly thou waft never broken, and ſo thy peace is not thy priviledge, but thy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Chriſt <hi>was annointed to bind up the broken-hearted, and to comfort thoſe who firſt have mourned, Iſai.</hi> 61.1. and thoſe who have true reſt given them, were firſt weary and heavy laden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>True peace is the fruit of the lips.</hi> Iſai. 57.9. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near.</hi> Peace is called the fruit of the lips,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:003114_0074_0FEF969861E41A08"/>
partly becauſe 'tis grounded upon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which is preached to us: Where true peace is, there hath been a crying and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the voice for it. Oh what importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities have been uſed, that the Lord would ceaſe to be an adverſary? what wreſtlings for his favour and friendſhip? This peace hath been valued above all the world, and the ſoul hath been contented to do any thing, to be any thing, ſo it may be at peace with God.</p>
               <p>True peace is likewiſe grounded upon the word; 'tis a peace not of our own, but of the Lords ſpeaking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace to his people, and to his Saints, but let them not turn again to folly.</hi> And when he ſpeaks peace, who then can make trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The word diſcovers the marks and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of ſuch as are indeed reconciled unto God, and become his children; that they prize the Lord Jeſus above all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. that they hunger and thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holineſs and righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. that they love and fear, and are deſirous to follow their Father, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. And the Spirit by the Word doth work theſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities and inclinations in our hearts, and diſcovers that he hath wrought them; and ſo we come to conclude that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reconciled.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:003114_0074_0FEF969861E41A08"/>3. <hi>True peace is joyned with the ſpiritual combat.</hi> The Spirit luſts againſt the fleſh in all thoſe who are reconciled unto God. There is a war with ſin where-ever there is a peace with God. If any of our luſts, which are both the Lords enemies and our own too, are winked at, and proviſion is made for them that they may be fulfilled, we plainly ſhew we are ſtill alienated from him. But if the remainders of corruption, if that evil which is preſent with us, be our burthen, and makes us cry out, <hi>O wretched as we are, Rom.</hi> 7.24. and we would eſteem it one of the greateſt happineſſes, to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of that ſin that dwells in us, this ſhews evidently, <hi>that with our minds we ſerve the Law of God, that we are in Chriſt Jeſus, and there is no condemnation to us, Rom.</hi> 6, 25: and 8.1.</p>
               <p>I grant, that in a wicked man there may be a combat between his will and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: Conſcience may check and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, for what his will hath a ſtrong propenſion towards. But the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and the Spirit is another thing: Here the very heart and will is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, holineſs is longed after, ſin, not only becauſe of its guilt, but becauſe of its filth, a burthen; and the heart is deſirous that conſcience were more awakened, that
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:003114_0075_0FEFA83183BB7990"/>
it might exerciſe greater power, and cauſe a greater reſtraint from what is evil; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the deſire of unrenewed ones is, that conſcience, when troubled, may be huſht aſleep, that ſo ſin may be committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remorſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>True peace is inconſiſtent with careleſs walking.</hi> A Child of God, who hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto peace, if he grows looſe, and begins to live at random, preſently his peace withers, and conſcience grudges and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, eſpecially if temptation to ſin, that hath no more of preſumption, doth prevail. Canſt thou omit thy duty? canſt thou be proud and periſh? canſt thou be exceſſive in thy recreations? canſt thou be unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over thy heart, and words, and ways, and yet thy peace not at all abate? Aſſure thy ſelf thy peace is but a meer deluſion.</p>
               <p>The quicknings of the Spirit may be without the comforts, but never the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts without the quicknings. If thou grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Spirit by thy lukewarmneſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality to withdraw his aſſiſtance, and to leave thee under deadneſs, and thy peace ſtill remains, that peace is not the Spirits fruit, but thy own hearts preſumption.</p>
               <p>Thus of the ſigns of peace.</p>
               <p>Now follows the arguments to perſwade unto endeavours after aſſurance that your peace is made.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:003114_0075_0FEFA83183BB7990"/>1. <hi>Aſſurance of peace will inflame your hearts with love.</hi> How will the fire kindle, and your hearts burn within you, when you percieve, that you, even you in particular, have an intereſt in that love which paſſes knowledge? that God hath had thoughts of kindneſs and mercy towards you, before the foundation of the world was laid, and that as his love is from everlaſting, ſo to evrlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting it will endure? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And this manifeſtation and ſenſe of the love of God will have the greater influence, becauſe it uſually finds us in ſorrow, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether ever favour will be extended towards ſuch as we, fearing we are caſt-a-ways. Now when in this doleful darkneſs the light of Gods countenance is lifted up, and he ſhews his reconciled face, oh how do our affections work towards him! The Prodigal, who came home with a ſad and doubtful mind, when he found himſelf in his Fathers armes, when he ſaw that ſo long abſence and great exorbitancies had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd his Fathers love, ſurely the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his love towards his Father again were beyond expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will fill you with joy and wonder.</hi> You will admire to ſee how the caſe is altered with you, a while ago you
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:003114_0076_0FEFA856630679F8"/>
were ſtrangers, now friends and favourites; a while ago you had not obtained mercy, but now you have obtained mercy; a while ago the firſt reſurrection, and ſo are ſome of thoſe happy ones, over whom the ſecond death hath no power; a while ago the children of wrath, and ſons of death, now adopted the children of God, and the heirs of glory! Well may your hearts rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you. This joy is not like that of the carnal and ungodly, 'tis built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſurer foundation, affliction cannot damp it, and the thoughts of death and judgment, which quite ſpoil the mirth of the wicked, will but highten and increaſe it, it being an earneſt of that fulneſs of joy, which after diſſolution will be entred into.</p>
               <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſurance of peace <hi>will mightily engage you unto thankfulneſs.</hi> This is one reaſon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, why <hi>David</hi> is called a man after the heart of God, becauſe he was ſo much in praiſe. And aſſurance will make you abound in thankſgiving. Unbelieving doubts and fears cauſe us to be poſſeſſed with a dumb devil, ſo that though our receipts are vaſt, our returns, are ſmall: We miſconſtrue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſay, they are common to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and that they are given in anger to us, and will ſerve only to increaſe both our
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:003114_0076_0FEFA856630679F8"/>
ſin and puniſhment. But when we know that our peace is made, we ſhall alſo know our intereſt in thoſe bleſſings which are peculiar to Gods choſen ones; and as for outward mercies, they will be very much ſweetned, becauſe coming not only from the hand, but from the heart of God; and hereupon we ſhall be the more forward <hi>to offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name,</hi> Heb. 13.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will quicken you to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; make you ſtedfaſt in obedience.</hi> With what forwardneſs will you pray, when you know you ſhall be heard? with what willingneſs will you engage in other Ordinance, when you know that God will meet with you in them? When you attend upon the miniſtry of the Word, the Lord himſelf hath engaged to be your inſtructer; when you come to the table, he will certainly make you welcome, and will be, not only the inviter, but the feaſt likewiſe. Your expectations may be juſtly raiſed, and you ſhall not be aſhamed of them. What encouragement doth this afford? And alſo, when you know that you are reconciled to God, and have a ſight and taſte how good and gracious he is, you will cleave to him with the fuller purpoſe of heart; you will find ſo much ſweetneſs in him, that all the delights of ſin and the world, which Satan doth ſo
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:003114_0077_0FEFA83B36B3FB88"/>
much magnifie in his temptations, will be but cheap and mean in compariſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Aſſurance of peace <hi>will ſet you above the fears of affliction and of death:</hi> Then you will be able to make application of that ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting truth unto your ſelves, <hi>That all chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are from love, and tend unto your holineſs &amp; profit, Heb.</hi> 12.6, 10. and this will keep you from fainting and diſmayedneſs of Spirit. Nay, death it ſelf will rather be deſired than feared, when you know it will admit you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords preſence, from whom, while in the body, you are abſent, when you know, that as ſoon as <hi>this earthly houſe of your taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhall be diſſolved, you ſhall have a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let not your hearts be lifted up with pride after the Lord hath manifeſted himſelf to you.</hi> Pride is a great enemy to peace. God revives and comforts the ſpirit of the humble, and the heart of the contrite ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. Thoſe who obſerve the workings of their own ſouls, ſhall find, after Gods manifeſting himſelf, that pride is commonly one of the firſt ſins which aſſaults them. The Apoſtle, after the abundance of revelations, was in
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:003114_0077_0FEFA83B36B3FB88"/>
great danger of being exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; therefore the meſſenger of Satan is ſent to buffet him, that this ſelf-exalting might be prevented. Oh do not think highly of your ſelves, do not cenſure and undervalue others; the more low you are in your own eyes, your joy and peace will be the more abiding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be watchful even againſt little ſins</hi>: Theſe will deaden the heart, and grieve the Spirit, cauſing him to ſuſpend his ſweet influences, and make way for greater. Little ſins have their peculiar aggravations. How inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are we when we ſtand with God about a ſmall matter, and refuſe to do a little for him? Miſpenſe of a little time, a little exceſs in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the creatures, a little frothineſs of mind, the ſmaller ſtirrings of pride and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch like, which are more commonly to be found in profeſſors, you muſt beware of, elſe theſe leſſer ſins, to your coſt and ſorrow, will be found great enough, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt and break your peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Eſpecially take heed of groſs tranſgreſſions which waſte the Conſcience.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> would needs feed upon forbidden pleaſures, he loſt his peace, and the joy of Gods ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.

Never offer unto God a ſacrifice, but let it have <hi>ſound inwards.</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That the Lords countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Pſal. 11. <hi>ult.</hi> When we are ſincere, and ſerve him with our whole ſoul, then he ſhews his face, and in his looks we may read his love, and through Chriſt his accepting of us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Let your deſign in begging the continuance of peace be this, that hereby you may be encouraged to do more for God, and to cleave the cloſer to him.</hi> Aim at his glory as well as your own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this matter. <hi>Lord! I deſire a continued aſſurance of thy love, but 'tis that I may love thee more, and be more zealous for thine honour, and labour in thy work with greater life and vigour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Let it be your daily practiſe to walk with God.</hi> Be not religious only by fits; this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues an heart much diſtempered.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall give a directory how to walk every day.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When your eyes are firſt open, lift them up to God, let your hearts be well ſeaſoned
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:003114_0078_0FEF9696D61BB2D0"/>
with holy thoughts and affections; they will be in the better frame all the day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Allot ſome time for ſecret prayer and ſearching of the Scripture, twice every day at leaſt: And ſervants, which are not maſters of their own time, if they cannot ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently pray at one time, ſhould be ſure to catch hold of another opportunity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let not meditation be omitted. One quarter of an hour, at leaſt, in thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome truth, the hearing or reading of which hath a little moved you, or which doth moſt concern you, may be well ſpared.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſerious in family duties, walk in the houſe with a perfect heart, and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly do the duties of your places and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the word ſtands much upon theſe, and hereby Religion is adorned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Accuſtom your ſelves to thoughts of God, and let your deſires be frequently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending towards him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In worldly buſineſs, remember Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be kept void of offence; take heed of injuſtice, defrauding, over-reaching.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let not the world, when it flows into your hands, inſinuate it ſelf into your hearts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Study to excel in thoſe things which may make Religion amiable in the eyes of the world, as meekneſs, humility, contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with your condition, charitableneſs, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:003114_0079_0FEFA840302CE2C0"/>
refuſing to backbite and defame any.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Be vigilant againſt the ſin which doth moſt eaſily beſet you, the ſin of your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſin of your calling, the ſin which heretofore did bear the greateſt ſway in you.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Reſiſt temptation at the firſt appearing of it; ſtart back from Satans baits, as one would do who is ready to tread upon a Serpent.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Let not Chriſtian liberty degenerate into carnal licentiouſneſs, uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh; remember you are the Diſciples of the crucified Jeſus, and ſo in your walking there muſt be not an enmity, but a ſuitableneſs to his Croſs.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Bad company abſtain from, and be not intimate with lukewarm profeſſors; when neceſſitated to be with them, be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over your ſelves; never ſinfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, but rather reprove them.</p>
               <p n="3">13. Deſign to get ground upon ſome ſin or other every day; every day let ſome progreſs be made in the work of mortification.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Obſerve providences, and get the good of them; let loſſes and croſſes wean you from the world, let afflictions imbitter ſin, and let mercies indear the Father of them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Reſt not in Ordinances, but conſider you muſt be reckoned with how you have improved them; If in theſe you neither <hi>meet</hi> with God, nor <hi>miſs</hi> him, 'tis a bad ſign.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:003114_0079_0FEFA840302CE2C0"/>16. Keep a watch before the door of your lips; oaths, falſhood, vanity, filthineſs, your communication muſt be free from. Be alſo ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak, for in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words there wanteth not ſin.</p>
               <p n="17">17. If you fall, lye not where you are fallen, cry immediately for pardon and healing; let the wound, while green, be cured before it feſter.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Have daily recourſe to Chriſt, to cover the ſins of daily incurſion; you have as much need of daily pardon, as you have of daily bread.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Live as Strangers and Pilgrims; look upon the World as your Inn, and Heaven as your Home, and act as within view of Death, and Judgment, and Eternity.</p>
               <p n="20">20. At evening reflect how you have ſpent the day. An Heathen of old gave this nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice,
<q>
                     <l>Never let ſleep, which ſenſes tyes,</l>
                     <l>At any night cloſe up thine eyes,</l>
                     <l>Before the actions of the day</l>
                     <l>Thou thrice and ſeriouſly doeſt weigh;</l>
                     <l>Where have I ſinn'd? what have I done?</l>
                     <l>What duty have I let alone?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If you would walk after this manner, how perfect might your peace be? and how much might your paſſage be ſweetned through his vale of tears?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:003114_0080_0FEFA8492DF32348"/>I have done with the third Doctrine: I ſhall be very brief in the two which remain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The fourth Doctrine is this, <hi>That when ſinners will not ſee, they are ſmitten many times with ſpiritual blindneſs, and the things of their peace are in a way of judgment bid from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord hides the things of their peace from them ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He cauſes his Spirit to withdraw</hi>: 'Tis the Spirits work to enlighten dark under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; but if the Spirit be gone, how great muſt the darkneſs be?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord gives Men up to the perverſe reaſonings and counſels of their own hearts</hi>; and then a thouſand abſurdities will, by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, be imagined in the doctrine which is according to godlineſs; and how bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome will the practiſe of godlineſs be made to appear?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord permits Satan to blind them</hi>; and by his means their hatred of light, and of the works of light, is very much augmented; and hereupon, either more abominable prophaneneſs, or ſtrong deluſions follow.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lord in his providence cauſes ſeveral things to happen,</hi> which ſinners ſtumble at, and by which they are more confirmed in their prejudices againſt the Word, and in their infidelity. The righteous are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſometimes to fall into ſin, and many times into great diſtreſs: The wicked often proſper in the world, and live and dye in a falſe peace: And upon this the ungodly are more darkned and hardned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In all this the Lord acts as a Judge, and intends to puniſh their refuſing to be enlightned, and yet he
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:003114_0080_0FEFA8492DF32348"/>
is not the Author of ſin: <hi>He is light,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.5. and no darkneſs can come from him. All ignorance and miſtake is from corrupted nature, being wrought upon by the Prince of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Neither is the juſtice of God to be quarrelled at for dealing thus with them that reject illumination.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The merit of their ſin is great. <hi>Neſcire eſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis nolle ſcire eſt ſuperbiae</hi>; there is abundance of pride in them that are unwilling to be informed, and a great love to evil deeds, and alſo mighty ingratitude, for light is a very great priviledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This puniſhment is very ſuitable; What more equal, than that thoſe, who would not be enlightned by the Spirit of the Lord, and directed into the paths of peace, ſhould be ſuffered to be beguiled by Satan and their own ſpirits, and ſo be miſguided and loſt for ever?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Take heed of ſinning againſt the light, for fear it be put out in obſcurity. The clearer the light ſhines, the more it aggravates the works of darkneſs. Let not the luſts of your hearts be cheriſhed and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, leſt the light of your heads be hereby extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Do not unwarrantably ſurmiſe, that the things of your peace are in judgment hid from you. All blindneſs is not judicial. If thou wouldſt fain know the will of God and do it, God upon thy <hi>asking will give wiſdom liberally without upbraiding, Jam.</hi> 1. He will not fail by his Spirit to inſtruct thee, who hath made thee thus willing to be inſtructed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct</hi> 5. The laſt Doctrine follows, <hi>When ſouls are left under darkneſs, their ſtate is wretched and deplorable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider, with ſuch</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is extreamly angry.</hi> When he puniſheth ſin with ſin he is moſt of all diſpleaſed; and truly he cannot puniſh it with a worſe evil than it ſelf is. In temporal judgments, 'tis to be hoped, the Lord aims at our reformation and amendment; but when he gives up any to blindneſs of mind, and a reprobate ſenſe, 'tis a ſign his love and mercy have done with
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:003114_0081_0FEFA865112A97A0"/>
them. As by the Spirit of God believers are ſealed up to the day of redemption, ſo by the ſpirit of ſlumber the unbelievers are ſealed up to the day of deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With ſuch Satan doth what he pleaſes; he leads them along. and how little do they perceive whither they are going? how do means make them worſe? how bold are they in ſin? how quickly are they like to fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, and grow rotten ripe for vengeance? and when that vengeance overtakes them, then they will weep over themſelves, as Chriſt doth over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and too late lament their own miſery, when 'twill be impoſſible to have it removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Earneſtly intreat, that this may never be yours, which which was the puniſhnent of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And if you would not lye under the like plague, you muſt not be guilty of the like ſin, namely, rejecting Chriſt, end the Goſpel of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Pity thoſe who tread in <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſteps, and provoke the Lord to cloſe their eyes; tell them of their danger, which they themſelves do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; awaken them out of their Lethargis, if it be poſſible, before it become paſt remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. If the Lord, when others are blinded, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both light and ſalvation to any of you, break out into praiſe. The light is marvellous which you are called to, and marvellous ſhould be your joy. You have that eye-ſalve, with which few eyes are anointed, you have that Spirit which the world doth not receive. You were born blind as well as others, but a miracle of grace hath been wrought upon you; the vail is taken off, and you ſee the Lord, and your intereſt in him, how ſhould all that is within you bleſs him? This preſent light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are viſited, is, as it were the dawning of the day of glory, and a certain forerunner of the light that's everlaſting.</p>
