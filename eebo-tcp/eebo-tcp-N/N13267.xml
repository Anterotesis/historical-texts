            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SEVERAL of the Editors in their introductions to the following Teſtimonies, have informed us that the conſent of the Preacher to their publication, tho' ſolicited, had not been obtained, which is aſſigned as a reaſon for not inſerting his name;—it may now be unneceſſary to with-hold it, as by his removal from this ſtate of probation, beyond the reach of human cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or human applauſe, the Reader may be gratified therewith, without giving juſt occaſion of offence to any. Several attempts to deſcribe this worthy Servant of CHRIST appeared in the public prints ſoon after his deceaſe—two of thoſe characters are part of the preſent collection, which with the account given of his religious progreſs and faithful labours in the Goſpel of JESUS, by his Brethren in religious profeſſion, extracted from Piety promoted, the eighth part, may be a ſufficient information to thoſe readers who were unacquainted with him and, the high eſtimation in which he was held by thoſe who knew him beſt.</p>

            <head>CHARACTER OF THE LATE MR. <hi>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</hi> BROTHER TO THE PHYSICIAN DR. FOTHERGILL,</head>
            <p>TO commemorate the virtues of great and eminent men, who have been honourable in their day, is a tribute due to their memory. A tribute which ſenſible men pay from emotions of reſpectful gratitude; and from a hope that it may prove an incentive to the Living to emulate their virtues.</p>
            <p>Of this claſs the late Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher among the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, may with great juſtice be ranked. I knew him well, and had the happineſs of his occaſional acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I call it the happineſs, becauſe I never enjoyed the company of any perſon from whom I received more real ſatisfaction; and however diverſified with affliction, the future part of my life may prove, I ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe hours I have ſpent with him, but with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar pleaſure. He was an happy compound of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016777_0004_0F9E2EDD28DC01B8"/>gentleman and the chriſtian; the virtues and amiable qualities of each character being admirably blended in him. Graceful in his perſon and deportment, eaſy and affable in his manner, he commanded both reſpect and love; he poſſeſſed natural abilities far ſuperior to the generality of mankind; and improved them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his power. Well read both in books and men, his ſtudies did not terminate in barren ſpeculation; but the great truths of religion were deeply implanted in his heart, and beamed forth illuſtriouſly in a benevolent and truly chriſtian conduct.</p>
            <p>As a member of civil ſociety he was exceedingly uſeful, filling up the ſocial and relative duties of life with great propriety. Blameleſs in his manners, kind, charitable, and ready on all occaſions to devote his time and talents to promote the beſt of all cauſes, the good of mankind. He lived beloved, and his loſs is deeply deplored by all who had the happineſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his worth.</p>
            <p>As a Preacher, he was far ſuperior to moſt who fill that ſtation: Sound in the important doctrines of the chriſtian faith, he endeavoured to promote them uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, with the greateſt energy of language, and the moſt perſuaſive eloquence. In this capacity he was indeed truly great; and his greatneſs received additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal luſtre from his humility. Although followed by numbers, and courted by perſons of ſuperior rank and ſtation, and admired by thoſe of all perſuaſions, the applauſe which his eminence juſtly acquired, did not exalt, but evidently tended to make him humble. He was a perſon of an enlarged mind, zealous without bigotry, and a ſteady promoter of univerſal charity. In his ſermons, it was evident to all his intelligent hearers, that he deeply felt the force of thoſe ſolemn truths he delivered; and his manner of diſplaying them was ſo juſtly emphatical, that none but the inſenſible
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:016777_0005_0F9E2EDEF3472E98"/>or obdurate could withſtand their force, or remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected by them. He travelled much from the moſt diſintereſted motives, among his friends in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Ireland, and the American Colonies, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of piety and chriſtian virtue, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of that faith and religion in which he moſt ſurely believed, and was ſo eminent an example.</p>
            <p>During the latter part of his life he was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed in his health; but (as I have heard from the beſt authority) perfectly happy and eaſy in his mind, having an evidence in himſelf that he was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſtate of felicity which is prepared for the righteous. This evidence ſupported him through the remains of a painful life, and was his unfailing hope in the awful hour of death, which (when near his end) he declared, <q>Had no terrors, nor would the grave have any victory.</q> And alſo added, <q>That as he had lived, ſo he ſhould cloſe with the moſt unſhaken aſſurance, that he had not followed cunningly deviſed fables, but the pure living and eternal ſubſtance.</q> Such was his exemplary life—Such his triumphant death!</p>
            <p>A life ſo ſpent is truly honourable—And ſuch a death unſpeakably glorious.</p>

            <p>ON the 15th inſtant paid the laſt debt of nature, Mr. SAMUEL POTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher amongſt the people called Quakers, endowed with qualifications ſuperior to moſt, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by a zeal truly apoſtolic, he long preached the intereſting truths of the goſpel to mankind; whilſt the uniform tenor of his life, devoted to religion and ſpent in the practice of every virtue, was the ſtrongeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his doctrine.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="biography">
            <p>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington in Lancaſhire, was the ſixth ſon of our worthy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient friend JOHN FOTHERGILL, mentioned in this Treatiſe; ſee page 29, and of MARGARET his wife, for an account of whom ſee volume the ſixth, page 90, of Piety promoted.</p>
            <p>This their ſon being of an active and lively diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and during his apprenticeſhip moſtly from under the watchful eye of his affectionate parent, he fled from the Holy Croſs of CHRIST, and indulged himſelf in the gratifications of folly and licentiouſneſs; violating the repeated convictions of divine grace in his own mind, which had been mercifully extended from his early years, thereby wounding the ſoul of his tender father (of whoſe religious care to form and lead the tender minds of his children to piety and virtue, we have an account in the memoirs of his life;) yet his pious admonitions proved nevertheleſs, as bread caſt on the waters, which returned after many days; for about the twenty firſt year of his age, the viſitation of divine love was ſo powerfully renewed, that it proved effectual to turn his ſteps out of the paths of vanity; and as he has expreſſed, with humble and awful gratitude to the Preſerver of men, <hi>It then appeared clear to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016777_0007_0F9E2EDFE416FBB0"/>that would be the laſt call the heavenly Father would favour him with;</hi> he therefore conſulted no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with fleſh and blood, but gave up to the holy viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, devoting his whole heart and affections to ſuch reconciliation with GOD, through the mediation of JESUS CHRIST; and abiding in great humility under the purifying operation of the holy Ghoſt and fire, he became thereby qualified for thoſe eminent ſervices he was called into; for in a few months, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraning power and love of GOD, his mouth was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear a Teſtimony to the ſufficiency of that holy Arm that had plucked him as a brand out of the fire: Thus a diſpenſation of the miniſtry being committed to his charge, he attended faithfully thereto, and moved therein at the requirings, and under the direction of divine wiſdom, by which means he ſoon became an able miniſter of the goſpel, called thereto and qualified by the Holy Ghoſt, under which influence he laboured with diligence and devoted much of his time and ſtrength, when health permitted, to the ſervice of his dear LORD and Maſter; for the continuance of whoſe favours he counted nothing too near or dear to part with, that he might be inſtrumental in gathering ſouls to GOD, which was the object he had in view in all his goſpel labours; being diligent himſelf, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to excite friends to a due and conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of meetings for religious worſhip, and thoſe for the diſciplince of the church.</p>
            <p>Thro' the courſe of his goſpel labours, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and private, animated by divine love, he expreſſed an uncommon warmth of affection for the riſing youth of this generation, with whom he was frequently led into a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> brotherly feeling and ſympathy for their preſent and eternal welfare; under which concern his love to this claſs of both ſexes, under all denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was ſtrong and ardent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016777_0008_0F9E2EE09911B980"/>
He travelled much in this Nation and Scotland, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in Ireland, and once through moſt of the North American Colonies, in the ſervice of truth; where, tho' ſingularly humbled in a ſenſe of poverty, weakneſs and inſufficiency on his firſt landing, he was by accounts received, marvelouſly ſtrengthened, both in public and private, in goſpel authority and love, to the awakening and comforting of many.</p>
            <p>In the fore part of the year 1769, he viſited moſt of the families of friends in the monthly-meeting of Grace church ſtreet, London; in which ſervice he was divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthened and enabled to extend a helping hand to many in cloſe and neceſſary labour, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing care, to live and act conſiſtent with our holy profeſſion, to the comfort and help of divers, and his own peace; and afterwards, at two different opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, he viſited the families of friends in Horſlydown and Weſtminſter monthly-meetings in that city, to the ſame good effect.</p>
            <p>He moſtly attended the yearly-meetings in London, and other places, when of bodily ability; in which his goſpel labours were very acceptable and edifying; being particularly careful when called from home, to return to his family and friends with as much expedition as the nature of his ſervice would admit.</p>
            <p>Having acquired a moderate competency by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and induſtry, he declined trade for ſeveral years before his deceaſe, devoting his time and talents to the ſervice of the churches. As a Pillar in the Lord's houſe he was ſtedfaſt, being actuated by a chriſtian and manly zeal; in deportment grave; his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſavory and edifying, correſponding with his miniſtry, which at times went forth as a flame, piercing the obdurate, yet diſcended like dew upon the tender plants of our heavenly Father's planting, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016777_0009_0F9E2EE154BE39F8"/>true mourners in zion, with theſe he travelled in a deep ſympathy of ſpirit; in his goſpel labours free from affectation, in doctrine clear, ſound and pathetic, filled with charity, allowing for the prejudices of mankind, being indeed a miniſter and elder worthy of double honour, ſpeaking whereof he knew, and what his own hands had handled of the good word of life.</p>
            <p>He endured a long and painful illneſs with much patience and reſignation, and towards the cloſe of his time expreſſed himſelf to ſome of his relations, when they took leave of him, previous to their ſetting out for the yearly-meeting in London, to the following effect: <hi>Our health is no more at our command, than length of days:—Mine ſeems drawing faſt towards a concluſion; but I am content with every allotment of Providence, for they are all in wiſdom,—unerring wiſdom.</hi>

               <hi>There is one thing which as an arm underneath, bears up and ſupports; and tho' the rolling tempeſtuous billows ſurround, yet my head is kept above them, and my feet are firmly eſtabliſhed.—O! ſeek it,—preſs after it,—lay faſt hold of it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tho' painful my nights, and weariſome my days, yet I am preſerved in patience and reſignation.—Death has no terrors, nor will the grave have any victory.—My ſoul triumphs over death, hell and the grave.</hi>

               <hi>I ſhould have been thankful had I been able to have got to the enſuing yearly-meeting in London, which you are now going to attend, where I have been ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed

               <hi>I feel a foretaſte of that joy that is to come;—and who would wiſh to change ſuch a ſtate of mind?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhould be glad if an eaſy channel could be found to inform the yearly-meeting that as I have lived, ſo I ſhall cloſe, with the moſt unſhaken aſſurance, that we have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, but the pure living eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſubſtance.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Let the aged be ſtrong, let the middle aged be animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the youth encouraged; for the Lord is ſtill with Zion; the Lord will bleſs Zion.</hi>

               <hi>Extract from the Publiſher's Introduction to the Printer of the public Ledger, dated London, September</hi> 4, 1769.</head>
            <p>"On a viſit lately to a literary acquaintance in the country, I met with the encloſed manuſcript copy of an Epiſtle to the inhabitants of Tortola in America, addreſſed to a ſociety under the diſtinguiſhed appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friends. I was induced to borrow it to take a copy for my own uſe, and ſeveral of my acquaintance expreſſing a deſire of having it printed, that they might become poſſeſſed of ſome copies without the trouble of writing them, I have ſent it for inſertion in order to oblige them. It is but juſtice to acknowledge that neither the author, nor his relations know any thing of its being conveyed to the preſs for public inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Convinced that it may have a tendency to profit ſociety in general, and cannot poſſibly be productive of diſadvantageous conſequences to any individual, I did not chuſe to riſk its ſuppreſſion, by aſking leave for its publication.</p>
            <p>Whatever blame is due to its appearance, is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, entirely my own; whatever merit may be found in the performance, is due to its author, as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inſtruction conveyed thereby; which is all the preface and apology that ſeems neceſſary, by way of introduction, from</p>

                  <head>AN EPISTLE TO FRIENDS IN THE ISLAND OF <hi>TORTOLA.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THOUGH I am perſonally a ſtranger, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to moſt of you; yet ye have been, of late time eſpecially, ſo frequently the ſubject of cloſe thoughtfulneſs to me, and with ſo much warmth as to engage my mind to viſit you in a collective capacity with this Epiſtle, from ſome apprehenſions of duty, and with an heart repleniſhed with ſincere good will, in which I wiſh you the poſſeſſion of that happineſs which is everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>It was tidings of great joy to the living body of friends in this land, to hear that the Lord Almighty was at work in your Iſland to beget children to himſelf: and that the ſame ſubſtantial virtue which wrought upon many in this and other nations, to redeem and purify them a people to the praiſe of his great name, had alſo viſited you with the day-ſpring from on high; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſame bleſſed fruits in meaſure, even a death
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016777_0013_0F9E2EE91ECA89B0"/>unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs; and, by the baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, brought them into the body whereof Chriſt is head.</p>
                  <p>Oh the tenderneſs, the fear, and watchfulneſs, which attended ſome of your ſouls in that day! A precious day of viſitation, which ought for ever to be remembered; a day wherein the Lord allured ſome of you, and brought you into the wilderneſs; ſpeaking comfortably to you, and in his own time, gave you vineyards from thence. Some of you, I believe, have in remembrance thoſe times of divine betrothing, and cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it was the Lord's doing. Then the mind was humbled as in the duſt, and a living concern aroſe to walk in white, and to enter into covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant you then hoped would never be broken; in this ſimplicity of heart, the Lord's children are ever ſafeſt; almighty power watching over them for good, and regarding them with a father's care.</p>
                  <p>As individuals amongſt you were thus engaged, the ſpiritual ſympathy and fellowſhip of the one body ſpread over ſea and land; and we became as epiſtles written in one another's hearts; and were baptized by the one ſpirit into the one body, wherein is the bond of peace, and unity of the faints; in this ſtood our rejoicing on your account; for it is not the acceſſion of numbers to any name or diſtinction amongſt men, but the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſouls to the everlaſting ſhepherd, which gives joy to the Lord's family in heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>Now, dear Friends, is not the dew of your morning at times brought to recollection, and its heavenly reliſh remembered, yet hath not a loſs ſenſibly attended you, and the once promiſing plantation amongſt you become leſs fruitful and beautiful? If ſo, where ſhall we enquire for the cauſe? We ſhall not find any deficiency in divine compaſſion; but the loſs hath been occaſioned by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016777_0014_0F9E2EE993BE5DF8"/>to follow on to know the Lord in his own way and leadings; and a departure in heart from him hath enſued, whereby the work hath been marred; and that goodneſs, wherein the holy unchangeable one would have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and rendered a permanent bleſſing and beauty to you, hath been to too many as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it hath ſoon paſſed away.</p>
                  <p>Such ever was the conſequence of unfaithfulneſs to the diſcoveries of the pure light; weakneſs, revolt, and back-ſliding have enſued, and when people have forſaken the fountain of living waters (which is open for ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and refreſhment) all their labour and inventions have been as broken ciſterns that can hold no water, and the latter end of ſuch, unleſs they return and repent, will be worſe than their former un-enlightened ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Bear with me, dear friends, in this freedom: My ſoul longs for your help and reſtoration; that by and through you the great name may be exalted in thoſe Iſlands, and <hi>that</hi> part of the Lord's footſtool may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious.</p>
                  <p>Let, I beſeech you, the ſeeming foremoſt rank amongſt you, look cloſely to their own ſteps; and conſider care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, whether they have not by ſome means contributed to the general decay of lively zeal and care, through their own declenſion and lukewarmneſs, for it is moſt certain the faithfulneſs, or unfaithfulneſs of this rank hath a very great influence over young and tender minds, as well as of thoſe who may be more advanced in years, than experience, and yet not void of a ſecret reliſh for heavenly matters. Return, therefore, I beſeech you, O ye Chiefs amongſt the people, to your firſt love, and do your firſt works leſt greater deſolation enſue; and he, who walketh in the midſt of the ſeven golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, come unto you quickly, and remove your's out of its place; for why ſhould the candleſtick remain, when the light and luſtre of the candle is extinguiſhed.</p>

                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016777_0015_0F9E2EEA4D5B8288"/>
And dearly beloved friends of the riſing generation, and ye in the prime of your life, ſuffer and receive the word of exhortation from one who tenderly loves you; remember your Creator and your Judge. Let not the fooliſh amuſements, or vain converſation of this world, prevail to turn you aſide from your great and everlaſting intereſt; remember there is not any thing of this world can lay the foundation of eternal peace. It is an earneſt humble ſeeking after the ſanctifying hand, and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to its virtue which can alone faſhion you as veſſels of honour, and fit you for the heavenly kingdom. Cheriſh the ſecret drawings of divine love, be not aſhamed of its tendering reſtraining effects. Why ſhould you ſell your ſouls for a thing of nought, for ſuch will be the ſmiles and frowns of this world, in a day that is haſtily approaching. Let not, therefore, the evil example of others, nor the reproach of the ſcornful prevail to your hurt; but retain the fear of God, which will keep the heart clean; and be an excellent enduring treaſure, when every thing elſe ſhall vaniſh as a vapour.</p>
                  <p>And it moſt certainly behoves you, friends, who are natives of this land, and have had your education amongſt us as a people, and been frequently directed to the heavenly monitor, to walk with great circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Ye are amongſt a people who have been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the like precious faith with us, principally through the immediate reach of the divine hand. Will not their eyes be turned to look at your conduct, and to obſerve the fruits of your faith, by its prevalence in your lives and converſations: And if inſtead of the bleſſed fruits of righteouſneſs, the contrary ſhould appear, and your conduct be the means of ſtumbling to any, and evil liberties be purſued by you to your own and others hurt; to ſuch I teſtify in the name, and under an awful ſenſe of the authority of the Moſt High, it had been better for them never to have known the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Heavy, very heavy will be the weight of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016777_0016_0F9E2EEB5C03CC78"/>complicated guilt of their own tranſgreſſions, and the tranſgreſſions of others made worſe by their example. Wo from a righteous and dreadful God, to thoſe by whom ſuch offences come.</p>
                  <p>I make no doubt but there are amongſt you an honeſt ſeed; an afflicted and poor people, ſome of the Lord's poor, who retain in ſome good degree, their firſt love, and bewail the hurt of Zion. I beſeech ſuch to ſtand faſt in their own lots, abide in the faith and patience; be ſober and hope to the end. Though the times are gloomy, the out-goings of the morning are of God, and he can, and will in his own time, cauſe the wilderneſs to become a fruitful field. Look not too much at the declenſion of others, leſt your faith ſhould fail, but ſtedfaſtly look to, and follow on to know the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who remains for ever, and the defection of multitudes can by no means impair his unchangeable truth and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>In a ſenſe of the freſh extendings of ancient all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient help, I moſt tenderly and affectionately ſalute you; may the ſcattered amongſt you be brought home, and the negligent be rouſed to diligence, whilſt yet a little day continues. Let the tender breathings ſtill remaining be cheriſhed, that they may gather ſtrength, and enter with holy prevalence the ear of the Lord and Father of his people. This is the ſincere prayer of one concerned at heart, for your reſtoration and ſtability in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace forever.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE following pathetic, and moving exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, were, as carefully as poſſible, taken down in characters, as they flowed from the lips of the preacher to large and crowded audiences; at which were preſent numbers of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions: many of whom have requeſted copies of the tranſcript; and others have deſired, in the ſtrongeſt terms, that they might be made ſtill more public, by means of the preſs.</p>
                  <p>The writer is deſirous of obliging many, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence to any individual—The manuſcript hath been read and approved of, by numbers of ſuperior judgment, who were preſent; and who have joined in this opinion, that from their being publiſhed, good may proceed to the well diſpoſed; nor can any kind of harm be foreſeen to accrue from hence.</p>
                  <p>The writer is not conſcious of having miſtaken the author's ſenſe: And if to the memory of any who were then preſent, there ſhould occur any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations from his immediate expreſſions, the editor is aſſured there can be but few, and thoſe not of moment, he having to the readieſt expedition, joined the moſt perfect attention, tho' in a crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed congregation (where he could have no other reſt, or ſupport, than the hand or the knee.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016777_0019_0F9E2EEFAE68CC60"/>
Indeed! the lively force and heart-felt energy with which the ſubſequent exhortations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, muſt remain from that time wanting: nor is it material to offer, that it is not in the power of the moſt faithful tranſcriber, to convey that enforcing part to his readers. The texts, i. e. chapter and verſe, have been ſince added, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to illuſtrate the work, and render it (if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!) more pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>The editor hath likewiſe taken down (by deſire) two other Sermons, from the ſame preacher; the ſubject of the firſt taken from the prayer of Agur, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxx. 7, 8, and 9. the other from <hi>Cant.</hi> iv. and 12, and at the cloſe of each, a Prayer; but thoſe will continue in manuſcript unleſs a public edition of them be encouraged.</p>
                  <p>As the miniſter hath been repeatedly ſolicited, but in vain, to conſent to the preſent publication; the reader muſt not wonder that his name is not publiſhed.</p>

                     <hi>The following Sermon was delivered, on Sunday morning the 17th day of May, 1767, at the</hi> opening <hi>of the yearly-meeting, at the Fryers, in Briſtol.</hi>

                     <hi>Art thou in health; my brother?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language of ſalutation of Joab to Amaſa; but with ſentiments different, far different, from thoſe which actuated the treachery of Joab; even thoſe of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleniſhed with that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which wiſheth well to all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art thou in health; my Brother?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could wiſh, with all poſſible ſolicitude, to lead every mind preſent, into the moſt careful enquiry, in reſpect to their ſpiritual ſtate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that ſupreme almighty being, who is the juſt and awful judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a ſolicitude for the health of your bodies, and proſperity of your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns, that too many of you have too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal ſouls; which is indeed <hi>the one thing needful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe temporal concerns, I ſay, which are of a trifling periſhing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principal concern: your anxiety and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the attainment of the treaſures and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pleaſures of the world, have occaſioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016777_0021_0F9E2EF1CB275CAB"/>
The conveniences of life are, by no means, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible concern, where they are bounded with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and confined within their proper channel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no leſs than eternal moment; it alſo requires an attention pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to its proper worth; for what are temporal concerns, when compared with the important one of eternity!</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the body is ſubject to divers maladies; and when we have done our utmoſt to preſerve it, we ſhall find in the end (and how ſoon that may be none knows) that it is of neceſſity, ſubject to the ſtroke of death, and to the incloſure of the grave.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore thought it by no means an improper enquiry for each individual to make, and deeply ponder, What is thy ſtate, or how is it with thee, O my ſoul! who art capable of partaking of immortal joys, and deſtined to triumph over death and the grave? <hi>When this earthly tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved,</hi> thy appointment and deſtination, if in proper ſoundneſs for it, ſhall be made perſect with the whole family of GOD, and be no longer ſubject to the diſeaſes, pains, trials and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this life, but ſhare the things which are of GOD,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>With the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this is of the moſt infinite importance to the ſons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the preſent occaſion, to put you in mind of the neceſſary enquiry into the ſtate of your ſpiritual health; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your immortal ſouls: being very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appearance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dangerous
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016777_0022_0F9E2EF1D6B9FE40"/>ſtate of diſeaſe and ſtupefaction; have only preſerved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>This enquiry into the preſent ſtate of experience, and of advancement in the work of ſalvation, hath branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf out in my view, and divided into ſeveral claſſes, thoſe who are now within the audience of my voice. And, in the firſt place, I intreat the attention of you, the elders, amongſt whom our LORD, as amongſt ſo many ſhepherds, hath divided his flock; over whom you are appointed to watch, and to teach them to perſevere in the path which leadeth to eternal life!</p>
                  <p>You have experienced the power of religion: you have<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 12.</note>

                  <p>O ye parents and heads of families, who are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as delegated ſhepherds over them; timely beware, leſt the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge, fall on your heads: (if through your miſconduct they become corrupted, and their ſouls periſh.)

With what ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and compoſure of mind will ſuch parents be enabled to anſwer the great GOD, upon his awful exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to this purpoſe: <q>What have you done with thoſe tender ſheep which I committed to your care in the wilderneſs? have you trained them up in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</q>—How will ſuch parents be ſupported by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having done their duty, in that ſolemn hour!—They then may truly ſay, <q>I have done my utmoſt within my contracted ſphere, within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row precincts of my allotment in life, to fill up my ſtated duty.</q> Then the ſupreme judge will ſet at his right hand ſuch parents, and they ſhall be united to him in glory.</p>
                  <p>And I beſeech you parents, elders, miniſters, (and I include myſelf) let us all ſay Amen, to this ſolemn care in our reſpective families; let us all diſcharge our ſeveral duties as men, hoping for the coming of our LORD; who then will ſay unto us, <q>Well done, good and faithful ſervants,</q> even in that hour when he ſhall come with terrors to make inquiſition for blood thro' the various ranks, whether miniſters, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various claſſes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

                  <p>Exerciſe yourſelves in this your preſent ſtate, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from thoſe, whoſe faculties are bounded within the narrow limits of this world; cultivate, continually cultivate, the minds of your offspring: endeavouring to raiſe in them a proper comprehenſion of the dignity of their natures, and to fix in them early a ſteady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their <hi>immortality;</hi> which is of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to all?</p>
                  <p>The hearts of thoſe are unſound, who live in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual attachment to the pride of life, who are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the love of the world, wherein their chief happineſs appears to be placed: how can ſuch point out the way to the city of GOD? how can they ſay to their children, <q>Let us retreat from the world, from this ſcene of corruption; let us withdraw from the cares, the ſolicitudes of life: let us aſcend to our appointed home: let us contemplate the joys of eternity: let nothing ſeparate us from that bleſſed hope!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>How can parents thus addreſs their children, when they have, perhaps, for a long courſe of years, ceaſed to conſider the awful importance of the ſubject; and their own minds continue fixed, and tied down to the fading enjoyments of life! Alas! that the folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſuperfluous pleaſures of the world ſhould ſo entirely engage and engroſs the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almoſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their precious time!</p>
                  <p>Hence, ſometimes, parents, inſtead of inſtructing the minds of their children, have ſo totally corrupted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016777_0029_0F9E2EFA76C5F130"/>their own, that they have laid obſtructions in the way to the immortal happineſs of their offspring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and virtue, they have been ſo extremely corrupt themſelves, as to oppoſe them in their paſſage; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, with violence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggravated their own guilt beyond expreſſion; alas! what will their puniſhment prove, when convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſo great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is the judge of quick and dead ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in judgment, to render to every man according to his works! May all parents, who are negligent in the diſcharge of their duties, lay it ſeriouſly to heart.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, may you, my brethren and ſiſters in a ſpiritual relation, continue in a ſtate of lively, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive health—labouring in the ſure ground of hope; that, <hi>when the great ſhepherd himſelf ſhall appear, you may alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> If you ſo perſiſt, I cannot but yet hope, that your ſtedfaſt continuance will prove the means of ſpreading ſpiritual health, in an eminent degree. For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <hi>with the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, or the pride of life,</hi> are very apt to ſpread the contagion to all that are round about them: ſo, on the other hand, ſuch as are reſtored by CHRIST, to a ſtate of ſpiritual health, and by him ſteadily preſerved in it, often become inſtrumental in his hand, to diffuſe that bleſſing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently obſerved to have healthy children.</p>
                  <p>I am convinced that the LORD is at work amongſt the riſing generation; many of whom ſtand convicted in their own minds, of the want of ſpiritual health; and are imploring the mercy of the GOD of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:016777_0030_0F9E2EFACEAA3DF0"/>
In order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the preſent riſing generation; whoſe ſtations in life may be likely to have ſome little continuance; be ever ſtedfaſt in the performance of your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of GOD.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me of the greateſt importance, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent preſent, that you watch over, and carefully nouriſh every ſeed of virtue ſpringing up in the minds of your children, for the ſake of their, and of your own, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral welfare; as well as for the hope and aſſurance of both their, and your own, eternal happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And here, let me claſs every ſingle individual; as every ſingle individual is poſting on his way to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate of exiſtence—and that they may be guided by infinite wiſdom, is my earneſt deſire; and be at laſt received into glory! welcomed thither by their dear Redeemer!</p>
                  <p>In this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another. He hath preſerved many from the pollutions that too frequently reign in the world; and hath merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully induced ſome to look early into the law of liberty, into the counſel of his will, who thereby learn the things which belong to their peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Art thou in health; my brother?</hi> Art thou not only <hi>called from</hi> a ſtate of <hi>darkneſs, into his marvellous light;</hi> but, obedient to the call, entered upon the road to eternal glory? Art thou in health; my fellow pilgrim?</p>
                  <p>A ſenſe of the want of that food which CHRIST gives, is at leaſt a ſymptom of life.</p>

I believe it may be ſaid concerning ſome among you, as was ſaid formerly to CHRIST; <hi>Lord, he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</hi> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the ſpirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or appearances, upon comparative righteouſneſs, upon a compariſon of their preſent, with their former ſtate; whoſe minds are relaxed with the love and ſpirit of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Some have relaxed into evil, and are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too much unacquainted with GOD and his law; which, to holineſs, and to <hi>that</hi> only, annexes happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Many of theſe might have gone on from one degree of ſtrength to another; had they not too much regarded the things of time, and fed too greedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the temptations and pleaſures of this Life; not enough conſidering, that the diſeaſes and diſorders of the mind thus fed, muſt certainly at laſt bring death, even the <hi>death,</hi> tho' not <hi>diſſolution,</hi> of the ſoul. They might have been cloathed, if not with a perfect heart, yet with a certain degree of ſtrength; and been more and more advanced on their way to the regions of bliſs.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you, continue in your love to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of CHRIST: that, day after day, you may feed on the holy ſacrifice, and on that eternal fruit with which he nouriſhes the ſoul that <hi>hungers and thirſts after righteouſneſs.</hi> And, I cannot help, while I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſſing you in a more immediate manner, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that, not relying on your own wiſdom, and your own ſtrength, but in a full dependance and leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breaſt of the beloved JESUS, you all, patiently, with a holy ſoundneſs, proceed in <hi>the highway to the city of God;</hi> that you may be crowned at laſt with glory, honour, and immortality!</p>
                  <p>I find in me (at leaſt) one qualification of a goſpel miniſter; even that of a ſtrong and ardent love, which wiſheth well to all mankind: and in particular that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016777_0032_0F9E2EFC4C07A6A0"/>you who are preſent, may enjoy ſuch a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, as I have been at this time enforcing to your ſerious conſideration: may it ſpread through every claſs; may you all encreaſe in the ſtability of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, through this life; and may it carry you into the boundleſs joys of eternity, into that glorious city, not one of whoſe inhabitants, can ſay, "I am ſick."</p>

                     <hi>O! death, I will be thy plagues;</hi> and it hath made a deep impreſſion upon my mind. This declaration of the moſt high GOD, hath been amply verified in the experience of all, who have been quickened into a life of piety. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been <hi>the reſurrection and the life</hi> to all ſuch. Tho' <hi>death</hi> hath <hi>come upon all,</hi> we are not all included under death; ſo as to be left without the quickening vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying power, that is offered to raiſe the dead to life.</p>

I cannot think but it has been the experience of divers, within the audience of my voice, who know the certainty of this important truth, tho' others may reflect upon me, as being beſide myſelf; yet, if ſo, I may ſay with the apoſtle, <hi>it is unto God.</hi> But I would gladly ſpeak intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly to the ſoul that is on its way to the regions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; for if we are ſober, <hi>it is for your ſakes.</hi> I would aſk whether a ſecret ſomething hath not often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited your ſouls, an unſpeakable ſomething, often ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and immediately attended, that hath engaged you to ſend up heavenly and earneſt wiſhes, and raiſed in

The ſpiritually dead, have received it; and it hath been of his pure mercy, that he hath followed us from time to time; hath met us, as it were, in a narrow place, with inſtructions and reproofs, and ſecretly raiſed up in us the hidden life of his own divine wiſdom; he hath cauſed the animating and warming beams of the ſun of righteouſneſs to break forth.

We admire, with humble hearts and minds, the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tranſactions of that time, when ſweat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy JESUS! when, being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly! when he was betrayed, his ſacred head crowned with thorns! his face ſpit upon! he was moſt ignominiouſly treated, and<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xi. 7.</note> as <hi>a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb,</hi> he complained not!</p>
                  <p>We behold him, in his agonies on Calvary Mount, offering himſelf as a ſacrifice for the ſins of the whole world; that he might purify us, by the ſhedding of his precious blood! <hi>more precious than the blood of goats and lambs;</hi> or any other that was ſhed under the law. We believe in his amazing mercy, in offering himſelf there; when, loaden with the immenſe weight of the ſins of mankind, and the immediate ſenſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's preſence withdrawn, he was left to ſuffer alone; under this extreme preſſure crying out, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Sabacthani!</hi> was crucified! dead! and buried.</p>
                  <p>Here pauſe a little, I beſeech you!—contemplate the adorable theme! acknowledge, O man! that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded gratitude, which is ever due from thee: O! my ſoul, <hi>how much thou oweſt unto thy Lord!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know we have been ſtigmatized, as diſbelieving the truths of the Chriſtian religion.

                  <p>By virtue of that holy ſacrifice the remiſſion of ſins is gained; the awakening power of that ſentence which is due to ſin is felt in a ſtate of alienation from GOD; and as we believe, that if one <hi>died for all, then were all dead;</hi> ſo, we believe that he who was crucified, dead, and buried, likewiſe triumphed over the grave, and now <hi>ſitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> in a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to make interceſſion for man, in order that he might effectually purchaſe, and redeem to himſelf, a people to the praiſe of his name; and diffuſe, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his univerſal empire, a ſimilarity of opinion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ariſing from the experience of his univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love.</p>
                  <p>I am no Arian, far from it:—I believe in the clear emphatic teſtimonies laid down in holy writ, that CHRIST was more than a prophet. I repeat my belief that he ſuffered, died, aſcended, and is now come<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 28.</note>

                  <p>However this doctrine may reliſh with ſome, I am convinced he died for all, that all ſhould be ſaved; that, through him, we might be juſtified in the ſight of GOD; that we might put on <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with all his divine affections.</hi>

O! my friends, for ſuch I term you in the courſe of that univerſal love, which reacheth forth to the whole human race, which floweth from him who hath thus wrought for me, and <hi>brought life and immortality to light</hi> in my ſoul. Is any one of you deſirous of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>how much oweſt thou unto my Lord?</hi>—lay hold on his offers of redemption; live in his fear, in fellowſhip with him, <hi>in communion with the church of the firſt born, whoſe names are written in heaven:</hi> ſo will you far better know than any one on earth can ever inform you.</p>
                  <p>Examine the riſing ſuggeſtions of your own minds: you are not formed to live merely to yourſelves, merely within the contracted bounds of human privileges, in the narrow limits of mortality. Conſider the dignity of your nature; you are formed for the moſt glorious purpoſes.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Continue this muſing, this ſtate of meditation; prize the invitations of the ſpirit of CHRIST, mercifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to your immortal ſpirits; and let your minds mount upwards: remember your pious predeceſſors, now perhaps in glory; and their connections in the

                  <p>I would not give up, like Eſau,<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>my birth-right</hi> to ſeek <hi>a place of repentance with tears, and not to find it.</hi> O my ſoul! for ever acknowledge how much thou oweſt unto thy LORD! Let none ſay <q>he hath bleſſed me variouſly, and in ſome future time I will awake my ſoul to gratitude, I have now ſomething elſe to do;</q> like him who, when an apoſtle<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acts xxiv. 25.</note> reaſoned <hi>of righteouſneſs, temperance and judgment to come,</hi> replied <hi>go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like diſpoſition continues to prevail in too many: and this ſeems to be the language of their hearts, <q>Go thy way this time; call upon me when I have lived
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016777_0045_0F9E2F0D918820F0"/>to myſelf, and anſwered my own purpoſes a little longer; viſit me at ſome diſtant time hence.</q> Oh! rather <hi>to-day, while it is called to-day,—Harden not thy heart:</hi> do not defer thy repentance a moment; thou knoweſt not what <hi>a moment may produce.</hi> Conſider thy repeated tranſgreſſions; thy multiplied offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD: heap not up <hi>wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> ſwell not the dreadful account. Thou haſt hitherto trampled upon the goodneſs and the mercies of the GOD that made thee; venture not on preſumption and delay. Time is uncertain: Immortality is at hand.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you therefore my friends at the preſent time, that you will lay to heart the neceſſity of your making up this great account: delay it not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of life. Many are on the brink of the grave! reflect upon your extreme danger! think not of crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the account of your repentance into your laſt hour of life! You will find it extremely difficult to labour under the infirmities of the body, upon a death-bed, without a reaſonable ground of hope: all the offers of mercy having been long continued, and often repeated; yet by you as long ſlighted, and as often rejected; what then will diſcharge you from that dreadful account! I wiſh it may never be the caſe of any within the audience of my voice. Let us all immediately ponder, rightly conſider, and ſeriouſly improve this conſideration, <hi>How much oweſt thou unto my Lord?</hi>

                  <p>WITH unſpeakable reverence we preſume to approach thy preſence, O Father! who art in heaven and, with the voice of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and holy praiſe, to offer the tribute, that is due to Thee alone!</p>
                  <p>In a commemoration of thy mercy, thy infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! we are awfully bowed before thee, as at thy ſacred foot-ſtool; in the deepeſt reverence and thankfulneſs, for the ſtretching forth<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxiii. 4.</note>

                  <p>Though humbled in duſt, in the ſenſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, we are, nevertheleſs, encouraged to breathe unto Thee; to make mention of thy name, with joy of heart: we adore that goodneſs, which hath put it into our hearts to ſeek, ſerve and fear Thee; and to turn to the place where<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 13.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou haſt loved us before we loved Thee: thy love, O LORD! hath not been after the manner of men: Thou haſt called us, when we were enemies; and haſt reconciled tranſgreſſiors to thyſelf. Thou haſt followed us in the day of our revolting; and, when we were ſtraying in the wilderneſs, as a moſt gracious and tender ſhepherd Thou didſt lay thy hand on us, not only with judgment, but with mercy; and haſt

                  <p>Our deviations from thy holy path have not been puniſhed with inexorable juſtice; but thy conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us has been cloathed with unſpeakable compaſſion.

                  <p>Oh thou that art fairer than the ſons of men! grace flows from thy lips; Thou beholdeſt us when tempted, and ſpeaks to our ſtates with all the language of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Father of mercy! grant that innumerable multitudes may reſort to thy temple, that ſacred houſe, which thou haſt erected to thy honour and ſervice.

                  <head>The following SERMON was delivered at the Fryers Meeting in Briſtol, on Friday the 22d Day of May, <hi>1767.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I HAVE frequently thought, and the ſentiment hath been confirmed from my own obſervation and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that a great and excellent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no ſurer guide than tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſubſcribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, recorded in holy writ;</p>
                  <q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lviii. 11.</note> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the earth;</q>
                  <p>As ſuch a perſuaſion, from whatever ground it ariſes, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to purſue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a ſtep to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only ſure guide to true happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I ſcarce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exiſtence of the ſupreme Being; but believe on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour enlightened to ſee their duty, and aſſiſted to diſcharge it; do, in conſequence of theſe favours, contemplate, with ſatisfaction inexpreſſible, theſe attributes of the moſt high GOD, here mentioned by the Pſalmiſt: and could I be induced to think, that any part of mankind had ſwerved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of thoſe his attributes, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:016777_0054_0F9E2F16943C11A8"/>to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I ſay, could I believe their minds were deſtitute of this animating and enlivening proſpect of his power, omniſcience, and goodneſs, in his ſuperintendant care, and preſent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth, I ſhould deem ſuch but a very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if any, from the ſtate of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> upon whoſe altars the holy apoſtle diſcovered an inſcription,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xvii. 23.</note> 
                     <q>"To the unknown God."</q> Indeed a language that was ſpoken formerly hath been too much adopted by ſucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like thoſe men of Jeruſalem, who ſaid,<note n="†" place="bottom">Zeph. i. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> Many (ſeduced by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to eſtrange and withdraw themſelves from the arbitrator of the whole earth: they have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus reaſoned with themſelves, <q>He will do us no good, why therefore ſhould we ſeek him? he will do us no harm; why ſhould we fear him?</q> This, we may juſtly look upon, as the moſt unhappy ſeduction of mind! as it miſleads to the utmoſt diſtance, (without timely recovery) from that ſtate of obedience, in which we are only capable of happineſs, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</p>
                  <p>But we may juſtly conclude, that ſuch impiety paſſed not the attention of an all-ſeeing GOD, in as much as he replied, <q>I will puniſh thoſe men of Jeruſalem, who have ſaid, The Lord doeth us no good, why ſhould we ſeek him? he will not do us any harm, why ſhould we fear him?</q>
                  </p>

The certainty of his ſuperintendency, hath continued to be the happineſs of all the wiſe and good in all ages; and it is theſe, and only theſe, that diſcern wherein true happineſs conſiſts. Hence hath it become, and ſtill remains, an eſtabliſhed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</p>
                  <p>Under this head in particular, a Petition or Prayer that was put up to him who hath created the earth, and aſſigned a reward to the righteous, by <hi>Agur</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jaketh,</hi> hath appeared to my mind, as neceſſary at this day to be adopted by every individual, who is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of living to the beſt, wiſeſt, and happieſt purpoſe of life; without which they had better never have lived: And I cannot but recommend it moſt particularly to <hi>You,</hi> the riſing generation, whoſe minds I truſt are at times ſuſceptible of proper impreſſions, who are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſlaves to the vanity and luſts of the world: and indeed it ſeems like the language of one that is entering upon the ſtage of life:<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of this memorable requiſition hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to my mind, during the courſe of a long ſeries of obſervations of men, and times; with regard to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of God; as including indeed, all that is good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our ſafe conduct and ſupport through this life, to that completion of happineſs, propoſed as the final reward of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:016777_0056_0F9E2F18495F5E48"/>
But how will ſome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no truſt? who would gladly be poſſeſt of, and are much better pleaſed with, ſharing a crown of wicked proſperity in this world, than with the proſpect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a ſtate of endleſs futurity.</p>
                  <p>O that parents would timely and vigilantly exert themſelves to raiſe early impreſſions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the chriſtian doctrine, with all its glorious conſequences; firmly perſuading and convincing them, that they are under the immediate notice of that Being, who is ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably good, and gracious; and informing them, that he is cloathed with every awful, reverential attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; as being perfectly wiſe, powerful and good, yet ſtrictly juſt; that he is the maker of us all; and that he delights to be called upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellation of, <q>Our father, who art in heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, under the deep and reverent ſenſe of the certainty of his continual preſence and providence, let us be ever careful, ever earneſtly deſirous to conſtitute a part of his children and family, in this our probationary ſtate; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of ſpirits; we may aſſuredly hope to join the cherubim and ſeraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant church; and may, when our warfare ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, unite with the chorus of his triumphant hoſts, in the language and tribute of grateful adoration and praiſe.</p>
                  <p>And indeed without this bleſſed hope, we are of all creatures, the moſt miſerable! being daily ſurrounded with lamentation and woe! combating with ſecret or
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:016777_0057_0F9E2F1AD53CF748"/>obvious diſtreſſes! and encountring, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual ſucceſſion and variety of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! We might therefore truly ſay, if our hopes were only fixed upon the tranſitory and fleeting pleaſures of this life, we ſhould be of all the animal creation, the moſt miſerable! But we are aſſured, that nothing leſs than GOD himſelf, is the infinite and endleſs reward of all that diligently and conſtantly ſolicit him to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing purpoſe.—<hi>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die; remove far from me, vanity, and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or leſt I be poor, and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is as if the Prophet had ſaid, <q>Thou art my father, the author of my being; I made nothing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but am wholly and entirely the offspring of thy power and workmanſhip of thy hands: thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt therefore what is beſt and fitteſt for me; and what can I require elſe from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy preſervation out of the dangers of thoſe oppoſite extremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of ſafety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy approbation and favour in my walking therein!</q>

                  <p>I am fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth ſcarce ever cloſed, 'till death cloſes it; could they be induced to yield ſome of their precious moments to timely and ſerious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; would endeavour to withdraw themſelves from tranſitory things, at leaſt before their laſt moments of life; and in ſome meaſure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</p>

                  <p>IT is unto Thee, the author of all our mercies, thou moſt glorous and holy one! that we preſume to have recourſe; and with the deepeſt humility and reſignation of mind, to acknowledge thy preſent bleſſings, and the diffuſion of thy wiſdom and goodneſs, with gratitude, reverence and feeling ſubmiſſion! As Thou beſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt what is beſt for us, we beg that we may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally favoured with thy providential and fatherly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; and with that mercy which ſanctifies them, which renders them moſt highly inſtructive and uſeful to us: that hence we may enjoy inward peace in the time of outward trouble: we beſeech Thee thus to carry on and compleat our ſanctification and ſalvation, that in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, we may attain an<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. i. 12.</note>

                     <hi>all things may work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to thoſe</hi> that are afflicted: may they profitably liſten to the inſtructive voice of affliction; and thoſe who enjoy proſperity, alike improve, from the language of every mercy!</p>
                  <p>Eſtabliſh us, we pray Thee, upon the holy immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able foundation of thy ever-bleſſed and unchangeable truth; Thou that haſt been with us, and remembered us; and haſt opened our hearts for thy admiſſion, through the virtue of thy heavenly power and divine love. We pray Thee, in the name and ſpirit of thy dear ſon, to direct us in the ſeveral ſucceeding ſteps of our lives; to preſerve us in an humble dependance and holy truſt in thy power: and may we be continually favoured to make mention of thy name with joy and gladneſs of heart.</p>

                  <p>Ye heads of families; fathers, mothers, and guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that preſide over and ſuſtain the various relations in domeſtic life; ever carefully proſecute your own eternal happineſs, and the happineſs of all thoſe over whom you are placed in charge! exhorting them in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection, and encouraging them by worthy example, to<note n="‡" place="bottom">Col. iii, 2.</note>

Could parents and heads of families, from time to time, have appealed to the ſearcher of hearts for the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their intentions, and the rectitude of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in theſe moſt important concerns, then might they have ſaid with holy confidence,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke ii. 29, 30.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>What think ye parents? ye that live as it were in a ſtate of ſtupefaction; what think ye of the important moment, when in the ſight of GOD, angels, and men, inquiſition for blood ſhall be made; what think ye of the preparation of rendering that account with joy, at the dread tribunal of final judgment? in which an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the diſcharge of your ſeveral duties, in this reſpect, will moſt aſſuredly be made!—It is poſſible, and indeed I cannot but believe it conſiſtent with the goodneſs of the ſupreme being; that, where the natural parents have been negligent in their diſcharge of this important truſt, and have conducted their offspring into byways and crooked paths, forgetful of the way that leadeth to life eternal; the everlaſting father hath not been wholly unmindful of his children, thus abandoned to the wiles of the deſtroyer; but hath frequently reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth a kind hand to ſuch, and will continue to make up to them, who gratefully receive his kindneſs, and obey his voice, the deficiency of ſuch paſt parental care;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016777_0080_0F9E2F324F59CF40"/>even by the virtue of his living power in their hearts: in the mean time, the very criminal neglect of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents will, notwithſtanding this, draw down on them its own weight of condemnation:<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. v. 5.27.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed it muſt be confeſt, and I am thoroughly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all parents are not thus negligent: I cannot but remember the ineſtimable father I had in early life; and above all things, his almoſt <hi>unexampled care and tenderneſs over his infant offspring.</hi> I well remember the <hi>very</hi> powerful and moving eloquence of deſcending tears! when he collected his numerous family of little ones about him, and in the time of our extream tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and very early years, how often he hath wept over us, when he hath been recommending us to the throne of grace! though I cannot repeat the immediate lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he uttered, upon theſe occaſions, which were ſo extreamly intereſting to us all!</p>
                  <p>I wandered, as to myſelf indeed I may ſay, and ſtrayed from the <hi>garden incloſed,</hi> in many of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſteps of my life: and even now ſtand <hi>as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of mercy amongſt you!</hi> whilſt I thus afreſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and recite this amazing inſtance of a tender parent's anxious and unabated care, for our preſervation out of the evils that abound in the world; for our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſafe place within the incloſures, where<note n="†" place="bottom">Cant. i. 7.</note>

                  <p>At this door, my friends, unſpeakable damage hath entered, and widely ſpread amongſt us as a people; even through this neglect, the grand deceiver hath the more eaſily broke into this and the other family; the power of ſeduction hath taken place; and many young people may be ſaid to have laid violent hands on their own ſouls, and thoſe of others too, in their gradual ſtepping out of the <hi>garden incloſed.</hi>

                  <p>Is there even a ſervant lad, or a ſervant girl that hath continued neglected, and their minds left to wander at will?

                  <p>I know well, friends, that tho' my education was within the garden incloſed, yet I wandered far from it; and in my departing, laid myſelf open to the enemy of my ſoul. I kept the worſt of company; I ſubjected my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to almoſt every temptation; broke through the fence of the ſacred incloſure! trampled it under my feet! and when for a time I found the leaſt inclination to do good, evil was preſent with me! and I went on from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it to another! my wickedneſs ſo far increaſed with my diligence that at length, alas! I beheld the ſtrong wall broken down! the garden wall deſtroyed! the mound left defenceleſs! and no hopes left of returning peace to my afflicted ſoul!</p>
                  <p>O ye, who are the hopes of the next generation! the ſteps I have trod warrant me to expoſtulate with, and to warn you of the moſt dreadful danger of that devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to which youth is too prone, for want of due and timely reflection, ſuitable to its vaſt importance; and the extream difficulty of treading back, or extricating yourſelves from it, when the mind is once engaged and entered into the path of folly: believe me, now is your

                  <p>IT is not in the "Oldneſs of the Letter<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vii, 6.</note>," or in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling Formality, but from the animating warmth of Goſpel Love, that I ſalute this aſſembly in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all always. Amen.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 14.</note> It is the conſtant language of that evangelical ſpirit, from which ariſes this tribute of <q>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good-will to men<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke ii. 14.</note>,</q> and which I am thankful to feel not reſtrained within leſs compaſs than the Bulk of Mankind; but zealouſly and ardently pointing towards all ſuch as profeſs faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a hope of ſalvation by him.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething further couched in this affectionate ſalutation than the language of Love; the language of Wiſdom.—That Wiſdom which is "profitable to direct<note n="§" place="bottom">Eccl. x. 10.</note>," ſeems to me very evidently and very eminently diſplayed by the father of mercy and kindneſs in theſe expreſſions; which, by divine aſſiſtance, I would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a little to open, and to urge as words of ſome

                        <hi>I.</hi> The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>There is no language, or form of words, ſufficiently copious and expreſſive, though raiſed to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or height of deſcription, for repreſenting the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manifeſtations of heavenly kindneſs, goodneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and mercy, or for exhibiting the things which proceed from the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but it is allowable to ſpeak whereof we know, according to the Meaſure of knowledge, and to utter, according to the proportion of Strength given, what we now ſee in part, and what from experience we feel, of the merciful kindneſs of God; and which, as we faithfully follow his will, we ſhall hereafter more fully and comprehenſively behold.—This I apprehend is neceſſary for all, to whom a revelation of the Chriſtian Religion has been made by means of Holy Writ; and in an eſpecial manner, where He that is the diſcoverer of ſtates, has opened their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to believe the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, and the ſacred records of that miraculous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Grace that came by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But for my own part, I muſt freely acknowledge there was a time of my life, in which I would gladly have relieved myſelf from following the arduous paths of religion, by turning aſide into the paths of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm and Infidelity. My mind was ready to alledge, as ſome at this time of day may be, <q>How can we believe without Evidence! There is not a ſufficient Evidence of Truth to convince my judgment, or to induce me to believe.</q> I know this has been the allegation of ſome: But I have found there is no Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:016777_0093_0F9E2F4094CFF120"/>of evidence, but an unwillingneſs to admit the Force of that evidence, which would properly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the mind; and I have reaſon to apprehend this has been the caſe with others; for if there was a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſubmiſſion, and diſpoſition of mind to receive the Truth in the Love of it; to endeavour after it in its genuine ſimplicity; to look at it with a ſingle eye; and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, to ſuppreſs or baniſh all the <hi>"buts</hi> and <hi>ifs;</hi> we ſhould ſoon find the Evidence of the Chriſtian Religion to be lively and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible, and effectually to operate to make us wiſe and good; Wiſe with the Wiſdom that is to Salvation; and Good, with the Goodneſs that is of God, the Source of Goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt people "take counſel, and not of God," and ſuffer themſelves to be <q>covered with a covering and not of his Spirit<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxx 1.</note>,</q> they are unwilling to admit the force of thoſe truths which would <q>ſeparate the precious from the vile,</q> and <q>purify us according to his word.</q>—While this is the caſe that many deviate in point of Faith, they may complain of the want of Evidence, reſpecting the Certainty and Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; and complain with as much juſtice, as a man who wilfully hides himſelf in Darkneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his Incapacity of Seeing. For we have <hi>ſuch</hi> an evidence and underſtanding imparted by the Light and Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as doubtleſs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly diſplays the immediate Regard and Love of God, as recorded in Holy Writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illumination <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for all that would have valid claim to the Chriſtian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm aſſurance of, and a well-grounded belief in, thoſe glorious truths.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:016777_0094_0F9E2F4154DADA18"/>
We have ſometimes been accuſed of allegorizing away the important truths of the Chriſtian Religion as recorded in Holy Writ: It is far, very far, from our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or inclination! We want to <hi>inforce</hi> them, upon ourſelves, upon our brethren, with all that requiſite weight which commands their belief; calling to a belief of <hi>Heart,</hi> not a mere aſſent with the Tongue; but "a belief of Heart unto righteouſneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom, x. 10.</note>."</p>
                     <p>We have been diſtinguiſhed, and are not aſhamed of the diſtinction, for preaching, "Chriſt within;" but we never preach a Chriſt within, oppoſed to, or derogating from, a Chriſt <hi>without.</hi>—We fully believe not only in his glorious and gracious appearance amongſt the ſons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. x. 7.</note>;" but we alſo believe in his inward and ſpiritual appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, "the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. ix. 28.</note>;" in which we are ſupported by a cloud of witneſſes<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. xii. 1</note>, and by the doctrine of the holy Author of the Chriſtian Religion, inforcing his inward and ſpiritual manifeſtation (the manifeſtation of his Grace) in as clear and indubit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a manner, as from the teſtimonies delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his external appearance.</p>
                     <p>But the myſtery of ungodlineſs hath powerfully wrought with ſome who profeſs the Chriſtian name, in oppoſition to the force of thoſe teſtimonies with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his internal appearance, or manifeſtation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the hearts of mankind; and to render inadmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the doctrine of an inward and ſpiritual communion, the revelation of Light, Life, and Good to the ſouls of men, immediately imparted for our redemption and ſanctification.—This would lead people home from the flowery paths of Eaſe and Speculation, into the arduous one of Practice: It would transfer religion from the <hi>Head</hi> to the <hi>Heart;</hi> and, in its progreſs, would remove
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:016777_0095_0F9E2F4210707B18"/>every obctacle to the admiſſion of the doctrine of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual manifeſtation of the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But there hath been a lamentable defection from the Life and Spirit of true chriſtianity, wherein the Old Man, under all the pomp of Opinion, and aſſenting to indubitable Truths ſtill remains in full poſſeſſion of every inordinate love, and his goods are at eaſe. A mind diſguiſed with JACOB'S Voice, and ESAU'S Hands, ſound orthodox Principles, with a ſchiſmatic Heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the Formaliſt of all names and diſtinctions to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the old man being at eaſe with his goods, in a ſtate of ſelf-ſufficiency, either rejoicing under a Form, and the falſe ſhade of Opinion and regularity of conduct, or in the pomp of a ſpecious external appearance; wherein ſome continue poſſeſſed of an unhappy tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or eaſe of mind, and are endeavouring to build up a tabernacle quiet and ſafe, content with a Form, or depending upon a bare Belief in the doctrines of the chriſtian religion.—But there is a work whereby the <hi>Old</hi> Earth, and the <hi>Old</hi> Heavens are made to <hi>ſhake,</hi> and muſt be removed; which is of the adorable mercy and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he thus may reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;—</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Yet once more will I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo HEAVEN!<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xii. 27.</note>
                        </q>—Not only the Earth, not only againſt the inhabitants of the earth; but the Work of God is made conſpicuous in the Awakening of the ungodly, for their converſion from ſin and death, unto righteouſneſs and life.—"Yet once more will I ſhake HEAVEN!"—The glorious ſpecious Appearances of Truth, and Doctrines recorded and aſſented to, but yet not reduced to Experience; truths received and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Tongue, but the Heart revolting from their efficacious influence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="unknown:016777_0096_0F9E2F43223AB5E8"/>
                        <q>Yet once more will I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.</q> And this word, yet once <hi>more,</hi> ſignifies the REMOVING of thoſe things which are ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. And undoubtedly the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in its manifeſtation, procedure and effects, would ſhake <hi>every</hi> falſe reſt in which any deluded ſoul may have fixed its repoſe: He would ſhake every falſe reſt among thoſe under all names and diſtinctions to religion, who are truſting in <hi>Name</hi> and in <hi>Form,</hi> without the POWER, or an experience of its virtual effects upon the ſoul; theſe all appertain to one family:—and not only ſo, but he would ſhake every falſe reſt, yea and the FOUNDATION, of thoſe who are building upon a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and upon the Apoſtles <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe they are only building upon the <hi>Credibility</hi> of thoſe truths, yet cannot experimentally ſay, Through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus, "We acknowledge the Truth, according to Godlineſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Titus i. 1.</note>"</p>
                     <p>They that are of the World, come here alſo to a houſe fortified with <hi>Opinion,</hi> and are ſupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in having obtained a clear, full, and conciſe knowledge of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. But there is a power that will ſearch every <hi>falſe foundation,</hi> and overturn every ſuperficial dependence on Human Production, that is inconſiſtent with the uniform tendency of his ſacred Law, faſhioned upon the plan of unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, everlaſting Wiſdom.—It is not of Man, or by Man, but proceeds from the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby thoſe truths are brought home to the Hearts of mankind. The gracious effects of his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful working, are manifeſted to bring us home from a ſtate of falſe dependence, that we may humbly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally acknowledge, <q>In God is my Salvation, and my Glory, the Rock of my Strength:<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxii. 7.</note> in God alone is my Truſt.</q>

But "the Strong Man," armed with OPINION and BELIEF, has nevertheleſs been purſuing <hi>vitiated Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> which people have endeavoured to retain, and gloſſed over with a ſpecious lofty Profeſſion; fully aſſenting to the truths handed forth from the experience of others, but unreduced to practice in themſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>While the ſtrong man armed keeps the palace, the things that he poſſeſſeth are in peace;<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xi. 21.</note> until a ſtronger than he overcome, and caſt him out with all his goods.</q>—All thoſe things that are inconſiſtent with the holineſs and purity of the Divine Nature, which are pointed clearly out, and may be underſtood, by the declaration of our Lord concerning the Church, wherein <q>every plant that is not of my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's right hand planting, ſhall be rooted out.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xv. 13.</note>
                        </q>—What would then become of all thoſe things, which a miſtaken judgment calls "but <hi>little</hi> things?" Of the Pleaſures and Amuſements of the preſent age, invented by the ſons of diſſipation, who add wings to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are carried forward with rapidity through time, unprepared, to a final judgment? What a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of thoſe things which are <q>not of the Father, but of the World that lies in wickedneſs:<note n="§" place="bottom">1 John v. 19.</note>
                        </q> things of which I ſhall not now particularly ſpeak; but they are ſuch as have no life in the LIFE of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Man, but are ever Enemies to it, while the Affections are earthly, and confined to this world, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the partiality of deluded minds may think to ſeek a reſource, and attempt to obviate the ſeeming Rigours of the Goſpel, or find for themſelves an eaſier and more flexible way, by reſting upon a mere Belief of <hi>Syſtems</hi> (the goods belonging to the ſtrong man armed) wherein they endeavour to ſupport themſelves, and are high in Profeſſion, but weak reſpecting Practice? A ſpecies of Deviation from the Power of Truth proceeding from the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016777_0098_0F9E2F470CCC65D0"/>Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which would ſearch the ſecrets of every Heart! It would open to the view of the attentive mind their nature, and the ſituation they are in; what is of God, and what is not of God; what is pure, and what is impure: It would ever prove a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive teſt in all our actions, a more certain criterion in our conduct through life, than it is to be feared the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian profeſſors have attained, and which it is abſolutely impoſſible for the Strong Man armed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, with all his ſeeming Sanctity of the Fleſh, or ſtrenuous Support of Belief, and a multitude of external performances; notwithſtanding he may endeavour to plead for the "Law and the Commandment," and think thereby to attain the mark of Chriſt's followers, who "walk therein all the days of their lives."</p>
                     <p>But although they are thus lifted up in their minds, there is an Omniſcient and Omnipreſent BEING, who cannot be deceived or impoſed upon; and it is impoſſible to invalidate that invariable obligation to live under the Power of the Croſs of Chriſt, however they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find means, by profeſſing his Name without taking up a Croſs to the inordinate pleaſures and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of this world, or attribute to themſelves the merits of his death, without a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs, wherein alone we are made partakers of an everlaſting glory.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you by the moſt powerful motive of the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that every one may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cultivate in your minds a living Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that we may all experience the purity and ſanctity of its nature to operate in our hearts; and as members of one Family, tho' diſtinguiſhed by various Names, we may continue as Brethren and Fellow-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, in our paſſage through the wilderneſs of this world, to an endleſs Glory; that we may run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience

                     <p>I beſeech you by the Mercies of God, by every pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motive, in the language of Love, the Love of God, which lives in my heart, lay hold of the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by which alone our hearts and minds can experimentally acknowledge, that it is by the virtue of it we are cleanſed, purified, and redeemed from the pollutions and defilements of the world; and whereby we become faſhioned in the image of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Let us next conſider the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as offered for our REDEMPTION.—And I have no doubt of its being acknowledged, by all who have any underſtanding of the nature of True Chriſtianity, or care about their immortal ſouls, that the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt manifeſtly leads to the doctrine of <q>Repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards God;</q> to a redemption of the ſoul from death, hell, and the grave; conſequently, from that ſtate of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to ſinners, where the ungodly receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their diſobedience:—Neither have I any doubt of our being accompanied herein by a cloud of witneſſes, who <hi>feel</hi> the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and know the force and authority of thoſe teſtimonies concerning it.—And let us take along with us the knowledge which the apoſtles and primitive believers had of the Chriſtian Redemption and Doctrine in their times, that <q>the Grace of God, that brings ſalvation, hath appeared to ALL men; teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, and glorious appearance, of the Grace of God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who gave

This is the Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt;—a Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion effected by the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—It conſiſts not in the Strength, or Change of <hi>Opinions,</hi> or a formal Conception;—but as we experience a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual progreſſion from glory to glory, and from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſimilitude, or reſemblance, of the Divine Image to another, until we attain a victory here, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of happineſs in a future ſtate.</p>

                     <p>It is in the enjoyment of this divine and ardent Charity, that the celeſtial inhabitants in the realms of light receive the ſacred Emanations of LOVE, and enjoy the Favour of God in a participation of thoſe ineffable pleaſures which it yields to the glorified aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of ſaints in bliſs.—And, indeed, it ſeems to me to be the grand Source of all happineſs and duty, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in heaven, as well as perfection of wiſdom to the ſons of men, derived from thoſe gracious relative attributes of the Divinity wherein he is mercifully communicating the eſſential part of his own Nature, being in Himſelf, "altogether <hi>lovely,</hi>

And while the BODY is terreſtrial, the GLORY is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial, and the body will continue engaged in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of earthly things.—For every mind will attend to its Similitude.—And <hi>while</hi> the Body is terreſtrial, the Glory will <hi>remain</hi> terreſtrial, however it may aſſume a reſemblance to matters of a <hi>higher</hi> nature, and ſuperior importance.—Yet while the <hi>Glory</hi> is earthly, our <hi>Views</hi> earthly, and confined to the pleaſures and purſuits of <hi>this</hi> world, our <hi>Affections</hi> are earthly, and we are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of <hi>that</hi> LOVE, which is of a divine and <hi>heavenly</hi> nature.</p>

                  <p>THERE is a paſſage in ſacred Writ, which has been revived in my remembrance during the ſilence of this Meeting, and the train of reflections which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, has ſealed inſtruction to my mind, and furniſhed me with renewed cauſe of humiliation and gratitude; <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 37.</note> Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every perſon who ſeriouſly believes in the exiſtence of a God, in a future ſtate, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and puniſhments, cannot be indifferent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what may be his lot, when he ſhall be diſpoſſeſſed of this frail Tabernacle of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approaching to the Period of its diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he ſhall finally receive the irrevocable ſentence of <q>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxv. 41.</note> go ye curſed into the regions of irremediable miſery;" or<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. xxv. 34.</note> come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for the righteous, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and into thy maſter's reſt.</q> This concern has prompted many to enquire what is eſſentially neceſſary for them to believe and practiſe in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence, and furniſh
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016777_0117_0F9E2F60CFC63540"/>them with a well grounded hope of a glorious and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py immortality. Many of the honeſt and ſincere of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas of the requiſites to ſalvation, and of courſe have purſued as different meaſures to accompliſh that deſirable end. It is not my preſent buſineſs, to particularize any of thoſe various ſyſtems of Faith, which are adopted by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt mankind; it is not to controvert matters, in which ſincere men of the various denominations moſt ſurely believe; but rather to recommend them always to ſtand open to conviction, and a ſtrict attention to thoſe rules of conduct, which appear to them moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the will of Heaven. I ſhall therefore addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thoſe, in whatever religious ſociety they are found, whoſe honeſt inquiries have not yet been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſufficient conviction, or led them clearly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what are the terms on which their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whilſt this important queſtion is found, at leaſt in their hearts if not in their mouths <q>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not preſume arrogantly to dictate to any reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of ſo important a concern as that of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul; every Man ſhould exerciſe thoſe talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a cloſe and ſincere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the diſcovery of thoſe truths both prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and ſpeculative which have an immediate relation to the happineſs of a Being circumſtanced as he is. I ſhall ſimply propoſe thoſe things which from my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their Author, and worthy of Man's moſt ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is an indiſputable truth that we made not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <q>We are thine offspring, thou haſt made us and not we ourſelves,</q> ſays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the univerſe, the vehicles which
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016777_0118_0F9E2F61905DAE98"/>the ſoul informs, and the intellectual powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we poſſeſs, derived their being from the eternal fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is alſo clear to me that we were brought into exiſtence with the benevolent deſign of finally ſuſtaining the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in unſpeakable mercy promiſed, that after we have endured a ſeaſon of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth, a conflict with our paſſions excited by numerous cauſes, and a fight of afflictions, we ſhould finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed felicity in the unknown regions of eternity. But this deſirable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is generally called fate, the laws of neceſſity, or the arbitrary will and power of the Author of our exiſtence. God has conſtituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehending and practiſing thoſe duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him: he offers, but does not impoſe, happineſs on his creatures; he ſhows us the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Canaan, he gives us power to poſſeſs it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly ſet before us, but our election is not conſtrained to either; the ſovereign of the univerſe is no reſpecter of perſons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they ſtand in the ſame relation to the univerſal Father, Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of Mankind to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Joy of his Salvation. To this doctrine the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle bore an ample and explicit teſtimony: <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts x. 34, 35.</note> Of a truth, ſaid he, I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every nation thoſe who fear him and work righteouſneſs ſhall be accepted of him."—<note n="†" place="bottom">Romans viii. 13.</note>"If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if through the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016777_0119_0F9E2F626879CD18"/>ſpirit ye morify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</q> This is a propoſition that relates to every individual in the vaſt community of Mankind, however circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he reſides.</p>
                  <p>All this indeed may be acknowledged both by thoſe within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they ſhall do to be ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation; they want to be informed of the preciſe ideas that ſhould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though perhaps they readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the terms life and death imply future happineſs and miſery. I ſhall therefore attempt according to the ability I am endued with, to give you my thoughts on the important ſubject in queſtion at this time. To "live after the fleſh" is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and paſſions, beyond the bounds of reaſon, temperance and ſobriety, which as it frequently introduces numerous diſorders into the animal ſyſtem, and aggravates the infirmities to which theſe corruptible bodies are incident, ſo it affects the good of ſociety, and renders unfit for thoſe contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal ſpirits, beings whom God in his wiſdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>has made a little</hi> (and perhaps but a little) <hi>lower than the Angels,</hi> and who would crown them with a ſuperior glory, honour and happineſs than that which animal gratifications can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on their deluded votaries. Whilſt we are in the body we muſt expect to find thoſe appetites, affections and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which belong to our nature; but theſe are to be reſtricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and neceſſities, of which the divine principle which God has graciouſly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:016777_0120_0F9E2F630B715DF8"/>
This principle of intelligence although called by a variety of names in the different profeſſions amongſt Men, is the ſame in nature throughout all Mankind. It is the ſpirit in Man that giveth a right underſtanding; it is the light that more or leſs enlightens every Man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the Apoſtle preached to the Gentiles; it is the Grace that hath appeared to all Men, teaching them to deny ungodlineſs and the world's luſts, and to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world; and finally it is the ſupreme reaſon, the law of truth and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the teſt of virtue and vice, which God himſelf hath erected in the hearts of all Men; and happy are thoſe who hear and obey it in all things.</p>
                  <p>I would not be underſtood to mean that this principle of which I am ſpeaking is deſigned to inſtruct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or to give a clear inſight into thoſe numerous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative ſubjects, which have, not only unprofitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed mankind and diverted their attention from more ſubſtantial objects, but which have perplexed and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from generation to generation; but by the exerciſe of it we may apprehend thoſe truths that belong to us, and have an eſſential relation to the important end of our exiſtence; of which truths the Father of ſpirits has enabled us to judge; this is implyed by the queſtion which our Lord himſelf propoſed to a people miſled by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xii. 57.</note> yea and why judge ye not for yourſelves, what is right?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſocial, ariſing from our various connexions, natural and divine: The relation we ſtand in to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:016777_0121_0F9E2F5D8F6471E8"/>of our being is that of Children; filial fear, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and worſhip is therefore our indiſpenſible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures ſtand in to us, is that of brethren, children of the ſame univerſal Father, and formed for the ſame glorious and happy end; juſtice, charity and brotherly kindneſs are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our indiſpenſible obligations unto mankind. There are alſo various accidental relations, ſuch as father, governor, maſter, ſervant and numerous others, all which have their correſpondent duties. Thus far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the perſons whom I immediately addreſs at this time may concur with me in ſentiment, but they as well as I, are perhaps conſcious of having failed in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtances of diſcharging their religious duties to God and their ſocial duties to mankind. We have all ſinned and fallen ſhort of the glory of God! we have multiplied our tranſgreſſions without number! and our iniquities riſe before us as a thick cloud! which obſcures the brightneſs of that eternal Sun of righteouſneſs, which would otherwiſe illuminate our underſtandings with its marvellous light. Who, therefore, (ſays the illuminated penitent ſoul) ſhall deliver us from the body of this death? who ſhall take from us the weight of our ſins under which we groan inceſſantly? who ſhall ſave us from the wrath to come? "Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" The condition of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and redemption are very clearly expreſſed in the ſacred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeatedly aſſerted; he is repreſented to us in the adorable character of a God of mercy, long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and of unſpeakable kindneſs; as a Being ready to blot out our tranſgreſſions from the celeſtial regiſter, on our ſincere repentance, and to remember them no more.</p>

This important and intereſting doctrine was typified under the Law, ſpoken of by the Prophets, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſerted by the Son of God, who is our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future Glory. In his character was diſplayed to Mankind, in the moſt eminent and ſtriking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodneſs of God toward the whole rational creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who like ſheep have gone aſtray from the univerſal ſhepherd and biſhop of Souls, who have widely wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the paths of purity and holineſs, which are ways of pleaſantneſs and peace; that path of the juſt Man, which (like the luminous orb as it ariſes in our hemiſphere) ſhines with increaſing refulgency, ſplendor and brightneſs, till it arrives at the meridian altitude of a gloriouſly perfect day! This path leads all who ſteadily purſue its direction, by degrees of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through the wilderneſs of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our Creation, to that compleat frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bliſs that is figuratively repreſented to us by <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 10.</note> a City that hath foundations, whoſe builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker God is;" a City "<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah lx. 18.</note> whoſe Walls are ſalvation, and whoſe Gates are eternal praiſe;</q> a City that hath no need of the elementary light of Sun, Moon and Stars, "<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. xxi. 23.</note> for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of" a City where God reigns triumphantly amongſt his ſaints, and is to them an inexhauſtible fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pilgrim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the ſalvation of his Soul.</p>
                  <p>The important meſſage which Chriſt had in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compaſſionated his Creatures, encompaſſed with the diſtreſſes which their ſins had
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016777_0123_0F9E2F65D1A5D668"/>brought upon them, that he willed not their everlaſting ſeparation from him the ſource of happineſs, that he was willing they ſhould be reconciled to him; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called upon them to <hi>Repent and be converted that their ſins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his reſt.</hi> This was the intereſting doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are thoſe who hear and obey it. <q>Repent and be converted that your ſins may be forgiven you.</q> It is not the aſſent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Goſpel; but a ſurrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the New Jeruſalem, the City of God.</p>
                  <p>If we take an impartial ſurvey of our paſt lives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is ſcarcely a Soul preſent but muſt feel ſome degree of remorſe, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of repentance for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to ſo gracious a Father, who has encompaſſed us with bleſſings, and preſerved us by his providence from the earlieſt period of our lives to the preſent hour; we muſt (I ſay again) upon ſerious retroſpection, poſſeſs ſome degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; but unhappily for us the impreſſions that are made on our minds by ſuch a review of our actions, are frequently eraſed by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are ſuffered to have upon us, and like the early dew they ſoon paſs away. Thoſe who have been cleanſed in ſome degree by the water of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, are often defiled again by the repetition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had determined to renounce and forſake, they are again caught in the ſnare of their luſts, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by thoſe objects which have a tendency to alienate
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:016777_0124_0F9E2F66B12832B0"/>their affections from the ſupreme good. Thus when the force of conviction again ſounds the awakening alarm, they are ready to query with ſurpriſe and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety <q>what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our inconſtancy to our virtuous reſolutions has reduced us? ſhall we deſpair of that divine mercy we have ſo often abuſed, of that goodneſs we have ſo long trifled with?</q> God forbid! rather proſtrate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the continued mercy of the univerſal parent, as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but duſt; beſeech him therefore to ſend forth help from his holy ſanctuary, that you may be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to renew and keep your Covenants with him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from the Commiſſion of evil, and wait on him in the ſilence of all fleſh; ſince it hath pleaſed him again to enlighten your darkneſs, and thus to give you to ſee yourſelves as you are ſeen of him; he may alſo be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enflame your hearts with that celeſtial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual filth and droſs, that prevents the aſcent of the Soul godward, and renders it an unfit habitation for his holineſs to dwell in. As our backſlidings have frequently corrected us and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our minds with anxiety, let our future conduct directed by his Grace, atone for what is paſſed, and by a converſation ordered aright, let us glorify our Father who is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>I feel at this ſeaſon the influence (in degree) of that celeſtial Charity which breathes through Immanuel to the whole creation of God, wiſhing ſalvation to every Soul that inhabits the earth; in which I entreat you (as a being ſubject to the ſame infirmities which you ſometimes unavailably deplore) "repent and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;" repentance you have frequently experienced, but too little I fear of that eſſential converſion which
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:016777_0125_0F9E2F6819B34110"/>the Goſpel of Jeſus propoſes, 'tis highly probable that ſome perſons preſent have ſeen the neceſſity of that reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of heart and reformation of manners intended by converſion, but urged by the powerful prevalency of their luſts, would if poſſible find ſome other remedy for a wounded conſcience, than that which the ſimplicity of the Goſpel requires, as a neceſſary prelude to the favour of God; like the young Man in the Goſpel, they have been animated with a deſire to be enrolled amongſt the diſciples of Jeſus, who are called Heirs of God and Co-heirs with Chriſt of that inheritance which is incorruptible and full of Glory; they have aſked counſel of the wonderful counſellor, addreſſing him with this important queſtion, <q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark x. 17.</note> what good thing ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</q> yet when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable terms of ſalvation have been propoſed, when they have been told that they muſt part with all their Idols, they have gone away ſorrowful, the terms have appeared too hard for them to comply with; and like Naaman who wanted to be cured of his Leproſy, yet was ſtaggered at the ſimplicity of the Prophet's direction, are crying out <q>

                  <p>Man is deſirous to poſſeſs the crown of eternal life, but not to bear the Croſs; he would indeed reign with Chriſt, but not ſuffer with him; he would accompany him to the mount of transfiguration, but not to Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha; he would be his attendant at his Glorification, but not in the awful ſcene of his Humiliation.</p>

Divers have wandered as from mountain to moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and from hill to hill, ſeeking for the living in the Sepulchres of the Dead, they have ſometimes adopted one creed, and ſometimes another, practiſed external ordinances, and complied with empty forms, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves frequently to guides as blind and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent as themſelves with this awful inquiry <q>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" "I ſay again, repent and be converted,</q> for this is the only way to find ſalvation to your Souls; no external cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, no verbal confeſſions, nor any change of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions merely, can accompliſh this repentance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and afford you the conſequent reward of a glorious immortality, this important work of ſalvation muſt be effected in man, by the powerful operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which is a conſuming fire to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part in Man, to the corrupt and perverſe will, which would not that Chriſt ſhould reign in his Kingdom, and that God ſhould be all in all. It is the Baptiſm of fire (of which John's was but a type) which diſcriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pure from the impure, gathers the Wheat into the Garner but conſumes the chaff with unquenchable burnings.</p>
                  <p>In the world there are many voices which correſpond not with the voice of Chriſt, the only Shepherd of Souls (whom we ought to hear and obey in all things) but are the voices of thoſe who preach for hire and divine for Money; who look for their gain from their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quarters; and as to ſuch conſcientious Men who cannot put into their mouths, they are ready to make war againſt them; theſe have found it for their worldly intereſt to lead the deluded people from, rather than to Chriſt, that glorious High Prieſt of the Chriſtian Religion; they have attempted to render that myſterious which the Holy Ghoſt has left clear, and to perplex the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016777_0127_0F9E2F684C812048"/>of mankind with vain metaphyſical ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without making them either wiſer or better. This claſs of Men whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe Glory is their ſhame, have indeed proved phyſicians of no real value; inſtead of laying the Axe to the root of the corrupt Tree, they have only attempted to lop off ſome of its branches; they have preſcribed emollients, where the moſt ſearching operations were expedient; and healing the wound of the daughter of Zion deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have lulled, multitudes into a fatal ſecurity, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with hopes which it is to be feared will finally end in diſappointment. There are others who aſſume the Office of Miniſters, (the purity of whoſe intentions my Charity will not permit me to doubt,) who like a Man that attempts to anſwer a queſtion before he has fully heard it, have too precipitately embarked in the important work of inſtructing Souls relative to the affairs of ſalvation; theſe are like Ephraim <q>

May the Lord Almighty in his mercy gather theſe who are wandering as ſheep without a Shepherd, and lead them into the ſacred incloſure of his fold, into eternal ſafety.</p>

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:016777_0129_0F9E2F69D8C118E0"/>cravings of an immortal ſpirit with the ſpiritleſs huſks and ſhells of an empty profeſſion of Religion! look towards your Father from whom you have revolted; remember that in his Houſe there is bread enough and to ſpare; there your Souls may be repleniſhed with ever enduring ſubſtance: Return, O Houſe of Iſrael! and ſeek the face of your everlaſting friend and Father! he has in unſpeakable kindneſs declared that he will be found of thoſe who ſeek him in ſincerity of heart, and that as many as knock at the Gate of mercy for an entrance, ſhall be admitted to his preſence, and receive the remiſſion of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>The humble addreſs which the Prodigal made to his Father (in that excellent parable given us by Chriſt) the Father's return to it, and the manner of his reception into favour, is exceedingly expreſſive of the becoming penitence of the one and the mercy of the other <q>

My Soul ſalutes you in the endeared affection of the Goſpel of peace, and wiſhes your eſtabliſhment in Righteouſneſs, that you may abide in holy patience the fiery trial of your faith through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the days of your Pilgrimage on earth, and become as fixed pillars in the celeſtial building, the houſe of God, that ſhall go no more out.</p>
                  <p>If ye abide in the word of faith by which ye have been taught, the malice of Men nor Devils, nor all the united powers of darkneſs, ſhall be able to pluck you out of the hand of him, who is your Judge, your King, your Protector, your Father and your everlaſting Friend. When the earth ſhall be wrapped together as a ſcroll, and the Sun and Moon be darkned, when every Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens ſinks into everlaſting obſcurity, and the Elements of this world ſhall melt with fervent heat, you will poſſeſs an habitation within the ſuperior regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a new Heaven and a new Earth, where the Lord your Righteouſneſs dwells.</p>
                  <p>Many of the pretended wiſe, learned and prudent who have ſought to climb up ſome other way, rather than to enter by Chriſt, who is the door (by the conditions which he has propoſed) into the ſheepfold, may pity you as fools, or ridicule you as enthuſiaſts, count your lives madneſs, and your end to be without honour, but they will one day be aſtoniſhed at the ſtrangeneſs of

In the World you are to expect tribulations of various kinds; pain, ſickneſs, temptations and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments invade the breaſt of the moſt righteous and temperate amongſt Men; the cup of mixture (more or leſs impregnated with the wormwood and the gall) is the lot of all Men, deſigned doubtleſs to effect a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe, by him who afflicts not willingly, nor without a righteous and benevolent cauſe, the Children of Men; as the Heavens are higher than the Earth ſo are the ways of Almighty Wiſdom higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts! We ſee a little, and but a very little of the amazing univerſal plan of his Government over rational and immortal ſpirits. It lies beyond the reach of the moſt exalted human faculties to comprehend his wiſdom, throughout the righteous adminiſtration of his Providence, which is unſearchable! It is our duty as frail dependent beings to meet every diſpenſation of his Providence with that reſignation of ſpirit, which inceſſantly breathes the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language of "not my will O Lord! but thine, be done in all things!" Under the evils which we feel and which our prudence could not prevent, let us rather implore divine aid to endure them with patience, than to pray that they may be removed from us; leſt like ignorant Children we ſhould ſeek to avoid that portion from our Heavenly Father's Hand, which he graciouſly deſigned to remove or prevent a greater evil. This is not the place of your reſt, but a ſtate of probation, a painful pilgrimage, a Land of pits and ſnares, through which lies a narrow Path to the regions of eternal Peace.</p>

The Soul by reaſon of its connexion with the body, incloſed within the walls of fleſh, cannot extend its views and employ its faculties on divine objects, without frequent interruption; but when the days of its captivity are accompliſhed, it will be capable of a more glorious expanſion in the Kingdom of Immortality, and (if bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſcription of Holineſs) will be put in poſſeſſion or that Joy which is unſpeakable and full of Glory. Therefore in all thoſe calamities to which we are ſubject in the houſe of our Pilgrimage, we have a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to flee to, where ſafety is alone to be found; though indeed we muſt feel in degree as Men, yet we may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the patience, reſignation and holy fortitude of Chriſtians, who are looking for a better Country, a more excellent Inheritance in that City whoſe Inhabitant cannot ſay "I am Sick."</p>
                  <p>Be ye therefore ſtedfaſt, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour ſhall not be in vain. Be ye in your ſeveral ſtations in the Church, and in the world, as way-marks to the honeſt inquirers who are aſking their way to Zion, and from a true ſenſe of their condition are crying out "what ſhall we do to be ſaved?" ſhew forth by your example of Charity, Sobriety, Temperance and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, that you are redeemed from the ſpirit of the world, that lies in wickedneſs; be not captivated by its trifling amuſements, nor inſnared by its lying vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but retain the fear of the Lord which will keep the heart clean, and prove a ſource of ſureſt conſolation when all things elſe will be unavailing! let the purity of your lives demonſtrate that you are attentive to things more excellent, things that are permanent and eternal, eſſentially relating to the ſalvation of the Soul! by this means you will become the conſecrated Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and be a means of leading others in the way of Righteouſneſs!</p>

Far, very far, be it from me to think highly of myſelf, to exalt the Officer, the Miniſter. I would not that you ſhould hold any Man's perſon in high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I am deeply ſenſible that to me belongs <q>bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confuſion of face,</q> but I magnify mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the power of him who has ſeen meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in your view the adorable goodneſs and condeſcenſion of the great Author of all mercies, in that he has cauſed the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to be renewedly ſounded in your borders; hear its important meſſage with ſuitable attention; let it rouſe and prepare all the ranks in the Armies of our Iſrael, to engage in the glorious Cauſe of our God.

If after your attentive care has been employed, for their preſervation; if after by the forceable voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holineſs in the fear of God, they <hi>will</hi> go, they <hi>will</hi> turn aſide into the byways and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paths of ſin and iniquity, they muſt ſtand by their own choice; you have redeemed your Souls, and will be found in your lots at the end of time, a ponderous Crown awaits you, you will cloſe your eyes, and open them to the boundleſs fruition of unmixt Joy, in a happy eternity.</p>

We do ſometimes with ſorrow obſerve, the unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed labours of a Parent's love, beſtowed without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect; 'tis <hi>mournful</hi> to ſee Children pierce with bitterneſs and anxiety the breaſt that has been their ſupport in their infantile years; to fill that eye with ſorrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal fondneſs! 'tis a cruel thing for a Child to mingle Gall and Wormwood, in the cup of a Parent deſcending to the Grave; let us be aſſured that their own portion of Gall and Wormwood will be doubly increaſed thereby, in the ſolemn hour of juſt Retribution! But, Oh belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Youth! I earneſtly deſire that you may never thus widely deviate from the paths of rectitude; 'tis on you the hope of the preſent age muſt ſhortly devolve; may you wiſely chooſe an early ſubmiſſion to the holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Croſs of Chriſt, that you may come up as an Army for God. Conſider the uncertainty of your ſtay here; conſider the important buſineſs of Life; and let the love of every unprofitable delight, be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the arduous purſuit of Glory, Honour, Immortality and Eternal Life. We are daily inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the powerful eloquent language of Mortality; Death invades all ranks, ſnatches thoſe of all ages from the buſy ſtage of life, ſhe that was yeſterday ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with nuptial Joys, muſt to-morrow be confined within the cold incloſure of the ſilent Grave. <q>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet;</q> let the young, the joyous; thoſe that are in the bloom of life, leave every thing that tends to retard their progreſs towards the City of the Saints ſolemnity; let them relinquiſh their moſt exalted ſatisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the Joys of God's Salvation; which are unutterably more deſirable, than all the ſin-pleaſing gratifications that this World can beſtow.</p>
