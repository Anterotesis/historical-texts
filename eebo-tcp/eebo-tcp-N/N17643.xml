            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She was a moſt excellent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whom he was a complaiſant, but careleſs huſband.

Yet this lady, while ſhe uſed the beſt oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was free from all narrow, mean, and ſelfiſh views.

               <p>In ſuch company mr. Grandiſon could not fail of paſſing his time very agreeably. He was particularly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the confidence of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022852_0033_0FBA9D571639BE38"/>
marchioneſs, who opened her heart to him on every material occurrence that preſented itſelf. Her lord, who is diſtinguiſhed by his politeneſs, was never better pleaſed than when he found them together: and frequently, though they were not engaged in lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the lovely Clementina claimed a right to be preſent with her mother.</p>
               <p>Things were in this ſituation, when the young count of Belvedere, who had received his education in Spain, returned to Parma; and paying a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to this noble family, ſaw and loved Clementina. As the count was not only a man of ſenſe, but had a handſome perſon, and a great fortune; they all thought that his alliance was very deſirable. The marquis highly approved of it, and the marchioneſs had ſeveral converſations with mr. Grandiſon on this ſubject. She thought it neceſſary to know his thoughts on the occaſion, as the barone, unknown to him, had frequently declared, that he thought there was no other way of rewarding his merit, than by giving him a relation to the family. In the mean time, mr. Grandiſon, thus

diſtinguiſhed by all the perſons of this noble houſe, and a daily witneſs of the innumerable excellencies of the lovely Clementina, found it impoſſible not to ſuffer his vanity to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times awakened, and to ſtifle his wiſhes of obtaining ſuch a prize. But he endeavoured to check the pleaſing idea, the moment he found it play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his heart; for he would have thought any attempt to recommend himſelf to the young lady's favour, though only by his looks and aſſiduities, a breach of that generous truſt and confidence which they all repoſed in him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grandiſon now formed the reſolution of retiring from Italy, and viſiting ſome of the German courts.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they had not the leaſt reaſon to be diſpleaſed with their converſation.</p>
               <p>The time of mr. Grandiſon's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture now drawing near, and the young lady repeatedly refuſing the count of Belvedere, the barone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to his friend, declared in his favour. His relations objected diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties with reſpect to his religion and his country; on which he deſired they would permit his talking to him on thoſe ſubjects, and diſcourſing with his ſiſter on her motives for refuſing the count of Belvedere; but this they would not allow. The Marchioneſs herſelf undertook to talk to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to demand of her, her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022852_0036_0FBA9D5D203FBCC0"/>
for diſliking all the propoſals that had been made her; but on her cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lovely Clementina, nothing was to be had from her but tears. A ſilence, that had not the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fullenneſs, had for ſome days, ſhown, that a deep melancholy had begun to take poſſeſſion of her mind; and yet ſhe appeared extremely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at their attributing it to love. However, her mother informed mr. Grandiſon, that ſhe could not help ſuſpecting, that, unknown to herſelf, ſhe was under the dominion of that paſſion, from her never appearing chearful, but when taking leſſons for learning a language that was never likely to be of the leaſt ſervice to her. Her melancholy ſtill encreaſing, he was deſired to talk with her. He did ſo, and it was obſerved, that ſhe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally aſſumed a chearful air, while he was preſent; and though ſhe ſaid little, appeared pleaſed with every thing he ſaid to her; but the moment he left her, ſhe ſtudied to find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of being alone. Her parents, who were in the deepeſt affliction, conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phyſicians, who all declared, that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022852_0037_0FBA9D5E9C8B3488"/>
ſhe was in love. She was taxed with it, and the utmoſt indulgence promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, with reſpect to the object of her affection, that ſhe could wiſh; but ſtill ſhe could not bear the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with patience.</p>
               <p>On the evening before the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for mr. Grandiſon's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this noble family made a ſplendid entertainment in honour of a gueſt, who had laid them under ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary obligations. For they had the more readily brought themſelves to approve of his leaving them, from their deſire to know how it would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Clementina. That lady appeared at table, and during the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſupported her part of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with extraordinary vivacity; and yet there appeared nothing in her looks or behaviour, that ſeemed the leaſt affected. When they thanked him for the pleaſure he gave the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſhe joined her acknowledgments; and when they expreſſed their wiſhes to ſee him again before he returned to England, ſhe did the ſame. Mr. Grandiſon's heart was dilated, and he was overjoyed at ſeeing ſuch a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

               <p>As the barone was not able to be with them, his friend went to take his leave of him, when, throwing his arms about him, he cried, O my Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! will you go?—Bleſſings at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you! But what will become of a brother and ſiſter, when they have loſt you? She muſt, ſhe ſhall be yours. Why will you leave us? Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon was ſurpriſed; for he had never before been ſo particular, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it could not be, for there were a thouſand obſtacles.—All of which, returned the barone, that depend on us, I don't doubt I ſhall overcome. They then ſettled a method of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on their correſpondence, and parted.</p>

The next morning mr. Grandiſon ſet out for Inſpruck, but on his arrival at that city, was deeply afflicted at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a letter, by which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that Clementina's chearful and lively behaviour had laſted no longer than the next day, and that her malady had returned with double force. She ſhut herſelf up in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without ſeeming to know that her woman was in it, or making any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the queſtions ſhe aſked her; but ſetting her chair with its back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her over againſt a cloſet, after a deep ſilence, leaned forward, and in a low voice, ſeemed talking to a perſon in the cloſet, crying, you ſay he is actually gone? Gone for ever? No, not for ever! Who, madam? ſaid the woman. To whom, pray, do you direct your diſcourſe?—We were all doubtleſs obliged to him, reſumed ſhe; ſo bravely to reſcue my brother, and to purſue the bravoes, and, as my brother ſays, to put him in his own chaiſe, and walk on foot by its ſide.—Why, as you ſay, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins might have murdered him, or the horſes might have trampled him

under their feet. Her women then ſtepped into the cloſet, and in order to turn the courſe of her ideas, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door, and left it open, to try if that would divert her attention from the place; but ſhe ſtill talked calmly, as if to ſome body in it, then burſting into a faint laugh, ſhe cried, in love I that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Every thing that medicine could do, was now tried. But her confeſſor, though an honeſt and worthy man, had filled her mind with fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.

               <p>In the city of Florence is a family of diſtinguiſhed rank and honour, the ladies of which have a female friend who lives with them, named Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who in the early part of life, was defrauded of her fortune by an uncle. She is an Engliſh proteſtant, and is greatly eſteemed for her genius, and the goodneſs of her heart. Theſe ladies with this their companion, were one day viſiting at marcheſe della Porretta's, when the diſtreſſed mother told them the mournful tale; and they thinking nothing that could be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by human prudence impoſſible to mrs. Beaumont, deſired that the young lady might be entruſted to her care at their houſe in Florence. To this they immediately agreed, and they took her with them. Mrs. Beaumont ſoon engaged the unhappy Clementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's affections, and by her very artful management, found means to prevail on her to reveal the cauſe of her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and that it aroſe from her

Her hopes that his abſence would reſtore her tranquillity, had made her behave with ſuch ſteadineſs at his departure; but ſhe was not able to maintain ſo great a part; yet ſhe profeſſed, that ſhe would never marry one who by his religion was an enemy to the faith, in which ſhe had never wavered; and which, ſhe obſerved, ſhe would never change, were an earthly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Upon this, mrs.

He inſtantly returned to Bologna, where, on his arrival, he was received with all the marks of friendſhip and eſteem by the marquis and the biſhop. The barone, who ſtill kept his chamber, embracing him, ſaid, now is the affair I have ſo long had in view, determined. O chevalier, you'll be a happy man. Clementina will be yours, and you will be Clementina's. Now do I indeed embrace my brother—But I won't detain you; haſte to the happy girl, who is with her mother; and both are ready to welcome you. Mr. Grandiſon was then conducted into the marchioneſs's drawing room, where he found that lady richly dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the lovely Clementina alſo elegantly dreſſed, and ſtanding by her chair; while her natural modeſty, heightened by a glowing conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſeemed to ariſe from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, gave her advantages ſuperior to her richeſt jewels. The marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs behaved to him with great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and reſpect, apologized for her daughter's ſilence and confuſion; and on her returning, congratulated him on the happineſs intended him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

Mr. Grandiſon applauded her goodneſs, and ſhe added, that ſhe did not doubt of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He therefore aſſured the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs, that not having preſumed to encourage hopes of the happineſs that now ſeemed to await him, he could hardly yet flatter himſelf that he ſhould enjoy ſuch felicity. She anſwered, that he deſerved it all. He knew the value they had for him. Clementina's regard was founded on virtue: and ſhe did not doubt, but all that depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him would, as well from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022852_0046_0FBA9D705BF983A8"/>
as gratitude, be complied with. The marquis, who entered ſoon after, behaved with the ſame indulgence, letting him know, that his ſon the biſhop, would diſcourſe with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms. A great fortune, beſides a noble eſtate bequeathed her by her two grand-fathers, was propoſed, and his father was to be invited over to grace their nuptials.</p>
               <p>The biſhop at laſt made the dreaded propoſals, with which, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He was to make a formal renunciation of his religion, and to ſettle in Italy, and only be allowed once in two or three years to go to England, if he pleaſed, for two or three months; and, if their daughter ſhould deſire it, ſhe might, once in her life, be carried thither on a viſit of curioſity, and ſtay there the time they ſhould limit. The biſhop, who was amazed at his ſcruples, in va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> endeavoured to convince him of what he called his errors; for he could not change his religion without convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He even reproached him with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, ingratitude, and cruelty. The
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022852_0047_0FBA9D7266811228"/>
general, who was now at Bologna, raved, threatened, and treated him with contempt, while the marquis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider him as unworthy of the honour deſigned him. In what diſtreſs was mr. Grandiſon involved, in being thus obliged to deny himſelf the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſh of his heart, and to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the warm expectations of thoſe who had a ſincere value for him! But when his dear Jeronymo intreated his compliance—when the tender mother intreated him to have pity on her heart, and her poor child's head—and when the gentle, the lovely Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina urged him for his ſoul's ſake, to embrace the doctrines of her holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the church, how was his mind torn by the contending paſſions, which tortured his breaſt? But he was fully ſatisfied with his own faith, and had inſuperable objections to that which they deſired him to embrace; and, if he complied, his conſcience and his country were to be the ſacrifice. Yet he ſtudied for a compromiſe. Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina was very dear to him, and he then beheld graces in her, which he had hitherto ſtruggled to behold with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022852_0048_0FBA9D7396DF2DC8"/>
He propoſed to live one year in Italy, and one in England by turns, if their dear Clementina would conſent to live with him there; if not, he propoſed to paſs only three months in every year in his native country. He offered to leave her entirely at her liberty in the article of religion; and, in caſe of children by the marriage, the daughters to be educated by her, and the ſons by him; a condition, to which the pope himſelf, it was preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, would not refuſe his ſanction. To this, the unhappy Clementina would have conſented, and earneſtly endeavoured to procure the conſent of her friends. But no arguments could prevail on them to allow their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to marry a proteſtant. This deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was followed by the moſt diſtreſsful ſcenes; the mother, indeed, ſeemed in a manner neutral; and the barone remained ſtill firm in mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon's intereſt; but the marquis, the general, the biſhop, and the whole Urbino branch of the family, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable. The general treated him even with an inſolent arrogance; and imagining that mr. Grandiſon had uſed

ſome art to engage his ſiſter's affections, pretended to have a right to call him to account for it. But notwithſtanding mr. Grandiſon's being deeply diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he anſwered the general's paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſpeeches with ſpirit; but let him know, that nothing ſhould make him attempt the life of the brother of his friend. The rigour of their behaviour was now extended even to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Clementina: and mr. Grandiſon in vain recommended their treating her with indulgence. He was deſired to depart from Bologna; and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina was not permitted to ſee him, though ſhe begged on her knees to have a parting interview. At hearing of his being gone, her grief moved every one to pity, and this ſubſided into fits, the deepeſt melancholy and ſilence.</p>

With this gentleman, he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquainted: and having now ſpent two days with him in the city, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to a little lone houſe in the Cambreſis, which that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man uſed to term his dormitory. Mr. Grandiſon had only one ſervant with him, who lay in a little room over the ſtable, with a man ſervant of mr. Danby's, there being conveniencies in the houſe only for mr. Danby, a friend and two women ſervants. About mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>night, mr. Grandiſon was alarmed by hearing a noiſe at the window of mr. Danby's room, when, inſtantly ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on his cloaths, and drawing his ſword, he ran thither, juſt as a villain with a large knife in his hand, had ſeized mr. Danby's throat, who till then was ſound aſleep. The ſkin of his neck, and one of his hands, which he had lifted up to defend himſelf, were ſlightly wounded, when Mr. Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon run the ruffian into the ſhoulder

By that time, a ſecond fellow, who had got up to the window, was half in, when, calling to a third below, to haſte up after him, mr. Grandiſon ran to the ſecond fellow, who then fired a piſtol, but happily miſſed him; and feeling the point of the ſword in his arm, threw himſelf, with a little of mr.

Mr. Danby had a brother of very abandoned principles, to whom he had frequently given large ſums, which he had ſquandered away in his debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

During the time that mr. Grandiſon was ſacrificing the deareſt wiſhes of his heart to his religion, and his love of his country, and was expoſed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that called forth all his courage, his father was indulging his love of pleaſure. He placed over his daughters as governeſs, the widow of one of his companions, named Oldham, whoſe fortune had not held out as ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's had done. This lady had fine qualities, was well deſcended, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and an economiſt: But ſhe ſoon became ſo unhappily ſenſible of ſir Thomas's favours and preſents, that in a little more than a twelve-month, ſhe was obliged to come up to town, where ſhe lay in. The eldeſt of the young ladies being at that time about nineteen, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But ſir Thomas having another ſeat in Eſſex, carried mrs. Oldham thither; and for ſome time every body apprehended that they were married. Sir Thomas was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022852_0054_0FBA9D7E1DE90F08"/>
at his daughters for oppoſing the return of their governeſs. And he had another miſtreſs in town, who had a taſte for all its gaieties.</p>
               <p>The young ladies were now treated with great ſeverity by ſir Thomas: and his ſon had not been long abroad, when they were forbid to correſpond with him, leſt his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>llies ſhould be the ſubject of their correſpondence: and he alſo ordered their brother not to write to them. This prohibition gave theſe ladies the moſt ſenſible concern, as they dreaded its laying a foundation for their being treated with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by their brother, on whom, as their mother had foretold, they were likely, if he ſurvived their father, to have too great a dependence. But though ſir Thomas ſhewed not the leaſt tenderneſs for his daughters, he, in all companies gloried in his ſon, who he obſerved, was all that was dutiful, brave, worthy and pious; alleging to his intimate friends, that the reaſon of his permitting his being ſo long abſent, was, that his ſon's morals and his own were ſo different, that he ſhould be aſhamed of his ſuperiority; but, that
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022852_0055_0FBA9D7FD4527038"/>
he intended to alter his courſe of life, and then he would ſend for him. In the mean while, mrs. Farnboro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas appeared fond of lord L. and on his retiring to Grandiſon Hall, after mrs. Farnborough's death, gave him an invitation to viſit him there. Hence that nobleman attended him at the hall, where he fell in love with the eldeſt of the young ladies, to whom he revealed his paſſion. She referred her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to her father: but though
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022852_0056_0FBA9D8112AD0950"/>
this match would have been highly to her advantage, ſir Thomas abſolutely refuſed his conſent.</p>
               <p>At length, ſir Thomas reſolved to regulate his affairs, preparatory to the leave he intended to give his ſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. But he knew not what to do with mrs. Oldham, and two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he had by her. He made no doubt of his ſon's having heard of his guilty commerce with her: but he did not chooſe that he ſhould find her living with him as a miſtreſs, in one of the family ſeats. He was alſo unwilling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>While he was thus contriving how to make the beſt appearance before his ſon, whoſe character for virtue and prudence, made him half afraid of him, he received a propoſal of marriage for the young gentleman from one of the firſt men in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whoſe daughter accompanying her brother and his lady in a tour to France and Italy, fell in love with mr. Grandiſon at Florence. Sir Thomas had ſeveral meetings on this ſubject,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022852_0057_0FBA9D82A5459870"/>
both with the brother and the earl, his father, and was ſo fond of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to bear, that he had thoughts of reſerving to himſelf an annuity, and, in favour of this match, making over the whole eſtate to his ſon; and actually ſent him this propoſal. But mr. Grandiſon in his anſwer, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if this aroſe from his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, affection, and indulgence, he had ſo often experienced, he could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

On this anſwer, ſir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas reſolved to ſuſpend the treaty of marriage till his ſon's arrival.</p>

                  <p>Sir Charles returns to England. His engaging behaviour to his ſiſters, and to mrs. Oldham.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE affairs of the family were in this ſituation when Sir Charles arrived. He returned no anſwer to his ſiſter's letters, but inſtantly ſet out for Calais, embarked, and the ſame day in which he landed, arrived at his late father's houſe in St. James's ſquare. How awful to the ſiſters, after an abſence of eight or nine years, muſt be the firſt appearance of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on whom their fortunes entirely depended, and to whom they had been accuſed by their father, now ſo lately departed, of want of duty! He alighted from his poſt-chaiſe at the door, and his two ſiſters met him in the hall. They remembered the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful youth of ſeventeen, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022852_0060_0FBA9D88C342FDD0"/>
beauties into which their own fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were ripened, ſeemed not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that manly ſtature and air, and that equal vivacity and intrepidity, with a noble countenance, that then appeared more than uſually ſolemn, from his having in his thoughts an unburied and beloved father. O my brother! ſaid Caroline, meeting him with open arms, but ſhrinking from his embrace, may I ſay my brother? and was juſt fainting. He claſped her, and ſupported her in his arms, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, the youngeſt, affected at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſurprized at her ſiſter's emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ran back into the room they had left, and threw herſelf upon a ſettee. Her brother followed her, ſoothing miſs Caroline, with his arm round her waiſt, and with eyes of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cried, my Charlotte! holding out his inviting hand, and haſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſettee. She then found her feet, and throwing her arms about his neck, he folded both of his ſiſters to his boſom, crying, receive, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſiſters, receive your brother, your friend. Aſſure yourſelves of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abated love. That aſſurance, they
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022852_0061_0FBA9D8A153BCA80"/>
cried, was balm to their hearts; and when each was ſeated, he ſitting over againſt them, looked firſt at one, then on the other; and taking each by the hand, charming women! ſaid he, how I admire my ſiſters! I don't doubt, that you have minds anſwerable to your perſons. What pleaſure, what pride ſhall I take in my ſiſters! My dear Charlotte! ſaid miſs Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, taking her ſiſter's other hand, has not our brother all the brother in his face? His goodneſs only looks ſtronger and more perfect. What was I afraid of? My heart alſo ſunk; I knew not why, ſaid Charlotte. But we feared—indeed, ſir, we both fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—O my brother! tears trickling down the cheeks of each—We did not mean to be undutiful—Love your brother, my dear ſiſters, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, as he will endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your love: my mother's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters could not be undutiful—miſtake only!—unhappy miſapprehenſion! He then preſſed the hands of each with his lips, aroſe, went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and wiped his eyes—Then turning towards them, added, permit

me, my dear ſiſters, to retire for a moment, my father demands this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. They waited on him to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment with ſilent reſpect. No cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I hope, my Caroline, my Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, he reſumed, we were true ſiſters and brother a few years ago: ſee your Charles as you ſaw him then; and don't let abſence, which has increaſed my love, leſſen yours. Each ſiſter then took a hand, and would have kiſſed it. But he claſped his arms about them both, and ſaluted them. He caſt his eyes on his father's and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pictures, with ſome emotion; then on them, and again ſaluting each of them, they withdrew with tears of joy trickling down their cheeks.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles in half an hour rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in another dreſs, and again ſaluted them with an air of tenderneſs that baniſhed fear, and left room for nothing but love. Soon after their couſin Grandiſon came in: and after the firſt compliments, the ladies retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that gentleman touched upon the circumſtances of ſir Thomas's illneſs, and death; inveighing againſt mrs. Oldham, telling ſir Charles what they
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022852_0063_0FBA9D8E52D15A30"/>
had done, and exclaiming againſt her for the ſtate ſhe had lived in, and her unwillingneſs to reſign the care of ſir Thomas, in his illneſs, to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He then aſked ſir Charles, if he was not pleaſed with what they had done as to that vile woman? But he only obſerved, that he believed every thing was deſigned for the beſt. Mr. Grandiſon then ridiculed her grief and mortification at being obliged to leave the houſe, where ſhe had ſo long reigned lady paramount. Sir Charles aſked, if they had found a will? And was anſwered, that they looked in every probable place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but found none. I intend, ſaid ſir Charles, to inter the venerable remains with thoſe of my mother, which I know was his deſire. An elegant, but not ſumptuous monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be erected to the memory of both, with a modeſt inſcription, that ſhall be rather a matter of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the living than a panegyric on the deceaſed. The funeral ſhall be decent, but not oſtentatious: and the difference of the expence ſhall be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately applied to aſſiſt diſtreſſed houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, or ſome of my father's poor

               <p>The ſolemnity was no ſooner over, than ſir Charles, leaving every thing as he found it, at Grandiſon-hall, came to town, and in the preſence of his ſiſters, broke the ſeals they had affixed to the cabinets and eſcrutores in the houſe there; and having made memorandums of the contents of many papers, went with his ſiſters to the houſe in Eſſex, and when there, told them it was neceſſary for Mrs. Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who had lodgings at a farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in the neighbourhood, to be preſent at breaking the ſeals, as ſhe had affixed her's; and accordingly ſent for her. She came with fear and trembling, when ſir Charles, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting her ſo ſoon, was in his ſtable, with the groom and coachman, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his horſes, which were ſome of the fineſt hunters and racers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

               <p>Sir Charles entered, and ſaw her ſtanding pale and trembling near the door. He bowed to her. Mrs. Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, I preſume, ſaid he—pray, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, be ſeated: I ſent to you, that you might ſee the ſeals broken—pray, madam, ſit down, added he, taking her hand, and leading her to a chair not far diſtant from his ſiſters, and then ſitting in one between them and her. Pray, madam, compoſe yourſelf, added he, with pity in his eyes; and and then turned to his ſiſters, to allow her time to recover herſelf. She was relieved by a flood of tears, and tried to ſuppreſs her audible ſobs, which he would not ſeem to hear.

me a friend ready to thank you for art your paſt good offices, and to forget all miſtaken ones. This was more than ſhe could bear; ſhe threw herſelf at his feet, when raiſing her to her chair, he added, poor mr.

You have been a faithful manager of the affairs of this houſe. By written evidences I can juſtify you: evidences that I am ſure none here will diſpute.

                  </gap>le haſty, has told me, that he treated you with unkindneſs. He thought you wrong for inſiſting to put your ſeal; but he was miſtaken, you did right. O brother! O brother! ſaid both the ladies at once, half in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, though half vexed. Bear with me, my ſiſters, ſaid he, we have all ſomething to be forgiven for. They knew not but they might be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the admonition from what their father had written of them. He then mentioned chocolate being brought in,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022852_0068_0FBA9D98010E8DB8"/>
and being deſirous of relieving mrs. Oldham by ſome little employment, deſired her to be ſo obliging to ſee it made.</p>
               <p>She had no ſooner left the room, than, addreſſing himſelf to the ladies, my dear ſiſters, ſaid he, let me, on this occaſion, deſire you to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of me. I don't conſider this poor woman on the foot of her own merits with reſpect to us: The memory of our father is concerned. She is intitled to juſtice, for its own ſake; to generoſity, for ours; to kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for my father's. In ſeveral of his letters to me, he praiſes mrs. Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's economy; and he had a right to do what he would with his own fortune. It was not ours till now. Whatever he has left us, he might have leſſened. The economy is all that concerns us in the point of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and that is in her favour. He might have given mrs. Oldham a title to a name that would have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our reſpect, if not our reverence. You have enlarged minds; and are the daughters of the moſt charitable, the moſt forgiving of women; and I
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022852_0069_0FBA9D99E8DF41C0"/>
was willing to judge of her behaviour, before I recommended her to your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Is ſhe not humbled enough? From my ſoul, I pity her. She loved my father, and I don't doubt mourns for him in ſecret; yet does not dare to plead her love. I would now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her only as one who has executed a principal office in this houſe; and it will become us to behave to her in ſuch a manner, as to make the world think we conſider her only in that light.</p>
               <p>When they had drank chocolate, he told mrs. Oldham, he was ready to attend her, and deſired his ſiſters to give them their company. On their coming to the chamber in which ſir Thomas died, mrs. Oldham turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Two or three months after ſir Charles's arrival in England, lord L. came to town from Scotland, and paid him his firſt viſit; when, his lordſhip mentioning his love for miſs Caroline, and ſhe acknowledging her regard for him, he introduced him to her, and joining their hands, held them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both his; ſaying, with pleaſure do I join hands, where ſuch worthy hearts are united.

And has not my Charlotte, ſaid he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her, ſome happy man whom ſhe can diſtinguiſh by her love? You, my ſiſters, are equally dear to me. Come, Charlotte, make me your conſidant; and your inclinations ſhall direct my choice.</p>
               <p>Before the marriage, ſir Charles gave his ſiſter a paper ſealed up. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this, my Caroline, ſaid, he, as from your father's bounty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with what your mother, had ſhe lived, would have wiſhed. When you oblige lord L—with one hand, make him this preſent with the other; and thus intitle yourſelf to all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude with which his worthy heart will overflow. I have only done my duty, in promiſing an article of the will I have made in my own mind for my father. He then ſaluted her, and withdrew before ſhe broke the ſeal; and when ſhe did, ſhe found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained bank notes for 10,000l. She threw herſelf into a chair, and was unable to riſe; but recovering herſelf,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022852_0076_0FBA9DA610BF8960"/>
ſhe hurried out to find her brother, and was told he was in his ſiſter's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. She ran thither, and found Charlotte was in tears, ſir Charles having juſt left her. What ails my Charlotte? ſaid ſhe. O Caroline, cried the other, this brother! there is no bearing his generous goodneſs. See that deed! She took it up, and finding it was for the ſame ſum he had given her, and to carry intereſt, they congratulated and wept over each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if diſtreſſed. Caroline found out her brother; but when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, could only expreſs her gratitude by lifting up her hands and eyes. He had no ſooner raiſed and ſeated her, than the equally grateful Charlotte entered, when placing her next her ſiſter, and drawing a chair for himſelf, he took the hand of each, and then ſaid, my dear ſiſters, you are too ſenſible of theſe inſtances of my brotherly love.

We would not be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a bad action. I hope not, I hope not, ſhe returned. You ſeem to be a mother, theſe young gentlewomen, I preſume, are your daughters. Save me from ruin, I beſeech you, madam—Save me from ruin as you would theſe your daughters. This muſt be the vile contrivance of ſir Hargrave Pollexfen. Is it not? Is it not? Tell me, I beg you to tell me.</p>
               <p>Miſs Byron then riſing, ſat on the ſide of the bed; when ſir Hargrave inſtantly entered. She ſcreamed out,

On her reviving, ſhe begged and offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to induce them to facilitate her eſcape: but ſhe had ſcarce began to ſpeak before ſir Hargrave returned, and haughtily bade her not needleſsly terrify herſelf, ordering the women to withdraw.

The women again walked out, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I have entreated you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and on my knees too, to ſhow me mercy, but you would ſhew me none.

Then throwing his arms about her, ſhe was terrified, and cried out, when inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered one of the daughters, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Then turning to him, ſhe told him the gentleman was waiting.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant entered a horrid looking clergyman; he was a tall, big-boned, ſplay-footed man, in a ſhabby gown, a wig equally ſhabby, with a huge red pimpled face, and a great red noſe.

But paying little attention to his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid viſage, ſhe puſhed by ſir Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, turning him half round, and

plead for me! If you be women, plead for me!—You have a ſoul to anſwer for. I can die; but never, never will be his! The young women wept; and the mother being moved, deſired they might talk to the lady by themſelves. This was granted; when, retiring into another room, they plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſir Hargrave's great eſtate, his handſome perſon, his honourable love, and their being unable to ſave her from worſe treatment. On the other hand, miſs Byron pleaded her invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible averſion, and contempt of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, crying, how, not able! Is not this, ladies, your own houſe? Cannot you raiſe your neighbours? Before the week is out, I will order a thouſand pounds to be paid into your hands.

to exalt her into lady Pollexfen, he would humble her. She would be greatly hurt, indeed, cried he, to be the wife of a man of my fortune and conſequence! But I'll bring down her pride. What the devil, am I to creep, beg, and entreat only for a wife!—But, madam, added he, with a ſneer, perhaps you'll be mine upon certain terms.</p>
               <p>The mother and youngeſt daughter were then led by ſir Hargrave to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

head ſwam, her eyes failed her, and ſhe fainted away. Sir Hargrave, filled with conſternation, ran about the room calling upon God to have mercy upon him, and having let in the women, they lamented over her, and ſaid ſhe had death in her face. The baronet, in the midſt of his horror, ſeized her bloody handkerchief, and ſaying it ſhould not appear againſt him, ſtepped into the next room, and thruſt it into the fire, by which was ſitting the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and his helper, over ſome burnt brandy. O Gentlemen, ſaid he, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done to-night. Take this, giving them money; the lady is in a fit, I wiſh you well home.

               <p>On miſs Byron's coming to herſelf, ſhe found no body with her but the three women. She was in a cold ſweat, and as there was no fire in the room, they conducted her into the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

which the two men had left; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardly able to ſtand, they placed her in an elbow chair, and chafed her temples with Hungary water. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mother and eldeſt daughter left her, and went to ſir Hargrave: and the youngeſt being at length called out, the baronet entered, took a chair, and ſat down by miſs Byron, who ſtill felt a violent pain in her ſtomach and arm. At laſt the lady breaking ſilence, ſaid have you done well, ſir Hargrave, to commit ſuch violence on one who never did nor thought to injure you? In what diſtraction have you involved my couſin Reeves! She ſtopped, and he continuing ſilent, ſhe reſumed, theſe ſeem to be honeſt people, and I hope you only deſign to terrify me.

               <p>The chariot was attended by ſeveral men on horſeback, among whom was her own ſervant, and ſir Hargrave ſtepping in, ſaid to him, if you meet with impertinents, you know what to ſay; and on her ſcreaming out, he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidingly cried, ſcream on, my dear, and barbarouſly mocked her, imitating the bleating of a ſheep.

On her calling out for help, at the approach of paſſengers, ſhe heard one of the men repreſent ſir Hargrave as the beſt of huſbands, and herſelf as the worſt of wives.

He vowed revenge; and was no ſooner recovered, than he ſent ſir Charles a challenge. But though ſir Charles was perfectly ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the uſe of all the offenſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, he had reſolved never to make

               <p>Sir Charles and his ſiſter were charmed with the converſation and engaging qualities of their amiable gueſt, and became ſo extremely fond of her, as to give her the title of ſiſter; and on lord and lady L's arrival, after miſs Byron's return to Mr. Reeve's, they were conducted thither by ſir Charles and miſs Charlotte, that they might then ſee and acknowledge their new relation.

               </argument>
               <p>MISS Byron was charmed with the diſintereſted goodneſs in her deliverer; and ſir Charles's ſiſters, by whom ſhe was tenderly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, obſerving the pleaſure with which ſhe I ſtened to every thing they ſaid of him, and the delight ſhe took in his converſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion, prevailed on her to confeſs the impreſſion he had made on her heart; letting her know, that they wiſhed to acknowledge her as their real ſiſter, and generouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their aſſiſtance, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſituation of their brother's mind. They knew that he had a high eſteem for miſs Byron, but could not be certain that he was not under engagements to ſome foreign beauty. They therefore applied for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the worthy doctor Bartlett, who was now ſir Charles's chaplain, and was well acquainted with every circumſtance of his life. But this
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:022852_0103_0FBA9B6F9336A3E0"/>
gentleman referred them to their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; on which they took the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to aſk him whether he had any thought of marriage, and if his heart was in poſſeſſion of any foreign lady. To this he only anſwered, that he was in a very difficult ſituation, and far from being happy. But a few days after, taking miſs Byron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lord L—'s ſtudy, he gave her the hiſtory of the noble Clementina and his friend Jeronymo, referring her, for farther particulars to his letters to dr. Bartlett. She was extremely mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the affecting ſtory, admired and pitied the lovely Italian; and every hope of happineſs by an union with him, being now vaniſhed, reſolved to uſe her utmoſt endeavours, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer her paſſion.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles, ſome days after, paid a viſit to miſs Byron at her uncle Reeve's, where being left alone with her, he, with a ſolemn air, thus addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: The laſt time I had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being alone with my good miſs Byron, I told her a very tender tale, which muſt raiſe in ſuch a heart as her's a generous compaſſion for the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022852_0104_0FBA9B715740DD98"/>
nobleſt lady on the continent. The ſtory did indeed, affect you; and I am ſure you muſt have ſuffered ſtill more from the ſame compaſſionate goodneſs on the communications made you by dr. Bartlett. May I be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, madam, to add a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on the ſame ſubject, for I am deſirous to acquaint you, rather than any woman in the world, with all I know myſelf of this melancholy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. Miſs Byron, with trembling heſitation, anſwered, that the ſtory was, indeed, a moſt affecting one, and that he would do her an honour in acquainting her with further particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Sir Charles then told her, that Clementina's brother the biſhop, had written to entreat that he would once more viſit Bologna, though the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was againſt his coming. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to meet him where he pleaſed, and to conduct him to Bologna, where his preſence would rejoice every heart. He likewiſe ſhewed her a letter from mrs. Beaumont, which informed him of many affecting particulars. The noble yet unhappy Clementina had been hurried from place to place, with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022852_0105_0FBA9B750986B0B0"/>
the expectation of ſeeing him, and had afterwards been put into the hands of the lady Sforza, and her daughter Laurana, who, from intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and envy of her ſuperior quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had treated her with the utmoſt cruelty. Miſs Byron wept at read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He alſo ſhewed her a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from ſeignior Jeronymo, which informed me that his life was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him, and that he did not think himſelf in ſkilful hands, wiſhing that ſir Charles and himſelf had been of one country, ſince the greateſt felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he could now enjoy, would be to reſign up his life to the great author of it, in the arms of his deareſt friend.</p>
               <p>At this inſtant mr. Reeves entering the room, miſs Byron walked to the window, and ſtrove to recollect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The gentleman ſoon after with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, when ſir Charles coming up to

Sir Charles leading her to her ſeat, and taking his by her, anſwered, ever ſince I had the honour of knowing miſs Byron, I have conſidered her as one of the moſt excellent of women. My heart demands an alliance with her's, though I am in ſo perplexed a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſcarcely da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He then told her, that he had wrote to the biſhop, that he would moſt chearfully comply with his wiſhes, and that as Jeronymo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf diſſatisfied with his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, he only wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Sir Charles leaping out of the poſtchaiſe, deſired mr. Lowther's ſervant to diſmount, and getting on his horſe, galloped away with his three ſervants towards the place.

the two men who were ſo cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſing their whips: but on his approach, they drew their hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and retired to a little diſtance. The four men on horſe-back joining the two on foot, juſt as they were quitting the object of their fury, one of them ſaid, forbear brother, for the preſent, any farther violence; the gentleman ſhall be told the cauſe. Murder, ſir, ſaid he, is not intended, nor are we robbers. Thoſe you are ſolicitous to ſave are villains. At this inſtant, ſir Charles firſt raiſed one groaning man, and then the other. Their heads were covered with blood, and they were ſo bruiſed, that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats which lay near them. By this time the men on foot had mounted their horſes, and all ſix ſtood on their defence; but one of them was ſo furious, that two of the others could ſcarce reſtrain him, he cried that his vengeance ſhould be ſtill more complete. At this inſtant came up mr. Lowther, and his ſervant in the chaiſe, each with a piſtol in his hand, and he having, at ſir Charles's

deſire, examined their wounds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that there was no apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death. On which ſir Charles obſerved, that as they had neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to fly, nor been guilty of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to himſelf, his friend, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he was afraid they had reaſon to think themſelves ill uſed by the gentlemen. You, ſir, cried one of them, ſeem to be a man of honour and temper; we are men of honour as well as you. Our deſign was not to kill the miſcreants, as we told you, but to give them reaſon to remember their villainy as long as they lived, and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like. They have made a vile attempt on a lady's honour at Abbeville, and finding themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, have endeavoured, by round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about ways, to eſcape the vengeance of her friends. That gentleman has reaſon for being enraged, ſince he is the lady's huſband; that and that are her brothers. The villains have not yet been puniſhed as they deſerve, but let them aſk on their knees this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's pardon, pointing to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and promiſe never more to come

Sir Charles then turning towards ſir Hargrave and his companion, ſaid, gentlemen, if you have done wrong, you ought not ſcruple aſking pardon; but if you know yourſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, though I would be loth to riſque the lives of my friend and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; my countrymen ſhall not make ſo undue a ſubmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Sir Hargrave's poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe now coming up, he and his companion were, with difficulty, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it, while ſir Charles and Mr. Lowther went into theirs, and being only at a ſmall diſtance from Paris, they proceeded to that city in company.</p>

the count of Belvedere. They all expreſſed great joy at ſeeing him; but told him, on his enquiring after the barone Jeronymo, that he was alive, and that was all; however, the ſight of his friend would be a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to his heart. As to Clementina, her bodily health was greatly impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they had little hopes of the recovery of her mind. They both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that ſhe had been denied the requeſted interview at his departure, and were convinced, that if it had been granted, and ſhe had been left to mrs. Beaumont's friendly care, they might have expected a happy iſſue. The next day they ſet out for Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and the count of Belvedere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them about half way, found an opportunity to mention to ſir Charles his unabated paſſion for Clementina, and that he had lately made offers to marry her, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diſorder of her mind, ſince he flattered himſelf that her cure was not impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles, on his arrival at Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna, haſted to the barone, who, the moment he ſaw him, cried, do I once

The biſhop then led him to the marquiſs and marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when his reception from the former was kind, but from that of his lady, it was that of a mother to a long abſent child. She told him, ſhe had had ever eſteemed him her fourth ſon, and now he had brought over with him a ſurgeon of experience, and advice in writing, of eminent phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of his country, the obligations he had laid on their whole family, were too great ever to be returned.

Her motion was ſlow and ſolemn; her robes were black, and flowing; her dejected face was half covered by a veil of black gauſe, and her eyes caſt on the ground. Sir Charles aroſe from his ſeat, ſat down, and roſe again irreſolute, not knowing what he did, or what to do. She approached the table, round which the company ſat, but with her eyes caſt down, and more than half cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſhe then turned towards the window. Here, here, madam, ſaid Camilla, leading her to a chair that had been placed for her between the marchioneſs and the general's lady. She ſat down. Her mother wept, as did alſo the general's lady; and her father ſobbing, turned his head aſide. Her mother then took her hand, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my love, look round about you; but ſhe took no notice. The general grieved and impatient, aroſe; ſtepped to her; and hanging over her ſhoulder, cried, my deareſt ſiſter, look upon us all. See your father, mother, ſiſter,

If you love us, ſmile upon us; when lifting up her eyes to him, ſhe tried to ſmile: but ſuch a ſolemnity had taken poſſeſſion of her features, that her ſmile ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the ſmile of woe.

She caſt her eyes that way, and ſaw ſir Charles greatly affected. She ſtarted, ſhe looked again: again ſtarted, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening and turning pale by turns. She roſe, then threw her arms about Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla, who ſtood by her, crying, O Camilla! then gave way to a violent burſt of tears.

good Camilla! now at laſt you have told me truth! It is, it is he, hiding her face in Camilla's boſom. She then, ſupported by the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the general's lady, turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door; but ſir Charles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to her, ſhe ſtopped, and ſaying, Ah, chevalier, reclined her head on her mother's boſom, ſeemed ready to faint. He took her hand, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſſed it to his lips, crying, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, ladies, forgive me; lady Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina! His ſoul overflowing with tenderneſs, he could ſay no more; he therefore roſe. She moved on to the door, and then turned her head, ſtraining to look at him till ſhe was out of the room, ſir Charles ſtanding like a ſtatue.</p>
               <p>After this, many tender interviews paſſed between ſir Charles and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina. The whole family repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly uſed the moſt earneſt perſuaſions to induce ſir Charles to change his religion; but theſe proving ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, they conſented to give him Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina on the conditions he himſelf had propoſed; the daughters were, therefore, to be conſidered as Italians,

they were to be educated in Italy, and to enjoy the great eſtate given to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina by her two grandfathers, on condition of her marrying; while the ſons, as being proteſſants, were to be educated in England, and provided for by their father. Mean while, ſir Charles's joy was damped by the grief of the count of Belvedere, who, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at Bologna, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

when ſir Charles, to avoid hearing ſighs which pierced his heart, walked into the next room, where he found her mother and Camilla, who inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to her.

               <p>O thou, whom my heart loveth; my tutor, my brother, my friend! ſeek me not to marriage.

the effort? I know thou loveſt Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina: It is her pride to think thou doſt. But ſhe is not worthy of thee. Yet let thy heart own that thou loveſt her ſoul, her immortal ſoul, and her future peace. In that wilt thou ſhew thy love, as ſhe has endeavoured to ſhew her's. Thou art all magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; thou canſt ſuſtain the effort to which ſhe was unequal. Make ſome other woman happy, but let it not be an Italian.</p>
               <p>O thou whom my ſoul loveth, let me try the greatneſs of thy love, and the greatneſs of thy ſoul, by thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſtrengthen, and not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair a reſolution, which after all, it will be in thy power to make me break or keep!

forgive me? I know thou canſt. Thou haſt the ſame notions that I have of the brevity and vanity of this world's glory, and of the duration of that to come! If I have the courage, the reſolution to ſhew thee this paper, do thou enable me, by thy great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to complete the conqueſt of myſelf; and do not put me upon taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the generoſity of my honoured friends. Yet after all, it muſt be, let me own, in thy choice; for I cannot bear to be thought ungrateful to ſuch exalted merit, to add what name thou pleaſeth to that of Clementina.</p>
               <p>At reading this paper, ſir Charles was amazed, confounded, and filled with admiration at the angelic ſoul of this lady. He threw himſelf on a couch, without thinking of Camilla, who ſat in the window. Clementina rang, Camilla haſted to her. He ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe paſſed him, and roſe; but on her return, ſhe rouſed him from the ſtupefaction with which he was ſeized. O ſir, cried ſhe, my poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fears your anger; ſhe fears, yet hopes to ſee you. Haſte, haſte, and ſave her from fainting. He ran in.—

The admirable lady met him half way, and throwing herſelf at his feet, ſaid, forgive, forgive the creature that muſt be miſerable, if ſhe has offended you. He attempted to raiſe her, but ſhe cried, ſhe would not riſe till he had forgiven her. He then kneeled to her as ſhe kneeled, and claſping her in his arms, cried, forgive you, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam! O inimitable woman! Can you forgive me for having preſumed, and for ſtill preſuming to hope to call ſuch an angel mine! Being ready to faint, ſhe threw her arms about ſir Charles, to ſupport herſelf. Camilla held her ſalts to her noſe, and ſhe again repeated, am I, am I forgiven? Say that I am. Forgive you, madam! he returned, you have done nothing that wants forgiveneſs! I admire your greatneſs of mind. What you wiſh, bid me be, and that I will be. Riſe, moſt excellent of human creatures! Sir Charles, then raiſing her, led her to a chair, and involuntarily kneeled on one knee with both her hands in his, and looked up to her with eyes filled with love and reverence.

                  </gap>rl: but none of them imagined ſhe would be able to keep her reſolution; and to encourage ſir Charles, they reminded him, that ſhe had entirely put herſelf in his power, by writing, that he might add what name he pleaſed to that of Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina. Sir Charles, however, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that her conſcience was concerned, and notwithſtanding his paſſion, he told them, he could not reſolve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to violate it. Dear Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaid the biſhop, taking his hand, how I admire you! But can you be ſo great? Shall I not, my lord, he returned, emulate ſuch an example ſet by a woman? I came over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intereſted views. I indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered myſelf as bound by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which I had formerly agreed; but the lady Clementina and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as free. If ſhe perſiſts in her reſolution, I will endeavour to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce.</p>
               <p>A few days after, the marchioneſs,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022852_0127_0FBA9BA5263524A8"/>
in Clementina's name, begged of ſir Charles that he would accept of her, on the conditions they themſelves had propoſed, and that he would change his religion. Father Marcſcotti, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding the motion, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him on his knees. O cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſaid the biſhop, how happy is it in your power to make us all! You will not, I hope, dear Grandiſon, ſaid the marquis, refuſe my daughter. Aſk any conditions of us. She ſhall be with you in England in a month's time. We will accompany her thither; and ſtay till you ſhall chuſe to return with us. Jeronymo, ſobbing, caught his hand, crying for God's ſake, for my ſake, for all our ſakes, for your ſoul's ſake, my Grandiſon, be ours. Let your Jeronymo call you brother. If my tears, if my prayers have weight, ſaid the marchioneſs, let me call down my child, and ſhe ſhall give you her hand in our preſence. She thinks, beſides her regard for your ſoul, that ſhe ought to inſiſt upon the terms on which we would have conſented to make her yours, in gratitude for our compliance with her wiſhes. Deareſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Grandiſon! rejoined the biſhop, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not my ſiſter, refuſe not the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Clementina.</p>
               <p>They were all ſilent, with their eyes fixed upon ſir Charles, on which he replied, refuſe lady Clementina, ſaid you! How you wound my ſoul by the ſuppoſition! Lady Clementina's generous and condeſcending propoſal, when I am willing to allow terms to her, that ſhe will not to me, ſhews how important ſhe thinks the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the two religions, and I have only to confeſs myſelf, that the power of refuſal lies where it ought. Yet let me add, this company cannot think me too ſolemn—Were I to live always here, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced there is no life after this, your commands and Clementina's would be laws to me. But has ſhe not the goodneſs to ſay in her paper, that I have the ſame notion as ſhe of the brevity and vanity of this world's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of the duration of that to come. It is hard, very hard, ſaid the biſhop, for a man convinced of the truth of his religion, to allow to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a different perſuaſion, what he
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022852_0129_0FBA9BA7DA49ACE0"/>
expects ſhould be allowed for himſelf. You, chevalier, however, can allow it; and have ſuch greatneſs of mind as to judge favourably of thoſe who cannot. I do love you, but fain would I love you more. The marchioneſs wept. My dear love, ſaid the marquis, taking her hand, how many tears has this affair coſt you:—My heart bleeds to ſee you weep. The chevalier is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of our child, unworthy of the terms we offered him; unworthy of our joint entreaties—He is an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles being greatly affected, withdrew; but having taken two or three turns in the ſaloon, returned; on which the marquis coming to him, cried, I am ſorry—Not one word of apology, my lord, ſaid ſir Charles, interrupting him: I did not withdraw from reſentment, but purely from concern, that in your opinion, I did not deſerve the honor, done me by one ſo dear to you. Think me unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, my lord, and pity me. Principle, not perverſeneſs, influences me. It does every one preſent; it does the lady above; and ſhall we not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for one another, when we are all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the ſame motive? At this the biſhop threw his arms about ſir Charles, crying, generous expanſion of heart!</p>
               <p>Sir Charles, now finding that Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina ſtedfaſtly perſiſted in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, deſired they would allow him to make one effort to convince her, that ſhe might be happy with him; by endeavouring to remove her ſcruples with reſpect to his inviolable honour, and his allowing her the free exerciſe of her religion. To this they at length conſented: and ſhe deſiring to ſee him, he earneſtly pleaded his having agreed to allow her her chapel, her confeſſor, and her own ſervants. He alleged, that he might prevail on her father and mother to give them the pleaſure of their company in their firſt journey to England; and that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone would likewiſe go with them, and might obtain great benefit from the uſe of the reſtorative baths of his country.

Be my advocate to your own heart, and ſeek not, deareſt of men, to entangle me with your love. Sir Charles then aſſured her, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

it coſt him, he would yield to her pleaſure, and never urge her again on that ſubject, except he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the biſhop that ſhe had changed her mind.</p>
               <p>The agitations he had ſuffered were ſcarcely to be ſupported; and as he found his health affected, he thought it neceſſary, both on the noble lady's account and his own, to wean himſelf by abſence. He therefore viſited ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cities of Italy, and then returned to take his final leave of Bologna. The joy and gratitude of the marquis, his lady, and her ſon, on the recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intellects of their incomparable daughter; the pleaſing proſpect of the recovery of Jeronymo, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and affection for a perſon to whom they were under ſuch great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, made them at a loſs how to return the favour he had conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and they entreated him to let them know what return he would accept.

               <argument>
                  <p>Miſs Byron ſtruggles to conquer her paſſion; but ſir Charles no ſooner returns to England, than he pays his addreſſes to her. Their court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and marriage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ON ſir Charles's arrival in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, he was received by his family and friends with the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt teſtimonies of joy: but he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely alarmed to hear that miſs By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was ill; he therefore took a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into Northamp onſhire, where that lady lived with her relations, and paid a viſit to Mrs. Shirley, her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, an elderly lady of a very amiable character; when, informing her of his ſituation with reſpect to Clementina, he aſked if it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with her notions of delicacy, to
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022852_0134_0FBA9BAF523550E0"/>
give her intereſt in his favour; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that if it was, and if miſs Byron would accept of a heart that had been thus unaccountably divided, they would lay him under an obligation that he could only endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by the utmoſt gratitude and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; then deſiring an anſwer in writing, he left upon the table ſeveral letters he had received from Jerony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo and Clementina, with his anſwers, that ſhe might ſee that the affair was entirely finiſhed between him and that lady, and then took his leave.</p>
               <p>Immediately mrs. Shirley ſent for miſs Byron, mr. and mrs. Selby, with ſome other relations, and having informed them of the welcome news, they read the letters, which gave them entire ſatisfaction; on which the old lady wrote to ſir Charles, that they received as the higheſt honour, the offer he had made of an alliance, that would do credit to families of the firſt rank; and that it had been their moſt ardent wiſh, that the man, who had reſcued the dear creature, might be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sir Charles, on receiving this wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come letter, paid his addreſſes to miſs Byron. She at firſt received him with viſible confuſion, but was ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by his polite and tender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. He ſhowed her another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Jeronymo, in which his dear friend urged him to ſet an example to Clementina, by entering into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtate, and informing him, that the noble lady wiſhed for nothing more than to hear of his being happily married. You ſee, madam, added he, I am fully free, with regard to Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina; free by her own choice. It was always Clementina's wiſh that I would marry, and only be careful that my choice ſhould not diſgrace her regard for me; but when ſhe has the pleaſure of knowing the dear lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, if I am allowed that honour, ſhe will confeſs that my choice has done the higheſt credit to the favour ſhe honoured me with. He was ſilent, and ſeeming to expect an anſwer; the honour, ſaid ſhe, with much heſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſir Charles Grandiſon, no one ever did, or ever can doubt.—I muſt own—I muſt confeſs—Here ſhe pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

What does my dear miſs Byron own? What confeſs? ſaid he. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yourſelf, madam, of my honour, of my gratitude. Should you have doubts, ſpeak them. This, ſir, ſaid ſhe, is my confeſſion, the confeſſion of a heart no leſs ſincere than yours, that I am dazzled and confounded at the ſuperior merits of the noble lady you ſtill ſo juſtly eſteem.

Byron, returned he, in a rapture; and is this all your fear? Then muſt the man before you be happy. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina has acted gloriouſly, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her religion and her country, to all other conſiderations; and ſhall I not be doubly bound in gratitude to her ſiſter excellence, who not having theſe trials, yet the moſt delicate of human minds, ſhows in my favour, a frankneſs of heart which ſets her above little forms, and at the ſame time a generoſity with regard to the merits of another lady, that has few examples?

               <p>At laſt the happy day was fixed. The relations of miſs Byron choſe to have the ceremony performed in as public a manner as poſſible; and ſir Charles coming into their meaſures, that lady acquieſced, though ſhe could not, without great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  <pb n="139" facs="unknown:022852_0138_0FBA9BB853D65E80"/>
The ladies were all elegantly dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but miſs Byron was in virgin white. The proceſſion to church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of eight coaches and four, and the way was lined with ſpectators. On their ſtopping at the church yard, four tenants daughters, the eldeſt not above thirteen, unexpectedly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with neat baſkets in their hands filled with flowers; and as ſoon as the bride, mr.

as he will be good to his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet, now no longer Byron! She cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſied low, every one bleſſing her, and pronouncing her the lovelieſt of women, and him the politeſt and moſt graceful of men. Sir Charles now led her intothe veſtry, followed by the reſt of their friends; and the moment ſhe beheld her grandmother, ſhe kneeling, cried, bleſs, madam, your happy, happy child. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

yours, my deareſt life, addreſſing himſelf again to his lovely bride, who ſeemed ſcarcely able to ſupport her joy. Let me once more, added he, bleſs the hand that has bleſſed me! She chearfully offered it. I give you, ſir, ſaid ſhe, my hand, curtſying, and with it a poor but grateful heart.—It is all your own. He bowed upon it, unable to ſpeak. Joy, joy, joy, was wiſhed the happy pair from every mouth. See, my dear young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſaid the happy and inſtructive mrs. Shirley, addreſſing herſelf, to ſeveral who had entered the veſtry, the reward of duty, virtue, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience!

They each beſought her hand, kiſſed it, and promiſed to cheriſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what they had ſeen and heard.</p>
               <p>Sir Charles wrote the very next day to inform his dear friend the barone

della Porretta of the actual celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his nuptials, and concluded with a caution, given in the warmeſt terms, againſt urging Clementina, with too much earneſtneſs, to marry. The ſame day, by ſir Charles's deſire, the church-wardens brought a liſt of the poor, amounting to upwards of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty perſons, divided into two claſſes; one, of the poor—the other of houſe-keepers and labouring people, who were aſhamed to apply, but to whom the church wardens knew his bounty would be acceptable. He gave very liberally to all, and in particular, to about thirty of the laſt: and the church wardens, who were men of great humanity, went away bleſſing him.</p>
               <p>On the following Sunday, the relations of the bride and bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, were all richly dreſſed.

On his lady's coming to him and her friends, they involuntarily roſe, as if to pay her homage; but ſir Charles approaching her, with an air of unuſual freedom, cried, how lovely! But what is even all this amazing lovelineſs to the graces of her mind? They every hour riſe upon me. She hardly opens her lips, but I find reaſon to bleſs God and you, my dear ladies, bowing to mrs. Shirley and mrs.

Teach me, ſir, ſaid ſhe, to deſerve your love, by improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind you have the goodneſs to prefer, and then I ſhall be the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of women on earth. The church was extremely crouded, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming couple greatly admired. Sir Charles and his bride, however, did not forget that humble deportment due to the place, which ſeemed to render them abſent for the time from

               <p>Sir Charles and his bride, having received and returned the viſits of the neighbouring gentry, and giving the tenants their company at another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment provided for them, they ſet out for Grandiſon-hall, ſir Charles's principal ſeat; where, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again run the round of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and paying viſits, they ſettled into that pleaſing ſerenity, that conſtitutes the moſt perfect ſtate of human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

               <p>WHILE ſir Charles was thus employed in the moſt generous acts of humanity and friendſhip, a letter he received from the barone della Porretta, filled him with deep concern. By this letter he learned that the lady Clementina, being ſtrongly bent on taking the veil, had been preſſed with ſuch earneſtneſs and inceſſant importunity to give her hand to the count of Belvedere, as had greatly diſordered her brain; and that, to avoid that union, and put a ſtop to theſe importunate ſolicitations, ſhe had fled from her friends; and with no other attendants than her page, an Engliſh youth, and her ſervant Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, had embarked in a veſſel bound to London; and that both her father, mother, and himſelf, together with ſeveral other of her friends, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable for her loſs, were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; beſeeching him to ſearch for the fugitive Clementina, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

Dear ſir, ſaid ſhe, conſider me as a ſtrengthener<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not as a weakener of your hands in her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

After ſome debate, the whole family conſented to theſe articles: but the lady Clementina found the greateſt difficulty in giving up her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite project of taking the veil; nor could the count of Belvedere, without the greateſt agony of mind, ſubmit to diſcontinue his pretenſions. Theſe precautions being taken, Clementina was to be introduced to her longing parents; but her dread of appearing before them made her entreat the lady Grandiſon and the lady L—to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and countenance her, by their preſence; to which they willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

               <p>This noble lady was not informed till the day before, that the count of Belvedere had accompanied her friends to England. Sir Charles made uſe of great precaution in telling her; and at the ſame time let her know, that the count was very deſirous of taking his leave of her. She conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee him, as one of the friends of her father and brothers, and in that light deferred his departure; ſhe had afterwards ſeveral converſations with him, and, before all her relations, behaved towards him with the reſpect due to his merit. She was ſenſible of the ardour with which her parents and brothers wiſhed to ſee her married to that accompliſhed nobleman. She could not help obſerving the pleaſure that ſparkled in his eyes, whenever ſhe was pleaſed to enter into diſcourſe with him; and ſeriouſly conſidering their motives, with the extraordinary merit of the count, together with the reaſons that had induced her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to enter into the marriage

               <p>In ſhort, this noble family ſtaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months with ſir Charles. Every opportunity was taken to render their reſidence in England as agreeable as poſſible, and on their taking their leave, ſir Charles and his lady attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Dover.</p>
               <p>The next year, ſir Charles and his lady went to Italy, where they were received by this noble family with tranſports of joy. They found Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentina perfectly free from her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy diſorder of mind. After having ſpent ſeveral months in Italy, ſir Charles and his lady, in company with his brothers and ſiſters, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to England, where they had the pleaſure to reſume their former plan of life. Their piety and virtue are the ſources of the nobleſt pleaſures that can fill the human mind.</p>
