            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <head>To the ESSAY on the Globes.</head>
            <p>THE connection of astronomy with geography is so evident, and both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction so necessary to a liberal educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no man will be thought to have deserved ill of the republic of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who has applied his endeavours to diffuse more universally the knowledge of these ufeful Sciences, or to render the attainment of them easier; for as no branch of literature can be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended without them, so there is none which impresses more pleasing ideas on the mind, or that affords it a more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional entertainment.</p>
            <p>In the present work, several objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to former editions are obviated; the Problems arranged in a more method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical manner, and a great number added.
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:036757_0004_100ADB4EE4E86510"/>
Such facts are also occasionally introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, such observations interspersed, and such relative information communicated, as it is presumed will excite curiosity, and fit attention.</p>
            <p>To further the design, the attention is directed to the appearance of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etary bodies, as observed from the earth. It were to be wished that the tutor would at this part exhibit to his pupil the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious phenomena in the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; by teaching him thus to observe for himself, he would not only raise his curiosity, but so fix the impressions which the objects have made on his mind, that by proper cultivation they would prove a fruitful source of useful employment; and he would thereby also gratify that eager desire after novelty, which contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually animates young minds, and furnishes them with objects on which to exercise their natural activity.</p>

            <head>PART I. A TREATISE ON THE USE OF THE TERRESTRIAL &amp; CELESTIAL GLOBES.</head>
            <head type="sub">OF THE ADVANTAGES OF GLOBES IN GENERAL, FOR ILLUSTRATING THE PRIMARY PRINCIPLES OF ASTRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOMY AND GEOGRAPHY; AND PARTICULARLY OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE GLOBES, WHEN MOUNTED IN MY FATHER'S MANNER.</head>
            <p>UNIVERSAL approbation, the opinion of those that excel in science, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of those that are learning, all concur to prove that the artificial representations of the earth and heavens, on the terrestrial and celestial globes, are the instruments the best adapted to convey natural and genuine ideas of astronomy and geography to young minds.</p>
            <p>This superiority they derive principally from their form and figure, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a more just idea, and gives a more ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036757_0012_100B04162C668808"/>
representation of the earth and heavens, than can be formed from any other figure.</p>
            <p>To understand the nature of the projection of either sphere in plano, requires more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of geometry than is generally possessed by beginners, it's principles are more recluse, and the solution of problems more obscure.</p>
            <p>The motion of the earth upon it's axis is one of the most important principles both in geography and astronomy; on it the greater part of the phenomena of the visible world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: but there is no invention that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate so natural a representation of this motion, as that of a terrestrial globe about it's axis. By a celestial globe the apparent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heavens is also represented in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and satisfactory manner.</p>
            <p>In order to convey a clear idea of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious divisions of the earth, of the situation of different places, and to obtain an easy solution of the various problems in geography, it is necessary to conceive many imaginary circles delineated on it's surface, and to understand their relation to each other. Now on a globe these circles have their true form; their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections and relative positions are visible upon the most cursory inspection. But in objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the sphere in plano, the form of these circles is varied, and their nature changed; they are consequently but ill adapted to convey
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036757_0013_100B0418651A2F28"/>
to young minds the elementary principles of geography.</p>
            <p>On a globe, the appearance of the land and water is perfectly natural and continuous, fitted to convey accurate ideas, and leave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent impressions on the most tender minds; whereas in planispheres one-half of the globe is separated and disjoined from the other; and those parts, which are contiguous on a globe, are here separated and thrown at a distance from each other. The celestial globe has the same superiority over projections of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in plano.</p>
            <p>The globe exhibits every thing in true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, both of figure and size; while on a planisphere the reverse may often be observed.</p>
            <p>Presuming that these reasons sufficiently evince the great advantage of globes over either planispheres or maps, for obtaining the first principles of astronomical and geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge, I proceed to point out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of globes <hi>mounted in my father's manner,</hi> over the common, or rather the old and Ptolemaic mode of fitting them up.</p>
            <p>The great and increasing sale of his globes mounted in the best manner, may be looked upon at least as a proof of approbation from numbers; to this I might also add, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement they have received from the principal tutors of both our universities, the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036757_0014_100B041A3845C300"/>
public sanction of the university of Leyden, the many editions of my father's treatise on their use, and its translation into Dutch, &amp;c. The recommendation of Mess. Arden, Walker, Burton, &amp;c. public lecturers in natural philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, might also be adduced: but leaving these considerations, I shall proceed to enumerate the reasons which give them, in my opinion, a decided preference over every other kind of mounting.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following note from Mr. Walker's Easy Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Geography, in favour of my father's globes, will not, I hope, be deemed improper.</p>
                  <p>"Simplicity and perspicuity should ever be studied by those who cultivate the young mind; and jarring, opposing, or equivocal ideas should be avoided almost as much as error or falsehood. Our globes, till of late years, were equipt with an hour circle, which prevented the poles from sliding through the horizon; hence their rectification was generally for the <hi>place on the earth,</hi> instead of the <hi>sun's place in the ecliptic;</hi> which put the globe into so unnatural and absurd a position re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the sun, that young people were confounded when they compared it with the earth's positions during it's annual rotation round that luminary, and considering the horizon as the boundary of day and night. Being, therefore, sometimes obliged to rectify for the place on the earth, and sometimes for the sun's place in the ecliptic, the two rules clash so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily in the pupil's mind, that few remember a single pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem a twelvemonth after the end of their tuition. Globes, therefore, with a horary circle, are but partially described in this treatise; the great intention of which is, to make the elevations and depressions of the poles of a terrestrial globe to represent <hi>all</hi> the situations the earth is into the sun, for every day or hour through the year. The globes of <hi>Mr. Adams</hi> are the most favourable for the above mode of rectification of any plates we have at present; and to make a quiescent globe to represent all the positions of one revolving round the sun, turning on an inclined axis, and keeping that axis altogether parallel to itself, his globes are better adapted than any, I believe, in being."</p>

The earth, by it's diurnal revolution on it's axis, is carried round from west to east. To represent this real motion of the earth, and to solve problems agreeable thereto, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that the globe, in the solution of every problem, should be moved from <hi>west to east;</hi> and for this purpose, that the divisions on the large brass circle should be on that side which looks westward.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Rev. Mr. Hutchin's New Treatise on the Globes.</note>Now this is the case in my father's mode of mounting the globes, and the tutor can thereby explain with ease the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale of any problem to his pupil. But in the common mode of mounting, the globe must be moved from east to west, according to the Ptolemaic system; and consequently, if the tutor endeavours to shew how things obtain in nature, he must make his pupil unlearn in a degree what he has taught him, and by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction reverse the method he has instructed him to use; a practice that we hope will not be adopted by many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:036757_0016_100B041F11192AB0"/>
The celestial globe being intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the apparent motion of the heavens, should be moved, when used, from east to west.</p>
            <p>Of the phenomena to be explained by the terrestrial globe, the most material are those which relate to the changes in the seasons; all the problems connected with, or depending upon these phenomena, are explained in a clear, familiar, and natural manner, by the globe, when mounted in my father's mode; for on rectifying it for any particular day of the month, it immediately exhibits to the pupil the exact situation of the globe of the earth for that day; and while he is solving his problem, the reason and foundation of it presents itself to the eye and understanding.</p>
            <p>The globe may also be placed with ease in the position of a right sphere; a circumstance exceedingly useful, and which the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the globes did not admit of.</p>
            <p>By the application of a moveable meridian, and an artificial horizon connected with it, it is easy to explain why the sun, although he be always in one and the same place, appears to the inhabitants of the earth at different alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and in different azimuths, which cannot be so readily done with the common globes.</p>
            <p>On the celestial globe there is a moveable circle of declination, with an artificial sun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:036757_0017_100B0420A5E460E0"/>
The brass wires placed under the globes, serve to distinguish, in a natural and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner, twilight from total darkness, and the reason of the length of it's duration.</p>
            <p>The next point, wherein they materially differ from other globes, is in the hour circle. Now it must be confessed, that to every contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that has been used for this purpose there is some objection, and probably no mode can be hit upon that will be perfectly free from them. The method adopted by my father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me the least exceptionable, and to possess some advantages over every other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I am acquainted with. Agreeable to the opinion of the first astronomers, among others of M. de la Lande, he uses the equator for the hour circle, not only as the largest, but also as the most natural circle that could be employed for that purpose, and by which alone the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of problems could be obtained with the greatest accuracy. As on the terrestrial globe, the longitude of different places is reckoned on this circle; and on the celestial, the right ascension of the stars, &amp;c. it familiarizes the young pupil with them, and their reduction to time. This method does not in the least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the motion of the globe; but while it affords an equal facility of elevating either the north or south pole, it prevents the pupil from placing them in a wrong position; while the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036757_0018_100B04224D01F4C0"/>
horary wire secures the globe from falling out of the frame.</p>
            <p>Another circumstance peculiar to these globes, is the mode of fixing the compass. It is self-evident, that the tutor, who is willing to give correct ideas to his pupil, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make him keep the globes with the north pole directed towards the north pole of the heavens, and that, both in the solution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, and the explanation of phenomena. By means of the compass, the terrestrial globe is made to supply the purpose of a tellurian, when such an instrument is not at hand. I cannot terminate this paragraph, without testifying my disapprobation of a mode adopted by some, of making the globe turn round upon a pin in the pillar on which it is supported; a mode, that, while it can give little but relief to indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is less firm in it's construction, and tends to introduce much confusion in the mind of the pupil.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent that confusion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity which necessarily arises in a young mind, when names are made use of which do not properly characterize the subject, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found it necessary, with Mr. Hutchins, to term that broad wooden circle which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the globe, and on which the signs of the ecliptic and the days of the month are engraved, the <hi>broad paper circle,</hi> instead of horizon, by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036757_0019_100B0424A3A47748"/>
which it had been heretofore denominated. The propriety of this change will be evident to all those who consider, that this circle in some cases represents that which divides light from darkness, in others the horizon, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ecliptic. For similar reasons, he was induced to call the brazen circle, in which the globes are suspended, the <hi>strong brass cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, many operations may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by these globes, which cannot be solved by those mounted in the common manner; while all that they can solve may be performed by these, and that with a greater degree of perspicuity; and many problems may be performed by these at one view, which on the other globes require successive operations.</p>
            <p>But as, notwithstanding their superiority, the difference in price may make some persons prefer the old construction, it may be proper to inform them, that they may have my <hi>father's</hi> globes mounted in the <hi>old manner,</hi> at the usual prices.</p>

               <head>DEFINITIONS.</head>
               <p>BEFORE we begin to describe the globes, it will be proper to take some notice of the properties of a circle, of which a globe may be said to be constituted.</p>
               <p>A <hi>line</hi> is generated by the motion of a point.</p>
               <p>Let there be supposed two points, the one moveable, the other fixed.</p>
               <p>If the moveable point be made to move direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the fixed point, it will generate in it's motion a straight line.</p>
               <p>If a moveable point be carried round a fixed point, keeping always the same distance from it, it will generate a <hi>circle,</hi> or some part
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036757_0021_100B04281E0C65E8"/>
of a circle, and the fixed point will be the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of that circle.</p>
               <p>All strait lines going from the center to the circumference of a circle, are equal.</p>
               <p>Every strait line that passes through the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a globe, and is terminated at both ends by it's surface, is called a <hi>diameter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The extremities of a diameter are it's poles.</p>
               <p>If the circumference of a semicircle be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round it's diameter, as on an axis, it will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate a globe, or sphere.</p>
               <p>The center of the semicircle will be the center of the globe; and as all points of the generating semicircle are at an equal distance from it's center, so all the points of the surface of the generated sphere are at an equal distance from it's center.</p>

               <head>DESCRIPTION OF THE GLOBES.</head>
               <p>There are two artificial globes. On the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of one of them the heavens are delineated; this is called the <hi>celestial globe.</hi> The other, on which the surface of the earth is described, is called the <hi>terrestrial globe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fig. 2, plate XIII, represents the celestial, fig. 1, plate XIII, the terrestrial globe, as mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my father's manner.</p>

In using the celestial globe, we are to consider ourselves as at the <hi>center.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In using the terrestrial globe, we are to suppose ourselves on some point of it's <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The motion of the terrestrial globe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the <hi>real</hi> motion of the earth.</p>
               <p>The motion of the celestial globe represents the <hi>apparent</hi> motion of the heavens.</p>
               <p>The motion, therefore, of the celestial globe, is a motion from <hi>east to west.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the motion of the terrestrial globe is a motion from <hi>west to east.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the surface of each globe several cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are described, to every one of which may be applied what has been said of circles in page 205.</p>
               <p>The center of some of these circles is the same with the center of the globe; these are, by way of distinction, called <hi>great circles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these great circles, some are graduated.</p>
               <p>The graduated circles are divided into 360, or equal parts, 90 of which make a quarter of a circle, or a quadrant.</p>
               <p>Those circles, whose centers do not pass through the center of the globe, are called <hi>lesser circles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The globes are each of them suspended at the poles in a strong brass circles N Z AE S, and turn therein upon two iron pins, which are
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036757_0023_100B042CAB27CA60"/>
the axis of the globe; they have each a thin brass semicircle N H S, moveable about these poles, with a small thin circle H sliding thereon: it is quadrated each way to 90° from the equator to either pole.</p>
               <p>On the terrestrial globe this semicircle is a <hi>moveable meridian.</hi> It's small sliding circle, which is divided into a few of the points of the mariner's compass, is called a <hi>terrestrial</hi> or <hi>visible horizon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the celestial globe this semicircle is a <hi>moveable circle of declination,</hi> and it's small brass circle an artificial sun, or planet.</p>
               <p>Each globe has a brass wire circle, T W Y, placed at the limits of the crepusculum, or twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which, together with the globe, is mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a wooden frame. The upper part, B C, is covered with a broad paper circle, whose plane divides the globe into two hemispheres; and the whole is supported by a neat pillar and claw, with a magnetic needle in a compass-box, marked M.</p>

               <p>It contains four concentric circular spaces, the innermost of which is divided into 360,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036757_0024_100B042E371AD790"/>
and numbered into four quadrants, beginning at the east and west points, and proceeding each way to 90° at the north and south points: these are the four cardinal points of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. The second circular space contains, at equal distances, the thirty-two points of the mariner's compass. Another circular space is divided into twelve equal parts, representing the twelve signs of the zodiac; these are again sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into 30 degrees each, between which are engraved their names and characters. This space is connected with a fourth, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the calendar of the months and days; each day, on the eighteen-inch globes being divided into four parts, expressing the four cardinal points of the day, according to the Julian reckoning; by which means the sun's place is very nearly obtained for the common years after bissextile, and the intercalary day is inserted without confusion.</p>
               <p>In all positions of the celestial globe, this broad paper circle represents the plane of the horizon, and distinguishes the visible from the invisible part of the heavens; <hi>but in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial globe, it is applied to three different uses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To distinguish the points of the horizon. In this case it represents the <hi>rational</hi> horizon of any place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is used to represent the circle of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036757_0025_100B0430746573C0"/>
                  <hi>illumination,</hi> or that circle which separates day from night.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It occasionally represents the <hi>ecliptic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the strong Brass Circle</hi> N AE Z S. One side of this strong brass circle is graduated into four quadrants, each containing 90 degrees.</p>
               <p>The numbers on two of these quadrants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease from the equator towards the poles; the other two increase from the poles towards the equator.</p>
               <p>Two of the quadrants are numbered from the equator, to shew the distance of any point on the globe from the equator. The other two are numbered from the poles, for the more ready setting the globe to the latitude of any place.</p>
               <p>The strong brass circle of the celestial globe is called the meridian, because the centre of the sun comes directly under it at noon.</p>
               <p>But as there are other circle on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial globe, which are called meridians, we chuse to denominate this the <hi>strong brass circle,</hi> or <hi>meridian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The graduated side of the strong brass circle, that belongs to the terrestrial globe, should face the <hi>west.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The graduated side of the strong brazen meridian of the celestial globe, should face the <hi>east.</hi>

On the strong brass circle of the terrestrial globe, and at about 23½ degrees on each side of the north pole, the days of each month are laid down according to the declination of the sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Horary Circles, and their Indices.</hi> When the globes are mounted in my father's manner, we use the equator as the hour circle; because it is not only the most natural, but also the largest circle that can be applied for that purpose.</p>
               <p>To make this circle answer the purpose, a semi-circular wire is placed over it, carrying two indices, one on the east, the other on the west side of the strong brass circle.</p>
               <p>As the equator is divided into 360°, or 24 hours, the time of one entire revolution of the earth or heavens, the indices will shew in what space of time any part of such revolution is made among the hours which are graduated below the degrees of the equator on either globe.</p>
               <p>As the motion of the terrestrial globe is from west to east, the horary numbers increase according to the direction of that motion: on the celestial globe they increase from the east to the west.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Quadrant of Altitude,</hi> Z A. This is a thin, narrow, flexible slip of brass, that will bend to the surface of the globe; it has a nut,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036757_0027_100B04355F754C88"/>
with a fiducial line upon it, which may be readily applied to the divisions on the strong brass meridian of either globe. One edge of the quadrant is divided into 90 degrees, and the divisions are continued to 18 degrees below the horizon.</p>

               <head>OF SOME OF THE CIRCLES THAT ARE DESCRIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED UPON THE SURFACE OF EACH GLOBE.</head>
               <p>We may suppose as many circles to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on the surface of the earth as we please, and conceive them to be extended to the sphere of the heavens, marking thereon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric circles: for as we are obliged, in order to distinguish one place from another, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate names to them, so are we obliged to use different circles on the globes, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the parts, and their several relations to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Equator, or Equinoctial.</hi> This circle goes round the globe exactly in the middle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two poles, from which it always keeps at the same distance; or in other words, it is every where 90 degrees distant from each pole, and is therefore a boundary, separating the northern from the southern hemisphere; hence it is frequently called <hi>the line</hi> by sailors, and when they sail over it they are said to cross the line.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:036757_0028_100B0436ECB55BB8"/>
It is that circle in the heavens in which the sun appears to move on those two days, the one in the spring, the other in the autumn, when the days and nights are of an equal length all over the world; and hence on the celestial globe it is generally called the <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is graduated into 360 degrees. Upon the terrestrial globe the numbers increase from the meridian of London westward, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed quite round to 360. They are also num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered from the same meridian eastward, by an upper row of figures, to accommodate those who use the English tables of latitude and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude.</p>
               <p>On the celestial globe, the equatorial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are numbered from the first point of Aries eastward, to 360 degrees.</p>
               <p>Under the degrees on either globe is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated a circle of hours and minutes. On the celestial globe the hours increase eastward, from Aries to XII at Libra, where they begin again in the same direction, and proceed to XII at Aries. But on the terrestrial globe, the horary numbers increase by twice twelve hours westward from the meridian of London to the same again.</p>
               <p>In turning the globe about, the equator keeps always under one point of the strong
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036757_0029_100B04387B26A788"/>
brass meridian, from which point the degrees on the said circle are numbered both ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Ecliptic.</hi> The graduated circle, which crosses the equator obliquely, forming with it an angle of about 23½ degrees, is called the ecliptic.</p>
               <p>This circle is divided into twelve equal parts, each of which contains thirty degrees. The beginning of each of these thirty degrees is marked with the characters of the twelve signs of the zodiac.</p>
               <p>The sun appears always in this circle; he advances therein every day nearly a degree, and goes through it exactly in a year.</p>
               <p>The points where this circle crosses the equator are called the <hi>equinoctial points.</hi> The one is at the beginning of Aries, the other at the beginning of Libra.</p>
               <p>The commencement of Cancer and Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn are called the <hi>solstitial points.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The twelve signs, and their degrees, are laid down on the terrestrial globe; but upon the celestial globe, the days of each month are graduated just under the ecliptic.</p>
               <p>The ecliptic belongs principally to the celes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial globe.</p>

            <head>PART III. THE USE OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE, MOUNTED IN THE BEST MANNER.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <head>OF LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE, OF TERRESTRIAL MERIDIANS, AND THE PROBLEMS RELATING TO LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE.</head>
               <p>MERIDIANS are circular lines, going over the earth's surface, from one pole to the other, and crossing the equator at right angles.</p>
               <p>Whatever places these circular lines pass through, in going from pole to pole, they are the meridians of those places.</p>
               <p>There are no places upon the surface of the earth, through which meridians may not be conceived to pass. Every place, therefore, is supposed to have meridian line passing over it's Zenith from north to south, and going through the poles of the world.</p>
               <p>Thus the meridian of Paris is one meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; the meridian of London is another. This variety of meridians of satisfactorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036757_0031_100B043CC7BDFAB8"/>
on the globe, by the moveable meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, which may be set to every individual point of the equator, and put directly over any particular place.</p>
               <p>Whensoever we move towards the east or west, we change our meridian; but we do not change our meridian if we move directly to the north or south.</p>
               <p>The moveable meridian shews that the poles of the earth divide every meridian into two semicircles, one of which passes through the place whose meridian it is, the other through a point on the earth, opposite to that place.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that writers in geography and astronomy generally mean by the <hi>meridian</hi> of any place the <hi>semicircle</hi> which passes through that place; these, therefore, may be called the geographical meridians.</p>
               <p>All places lying under the same semicircle, are said to have the same meridian; and the semicircle opposite to it is called the opposite meridian, or sometimes the opposite part of the meridian.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing definitions, it is clear that the meridian of any place is immoveably fixed to that place, and is carried round alone with it by the rotation of the globe.</p>
               <p>When the meridian of any place is by the revolution of the earth brought to point at the sun, it is noon, or mid-day, at that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:036757_0032_100B043F206939D8"/>
The plane of the meridian of any place may be imagined to be extended to the sphere of the fixed stars.</p>
               <p>When, by the motion of the earth, the plane of a meridian comes to any point in the heavens, as the sun, moon, &amp;c. that point, &amp;c. is then said to come to the meridian. It is in this sense that we generally use the expression of the sun or stars coming to, or passing over the meridian.</p>
               <p>The time which elapses between the noon of any one day in a given place, and the noon of the day following in the same place, is called <hi>a natural day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All places which lie under the same meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, have their noon, and every other hour of the natural day, at the same time. Thus when it is one in the afternoon at London, it is also one in the afternoon to every place under the meridian of London.</p>
               <p>In order to ascertain the situation of any point, there must first be a settle part of the earth's surface, from which to measure; and as the point to be ascertained may lie in any part of the earth's surface, and as this surface is spherical, the place from whence we measure must be a circle. It would be necessary, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to establish two such circles; one to know how far any place may be east or west of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the second to know it's distance north or
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036757_0033_100B04413B98FD10"/>
south of the given point, and thus determine it's precise situation.</p>
               <p>Hence it has been customary for geographers to fix upon the meridian of some remarkable place, <hi>as a first meridian, or standard;</hi> and to reckon the distance of any place to the east or west, or it's longitude, by it's distance from the first meridian. On English globes, this first meridian is made to pass through London. The position of this first meridian is arbitrary, because on a globe, properly speaking, there is neither beginning nor end. The first person (whose works at least are come down to us) who computed the distance of places by longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and latitudes was Ptolemy, about the year after Christ 140.</p>
               <p>The <hi>longitude of any place</hi> is it's distance from the first meridian, measured by degrees on the equator.</p>
               <p>To find the longitude of a place, is to find what degree on the equator the meridian of that place crosses.</p>
               <p>All places that lie under the same meridian, are said to have the same longitude; all places that lie under different meridians, are said to have different longitudes; this difference may be east or west, and consequently the difference of longitude between any two places, is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their meridians from each other measur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the equator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:036757_0034_100B0442CEF792D0"/>
Thus if the meridian of any place cuts the equator in a point, which is fifteen degrees east from that point, where the meridian of London cuts the equator, that place is said to differ from London in longitude 15 degrees eastward.</p>
               <p>Upon the terrestrial globe there are 24 meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, dividing the equator into 24 equal parts, which are the hour circles of the places through which they pass.</p>
               <p>The distance of these meridians from each other is 15 degrees, or the 24th part of 360 degrees; thus 15 degrees is equal to one hour.</p>
               <p>By the rotation of the earth, the plane of every meridian points at the sun, one hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that meridian which is next to it eastward; and thus they successively point at the sun every hour, so that the planes of the 24 meridian semicircles being extended, pass through the sun in a natural day.</p>
               <p>To illustrate this, suppose the plane of the strong brass meridian to coincide with the sun, bring London to this meridian, and then move the globe round, and you will find these 24 meridians successively pass under the strong brass meridian, at one hour's distance from each other; till in 24 hours the earth will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the same situation, and the meridian of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036757_0035_100B04452CE4D7F8"/>
London will again coincide with the strong brass circle.</p>
               <p>By passing the globe round, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going article, it will be evident to the pupil, that if one of these meridians, 15 degrees east of London, comes to the strong brass meridian, or points at the sun one hour sooner than the meridian of London, a meridian that is 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees east comes two hours sooner, and so on; and consequently they will have noon, and every other hour, so much sooner than at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: while those, whose meridian is 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees westward from London, will have noon and every other hour of the day, one hour later than at London, and so on, in proportion to the difference of longitude. These definitions being well understood, the pupil will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not only to solve, but see the rationale of the following problems.</p>
               <div n="1" type="problem">
                  <head>PROBLEM I.</head>
                  <head>To find the Longitude of any place on the globe.</head>
                  <p>The reader will find no difficulty in solving this problem, if he recollects the definition we have given of the word longitude, namely, that it is the distance of any place from the first meridian measured on the equator. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either set the moveable meridian to the place, or bring the place under the strong brass
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036757_0036_100B04478F924C30"/>
meridian, and that degree of the equator, which is cut by either of the brazen meridians, is the longitude in degrees and minutes, or the hour and minute of its longitude, expressed in time.</p>
                  <p>As the given place may lie either east or west of the first meridian, the longitude may be expressed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>It appears most natural to reckon the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude always westward from the first meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; but it is customary to reckon one half round the globe eastward, the other half west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the first meridian. To accommodate those who may prefer either of these plans, there are two sets of numbers on our globes: the numbers nearest the equator increase west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, from the meridian of London quite round the globe to 360°, over which another set of numbers is engraved, which increase the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; so that the longitude may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned upon the equator, either east or west.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> Bring Boston, in New England, to the graduated edge of either the strong brass, or of the moveable meridian, and you will find it's longitude in degrees to be 70½, or 4 h. 42 min. in time; Rome 12½ degrees east, or 50 min. in time; Charles-Town, North-America, is 79 deg. 50 min. west.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="problem">
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:036757_0037_100B0449235F7738"/>
                  <head>PROBLEM II.</head>
                  <head>To find the difference of longitude between any two places.</head>
                  <p>If the pupil understands what is meant by the difference of longitude, the rule for the solution of this problem will naturally occur to his mind. Now the difference of longitude between any two places is the quantity of an angle (at the pole) made by the meridians of those places measured on the equator. To express this angle upon the globe, bring the moveable meridian to one of the places, and the other place under the strong brass circle, and the required angle is contained between these two meridians, the measure or quantity of which is to be counted on the equator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> I find the longitude of Rome to be 12½ east, that of Constantinople to be 29; the difference is 17½ degrees. Again, I find Jerusalem has 35 deg. 25 min. east longitude from London; and Pekin, in China, 116 deg. 52 min. east longitude; the difference is 81 deg. 27 min.; that is, Pekin is 81 deg. 27 min. east longitude from Jerusalem; or Jerusalem is 81 deg. 27 min. west longitude from Pekin.</p>
                  <p>If one place is east, and the other west of the first meridian, either find the longitude of both places westward, by that set of numbers
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036757_0038_100B044B86912AE8"/>
which increase westward from the meridian of London of 360 deg. and the difference between the number thus found is the answer to the question:—or, add the east and west longitudes, and the sum is the difference of longitude; thus the longitude of Rome is 12 deg. 30 min. east, of Charles-Town 79 deg. 50 min. west; their sum, 91 deg. 20 min. is the difference re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>It may be proper to observe here, that <hi>the difference in time is the same with the difference of longitude,</hi> consequently that some of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing problems are only particular cases of this problem, or readier modes of computing this difference.</p>

                  <p>At the diurnal motion of the earth is from <hi>west to east,</hi> it is plain that all places which are to the east of any meridian, must necessarily pass by the sun before a meridian which is to the west can arrive at it.</p>

                  <p>When it is 4 h. 50 min. in the afternoon at Paris, it is noon at New Britain, New England, St. Domingo, Terra Firma, Peru, Chili, and Terra del Fuego.</p>

               <head>OF LATITUDE.</head>
               <p>I have already observed, that the equator divides the globe into two hemispheres, the northern and the southern.</p>
               <p>The latitude of a place is it's distance from the equator towards the north or south pole, measured by degrees upon the meridian of the place.</p>
               <p>All places, therefore, that lie under the equator, are said to have <hi>no latitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All other places upon the earth are said to be in north or south latitude, as they are situated on the north or south side of the equator; and the latitude of any place will be greater or less, according as it is further from, or nearer to the equator.</p>
               <p>Lines, which keep always at the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from each other, are called <hi>parallels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a circle, or circular line, be conceived keeping at the same distance from the equator, it will be a parallel to the equator.</p>
               <p>Circles of this kind are commonly drawn on the terrestrial globe, on both sides of the equator.</p>
               <p>A circle of this kind, at 10 degrees from the equator, is called parallel of 10 degrees.</p>
               <p>When any such parallel passes through two
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036757_0042_100B04530E4A5728"/>
places on the globe's surface, those two places have the same latitude.</p>
               <p>Hence parallel to the equator are called <hi>parallels of latitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are four principal lesser circles paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the equator, which divide the globe into five unequal parts, called <hi>zones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The circle on the north side of the equator is called the <hi>tropic of Cancer;</hi> it just touches the north part of the ecliptic, and shews the path the sun appears to describe, the longest day in summer.</p>
               <p>That which is on the south side of the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is called the <hi>tropic of Capricorn;</hi> it just touches the south part of the ecliptic, and shews the path the sun appears to describe, the shortest day in winter.</p>
               <p>The space between these two tropics, which contains about 47 degrees, was called by the ancients the <hi>torrid zone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two polar circles are placed at the same distance from the poles, that the two tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics are from the equator.</p>
               <p>One of these is called the <hi>northern,</hi> the other the <hi>southern polar circle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These include 23½ degrees on each side of their respective poles, and consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 47 degrees, equal to the number of degrees included between the tropics</p>
               <p>The space contained within the northern
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036757_0043_100B0455C757BAF0"/>

               </p>
               <p>The spaces between either polar circle, and its nearest tropic, which contain about 43 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees each, were called by the ancients the <hi>two temperate zones.</hi>

"For what can be more interesting to a person in a long voyage, than to be able to tell upon what part of the globe he is, to know how far he has travelled, what distance he has to go, and how he must direct his course to arrive at the place he designs to visit? These important particulars are all determined by knowing the latitude and longitude of the place under consideration. When the discovery of the compass invited the voyager to quit his native shore, and venture himself upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ocean, that knowledge, which before he deemed of no importance, now became a matter of absolute necessity. Floating in a frail vessel, upon an uncertain abyss, he has consigned himself to the mercy of the winds and waves, and knows not where he is."<note n="*" place="bottom">Bonnycastle's Astronomy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The following instance will prove of what use it is to know the longitude of places at sea. The editor of Lord Anson's voyage, speaking of the island of Juan Fernandez, adds, "The uncertainty we were in of it's position, and our standing in for the main on the 28th of May, in order to secure a sufficient easting, when we were indeed extremely near it, cost us the lives of between 70 and 80 of our men, by our longer continuance at sea; from which fatal accident we might have been exempted, had
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036757_0047_100B045D4D72BBD8"/>
we been furnished with such an account of it's situation, as we could fully have depended on."</p>
               <p>The latitude of a place the sailor can easily discover; but the longitude is a subject of the utmost difficulty, for the discovery of which many methods have been devised. It is indeed of so great consequence, that the Parliament of Great Britain proposed a reward of 10, 000 <hi>l.</hi> if it extended only to 1 degree of a great circle, or 60 geographical miles; 15, 000 <hi>l.</hi> if found to 40 such miles; and 20, 000<hi>l.</hi> to the person that can find it within 30 minutes of a great circle, or 30 geographical miles.</p>
               <p>As I cannot enter fully into this subject in these essays, it will, I hope, be deemed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if I give such an account as will ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the reader to form a general idea of the solution of this important problem.</p>
               <p>From what has been seen in the preceding pages, it is evident that 15 degrees in longitude answer to one hour in time, and consequently that the longitude of any place would be known, if we knew their difference in time; or in other words, how much sooner the sun, &amp;c. arrives at the meridian of one place, than that of another. The hours and degrees being in this respect commensurate, it is as proper to express the distance of any place in time as in degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:036757_0048_100B045ED7CB0C98"/>
Now it is clear, that this difference in time would be easily ascertained by the observation of any instantaneous appearance in the heavens, at two distant places; for the difference in time at which the same phenomenon is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will be the distance of the two places from each other in longitude. On this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, most of the methods in general use are founded.</p>
               <p>Thus if a clock, or watch, was so contrived, as to go uniformly in all seasons, and in all places; such a watch being regulated to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don time, would always shew the time of the day at London; then the time of the day under any other meridian being found, the difference between that time, and the corresponding Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don time, would give the difference in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>For supposing any person possessed of one of these time-pieces, to set out on a journey from London, if his time-piece be accurately adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherever he is, he will always know the hour at London exactly; and when he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far either eastward or westward, that a difference is perceived betwixt the hour shewn by his time-piece, and those of the clocks and watches at the places to which he goes, the distance of those places from London in longitude will be known. But to whatever degree of perfection such movements may be
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:036757_0049_100B0460CA45B320"/>
made, yet as every mechanical instrument is liable to be injured by various accidents, other methods are obliged to be used, as the eclipses of the sun and moon, or of Jupiter's satellites. Thus supposing the moment of the beginning of an eclipse was at ten o'clock at night at London, and by accounts from two observers in two other places, it appears that it began with one of them at nine o'clock, and with the other at midnight; it is plain, that the place where it began at nine is one hour, or 15 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees east in longitude from London; the other place where it began at midnight, is 30 degrees distant in west longitude from London. Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the sun and moon do not, however, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen often enough to answer the purposes of navigation; and the motion of a ship at sea prevents the observations of those of Jupiter's satellites.</p>
               <p>If the place of any celestial body be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, for example, as in an almanack, for every day or to parts of days, to any given meridian, and the place of this celestial body can be found by observation at sea, the difference of time between the time of observation and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted time, will be the difference of longitude in time. The moon is found to be the most proper celestial object, and the observation of her appulses to any fixed star is reckoned one of the best methods for resolving this difficult problem.</p>

               <head>LENGTH OF THE DEGREES OF LONGITUDE.</head>
               <p>Supposing the earth to be a perfect globe, the length of a degree upon the meridian has been estimated to be 69,1 miles; but as the earth is an oblate spheroid, the length of a degree on the equator will be somewhat greater.</p>
               <p>Whether the earth be considered as a sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roid or a globe, all the meridians intersect one another at the poles. Therefore, the number of miles in a degree must always decrease as you go north or south from the equator. This is evident by inspection of a globe, where the parallels of latitude are found to be smaller in proportion as they are nearer the pole. Hence it is that a degree of longitude is no where the same, but upon the same parallel; and that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of longitude is equal to a degree of latitude only upon the equator.</p>
               <p>The following <hi>table</hi> shews how many geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical miles, and decimal parts of a mile, would be contained in a degree of longitude, at each degree of latitude from the equator to the poles, if the earth was a perfect sphere, and the circumference of it's equinoctial line 360 degrees, and each degrees 60 geographical miles.</p>
               <p>This table enables us to determine the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city with which places upon the globe revolve
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036757_0051_100B0465A5CF4A70"/>
eastward; for the velocity is different, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the distance of the places from the equator, being swiftest as passing through a greater space, and so by degrees slower towards the pole, as passing through a less space in the same time. Now as every part of the earth is moved through the space of it's circumference, or 360 degrees, in 24 hours; the space des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in one hour is found by dividing 360 by 24, which gives in the quotient 15 degrees; and so many degrees does every place on the earth move in an hour. The number of miles contained in so many degrees in any latitude, is readily found from the table.</p>
               <p>Thus under the equator places revolve at the rate of more than 1000 miles in an hour; at London, at the rate of about 640 miles in an hour.</p>

               <p>Another circumstance which arises from this difference of meridians in time, must detain us a little before we quit this subject. For from this difference it follows, that if a ship sails round the world, always directing her course eastward, she will at her return home find she has gained one whole day of those that stayed at home; that is, if they reckon it May 1, the ship's company will reckon it May 2; if westward, a day less, or April 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:036757_0053_100B04692EBE6670"/>
This circumstance has been taken notice of by navigators. "It was during our stay at Mindanao, (says Capt. Dampier) that we were first made sensible of the change of time in the course of our voyage: for having travelled so far westward, keeping the same course with the sun, we consequently have gained some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing insensibly in the length of the particular days, but have lost in the tale the bulk or number of the days or hours.</p>
               <p>"According to the different longitudes of England and Mindanao, this isle being about 210 degrees west from the Lizard, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of time at our arrival at Mindanao ought to have been about fourteen hours; and so much we should have anticipated our reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having gained it by bearing the sun com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>"Now the natural day in every place must be consonant to itself; but going about with, or against the sun's course, will of necessity make a difference in the calculation of the civil day, between any two places. Accordingly, at Mindanao, and other places in the East Indies, we found both natives and Europeans reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a day before us. For the Europeans coming eastward, by the Cape of Good Hope, in a course contrary to the sun and us, wherever we met, were a full day before us in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:036757_0054_100B046AE8F91320"/>
"So among the Indian Mahometans, their Friay was Thursday with us; though it was Friday also with those that came eastward from Europe.</p>
               <p>"Yet at the Ladrone islands we found the Spaniards of Guam keeping the same computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ourselves; the reason of which I take to be, that they settled that colony by a course westward from Spain; the Spaniards going first to America, and thence to the Ladrone islands.</p>
               <p>It is clear, from what has been said in the first part of this article, concerning both lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and longitude, that if a person travel ever so far directly towards east or west, his latitude would be always the same, though his longitude would be continually changing.</p>
               <p>But if he went directly north or south, his longitude would continue the same, but his latitude would be perpetually varying.</p>
               <p>If he went obliquely, he would change both his latitude and longitude.</p>
               <p>The longitude and latitude of places give only their relative distances on the globe; to discover, therefore, their real distance, we have recourse to the following problem.</p>
               <div n="10" type="problem">
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:036757_0055_100B046CE3B576D8"/>
                  <head>PROBLEM X.</head>
                  <head>Any place being given, to find the distance of that place from another, in a great circle of the earth.</head>
                  <p>I shall divide this problem into three cases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Case</hi> 1. If the places lie under the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian. Bring them up to the meridian, and mark the number of degrees intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Multiply the number of degrees thus found by 60, and they will give the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of geographical miles between the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if we would have the number of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish miles, the degrees before found must be multiplied by 69½.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Case</hi> 2. If the places lie under the equator. Find their difference of longitude in degrees, and multiply, as in the preceeding case, by 60 or 69½.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Case</hi> 3. If the places lie neither under the same meridian, nor under the equator. Then lay the quadrant of altitude over the two places, and mark the number of degrees intercepted between them. These degrees multiplied as above mentioned, will give the required dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="problem">
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:036757_0056_100B046F78E863D0"/>
                  <head>PROBLEM XI.</head>
                  <head>To find the angle of position of places.</head>
                  <p>The angle of position is that formed between the meridian of one of the places, and a great circle passing through the other place.</p>
                  <p>Rectify the globe to the latitude and zenith of one of the places, bring that place to the strong brass meridian, set the graduated edge of the quadrant to the other place, and the number of degrees contained between it and the strong brass meridian, is the measure of the angle sought. Thus,</p>
                  <p>The angle of position between the meridian of Cape Clear, in Ireland, and St. Augustine, in Florida, is about 82 degrees south westerly; but the angle of position between St. Augustine and Cape Clear, is only about 46 degrees north easterly.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is plain, that the line of position, or azimuth, is not the same from either place to the other, as the romb-lines are.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="12" type="problem">
                  <head>PROBLEM XII.</head>
                  <head>To find the bearing of one place from another.</head>
                  <p>The bearing of one sea-port from another is determined by a kind of spiral, called a romb-line, passing from one to the other, so as
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:036757_0057_100B04711820BA30"/>
to make equal angles with all the meridians it passes by; therefore, if both places are situated on the same parallel of latitude, their bearing is either east or west from each other; if they are upon the same meridian, they bear north and south from one another; if they lie upon a romb-line, their bearing is the same with it; if they do not, observe to which romb-line the two places are nearest parallel, and that will shew the bearing sought.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> Thus the bearing of the Lizard point from the island of Bermudas is nearly E. N. E.; and that of Bermudas from the Lizard is W. S. W. both nearly upon the same romb-line, but in contrary directions.</p>

               <head>OF THE TWILIGHT.</head>
               <p>That light which we have from the sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it rises, and after it sets, is called the <hi>twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The morning twilight, or day break, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences when the sun comes within eighteen degrees of the horizon, and continues till sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising. The evening twilight begins at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting, and continues till it is eighteen degrees below the horizon.</p>
               <p>To illustrate the causes of the various length of twilight in different places, a wire circle is fixed eighteen degrees below the surface of the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036757_0058_100B047325135540"/>
broad paper circle; so that all those places which are above the wire circle will have twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, but it will be dark to all those places below it.</p>
               <p>I have already observed, that it is owing to the atmosphere that we are favoured with the light of the sun before he is above, and after he is below, our horizon. Hence, though after sun-setting we receive no direct light from the sun, yet we enjoy his reflected light for some time; so that the darkness of the night does not come on suddenly, but by degrees.</p>
               <p>In a right position of the sphere the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights are quickly over, because the sun rises and sets nearly in a perpendicular; but in an oblique sphere they last longer, the sun rising and setting obliquely. The greater the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the place, the longer is the duration of the twilight; so that all those who are in 49 degrees of latitude have in the summer, near the solstice, their atmosphere enlightened the whole night, the twilight lasting till sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising.</p>
               <p>In a parallel sphere, the twilight lasts for several months; so that the inhabitants of this position have either direct or reflex light of the sun nearly all the year, as will plainly appear by the globe.</p>

               <head>OF THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH, AND THE PROBLEMS DEPENDING ON THAT MOTION.</head>
               <p>As the daily motion of the earth about it's axis, and the phenomena dependent on it, are some of the most essential points which a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner ought to have in view, we shall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to explain them by the globes; and here I think the advantage of globes mounted in my father's manner, over those generally used, will be very evident.</p>
               <p>I have already observed, that in globes mounted in our manner, the motion of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial globe about it's axis represents the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion of the earth, and that the horary index will point out upon the equator the 24 hours of one diurnal rotation, or any part of that time.</p>
               <p>I shall now consider <hi>the broad paper circle as the plane which distinguishes light from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> that is, the enlightened half of the earth's surface, from that which is not enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
               <p>For when the sun shines upon a globe, he shines only upon one half of it; that is, one half of the globe's surface is enlightened by him, the other not.</p>
               <p>That the enlightened half may be that half
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036757_0060_100B04772552CB58"/>
which is above the broad paper circle, we must imagine the sun to be in our <hi>zenith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or let a sun be painted on the cieling over the terrestrial globe, the diameter of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equal to the diameter of the globe.</p>
               <p>Then all those places that are above the broad paper circle will be in the sun's light; that is, it will be <hi>day</hi> in all those places.</p>
               <p>And all places that are below this circle, will be out of the sun's light; that is, in all those places it will be <hi>night</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When any place on the earth's surface comes to the edge of the broad paper circle, passing out of the shade into the light, the sun will appear <hi>rising</hi> at that place.</p>
               <p>And when a place is at the edge of the broad paper circle, going out of the light into the shade, the sun will appear at that place to be <hi>setting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we view the globe in this position, we at once see the situation of all places in the illuminated hemisphere, whose inhabitants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the light of the day. One edge of the broad paper circle shews at what place the sun appears rising at the <hi>same</hi> time; and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site edge shews at what places the sun is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the same time.</p>
               <p>The horary index shews how long a place is moving from one edge to the other; that is, how long the day or night is at that place;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036757_0061_100B047991AAA8C8"/>
and, consequently, when the globe is thus situated, you readily discover the time of the sun's rising and setting on any given day, in any given place.</p>

               <head>TO RECTIFY THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE.</head>
               <p>To rectify the terrestrial globe, is to place it in the same position in which our earth stands to the sun, at all or at any given times.</p>
               <p>That half of the earth's surface which is enlightened by the sun is not always the same; it differs according as the sun's declination dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
               <p>To rectify, then, the terrestrial globe, is to bring it into such a position, as that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened half of the earth's surface may be all above the broad paper circle.</p>
               <p>On the back side of the strong brass meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and on each side of the north pole, the months and days of the month are graduated in two concentric spaces, agreeable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the sun.</p>
               <p>Bring the day of the month that is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated on the back side of the strong brass meridian, to coincide with the broad paper circle, and the globe is rectified.</p>
               <p>Thus set the first of May to coincide with the broad paper circle, and that half of the earth's surface which is enlightened at any
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036757_0062_100B047B226AEDA8"/>
time upon that day, will be all at once above the said circle.</p>
               <p>If the horary index be set to XII, when any particular place is brought under the strong brass meridian, it will shew the precise time of sun-rising and sun-setting at that place, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as that place is brought to the eastern or western edge of the broad paper circle.</p>
               <p>It will also shew how long any place is in moving from the east to the west side of the illuminated disk, and thence the length of the day and night.</p>
               <p>It will also point out the length of the twilight, by shewing the time in which the place is passing from the twilight circle to the edge of the broad paper circle on the western side; or from the edge of this circle on the eastern side, to the twilight wire, and thus determine the length of the whole artificial day.</p>
               <p>N. B. The twilight wire is placed at 18 degrees from the broad paper circle.</p>
               <p>I shall now proceed to exemplify upon the globes these particulars, at three different sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the summer solstice, the winter solstice, and the time or times of the equinoxes.</p>

                  <head>PROBLEM XIII.</head>
                  <head>To place the globe in the same situation, with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the sun, as our earth is in at the time of the SUMMER SOLSTICE.</head>
                  <p>Rectify the globe to the extremity of the divisions for the month of June, or 23½ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees north declination; that is, bring these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions on the strong brass meridian to coincide with the plane of the broad paper circle.</p>
                  <p>Then that part of the earth's surface, which is within the northern polar circle, will be above the broad paper circle, and will be in the light, and the inhabitants thereof will have no night.</p>
                  <p>But all that space which is contained within the southern polar circle, will continue in the shade; that is, it will there be continual night.</p>
                  <p>In this position of the globe, the pupil will observe how much the diurnal arches of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allels of latitude decrease, as they are more and more distant from the elevated pole.</p>
                  <p>If any place be brought under the strong brass meridian, and the horary index is set to that XII which is most elevated, and the place be afterwards brought to the western side of the broad paper circle, the hour index will shew the time of sun-rising; and when the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036757_0064_100B047FA472EEC0"/>
place is moved to the eastern edge, the index points to the time of sun-setting.</p>
                  <p>The length of the day is obtained by the time shewn by the horary index, while the globe moves from the west to the east side of the broad paper circle.</p>
                  <p>Thus it will be found, that at London the sun rises about 15 minutes before IV in the morning, and sets about 15 minutes VIII at night.</p>
                  <p>At the following places it will be nearly at the times expressed in the table.</p>

                  <head>To place the globe in the situation of the earth, at the times of the EQUINOX.</head>
                  <p>The sun has no declination at the times of the equinox, consequently there must be no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the pole.</p>
                  <p>Bring the day of the month when the sun enters the first point of Aries, or day of the month when the sun enters the first point of Libra, to the plane of the broad paper circle; then the two poles of the globe will be in that plane also, and the globe will be in the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is called a <hi>right sphere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is a right sphere when the two poles are in the plane of the broad paper circle, because then all those circles which are parallel to the equator will be at right angles to that plane.</p>
                  <p>If the globe be now turned from west to east, it will plainly appear, that all places upon it's surface are twelve hours above the broad paper circle, and twelve hours below it; that is, the days are twelve hours long all over the earth, and the nights are equal to the days, whence these times are called the times of equinox.</p>
                  <p>Two of these occur in every year; the first
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036757_0067_100B0485F551D378"/>
is the autumnal, the second the vernal equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox.</p>
                  <p>At these seasons the sun appears to rise at the same time to all places that are on the same meridian. The sun sets also at the same time in all those places.</p>
                  <p>Thus if London and Mundford, on the gold coast, be brought to the strong brass meridian, the graduated side of which is in this case the horary index, and they be afterwards carried to the western edge of the broad paper circle, the index will shew that the sun rises at VI at both places; when they are carried to the eastern edge, the index points to VI for the time of sun-setting.</p>
                  <p>N. B. If London be not the given place, the hour index is to be set to the most elevated XII, while the place is under the graduated edge of the strong brass meridian.</p>
                  <p>The following circumstances, which usually attend the four cardinal divisions of the year, cannot be better introduced than at this place. At the time of the equinoxes, when the sun passes from one hemisphere into the other, there is almost constantly some disturbance in the weather; the winds are then generally higher: at the vernal equinox they are for the most part easterly, cold, dry, and searching. The solstitial point of the summer is often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by violent rains, and what we call
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036757_0068_100B0487E54872E8"/>
a midsummer stood. The winter being less rainy than the summer, nothing particular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens at the winter solstice, but that the frosts commonly set in more severely, with some quantity of snow upon the ground.</p>

               <p>The brass circle, which may be slipped from pole to pole on the moveable meridian, has been already described. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it is divided into eight parts, to which are affixed the initial letters of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner's compass.</p>
               <p>When the center of it is set to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place, the situation of any other place is seen, with respect to that place; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be east, west, north, or south of it.</p>
               <p>It will therefore represent the horizon of that place.</p>
               <p>We shall here use this artificial horizon, to shew why the sun, although he be always in one and the same place, appears to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth at different altitudes, and in different azimuths.</p>

                  <head>To exemplify the sun's altitude, as observed with an artificial horizon.</head>
                  <p>The altitude of the sun is greater or less, according as the line which goes from us to the sun is nearer to, or farther off from our hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
                  <p>Let the moveable circle be applied to any place, as London, then will the horizon of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be thereby represented.</p>
                  <p>The sun is supposed, as before, to be in the zenith, that is, directly over the terrestrial globe.</p>
                  <p>If then from London a line go vertically up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the sun will be seen at London in that line.</p>
                  <p>At sun-rising, when London is brought to the west edge of the broad paper circle, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed line will be parallel to the artificial hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the sun will then be seen in the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
                  <p>As the globe is gradually turned from the west towards the east, the horizon will recede from that line which goes from London verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally upwards; so that the line in which the sun is seen gets further and further from the horizon; that is, the sun's altitude increases gradually.</p>

When the horizon, and the line which goes from London vertically upwards, are arrived at the strong brass meridian, the sun is then at his greatest or meridian altitude for that day, and the line and horizon are at the largest angle they can make with each other.</p>
                  <p>After this, the motion of the globe being continued, the angle between the artificial hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the line which goes from London ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically upwards, continually decreases, until Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don arrives at the eastern edge of the broad pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per circle; it's horizon then becomes vertical again, and parallel to the line which goes verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally upwards. The sun will again appear in the horizon, and will set.</p>

                  <p>When London is at the graduated edge of the strong brass meridian, the line which goes vertically upwards makes an angle of about 15 degrees; this is the sun's meridian altitude at that season, to the inhabitants of London.</p>

                  <p>An <hi>azimuth</hi> of the sun is denominated from that point of the horizon, to which the sun, or a line going to the sun, is nearest.</p>
                  <p>Thus if the sun, or a line going to the sun, be nearest the south-east point of the horizon, which point is 45 degrees distant from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, the sun's azimuth is an azimuth of 45 degrees, and the sun will appear in the south-east.</p>
                  <p>Imagine the sun, as we have done before, to be placed directly over the globe.</p>
                  <p>In which case, a line going the sun from any place on the surface of the globe, will have a vertical direction, and will go from that place vertically upwards.</p>

If then we apply the artificial horizon to any place, the point of this horizon to which a vertical line is nearest, shews the sun's azimuth at that time.</p>
                  <p>It is observable, that the point of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon to which such a vertical line is nearest, will be at all times that point which is most elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>To exemplify this, let the globe be in the position of a right sphere, and let the artificial horizon be applied to London.</p>

                  <p>Turn the globe, till London comes to the eastern edge of the broad paper circle, then the western point of the artificial horizon will be most elevated, shewing that the sun sets due west.</p>
                  <p>Now place the globe in the position of an oblique sphere; and if London be brought to the eastern or western side of the broad paper circle, the vertical line will depart more or less from the east and west points, in which case the sun is said to have more or less <hi>ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>

the rising and setting of the sun in the longest day, in different places.</p>

                  <p>Elevate the north pole to 23° 28′, the sun's declination on the longest day; and turn the globe easterly till the intersection of the meridian with the equator that passes through Libra comes to the horizon, and the hour of VI will then be under the meridian, which in this problem is the hour index, because the sun sets this day at places on the equator as it does every day at VI o'clock. Now turn the globe easterly till the time under the meridian is 15 min. past VI. and you find that 8° 34′ of that graduated meridian is cut by the horizon; this is the beginning of the second climate; and the limits of all the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates may be determined, by bringing succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively the time equal to half the length of the longest day under the meridian, and observing the degree of the graduated meridian cut by the horizon.</p>

               <head>ZONES.</head>
               <p>Zones is another division of the earth's sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face used by the ancients: that part which the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036757_0077_100B049A2E74EDD8"/>
sun passes over in a year, comprehending 23½ degrees on each side the equator, was called by the ancients the torrid zone. The two frigid zones are contained between the polar circles. Between the torrid and the two frigid zones are contained the two temperate ones, each being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 43 degrees broad.</p>
               <p>The latitude of a place being the mark of it's position with respect to the sun, may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a general index to the temperature of the climate: it is, however, liable to very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; but to deny it absolutely, would be to deny that the sun is the source of light and heat below.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more hideous or mournful than the pictures which travellers present us of the polar regions. The seas, surrounding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hospitable coasts, are covered with islands of ice, that have been increasing for many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies: some of these islands are immersed six hundred feet under the surface of the sea, and yet often rear up also their icy heads more than one hundred feet above it's level, and are three or four miles in circumference. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account will give some idea of the scenery produced by arctic weather. At Smearing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough-Harbour, within fifteen degrees of the pole, the country is full of mountains, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices, and rocks; these are covered with ice and snow. In the vallies are hills of ice,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036757_0078_100B049C6CEF99E0"/>
which seem daily to accumulate. These hills assume many strange and fantastic appearances; some looking like churches or castles, ruins, ships in full sail, whales, monsters, and all the various forms that fill the universe. There are seven of these ice-hills, which are the highest in the country. When the air is clear, and the light shines full upon them, the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is inconceivably brilliant; the sun is reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them as from glass; sometimes they appear of a bright hue, like sapphire; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times variegated with all the glories of the pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic colours, exceeding, in the magnitude of lustre, and beauty of colour, the richest gems in the world, disposed in shapes wonderful to behold, dazzling the eye with the brilliancy of it's splendor. At Spitsbergen, within ten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the pole, the earth is locked up in ice till the middle of May; in the beginning of July the plants are in flower, and perfect their seeds in a month's time: for though the sun is much more oblique in the higher latitudes than with us, his long continuance above the horizon is attended with an accumulation of heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that of many places under the torrid zone; and there is reason to suppose, that the rays of the sun, at any given altitude, produce greater degrees of heat in the condensed air of the polar regions, that in the thinner air of this climate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:036757_0079_100B049F26A94EF0"/>
Yet, if we look for heat, and the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects of it, we must go to the countries near the equator, where we shall find a scenery totally different from that of the frigid zone. Here all things are upon a larger scale than in the temperate climates; their days are burning hot; in some parts their nights are piercing cold; their rains lasting and impetuous, like torrents; their dews excessive; their thunder and lightning more frequent, terrible, and dangerous; the heat burns up the lighter soil, and forms it into a sandy desert, while it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all the moister tracts with incredible vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The ancients supposed that the frigid zone was uninhabitable from cold, and the torrid from the intolerable heat of the sun; we now, however, know that both are inhabited. The sentiments of the ancients, therefore, in this respect, are a proof how inadequate the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the human mind are to discussions of this nature, when unassisted by facts.</p>

               <head>OF THE ANCIENT DISTINCTION OF PLACES, BY THE DIVERSITY OF SHADOWS OF UP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGHT BODIES AT NOON.</head>
               <p>When the sun at noon is in the zenith of any place, the inhabitants of that place were by the ancients called <hi>ascii,</hi> that is, without
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036757_0080_100B04A0B226AB38"/>
shadow; for the shadow of a man standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, when the sun is directly over his head, is not extended beyond that part of the earth which is directly under his body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not be visible.</p>
               <p>As the shadow of every opake body is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the sun, it follows, that when the sun at noon is southward from the zenith of any place, the shadow of an inhabitant of that place, and indeed of any other opake body, is extended towards the north.</p>
               <p>But when the sun is northward from the zenith of any place, the shadow falls towards the south.</p>
               <p>Those are called <hi>amphiscii,</hi> that have both kinds of meridian shadows.</p>
               <p>Those, whose meridian shadows are always projected one way, are termed <hi>heteroscii.</hi>
               </p>

                  <head>PROBLEM XXI.</head>
                  <head>To illustrate the distinction of ascii, amphiscii, heteroscii, and periscii, by the globe.</head>
                  <p>Rectify the globe to the summer solstice, and move the artificial horizon to the equator, the north point will be the most elevated at noon.</p>
                  <p>Which shews, that to those inhabitants who live at the equator, the sun will at this season appear to the north at noon, and their
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036757_0081_100B04A281565C88"/>
shadow will therefore be projected south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>But if you rectify the globe to the winter solstice, the south point being then the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most point at noon, the same persons will at noon have the sun on the south side of them, and will project their shadows northwards.</p>
                  <p>Thus they are amphiscii, projecting their shade both ways; which is the case of all the inhabitants within the tropics.</p>
                  <p>The artificial horizon remaining as before, rectify the globe to the times of the equinox, and you will find that when this horizon is under the strong brass meridian, a line going vertically upwards will be perpendicular to it, and consequently the sun will be directly over the heads of the inhabitants, and they will be ascii, having no noon shade; their shadow is in the morning projected directly westward, in the evening directly eastward.</p>
                  <p>The same thing will also happen to all the inhabitants who live between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn; so that they are not only ascii, but amphiscii also.</p>
                  <p>Those who live without the tropics are heteroscii; those in north latitude have the noon shade always directed to the north, while those in south latitude have it always projected to the south.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of the polar circles are
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036757_0082_100B04A4AE956658"/>
called <hi>periscii;</hi> because, as the sun goes round them continually, their shade goes round them likewise.</p>

               <p>When they look towards each other, the sun seems to rise on the right hand of the one, but on the left of the other. They have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent poles elevated; and the stars that never set to the one, are never seen by the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perioeci</hi> are also two opposite nations, situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the same parallel of latitude.</p>
               <p>They have therefore the same latitude, but differ 180 degrees in longitude; the same sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

               <p>
                  <hi>Antipodes</hi> are two nations diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, which have opposite seasons and latitude, opposite hours and longitude.</p>
               <p>The sun and stars rise to the one, when they set to the other, and that during the whole year, for they have the same horizon.</p>
               <p>The day of the one is the night of the other; and when the day is longest with the one, the other has it's shortest day.</p>
               <p>They have contrary seasons at the same time; different poles, but equally elevated; and those stars that are always above the horizon of one, are always under the horizon of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>Upon my father's globes there are twenty-three parallels, drawn at the distance of one degree from each other on both sides the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which, with two other parallels at 23½ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees distance, include the ecliptic circle.</p>
                  <p>The two outermost circles are called the tropics; that on the north side the equator is called the tropic of Cancer, that which is on the south side, the tropic of Capricorn.</p>
                  <p>Now as the ecliptic is inclined to the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in an angle of 23½ degrees, and is included between the tropics, every parallel between these must cross the ecliptic in two points, which two points shew the sun's place when he is vertical to the inhabitants of that paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel; and the days of the month upon the broad paper circle answering to those points of the ecliptic, are the days on which the sun passes directly over their heads at noon, and which are sometimes called their two midsummer days.</p>
                  <p>It is usual to call the sun's diurnal paths parallels to the equator, which are therefore aptly represented by the above-mentioned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel

                  <p>Let the globe be removed from ♑ to ♒, and the needle pointing to the variation as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will preserve the parallelism of the earth's axis; then it will be plain that the string, or central solar ray, will fall upon the first point of Leo, six signs distant from, but opposite to the sign ♒, upon which the globe stands; the central solar ray will now describe the 20th par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel of north declination, which will be about the 23d of July.</p>

OF THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS, BY EXPOSING THE GLOBES TO THE SUN'S RAYS.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1679, <hi>J. Moxon</hi> published a treatise on what he called <hi>"The English Globe;</hi> being (says he) a stabil and immobil one, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what the ordinary globes do, and much more; invented and described by the Right Hon. the <hi>Earle of Castlemaine."</hi> This globe was designed to perform, by being merely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the sun's rays, all those problems which in the usual way are solved by the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious aid of brazen meridians, hour index<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>My father thought that this method might be useful, to ground more deeply in the young pupil's mind, those principles which the globes are intended to explain; and by giving him a different view of the subject, improve and strengthen his mind; he therefore inserted on his globes some lines, for the purpose of solv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few problems in Lord Castlemaine's manner.</p>
                  <p>It appears to me, from a copy of Moxon's publication, which is in my possession, that the Earl of Castlemaine projected a new edition of his works, as the copy contains a great number of corrections, many alterations, and some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. It is not very improbable, that at some
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:036757_0100_100B04C5DC4BC258"/>
future day I may re-publish this curious work, and adapt a small globe for the solution of the problems.</p>
                  <p>The meridians on our new terrestrial globes being secondaries to the equator, are also hour circles, and are marked as such with Roman figures, under the equator, and at the polar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. But there is a difference in the figures pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the same hour circle; if it cuts the IIId hour upon the polar circles, it will cut the IXth hour upon the equator, which is six hours later, and so of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>Through the great Pacific sea, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section of Libra, is drawn a broad meridian from pole to pole; it passes through the XIIth hour upon the equator, and the VIth hour upon each of the polar circles; this hour circle is gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into degrees and parts, and numbered from the equator towards either pole.</p>
                  <p>There is another broad meridian passing through the Pacific sea, at the IXth hour upon the equator, and the IIId hour upon each polar circle; this contains only one quadrant, or 90 degrees; the numbers annexed to it begin at the nothern polar circle, and end at the tropic of Capricorn.</p>
                  <p>Here we must likewise observe, there are 23 concentric circles drawn upon the terrestrial globe within the northern and southern polar circles, which for the future we shall call polar
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036757_0101_100B04C82E9E3828"/>
parallels; they are placed at the distance of one degree from each other, and represent the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels of the sun's declination, but in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manner from the 47 parallels between the tropics.</p>
                  <p>The following problems require the globe to be placed upon a plane that is level, or truly horizontal, which is easily atttained, if the floor, pavement, gravel-walk in the garden, &amp;c. should not happen to be horizontal.</p>
                  <p>A flat seasoned board, or any box which is about two feet broad, or two feet square, if the top be perfectly flat, will answer the purpose; the upper surface of either may be set truly horizontal, by the help of a pocket spirit level, or plumb rule, if you raise or depress this or that side by a wedge or two, as the spirit level shall direct; if you have a meridian line drawn on the place over which you substitute this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal plane, it may be readily transferred from thence to the surface just levelled; this being done, we are prepared for the solution of the following problems.</p>
                  <p>It will be necessary to define a term we are obliged to make use of in the solution these problems, namely, the <hi>shade of extuberancy:</hi> by this is meant that shade which is caused by the sphericity of the globe, and answers to what we have heretofore named the terminator, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the boundaries of the illuminated and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036757_0102_100B04C9BB1C9D38"/>
obscure parts of the globe; this circle was, in the solution of some of the foregoing problems, represented by the broad paper circle, but is here realized by the rays of the sun.</p>

                  <head>To observe the sun's altitude (by the terrestrial globe) when he shines bright, or when he can but just be discerned through a cloud.</head>
                  <p>Elevate the north pole of the globe to 66 ½ degrees; bring that meridian, or hour circle, which passes through the IXth hour upon the equator, under the graduated side of the strong brass meridian; the globe being now set upon the horizontal plane, turn it about thereon, frame and all, that the shadow of the strong brass meridian may fall directly under itself; or in other words, that the shade of it's gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted face may fall exactly upon the aforesaid hour circle; at that instant the shade of extu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berancy will touch the true degree of the sun's altitude upon that meridian, which passes through the IXth hour upon the equator, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned from the polar circle, the most elevated part of which will then be in the zenith of the place where this operation is performed, and is the same whether it should happen to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in north or south latitude.</p>
                  <p>Thus, we may, in an easy and natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:036757_0103_100B04CC28CC61B8"/>
obtain the altitude of the sun, at any time of the day, by the terrestrial globe; for it is very plain, when the sun rises, he brushes the zenith and nadir of the globe by his rays; and as he always illuminates half of it, (or a few minutes more, as his globe is considerably larger than that of the earth) therefore when the sun is risen a degree higher, he must necessarily illuminate a degree beyond the zenith, and so on propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably from time to time.</p>
                  <p>But as the illuminated part is somewhat more than half, deduct 13 minutes from the shade of extuberancy, and you have the sun's altitude with tolerable exactness.</p>
                  <p>If you have any doubt how far the shade of extuberancy reaches, hold a pin, or your finger, on the globe, between the sun and point in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and where the shade of either is lost, will be the point sought.</p>

                  <p>If you have no meridian line, then the day of the month being known, find the sun's decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as before instructed, which will direct you to the parallel of the day, amongst the polar parallels, reckoned from either pole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the polar circle; which you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                  <p>Set the globe upon your horizontal plane in the sun-shine, and put it nearly north and south by the mariner's compass, it being first elevated to the latitude of the place, and the place it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self brought under the graduated side of the strong brass meridian; then move the frame and globe together, till the shade of extuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or term of illumination, just touches the polar parallel for the day, and the globe will be settled as before; and if accurately performed, the variation of the magnetic needle will be shewn by the degree to which it points in the compass box.</p>
                  <p>And here observe, if the parallel for the day should not happen to fall on any one of those drawn upon the globe, you are to esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a proportionable part between them, and reckon that the parallel of the day. If we had drawn more, the globe would have been confused.</p>
                  <p>The reason of this operation is, that as the

sun illuminates half the globe, the shade of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberancy will constantly be 90 degrees from the point wherein the sun is vertical.</p>
                  <p>If the sun be in the equator, the shade and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination must terminate in the poles of the world; and when he is in any other diurnal parallel, the terms of illumination must fall short of, or go beyond either pole, as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as the parallel which the sun describes that day is distant from the equator; therefore, when the shade of extuberancy touches the polar par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel for the day, the artificial globe will be in the same position, with respect to the sun, as the earth really is, and will be illuminated in the same manner.</p>

                     <p>The reason is, that the shade of extuberancy being a great circle, cuts the equator in half, and the sun, in whatsoever parallel of declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he may happen to be, is always in the pole of the shade; consequently the confines of light and shade will shew the true hour of the day.</p>

                     <p>The globe being every way adjusted as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and London brought under the graduated side of the strong brass meridian, hold up a plumb-line, so that it's shadow may fall upon the zenith point, (which in this case is London itself) and the shadow of the string will cut the parallel of the day upon that point to which the sun is then vertical, and that hour circle upon which this intersection falls, is the hour of the day; and as the meridians are drawn within the tropics, at twenty minutes distance from each other, the point cut by the intersection of the string upon the parallel of the day, being so near the equator, may, by a glance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server's eye, be referred thereto, and the true time obtained to a minute.</p>

               <head>THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF DIALLING ILLUSTRATED BY THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE.</head>
               <p>THE art of dialling is of very ancient origin, and was in former times cultivated by all who had any pretensions to science; and before the invention of clocks and watches it was of the highest importance, and is even now used to correct and regulate them.</p>
               <p>It teaches us, by means of the sun's rays, to divide time into equal parts, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036757_0115_100B04E2E9681900"/>
on any given surface the different circles into which, for convenience, we suppose the heavens to be divided, but principally the hour circles.</p>
               <p>The hours are marked upon a plane, and pointed out by the interposition of a body, which receiving the light of the sun, casts a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow upon the plane. This body is called the axis, when it is parallel to the axis of the world. It is called the stile, when it is so placed that only the end of it coincides with the axis of the earth; in this case, it is only this point which marks the hours.</p>
               <p>Among the various pleasing and profitable amusements which arise from the use of globes, that of dialling is not the least. By it the pupil will gain satisfactory ideas of the principles on which this branch of science is founded; and it will reward, with abundance of pleasure, those that chuse to exercise themselves in the practice of it.</p>
               <p>If we imagine the hour circles of any place, as London, to be drawn upon the globe of the earth, and suppose this globe to be transparent, and to revolve round a real axis, which is opake, and casts a shadow; it is evident, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the plane of any hour semicircle points at the sun, the shadow of the axis will fall upon the opposite semicircle.<note n="*" place="bottom">Long's Astronomy, vol. 1, page 82.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:036757_0116_100B04E477D8FF40"/>
Let a P C p, fig. 1, plate XIII, represent a transparent globe; a b c d e f g the hour semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles; it is clear, that if the semicircle P a p points at the sun, the shadow of the axis will fall upon the opposite semicircle.</p>
               <p>If we imagine any plane to pass through the center of this transparent globe, the shadow of half the axis will always fall upon one side or the other of this intersecting plane</p>
               <p>Thus let A B C D be the plane of the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of London; so long as the sun is above the horizon, the shadow of the upper half of the axis will fall somewhere upon the upper side of the plane A B C D; when the sun is below the horizon of London, then the shadow of the lower half of the axis E falls upon the lower side of the plane.</p>
               <p>When the plane of any hour semicircle points at the sun, the shadow of the axis marks the respective hour-line upon the intersecting plane. The hour-line is therefore a line drawn from the center of the intersecting plane, to that point where this plane is cut by the semicircle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the hour semicircle.</p>
               <p>Thus let A B C D, fig. 1, plate XIII, the horizon of London, be the intersecting plane; when the meridian of London points at the sun, as in the present figure, the shadow of the half axis P E falls upon the line E B, which is drawn from E, the center of the horizon, to
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:036757_0117_100B04E6DF174A20"/>
the point where the horizon is cut by the opposite semicircle; therefore, E B is the line for the hour of twelve at noon.</p>
               <p>By the same method the rest of the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines are found, by drawing for every hour a line, from the center of the intersecting plane, to that semicircle which is opposite to the hour semicircle.</p>
               <p>Thus fig. 2, plate XIII, shews the hour-lines drawn upon the plane of the horizon of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with only so many hours as are necessary; that is, those hours, during which the sun is above the horizon of London, on the longest day in summer.</p>
               <p>If, when the hour-lines are thus found, the semicircles be taken away, as the scaffolding is when the house is built, what remains, as in fig. 2, will be an <hi>horizontal dial</hi> for London.</p>
               <p>If, instead of twelve hour circles, as above described, we take twice that number, we may by the points, where the intersecting plane is cut them, find the lines for every half hour; if we take four times the number of hour cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, we may find the lines for every quarter of an hour, and so on progressively.</p>
               <p>We have hitherto considered the horizon of London as the intersecting plane, by which is seen the method of making an horizontal dial. If we take any other plane for the intersecting plane, and find the points where the hour semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles pass through it, and draw the lines from
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:036757_0118_100B04E86A98E458"/>
the center of the plane to those points, we shall have the hour-lines for that plane.</p>
               <p>Fig. 3, plate XIII, shews how the hour-lines are found upon a south plane, perpendicular to the horizon. Fig. 4, shews a south dial, with it's hour-lines, without the semicircle, by means whereof they are found.</p>
               <p>The <hi>gnomon</hi> of every sun-dial represents the axis of the earth, and is therefore always placed parallel to it; whether it be a wire, as in the figure before us, or the edge of a brass plate, as in a common horizontal dial.</p>
               <p>The whole earth, as to it's bulk, is but a <hi>point,</hi> if compared to it's distance from the sun; therefore, if a small sphere of glass be placed on any part of the earth's surface, so that it's axis be parallel to the axis of the earth, and the sphere have such lines upon it, and such planes within it, as above described, it will shew the hour of the day as truly as if it were placed at the center of the earth, and the shell of the earth were as transparent as glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A wire sphere,</hi> with a thin flat plate of brass within it, is often made use of to explain the principles of dialling.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, it is clear that dialling depends on finding where the shadow of a strait wire, parallel to the axis of the earth, will fall upon a given plane, every hour, half hour, &amp;c. the hour-lines being found as

above described, which we shall proceed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify by the globe.</p>
               <p>Every dial-plane (that is, the plane surface on which a dial is drawn) represents the plane of a great circle, which circle is an <hi>horizon</hi> to some country or other</p>
               <p>The center of the dial represents the center of the earth; and the gnomon which casts the shade represents the axis, and ought to point directly to the poles of the equator.</p>
               <p>The plane upon which dials are delineated may be either, 1. parallel to the horizon; 2. perpendicular to the horizon; or, 3. cutting it at oblique angles.</p>

The pupil need not, however, take out into his table the distances further than from XII to VI, which is just 90 degrees; for the distances of XI, X, IX, VIII, VII, VI, in the forenoon, are the same from XII as the distances of I, II, III, IV, V, VI, in the afternoon; and these hour-lines continued through the center will give the opposite hour-lines on the other half of the dial.</p>

                  <p>To transfer these, and the rest of the hours, upon an horizontal plane, draw the parallel right lines a c and b d, fig. 5, plate XIII, upon that plane, as far from each other as is equal to the intended thickness of the gnomon of the dial, and the space included between them will be the meridian, or twelve o'clock line upon the dial; cross this meridian at right angles by the line g h, which will by the six o' clock line; then setting one foot of your compasses in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section a, describe the quadrant g e with any convenient radius, or opening of the compasses; after this, set one foot of the compasses in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection b, as a center, and with the same rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius describe the quadrant f h; then divide each quadrant into 90 equal parts, or degrees, as in the figure.</p>

                  <head>To delineate a direct south dial for any given lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by the globe.</head>
                  <p>Let us suppose a south dial for the latitude of London.</p>
                  <p>Elevate the pole to the co-latitude of your place, and proceed in all respects as above taught for the horizontal dial, from VI in the morning to VI in the afternoon, only the hours must be reversed, as in fig. 3, plate XIII; and the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenuse a g of the gnomon a g f, must make an angle with the dial plane to the co-latitude of the place.</p>
                  <p>As the sun can shine no longer than from VI in the morning to VI in the evening, there is no occasion for having more than twelve hours upon this dial.</p>
                  <p>In solving this problem, we have considered our vertical south dial for the latitude of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036757_0124_100B04F4343DAC28"/>
as an horizontal one for the complement of that latitude, or 38 deg. 30 min<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; all direct vertical dials may be thus reduced to horizontal ones, in the same manner. The reason of this will be evident, if the globe be elevated to the latitude of London; for by fixing the quadrant of altitude to the zenith, and bringing it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect the horizon in the east point, it will point out the plane of the proposed dial.</p>
                  <p>This plane is at right angles to the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and perpendicular to the horizon; and it is clear, from the bare inspection of the globe thus elevated, that it's axis forms an angle with this plane, which is just the complement of that which it forms with the horizon, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore just equal to the co-latitude of the place; and that therefore it is most simple to rectify the globe to that co-latitude.</p>
                  <p>The north vertical dial is the same with the south, only the stile must point upwards, and that many of the hours from it's direction can be of on use.</p>

Then if your dial declines towards the east, (which we shall suppose in the present instance) count in the horizon the degrees of declination from the east point towards the north, and bring the lower end of the quadrant to coincide with that degree of declination at which the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ends.</p>
                  <p>Then bring the first meridian under the graduated edge of the strong brass meridian, which strong meridian will be the horary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex.</p>
                  <p>Now turn the globe westward, and observe the degrees cut in the quadrant of altitude by the first meridian, while the hours XI, X, IX, &amp;c. in the forenoon, pass successively under the brazen one; and the degrees thus cut on the quadrant by the first meridian, are the respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive distances of the forenoon hours, from XII, on the plane of the quadrant.</p>
                  <p>For the afternoon hours, turn the quadrant of altitude round the zenith, until it comes to the degree in the horizon, opposite to that where it was placed before, namely, as far from the west towards the south, and turn the globe eastward; and as the hours I, II, III, &amp;c. pass under the strong brazen meridian, the first me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian will cut on the quadrant of altitude the number of degrees from the zenith, that each of the hours is from XII on the dial.</p>
                  <p>When the first meridian goes off the quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:036757_0126_100B04F9484DFA00"/>

               <head>NAVIGATION EXPLAINED BY THE Globe.</head>
               <p>NAVIGATION is the art of guiding a ship at sea, from one place to another, in the safest and most convenient manner. In order to attain this, four things are particularly necessary:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To know the situation and distance of places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To know at all times the points of the compass.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To know the line which the ship is to be directed from one place to the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To know, in any part of the voyage, what point of the globe the ship is upon.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of the distance and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of places, between which a voyage is to be made, implies not only a general knowledge of geography, but of several other particulars, as the rocks, sands, streights, rivers, &amp;c. near which we are to sail; the bending out, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in of the shores, the knowledge of the times that particular winds sets in, the seasons when storms and hurricanes are to be expected,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036757_0129_100B04FF2A633628"/>
but especially the tides; these and many other similar circumstances are to be learned from sea charts, journals, &amp;c. but chiefly by observation and experience.</p>
               <p>The second particular to be attained, is the knowledge at all times of the points of the compass, where the ship is. The ancients, to whom the polarity of the loadstone was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, found in the day-time the east or west, by the rising to setting of the sun; and at night, the north by the polar star. We have advantage of the mariner's compass, by which, at any time in the wide ocean, and the darkest night, we know where the north is, and consequently the rest of the points of the compass.</p>
               <p>Indeed, before the invention of the mariner's compass, the voyages of the Europeans were principally confined to coasting; but this fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate discovery has enabled the mariner to explore new seas, and discover new countries, which, without this valuable acquisition, would probably have remained for ever unknown.</p>
               <p>The third thing required to be known, is the line which a ship describes upon the globe of the earth, in going from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The shortest way from one place to another, is an arc of a great circle, drawn through the two places.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:036757_0130_100B0501182BA328"/>
The most convenient way for a ship, is that by which we may sail from one place to another, directing the ship all the while towards the same point of the compass.</p>
               <p>A ship is guided by steering or directing her towards some points of the compass; the line wherein a ship is directed, is called the ship's course, which is named from the point towards which she sails.</p>
               <p>Thus if a ship sails towards the north-east point, her course is said to be N. E.</p>
               <p>In long voyages, a ship's way consist of a great a number of different courses, as from A to B, from B to C, and from C to D, fig. 9, plate XII; when we speak of a ship's course, we consider one of these at a time; the seldomer the course is changed, the more easily the ship is directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If two places,</hi> A <hi>and</hi> Z, <hi>fig.</hi> 7, <hi>plate</hi> XIII. <hi>lie under the same meridian,</hi> the course from the one to the other is due north or south. Thus let A Z be part of a meridian; if A be south of Z, the course from A to z must be north, and the course from Z to A south. This is evident from the nature of a meridian, that it marks upon the horizon the north and south points, and that every point of any meridian is north or south from every other point of it. From hence we may deduce the following co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary;
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036757_0131_100B05036FABD798"/>
that if a ship sails due north or south, she will continue on the same meridian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If two places lie under the equator,</hi> the course from one to other is an arc of the equator, and is due east or west. Thus let a z, fig. 7, be a part of the equator; if a be west from z, the course from a to z is east, and the course from z to a is west: for since the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor marks the east and west points upon the horizon, every point of the equator lies east or west of every other point of it, as may be seen upon the globe, by placing it as for a right sphere, and bringing a or z, or any of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate points, to the zenith; when it will be evidence, that if we are to go from one of these points a, to the other z, or to any point the equator, we must continue our course due east to arrive at a, or vice versa. From hence we may deduce this consequence, that if a ship under the equator sails due east or west, she will continue under the equator.</p>
               <p>In the two foregoing cases, the course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an arc of a great circle, (the meridian or equator) is the shortest and the most convenient way it can sail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If two places lie under the same parallel,</hi> the course from one to the other is due east or west; this may be seen upon the globe, by the following method: bring any point of a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the zenith, and stretch a thread over it,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036757_0132_100B050500271000"/>
perpendicular to the meridian; the thread will then be a tangent to the parallel, and stand east and west from the point of contact. Hence, if a ship sails in any parallel, due east or west, she will continue in the same parallel. In this case, the most convenient course, though not the shortest, from one to the other, is to sail due east or west.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If two places lie neither under the equator, nor on the same meridian, nor in the same parallel,</hi> the most convenient, though not the shortest, course from one to the other, is in a rhumb.</p>
               <p>For if we should in this case attempt to go the shortest way, in a great circle drawn through the two places, we must be perpetually chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our course. Thus fig. 8, whatever is the bearing of Z from A, the bearing of all the intermediate points, as B, C, D, E, &amp;c. will be different from it, as well as different from each other, as may be easily seen upon the globe, by bringing the first point A to the zenith, and observing the bearing of Z from each of them. Thus suppose, when the globe is rectified to the horizon of A, the bearing of Z from A be north-east, and the angle of position of Z, with regard to A, be 45 degrees; if we bring B to the ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, we shall have a different horizon, and the bearing and angle of position from Z to B will be different from the former; and so on of the other points C, D, E, they will each of them
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:036757_0133_100B0506A29A3B08"/>
have a different horizon, and Z will have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent bearing and angle of position.</p>
               <p>From hence we may draw this corollary, that when two places lie one from the other, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a point not cardinal, if we sail from one place towards the point of the other's bearing, we shall never arrive at the other place. Thus if Z lies north-east from A, if we sail from A towards the north-east, we shall never arrive at Z.</p>
               <p>A <hi>rhumb</hi> upon the globe is a line drawn from a given place A, so as to cut all the meridians it passes through at equal angles; the rhumbs are denominated from the points of the compass, in a different manner from the winds. Thus, at sea, the north-east wind is that which blows from the north-east point of the horizon, towards the ship in which we are; but we are said to sail upon the N. E. rhumb, when we go towards the north-east.</p>
               <p>The rhumb A B C D Z, fig. 8, plate XIII. passing through the meridians L M, N O, P Q, makes the angles L A B, N B C, P C D, equal; from whence it follows, that the direction of a rhumb is in every part of it towards the same point of the compass; thus from every point of a north-east rhumb upon the globe, the direction is towards the north-east, and that rhumb makes an angle of 45 deg. with every meridian it is drawn through.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:036757_0134_100B0508FA7057A8"/>
Another property of the rhumbs is, that equal parts of the same rhumb are contained between parallels of equal distance of latitude; so that a ship continuing in the same rhumb, will run the same number of miles in sailing from the parallel of 10 to the parallel of 30, as she does in sailing from the parallel of 30 to that of 50.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing mentioned to be required in navigation, was, to know at any time what point of the globe a ship is upon. This depends upon four things: I. the longitude; 2. the latitude; 3. the course the ship has run; 4. the distance, that is, the way she has made, or the number of leagues or miles she has run in that course, from the place of the last observation. Now any two of these being known, the rest may be easily found.</p>
               <p>Having thus given some general idea of navigation, we now proceed to the problems by which the cases of sailing are solved on the globe.</p>

to give an account of so many of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing problems, solved on the common globes, as would enable them to apply the remainder of those heretofore solved, to their own use. This is the more expedient, as, since the publication of my father's treatise, there have been a few attempts to do away some the inconveniences of the ancient form, particularly that of the old hour-circle, which is now generally placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meridian.</p>
               <p>I cannot, however, refrain from again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving to the pupil, that the solution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems on the old globes depends upon appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; that therefore, if he means to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the mere mechanical solution of them, the Ptolemaic globes will answer his purpose; but if he wishes to have clear ideas of the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale of those problems, he must use those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my father's manner.</p>
               <p>The celestial globe is used the same way in both mountings, expecting that in my father's mounting it has some additional circles; but the difference is so trifling, that it is presumed the pupil can find no difficulty in applying the directions there given to the old form.</p>

            <head>PART IV. OF THE USE OF THE CELESTIAL GLOBE.</head>
            <p>THE celestial globe is an artificial represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the heavens, having the fixed stars drawn upon it, in their natural order and situation; whilst it's rotation on it's axis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the apparent diurnal motion of the sun, moon, and stars.</p>
            <p>It is not known how early the ancients had any thing of this kind: we are not certain what the sphere of Atlas or Musaeus was; perhaps Palamedes, who lived about the time of the Trojan war, had something of this kind; for of him it is said,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>To mark the signs that cloudless skies bestow,</l>
               <l>To tell the seasons, when to sail and plow,</l>
               <l>He first devised; each planet's order found,</l>
               <l>It's distance, period, in the blue profound.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:036757_0154_100B0532A9B77D38"/>
From Pliny it would seem that Hipparchus had a celestial globe with the stars delineated upon it.</p>
            <p>It is not to be supposed that the celestial globe is so just a representation of the heavens as the terrestrial globe is of the earth; because here the stars are drawn upon a convex surface, whereas they naturally appear in a concave one. But suppose the globe were made of glass, then to an eye placed in the center, the stars which are drawn upon it would appear in a concave surface, just as they do in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
            <p>Or if the reader was to suppose that holes were made in each star, and an eye placed in the center of the globe, it would view, through those holes, the same stars in the heavens that they represent.</p>
            <p>As the terrestrial globe, by turning on it's axis, represents the <hi>real diurnal motion</hi> of the earth; so the celestial globe, by turning on it's axis, represents the <hi>apparent diurnal motion</hi> of the heavens.</p>
            <p>For the sake of perspicuity, and to avoid continual references, it will be necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat here some articles which have been already mentioned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ecliptic</hi> is that graduated circle which crosses the equator in an angle of about 23½ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036757_0155_100B053435C23118"/>
and the angle is called the obliquity of the ecliptic.</p>
            <p>This circle is divided into twelve equal parts, consisting of 30 degrees each; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of them are marked with characters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the twelve signs.</p>
            <p>Aries ♈, Taurus ♉, Gemini ♊, Cancer ♋, Leo ♌, Virgo ♍, Libra ♎, Scorpio ♏, Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius ♐, Captricornus ♑, Aquarius ♒, Pisces ♓.</p>
            <p>Upon my father's globes, just under the ecliptic, the months, and days of each month, are graduated, for the readier fixing the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sun upon it's place in the ecliptic.</p>
            <p>The two points where the ecliptic crosses the equinoctial, (the circle that answers to the equator on the terrestrial globe) are called the <hi>equinoctial points;</hi> they are at the beginnings of Aries and Libra, and are so called, because when the sun is in either of them, the day and night is every where equal.</p>
            <p>The first points of Cancer and Capricorn are called <hi>solstitial points;</hi> because when the sun arrives at either of them, he seems to stand in a manner still for several days, in respect to his distance from the equinoctial; when he is in one solstitial point, he makes to us the longest day; when in the other, the longest night.</p>
            <p>The latitude and longitude of stars are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from the ecliptic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:036757_0156_100B053630D1F878"/>
The <hi>longitude</hi> of the stars and planets is reckoned upon the ecliptic; the numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the first points of Aries ♈, where the ecliptic crosses the equator, and increasing according to the order of the signs.</p>
            <p>Thus suppose the sun to be in the 10th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Leo, we say, his longitude, or place, is four signs, ten degrees; because he has already passed the four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and is ten degrees in the fifth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>latitude</hi> of the stars and planets is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by their distance from the ecliptic upon a secondary or great circle passing through it's poles, and crossing it at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
            <p>Twenty-four of these circular lines, which cross the ecliptic at right angles, being fifteen degrees from each other, are drawn upon the surface of our celestial globe; which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced both ways, those on one side meet in a point on the northern polar circle, and those on the other meet in a point on the southern polar circle.</p>
            <p>The points determined by the meeting of these circles are called the poles of the ecliptic, one north, the other south.</p>
            <p>From these definitions it follows, that lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and latitude, on the celestial globe, bear just the same relation to the ecliptic, as they do on the terrestrial globe to the equator.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:036757_0157_100B053861A36788"/>
Thus as the longitude of places on the earth is measured by degrees upon the equator, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the first meridian; so the longitude of the heavenly bodies is measured by degrees upon the ecliptic, counting from the first point of Aries.</p>
            <p>And as latitude on the earth is measured by degrees upon the meridian, counting from the equator; so the latitude of the heavenly bodies is measured by degrees upon a circle of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, counting either north or south from the ecliptic.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The sun,</hi> therefore, <hi>has no latitude,</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ecliptic; nor do we usually speak of his longitude, but rather of his place in the ecliptic, expressing it by such a degree and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute of such a sign, as 5 degrees of Taurus, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of 35 degrees of longitude.</p>
            <p>The distance of any heavenly body from the equinoctial, measured upon the meridian, is called it's <hi>declination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the sun's declination, north or south, at any time, is the same as the latitude of any place to which he is then vertical, which is never more than 23½ degrees.</p>
            <p>Therefore all <hi>parallels of declination</hi> on the celestial globe are the very same as parallels of latitude on the terrestrial.</p>
            <p>Stars may have north latitude and south de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>

That which is called longitude on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial globe, is called <hi>right ascension</hi> on the celestial; namely, the sun or star's distance from that meridian which passes through the first point of Aries, counted on the equinoctial.</p>
            <p>Astronomers also speak of <hi>oblique ascension</hi> and <hi>descension,</hi> by which they mean the distance of that point of the equinoctial from the first point of Aries, which in an oblique sphere rises or sets, at the same time that the sun or star rises or sets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ascensional difference</hi> is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt right and oblique ascension. The sun's ascensional difference turned into time, is just so much as he rises before or after six o'clock.</p>
            <p>The celestial signs and constellations on the surface of the celestial globe, are represented by a variety of human and other figures, to which the stars that are either in or near them, are referred.</p>
            <p>The several systems of stars, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to those images, are called constellations. Twelve of these are represented on the ecliptic circle, and extend both northward and south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from it. So many of those stars as fall within the limits of 8 degrees on both sides of the ecliptic circle, together with such parts of their images as are contained within the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said bounds, constitute a kind of broad hoop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belt, or girdle, which is called the <hi>zodiac.</hi>

The names and the respective characters of the twelve signs of the ecliptic may be learned by inspection on the surface of the broad paper circle, and the constellations from the globe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>The zodiac is represented by eight circles parallel to the ecliptic, on each side thereof; these circles are one degree distant from each other, so that the whole breadth of the zodiac is 16 degrees.</p>
            <p>Amongst these parallels, the latitude of the planets is reckoned; and in their apparent motion they never exceed the limits of the zodiac.</p>
            <p>On each side of the zodiac, as was observed, other constellations are distinguished; those on the north side are called northern, and those on the south side of it, southern constellations.</p>

               <p>All the stars which compose these constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are supposed to increase their longitude continually; upon which supposition, the whole starry firmament has a slow motion from west to east; insomuch that the first star in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of Aries, which appeared in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intersection of the equator and ecliptic in the time of Meton the Athenian, upwards of

1900 years ago, is now removed about 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from it.</p>
               <p>This change of the stars in longitude, which has now become sufficiently apparent, is owing to a small retrograde motion of the equinoctial points, of about 50 seconds in a year, which is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon upon the protuberant matter about the equator. The same cause also occasions a small deviation in the parallelism of the earth's axis, by which it is continually directed towards different points in the heavens, and makes a complete revolution round the ecliptic in about 25,920 years. The former of these motions is called <hi>the precession of the equinoxes,</hi> the latter <hi>the nutation of the earth's axis.</hi> In consequence of this shifting of the equinoctial points, an alteration has taken place in the signs of the ecliptic; those stars, which in the infancy of astronomy were in Aries, being now got into Taurus, those of Taurus into Gemini, &amp;c.; so that the stars which rose and set at any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular seasons of the year, in the times of Hesiod, Eudoxus, and Virgil, will not at present answer the descriptions given of them by those writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

                  <p>Now if you turn the globe slowly round upon it's axis from east to west, while it is in this position, these points of intersection will move round the same way; and the inclination of the circle, which in shewing this motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the equinoctial, will not be altered by such a revolution of the intersecting or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial points. This motion is called the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the equinoxes, because it carries the equinoctial points backwards amongst the fixed stars.</p>
                  <p>The poles of the world seem to describe a circle from east to west, round the poles of the ecliptic, arising from the precession of the

                  <p>This motion of the poles is easily repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the above-described position of the globe, in which, if the reader remembers, the broad paper circle represents the ecliptic, and the axis of the globe being perpendicular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, represents the axis of the ecliptic; and the two points, where the circular lines meet, will represent the poles of the world, whence, as the globe is slowly turned from east to west, these points will revolve the same way about the poles of the globe, which are here supposed to represent the poles of the ecliptic. The axis of the world may revolve as above, although it's situation, with respect to the ecliptic, be not altered; for the points here supposed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the poles of the world, will always keep the same distance from the broad paper circle, which represents the ecliptic in this situation of the globe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rutherforth's System of Nat.

               <p>EVERY thing that relates to the sun is of such importance to man, that in all things he claims a natural preheminence. The sun is at once the most beautiful emblem of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, and, under his influence, the fostering parent of worlds; being present to them by his rays, cheering them by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, cherishing them by his heat, adorning them at each returning spring with the gayest and richest attire, illuminating them with his light, and feeding the lamp of life.</p>
               <p>To the ancients he was known under a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of names, each characteristic of his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent effects; he was their Hercules, the great deliverer, the restorer of light out of darkness, the dispenser of good, continually labouring for the happiness of a depraved race.

In the sacred scriptures, the original source of all emblematical writings, our Lord is called our sun, and the sun of righteousness; and as there is but one sun in the heavens, so there is but one true God, the maker and redeemer of all things, the light of the understanding, and the life of the soul.</p>
               <p>As in scripture our God is spoken of as a shield and buckler, so the sun is characterized by this mark ☉, representing a shield or buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the middle point, the umbo, or boss; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is love, or life, which alone can protect from fear and death.</p>
               <p>His celestial rays, like those of the sun, take their circuit round the earth; there is no corner of it so remote as to be without the reach of their vivifying and penetrating power.

                  <p>
                     <hi>To rectify the celestial globe, is to put it in that position in which it may represent exactly the apparent motion of the heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In different places, the position will vary, and that according to the different latitude of the places. Therefore, to rectify for any place, find first, by the terrestrial globe, the latitude of that place.</p>
                  <p>The latitude of the place being found in degrees, elevate the pole of the celestial globe the same number of degrees and minutes above the plane of the horizon, for this is the name given to the broad paper circle, in the use of the celestial globe.</p>
                  <p>Thus the latitude of London being 51½ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, let the globe be moved till the plane of the horizon cuts the meridian in that point.</p>
                  <p>The next rectification is for the sun's place, which may be performed as directed in prob. xxix; or look for the day of the month close under the ecliptic line, against which is the sun's place, place the artificial sun over that point, then bring the sun's place to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated edge of the strong brazen meridian, and set the hour index to the most elevated twelve.</p>

Thus on the 24th of May the sun is in 3½ degrees of Gemini, and is situated near the Bull's eye and the seven stars, which are not then visible, on account of his superior light. If the sun were on that day to suffer a total eclipse, these stars would then be seen shining with their accustomed brightness.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, set the meridian of the globe north and south, by the compass.</p>
                  <p>And the globe will be rectified, or put into a similar position, to the concave surface of the heavens, for the given latitude.</p>

The longest day at all places in north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is when the sun is in the first point of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. And,</p>

                  <p>Wherefore, the globe being rectified as above, and the artificial sun placed to the first point of Cancer, and brought to the eastern edge of the broad paper circle, and the horary index being set to that XII which is most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, on turning the globe from east to west, until the artificial sun coincides with the wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern edge, the number of hours counted, which are passed over by the horary index, is the length of the longest day; their complement to twenty-four hours gives the length of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est night.</p>
                  <p>If twelve hours be subtracted from the length of the longest day, and the remaining hours doubled, you obtain the climate mentioned by ancient historians; and if you take half the climate, and add thereto twelve hours, you obtain the length of the longest day in that cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.

               <head>OF THE EQUATION OF TIME.</head>
               <p>It is not possible, in a treatise of this kind, to enter into a disquisition of the nature of time. It is sufficient to observe, that if we would with exactness estimate the quantity of any portion of infinite duration, or convey an idea of the same to others, we make use of such known measures as have been originally borrowed from the motions of the heavenly bodies. It is true, none of these motions are exactly equal and uniform, but are subject to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036757_0174_100B055BF75C7088"/>
some small irregularities, which, though of no consequence in the affairs of civil life, must be taken into the account in astronomical calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There are other irregularities of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, one of which is in the inequality of the natural day.</p>
               <p>It is a consideration that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon without surprise, that wherever we look for commensurabilities and equalities in nature, we are always disappointed. The earth is spherical, but not perfectly so; the summer is unequal, when compared with the winter; the ecliptic disagrees with the equator, and never cuts it twice in the same equinoctial point. The orbit of the earth has an eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity more than double in proportion to the spheroidity of it's globe; no number of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the moon coincides with any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the revolutions of the earth in it's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; no two of the planets measure one another: put thus it is wherever we turn our thoughts, so different are the views of the Creator from our narrow conception of things; where we look for commensuration, we find variety and infinity.</p>
               <p>Thus ancient astronomers looked upon the motion of the sun to be sufficiently regular for the mensuration of time; but, by the accurate observations of later astronomers, it is found
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036757_0175_100B055DF6474380"/>
that neither the days, nor even the hours, as measured by the sun's apparent motion, are of an equal length, on two accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1st, A natural or solar day of 24 hours, is that space of time the sun takes up in passing from any particular meridian to the same again; but one revolution of the earth, with respect to a fixed star, is performed in 23 hours, 56 min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, 4 seconds; therefore the unequal progres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the earth through her elliptical orbit, (as she takes almost eight days more to run through the northern half of the ecliptic, than she does to pass through the southern) is the reason that the length of the day is not exactly equal to the time in which the earth performs it's rotation about it's axis.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, From the obliquity of the ecliptic to the equator, on which last we measure time; and as equal portions of one do not correspond to equal portions of the other, the apparent motion of the sun would not be uniform; or, in other words, those points of the equator which come to the meridian, with the place of the sun on different days, would not be at equal distances from each other.</p>

                  <head>To illustrate, by the globe, so much of the equation of time as is in consequence of the sun's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent motion in the ecliptic.</head>
                  <p>Bring every tenth degree of the ecliptic to the graduated side of the strong brass meridian, and you will find that each tenth degree on the equator will not come thither with it; but in the following order from ♈ to ♋, every tenth degree of the ecliptic comes sooner to the strong brass meridian than their corresponding tenths on the equator; those in the second quadrant of the ecliptic, from ♋ to ♎, come later, form ♎ to ♑ sooner, and from ♑ to Aries later, whilst those at the beginning of each quadrant come to the meridian at the same time; therefore the sun and clock would be equal at these four times, if the sun was not longer in passing through one half of the ecliptic than the other, and the two inequalities joined together, compose that difference which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the equation of time.</p>
                  <p>These causes are independent of each other, sometimes they agree, and at other times are contrary to one another.</p>
                  <p>The inequality of the natural day is the cause that clocks or watches are sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, sometimes behind the sun.</p>

A good and well-regulated clock goes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly on throughout the year, so as to mark the equal hours of a natural day, of a mean length; a sun-dial marks the hours of every day in such a manner, that every hour is a 24th part of the time between the noon of that day, and the noon of the day immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>The largest parallel of latitude on the terres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial globe, as well as the largest circle of decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on the celestial, that appears entire above the horizon of any place in north latitude, was called by the ancients the arctic circle, or circle of perpetual apparition.</p>
                  <p>Between the arctic circle and the north pole in the celestial sphere, are contained all those stars which never set at that place, and seem to us, by the rotative motion of the earth, to be perpetually carried round above our horizon, in circles parallel to the equator.</p>
                  <p>The largest parallel of latitude on the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:036757_0188_100B0578B3473E38"/>
and the largest parallel of declination on the celestial globe, which is entirely hid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the horizon of any place, was by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients called the antarctic circle, or circle of perpetual occultation.</p>
                  <p>This circle includes all the stars which never rise in that place to an inhabitant of the northern hemisphere, but are perpetually below the horizon.</p>
                  <p>All arctic circles touch their horizons in the north point, and all antarctic circles touch their horizons in the south point; which point, in the terrestrial and celestial spheres, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersection of the meridian and horizon.</p>
                  <p>If the elevation of the pole be 45 degrees, the most elevated part either of the arctic or antarctic circle will be in the zenith of the place.</p>
                  <p>If the pole's elevation be less than 45 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the zenith point of those places will fall without it's arctic or antarctic circle; if greater, it will fall within.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the nearer any place is to the equator, the less will it's arctic and antarctic circles be; and on the contrary, the farther any place is from the equator, the greater they are. So that,</p>
                  <p>At the poles, the equator may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as both an arctic and antarctic circle,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:036757_0189_100B057B1BB907D8"/>
because it's plane is coincident with that of the horizon.</p>
                  <p>But at the equator (that is, in a right sphere) there is neither arctic nor antarctic circle.</p>
                  <p>They who live under the northern polar circle, have the tropic of Cancer for their arc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and that of Capricorn for their antarctic circle.</p>
                  <p>And they who live on either tropic, have one of the polar circles for their arctic, and the other for their antarctic circle.</p>
                  <p>Hence, whether these circles fall within or without the tropics, their distance from the ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith of any place is ever equal to the difference between the pole's elevation, and that of the equator, above the horizon of that place.</p>
                  <p>From what has been said, it is plain there may be as many arctic and antarctic circles, as there are individual points upon any one meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, between the north and south poles of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Many authors have mistaken these mutable circles, and have given their names to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable polar circles, which last are arctic and antarctic circles, in one particular case only, as has been shewn.</p>

                  <p>By rectifying the globe to the latitude of the place, and turning it round on it's axis, it will be immediately evident, that the circle of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual apparition is that parallel of declination which is equal to the complement of the given latitude northward; and for the perpetual occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is the same parallel southward; that is to say, in other words, all those stars, whose declinations exceed the co-latitude, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be visible, or above the horizon; and all those in the opposite hemisphere, whose declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exceeds the co-latitude, never rise above the horizon.</p>
                  <p>For instance; in the latitude of London 51 deg. 30 min. whose co-latitude is 38 deg. 30 min. gives the parallels desired; for all those stars which are within the circle, towards the north pole, never descend below our horizon; and all those stars which are within the same circle, about the south pole, can never be seen in the latitude of London, as they never ascend above it's horizon.</p>

                  <p>The amplitude of the sun at rising and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting increases with the latitude of the place: and in very high northern latitudes, the sun scarce sets before he rises again. Homer had

               <p>The vertical point, that is, the uppermost point of the celestial globe, represents a point in the heavens, directly over our heads, which is called our zenith.</p>
               <p>From this point circular lines may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived crossing the horizon at right angles.</p>
               <p>These are called <hi>azimuth</hi> or <hi>vertical circles.</hi> That one which crosses the horizon at 10 deg. distance, from the meridian on either side, is called an azimuth circle of 10 deg.; that which crosses at 20, is called an azimuth of 20 deg.</p>
               <p>The azimuth of 90 deg. is called the <hi>prime vertical:</hi> it crosses the horizon at the eastern and western points.</p>
               <p>Any <hi>azimuth circle</hi> may be represented by the graduated edge of the brass quadrant of

                  <p>You will easily comprehend the reason of the foregoing distinction, because when the sun is in the equinoctial, it rises due east; but when it is in that part of the ecliptic which is towards the elevated pole, it rises before it is in the eastern vertical circle, and is therefore at that time <hi>above</hi> the horizon: whereas when it is in the other part of the ecliptic, it passes the eastern prime vertical before it rises, that is <hi>below</hi> the horizon; whence it is evident, that the opposite point of the ecliptic must then be in the west, and above the horizon.

Each star will then have the degree of it's right ascension directly upon the corresponding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of terrestrial longitude; their declination
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:036757_0211_100B05A4A38D8060"/>
will also be the same with the latitude of the places to which they answer; or, in other words, when the declination of a star is equal to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of a place, such star, within the space 24 hours, will pass vertically over that place and all others that have the same latitude.</p>
               <p>If we conceive the celestial investing globe to be fixed, and the terrestrial globe to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually turned from west to east, it is clear, that as the meridian of London passes from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another under the investing sphere, every star in the celestial sphere becomes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to another place upon the earth, and so on, until the earth has completed one diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal revolution; or till all the stars, by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent daily motion, have passed over every meridian of the terrestrial globe. From this view of the subject, an amazing variety, uniting in wonderful and astonishing harmony, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents itself to the attentive reader; and future ages will find it difficult to investigate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that should induce the present race of astron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omers to neglect a subject so highly interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to science, even in a practical view, but which in theory would lead them into more sublime speculations, than any that ever yet presented themselves to their minds.</p>

               <head>OF THE USE OF THE CELESTIAL GLOBE, IN PROBLEMS RELATIVE TO THE MOON.</head>
               <p>From the sun and planets we now proceed to those problems that concern the moon, the brilliant satellite of our earth, which every month enriches it with it's presence; by the mildness of it's light softening the darkness of
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:036757_0217_100B05B06E16B8A8"/>
night; by it's influence affecting the tide; and by the variety of it's aspects, offering to our view some very remarkable phenomena.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>"Soon as the ev'ning shades prevail,</l>
                  <l>The moon takes up the wond'rous tale;</l>
                  <l>And nightly to the lift'ning earth,</l>
                  <l>Repeats the story of her birth:</l>
                  <l>Whilst all the stars that round her burn,</l>
                  <l>And all the planets in their turn,</l>
                  <l>Confirm the tidings as they roll,</l>
                  <l>And spread the truth from pole to pole."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>As the orbit of the moon is constantly vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it's position, and the place of the node always changing, as her motion is even vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in every part of her orbit, the solutions of the problems which relate to her, are not altogether so simple as those which concern the sun.</p>
               <p>The moon increases her longitude in the ecliptic every day, about 13 degrees, 10 minutes, by which means she crosses the meridian of any place about 50 minutes later than she did the preceeding day.</p>
               <p>Thus if on any day at noon her place (lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude) be in the 12th degree of Taurus, it will be 13 deg. 10 min. more, or 25 deg. 10 min. in Taurus on the succeeding noon.</p>
               <p>It is new moon when the sun and moon
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:036757_0218_100B05B28820F2A8"/>
have the same longitude, or are in or near the same point of the ecliptic.</p>
               <p>When they have opposite longitudes, or are in opposite points of the ecliptic, it is full moon.</p>
               <p>To ascertain the moon's place with accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we must recur to an ephemeris; but as even in most ephemerides the moon's place is only shewn at the beginning of each day, or XII o'clock at noon, it becomes necessary to supply by a table this deficiency, and assign thereby her place for any intermediate time.</p>
               <p>In the nautical ephemeris, published under the authority of the Board of Longitude, we have the moon's place for noon and midnight, with rules for accurately obtaining any intermediate time; but as this ephemeris may not always be at hand, we shall insert, from Mr. Martin's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise on the globes, a table for finding the hourly motion of the moon. In order, however, to use this table, it will be necessary first <hi>to find the quantity of the moon's diurnal motion in the eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> for any given day; for the quantity of the moon's diurnal motion varies from about 11 deg. 46 min. the least, to 15 deg. 16. min. when greatest.</p>
               <p>The following tables are calculated from the least of 11 deg. 46 min. to the greatest of 15 deg. 16 min. every column increasing 10 minutes; upon the top of the column is the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:036757_0219_100B05B4E2539130"/>
quantity of the diurnal motion, and on the side of the table are the 24 hours, by which means it will be easy to find what part of the diurnal motion of the moon answers to any given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hours.</p>
               <p>Thus suppose the diurnal motion to be 12° 32′, look on the top column for the number nearest to it, which you will find to be 12° 36′, in the sixth column; and under it, against 9 hours, you will find 4 deg. 43 min. which is her motion in the ecliptic in the space of 9 hours for that day. The quantity of the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal motion for any day is found by taking the difference between it and the preceding day.</p>
               <p>Thus let the diurnal motion for the 11th of May, 1787, be required.</p>

The moon's path may be represented on the globe in a very pleasing manner, by tying a silken line over the surface of the globe exactly on the ecliptic; then finding, by an ephemeris, the place of the nodes for the given time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the silk at these two points, and at 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees distance from them elevate the line about 5¼ deg. from the ecliptic, and depress it as much on the other, and it will then represent the lunar orbit for that day.</p>

                  <p>First without an ephemeris, only knowing the age of the moon, which may be obrained from every common almanack.</p>
                  <p>Elevate the north pole of the celestial globe to 90 degrees, and then the equator will be in the plane of, and coincide with the broad paper circle; bring the first point of Aries, marked ♈ on the globe, to the day of the new moon on the said broad paper circle, which answers to the sun's place for that day; and the day of the moon's age will stand against the sign and degree of the moon's mean place; to which place apply a small patch to represent the moon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="unknown:036757_0223_100B05BEB947F890"/>
But if you are provided with an ephemeris,<note n="*" place="bottom">The nautical almanack is the best English ephemeris.</note> that will give the moon's latitude and place in the ecliptic; first note her place in the ecliptic upon the globe, and then counting so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees amongst the parallels in the zodiac, either above or below the ecliptic, as her latitude is north or south upon the given day, and that will be the point which represents the true place of the moon for that time, to which apply the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial sun, or a small patch.</p>
                  <p>Thus on the 11th of May, 1787, she was at noon in 2 deg. 35 min. of Pisces, and her lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude was 4 deg. 18 min.; but as her diurnal motion for that day is 12 48 in nine hours, she will have passed over 4 deg. 47 min. which added to her place at noon, gives 7h. 22 min. for her place on the 11th of May, at nine at night.</p>

                  <p>It is evident, this can happen only when the ascending node of the moon is in the vernal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinox; for then her greatest meridian altitude will be 5 deg. greater than that of the sun, and therefore about 67 deg.; also her least meridian altitude will be 5 deg. less than that of the sun, and therefore only 10 deg.: there will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be 57 deg. difference in the meridian alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the moon; whereas that of the sun is but 47 deg.</p>
                  <p>N. B. When the same ascending node is in the autumnal equinox, then will her meridian altitude differ by only 37 deg.; but this pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon can separately happen but once in the revolution of a node, or once in the space of nineteen years: and it will be a pleasant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to place the silken line to cross the ecliptic in the equinoctial points alternately; for then the reason will more evidently appear, why you observe the moon sometimes within 23 deg. of our zenith, and at other times not more than 10 deg. above the horizon, when she is full south.</p>

                  <head>PROBLEM XLIV.</head>
                  <head>To illustrate, by the globe, the phenomenon of the harvest moon.</head>
                  <p>About the time of the autumnal equinox, when the moon is at or near the full, she is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to rise almost at the same time for several nights together; and this phenomenon is called the <hi>harvest moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This circumstance, with which farmers were better acquainted than astronomers, till within these few years, they gratefully ascribed to the goodness of God, not doubting that he had ordered it on purpose to give them an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate supply of moon-light after sun-set, for their greater convenience in reaping the fruits of the earth.</p>
                  <p>In this instance of the harvest moon, as in many others discoverable by astronomy, the wisdom and beneficence of the Deity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, who really so ordered the course of the moon, as to bestow more or less light on all parts of the earth, as their several circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or seasons render it more or less service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ferguson's Astronomy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the equator, where there is no variety of seasons, moon-light is not necessary for ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in the produce of the ground; and
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:036757_0226_100B05C434B433E8"/>
there the moon rises about 50 minutes later every day or night than on the former. At considerable distances from the equator, where the weather and seasons are more uncertain, the autumnal full moons rise at sun-set from the first to the third quarter. At the poles, where the sun is for half a year absent, the winter full moons shine constantly without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, from the first to the third quarter.</p>
                  <p>But this observation is still further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, when we consider that this appearance is only peculiar with respect to the full moon, from which only the farmer can derive any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for in every other month, as well as the three autumnal ones, the moon, for several days together, will vary the time of it's rising very little; but then in the autumnal months this happens about the time when the moon is at the full; in the vernal months, about the time of new moon; in the winter months, about the time of the first quarter; and in the summer months, about the time of the last quarter.</p>
                  <p>These phenomena depend upon the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent angles made by the horizon, and different parts of the moon's orbit, and that the moon can be full but once or twice in a year, in those parts of her orbit which rise with the least an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
                  <p>The moon's motion is so nearly in the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:036757_0227_100B05C5C747EC10"/>
ecliptic, that we may consider her at present as moving in it.</p>
                  <p>The different parts of the ecliptic, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it's obliquity to the earth's axis, make very different angles with the horizon as they rise or set. Those parts, or signs, which rise with the smallest angles, set with the greatest, and <hi>vice versa.</hi> In equal times, whenever this angle is least, a greater portion of the ecliptic rises, than when the angle is larger.</p>
                  <p>This may be seen by elevating the globe to any considerable latitude, and then turning it round it's axis in the horizon.</p>
                  <p>When the moon, therefore, is in those signs which rise or set with the smallest angles, she will rise or set with the least difference of time; and with the greatest difference in those signs which rise or set with the greatest angles.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the latitude of London, at the time of the vernal equinox, when the sun is setting in the western part of the horizon, the ecliptic then makes an angle of 6<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deg. with the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; but when the sun is in the autumnal equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, and setting in the same western part of the horizon, the ecliptic makes an angle but of 15 deg. with the horizon; all which is evident by a bare inspection of the globe only.</p>
                  <p>Again, according to the greater or less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the ecliptic to the horizon, so a greater or less degree of motion of the globe
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:036757_0228_100B05C82B4A13B8"/>
about it's axis will be necessary to cause the same arch of the ecliptic to pass through the horizon; and consequently the time of it's passage will be greater or less, in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; but this will be best illustrated by an example.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, suppose the sun in the vernal equinox, rectify the globe for the latitude of London, and the place of the sun; then bring the vernal equinox, or sun's place, to the western edge of the horizon, and the hour index will point precisely to VI; at which time, we will also suppose the moon to be in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal equinox, and consequently at full, and rising exactly at the time of sun-set.</p>
                  <p>But on the following day, the sun, being advanced scarcely one degree in the ecliptic, will set again very nearly at the same time as before; but the moon will, at a mean rate, in the space of one day, pass over 13 deg. in her orbit; and therefore, when the sun sets in the evening after the equinox, the moon will be below the horizon, and the globe must be turned about till 13 deg. of Libra come up to the edge of the horizon, and then the index will point to 7h. 16 min. the time of the moon's rising, which is an hour and quarter after sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set for dark night. The next day following there will be 2½ hours, and so on successively, with an increase of 1¼ hour dark night each
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:036757_0229_100B05CA35532B38"/>
evening respectively, at this season of the year; all owing to the very great angle which the ecliptic makes with the horizon at the time of the moon's rising.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, suppose the sun in the autumnal equinox, or beginning of Libra, and the moon opposite to it in the vernal equinox, then the globe (rectified as before) being turned about till the sun's place comes to the western edge of the horizon, the index will point to VI, for the time of the setting, and the rising of the full moon on that equinoctial day. On the following day, the sun will set nearly at the same time; but the moon being advanced (in the 24 hours) 13 deg. in the ecliptic, the globe must be turned about till that arch of the eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic shall ascend the horizon, which motion of the globe will be very little, as the ecliptic now makes so small an angle with the horizon, as is evident by the index, which now points to VI h.17 min. for the time of the moon's rising on the second day, which is about a quarter of an hour after sun-set. The third day, the moon will rise within half an hour; on the fourth, within three quarters of an hour, and so on; so that it will be near a week before the nights will be an hour without illumination; and in greater latitudes this difference will be still greater, as you will easily find by varying the case, in the practice of this celebrated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, on the globe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="unknown:036757_0230_100B05CBC7A20290"/>
This phenomenon varies in different years; the moon's orbit being inclined to the ecliptic about five degrees, and the line of the nodes continually moving retrograde, the inclination of her orbit to the equator will be greater at some seasons than it is at others, which prevents her hastening, in each revolution, with an equal pace.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is another class or species of planets, which are called <hi>comets.</hi> These move round the sun in regular and stated periods of times, in the same manner, and from the same cause, as the rest of the planets do; that is, by a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripetal force, every where decreasing as the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:036757_0232_100B05D072294B18"/>
squares of the distances increase, which is the general law of the whole planetary system. But this centripetal force in the comets being compounded with the projectile force, in a very different ratio from that which is found in the planets, causes their orbits to be much more elliptical than those of the planets, which are almost circular.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may be the form of a comet's orbit in reality, their geocentric motions, or the apparent paths which they describe in the heavens among the fixed stars, will always be circular, and therefore may be shewn upon the surface of a celestial globe, as well as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and places of any of the rest of the planets.</p>
                  <p>To give an instance of the cometary praxis on the globe, we shall chuse that comet, for the subject of these problems, which made it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at Boston, in New England, in the months of October and November, 1758, in it's return to the sun; after which, it approached so near the sun, as to set <hi>heliacally,</hi> or to be lost in it's beams for some time spent in passing the perihelion. Then afterwards emerging from the solar rays, it appeared retrograde in it's course from the sun towards the latter end of March, and so continued the whole month of April, and part of May, in the West Indies, particularly in Jamacia, whose latitude ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:036757_0233_100B05D2027F05D8"/>
it visible in those parts, when it was, for the greatest part of the time, invisible to us, by reason of it's southern course through the heavens.</p>
                  <p>When two observations can be made of a comet, it will be very easy to assign it's course, or mark it out upon the surface of the celestial globe. These, with regard to the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned comet, we have, and they are sufficient for our purpose in regard to the solution of cometary problems.</p>
                  <p>By an observation made at Jamaica on the 31st of March, 1759, at five oclock in the morning, the comet's altitude was found to be 22 deg. 50 min. and it's azimuth 71 deg. south-east. From hence we shall find its place on the surface of the globe by the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem.</p>

But rectifying the globe for the latitude of London, the path of the said comet will be for the most part invisible, or below the horizon; and therefore it could not have been seen in our latitude, but at times very near the beginning and end of it's appearance; because, by bringing the comet's path on one part to the south point of the horizon, it will immediately appear in what part the comet ceases to be visible; and then bringing the other part of the path to the point, it will appear in what part it will again become visible.</p>
