            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE I ſent you my Remarks of the 23d of <hi>April,</hi> I have farther conſidered the preſent State of the Country, and had ſome new Tho'ts upon it. I was then of Opinion that Emitting more Province Bills, would but Encreaſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long our Miſeries, and therefore could not chooſe but be againſt it. And I am ſure ſtill that to Emit more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Publick or Private Scheme that hath been yet Projected, will do ſo. I am ſure alſo that to leave off Truſting as far as it is practicable enough to do it, would in ſome time effectually ſet all things to rights again. However I am ſenſible that in the mean time many People muſt undergo conſiderable Straits and Difficulties. If therefore any way could be contrived to Emit more Province Bills without running into thoſe Fatal Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which have attended former Projects of this Nature, or into others as bad, I ſhould rejoyce in it as much as any Man in the Province. And upon ſome Application of Thought to this Matter, I hope I have hit upon a Project by which <hi>an Hundred Thouſand Pounds of Bills may be Emitted, in ſuch a manner as to raiſe their Credit Equal to Silver, and to bring an Hundred Thouſand Pounds of Silver into the Country in a few Years.</hi> When I have had Opportunity to draw my Tho'ts upon this matter into Form, I intend to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the Publick Cenſure. In the mean time I have met with <hi>Some</hi> Remarks (of the 16th. of <hi>May</hi>) upon my Remarks: Theſe I think it may not be amiſs to take ſome Notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002190_0003_0FBCCC65A80B57C0"/>My Controverſy with Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> was not ſo much whither <hi>Boſton</hi> in Fact labour'd under great Diſtreſſes; As whither he had not aſſigned wrong Cauſes of theſe Diſtreſſes? Becauſe aſſigning wrong Cauſes of Real Evils, is the way to lead into wrong Meaſures to Remedy them.</p>
            <p>Whither the Gentleman hath juſtly repreſented the Opinion of the Country; Or whither the People are of one mind where he hath Travel'd, and of another where I have Liv'd I ſuppoſe time will diſcover.</p>
            <p>He ſays I have done well to add the word SOME to my Remarks. I believe he ſpeaks as he thinks, for he hath imitated me in well doing in this matter. So hath he imitated the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> alſo which he ſpeaks of, by paſſing in ſilence thoſe things which I ſuppoſe he found it hard to anſwer. But I muſt confeſs I am a Man ſo far ſhort of a <hi>Common Underſtanding,</hi> that tho' I have carefully reviewed Mr. <hi>Colman's</hi> Pamphlet, I cannot find what <hi>thoſe Important Matters are, which are not toucht upon.</hi> I muſt therefore borrow our Author's Expreſſion in Page 11, <hi>I am ſorry to find that he was for general Terms upon this head and did not care to deſcend to Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I diſlike the Perſonal Reflections in <hi>the Poſtcript</hi> as much as our Author does; but whither he might not have put in the Word <hi>SOME</hi> between <hi>Juſtified by</hi> and <hi>Men of every Rank &amp; Order,</hi> as properly and with as much Truth as in his Title Page I leave to others to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Anſwer the Anſwers would take up too much time, &amp;c.</hi> If the Gentleman himſelf thinks his own Remarks to be no Anſwers, I ſuppoſe he will eaſily get moſt other Men to be of his mind. But then why he ſhould trouble the World with his Remarks I can't well imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſaith you have repreſented Things in a ſmart and moving manner, by which I perceive he thought the Town felt the truth of what you have written, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo is beyond my Comprehenſion! Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> writ ſmartly, therefore what he writ was true and felt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002190_0004_0FBCCC67A68FFE78"/>
by the Town. If there was danger of Mr. <hi>Colman's</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, I think there is not much of this Gentlemans Logick. I ſuppoſe he knows that ſharp Writing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times irritates Men's Paſſions, and creates Heats and Animoſities where there is no juſt cauſe for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the ill uſes which have been made of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills, and the unhappy Conſequences reſulting therefrom, I ſhall not run into the Argument, it being nothing to the preſent Caſe.</hi> I think Sir nothing can be more to the preſent Caſe, than to let the Country know truly how we came into ſuch a Caſe; for unleſs we know what bro't us into our preſent Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I am ſure we ſhall not be like to ſee our way very clearly out again. But if the Gentleman thinks it a ſufficient excuſe for not <hi>running into an Argument,</hi> which perhaps it might not be very eaſy to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of again, to ſay that it is nothing to the preſent Caſe; at that rate he might have ſav'd himſelf from much trouble, and others from ſome expence, by only putting an Advertiſement into the News-Letter and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zett, That my Remarks <hi>were all nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe</hi>—.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Province Bills received their deadly wound the Day they were firſt invented, &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe our Author himſelf remembers when for many Days the Merchants themſelves would upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, give Silver for them without receiving any advance, and thank ye too. It was ſometime (tho' indeed not very long) before they ſeem'd to underſtand the Advantage put into their hands to Export the Silver.</p>
            <p>But how came the Province Bills to receive this <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound?</hi> Why, <hi>Becauſe they were not made a lawful Tender,</hi> Or becauſe there was not a Law made that they ſhould Anſwer Specialties. If ſuch a Law had been made, it would not have ſignifyed much towards keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Credit of them. Since the Importation of Foreign Commodities hath been greater than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the Country would Anſwer for, there hath been a neceſſity that Silver ſhould go to help make the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002190_0005_0FBCCC68A55AAAF8"/>
Ballance, and while there was a neceſſity of this, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Bills muſt needs have been improved to Buy it up. And this would unavoidably have made a difference in a ſhort time between Province Bills and Silver, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Act for making them a Lawful Tender. Now if ſuch an Act could not have kept up the Credit of them, I am ſure it would ſoon have been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of much Injuſtice and Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>What he alludes to about the <hi>Canada Expedition,</hi> I cannot tell. But I ſuppoſe the <hi>Poor Men</hi> ſpent their Wages quickly after they got home, and the Gentleman knows that the Credit of our Bills was not <hi>then</hi> ſunk near ſo low, as it hath been ſince the Poſt-poning the Taxes and the Emiſſion of Loan Money.</p>
            <p>IT IS THE INTEREST OF THE MERCHANTS TO RUN DOWN THE VALUE OF THE PUBLICK BILLS, IN ORDER TO GET MONEY BY THEM. <hi>If this be the Caſe,</hi> then as Things ſtand at preſent, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will cure this evil Practice but a Scarcity of the Bills. When once Merchants really find the want of them, they will ſoon prize them high enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The GREAT ARGUMENT with me for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bank is, that it would be in the Hands of A MUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITUDE of Men, whoſe Intereſt it would be to ſupport the Credit of their Bills, &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Province Bills are in the hands of at leaſt as great a Multitude. And I believe that every Man that owns a Province Bill wiſhes it were as good to him as Silver, and is ready to uſe any means which he thinks may conduce to make it ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas it is and always will be the Intereſt of every Private Man to undervalue the Publick Bills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Selling his Silver to the higheſt Bidder, &amp;c.</hi> This again is quite out of my reach! One wou'd imagine by this, that every Private Man in the Country hath, and always will have Silver to Sell. If every Man Sells Silver, pray who are the Bidders for it, and who the higheſt Bidders? The Gentleman ſays afterwards, that <hi>perhaps I am a Sallary Man.</hi> I aſſure him I am not;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002190_0006_0FBCCC6A26B5D9E0"/>
but I don't know but that ſome will ſuſpect him, from this Paſſage, to be a Seller of Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am fully of the Gentlemans mind, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible either the Town or Country ſhould ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Medium or other.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Bank Bills ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any Scheme projected yet, will ſerve the turn better than Province Bills, I am ſure his <hi>Great</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above don't prove.</p>
            <p>What the Gentleman ſaith about our Burthening Trade with heavy Duties, I won't my ſelf call <hi>Evaſion, Miſrepreſentation &amp; Amuſement.</hi> Let the Reader call it what he thinks fit. I gave Two Reaſons for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the Trade of Boſton, that ſo People might know that their Diſtreſſes were not owing wholly to the want of Medium. He paſſes one in ſilence. <hi>As any wiſe Man would.</hi> The other he would fain ſhift quite away to other Provinces, and lay blame on our own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He don't tell us concerning <hi>Newbury, Ipſwich, Cape-Ann, Marblehead, Salem,</hi> (not to mention other Places;) all within our own Province, that none of them carried on ſo large a Foreign Trade during the late French War as they do now, and that ſome of them carried on no Foreign Trade at all: but he would make us believe that by heavy Duties we have driven away Trade to our Neighbours. What are theſe heavy Duties laid upon? I ſuppoſe he won't ſay upon Engliſh Goods. Perhaps the Taverners and Retailers may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member for him, that there is an heavy Exciſe upon Rum, Brandy, &amp;c. But this is nothing to the Importer, but to the Retailer of theſe Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gentlemen ſays, I make a great noiſe about giving Twelve Shillings an Ounce for Silver.</hi> P. 6. When I am convinced that I have made more than there is cauſe for, I ſhall be very ſorry for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He don't believe Three Thouſand Pounds of Silver per Annum, comes into the Province, &amp;c.</hi> I can tell him the Gentleman (of very conſiderable Trade) that affirms upon his own knowledge that above <hi>l.</hi> 10000. came in laſt Year from one Place. And there are enough in the Town
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002190_0007_0FBCCC6BA6B4E3C8"/>
that can tell him the ſingle Ship which not very long ſince carried <hi>l.</hi> 10000. at once away; but Providence frown'd upon the Cargo and ſunk it in the Sea.</p>
            <p>What Myſtery there may be in <hi>laying Fiſh in one Pile and Province Bills in another,</hi> I cannot tell. But the laſt Price Currant in the Gazette tells me Fiſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable 26. <hi>s.</hi> per Quintal and riſing, and now it is 28 <hi>s.</hi> this looks as if the Pile of Bills held out pretty well. I my ſelf can tell the Men who paid Thirty Pounds a Ton for Oil laſt Week, and are ready to do ſo again this Week. If Tarr and Turpentine lie a little upon hand, it is only becauſe our Correſpondents abroad write us that they won't anſwer there. In ſhort my Argument in the 17th Page of my former Letter is founded upon the matter of Fact. I believe we have yet Province Bills enow to buy up all the Produce of the Country fit for Exportation, and all the Silver and Gold beſides, becauſe we have ſeen it done from Year to Year, and ſee it ſtill a doing every Day. However the Gentleman is of another Opinion, and muſt tell me ſo, tho' he gives no reaſon for it. Now whither his Opinion without any Reaſon, or my Reaſon founded on daily Obſervation will weigh moſt, I muſt leave to others to judge. For my own part I am ſenſible enough that if there be no more Bills Emitted, and if no way can be found to bring and keep Silver in the Country again, there will really be a pinching Scarcity of Medium in Time: but as yet I have never met with any good Reaſon to think but that we have Province Bills enough for any thing but to pay Labourers in Boſton, and Debts contracted by virtue of long Credit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Gentleman ſeems much concerned at your touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Law to ſhorten Credit, &amp;c.</hi> I am ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have proved that the Welfare of the Country depends upon ſhortening it yet more, and that doing this will remedy divers Evils which nothing elſe will.</p>
            <p>I have no inclination to aggravate Mr. <hi>Colmans</hi> fault, nor to incenſe the Goverment againſt his Vindicator, and ſo I ſhall make to Reflection on what follows next

(which it may be ſome will call <hi>Amuſement</hi>) and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Paſſages that look the ſame way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not the Plenty of Bills, but the Scarcity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns is the cauſe of Silver and Gold's being bought up and Ship'd off, &amp;c.</hi> A Strong Argument this if true, for ſhortening Credit; for we ſee that tho' the Providence of God out our ſhort Returns, yet Traders if left to their own way will continue to Import as much as ever. By this means the Silver and Gold is gone already, and if Truſting be allow'd our Lands will go too in a ſhort time. But after all I muſt tell the Gentleman, that if the Merchants had not Province Bills enough to ſpare, they would not buy Silver and Gold with them. For he and every Body elſe know well enough that what Men ſtand in real need of they value, and are loth to part with, and therefore if the Merchants really wanted Province Bills to carry on their Trade ſo much as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, they would never be ſo Prodigal of them.</p>
            <p>Again is our Scarcity of Returns Real or only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative? If only Comparative I have told him already how that came to paſs in the 2d. and 3d. Pages of my former Letter. There I told him that when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment firſt Emitted Province Bills, the Traders quickly improved the Advantage put into their hands to Import Foreign Commodities, in far greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities than the Produce of Country wou'd make Returns for, &amp;c. Thus Returns became Comparatively Scarce, and ſo Silver and Gold was bought up with the Province Bills, and Shipp'd off, to make Returns with. But this is an Argument, which our Author (<hi>like a Wiſe Man</hi>) cared not to run into, and therefore tho't it <hi>nothing to the preſent Caſe</hi>; I ſhall not therefore purſue him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it.</p>
            <p>Our Author thinks the Scarcity of Returns to be Real, and tells me I don't conſider we have loſt our <hi>Bay Trade.</hi> I confeſs I did not conſider it, for I knew we had had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Veſſels from the Bay this Year already; and One of them was in the Harbour but Laſt Week. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that the Bay Trade was no ſuch mighty Article
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002190_0009_0FBCCC6ED40E8D50"/>
as he pretends. The Spaniards have always in time of Peace, as well as War, given us all the Diſturbance they could in it.</p>
            <p>The failing of our <hi>Newfoundland Trade</hi> is owing in a great meaſure to the failing of the Fiſhery there of late Years; upon which account the Number of People is much diminiſht, and conſequently their Demands for Proviſions. But if our Trade thither be leſſen'd by this means, yet the failure of the Fiſhery <hi>there,</hi> hath brought <hi>our</hi> Fiſh to a better Market.</p>
            <p>Our Author goes on to tell me, <hi>That the Reaſon European Goods are ſo high of late, is,</hi> (1.) <hi>Becauſe there are not near ſo many Imported as formerly.</hi> (2.) <hi>The Scarcity of Returns helps alſo to keep up their Prizes, &amp;c.</hi> The putting theſe Two Articles ſo near together hath quite ruin'd all the Cauſe. I doubt Men of <hi>but a common Underſtanding</hi> will be vain enough to imagine they ſee an inconſiſtency. It will be very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to enquire, if the Importation be ſo ſmall, how come Returns to be ſo ſcarce? One wou'd think the Produce of the Country might well enough anſwer a <hi>ſmall</hi> Importation. What need then of buying Gold and Silver too to help? In ſhort let the Importation be greater or leſs, if it be more than, the Produce of the Country alone will make Returns for, it is too great ſtill for the Welfare of the Country; and while it continues ſo, all the fine Projects in the World won't bring us to ſee Good Days again; for how is it poſſible if the Country in general ſpends more than it can pay for?</p>
            <p>The Gentleman finds fault <hi>that I do not tell what theſe convenient Reaſons are, at which I ſay a Cry is made THAT THE BILLS ARE HOARDED, &amp;c.</hi> I will tell him now if he needs Information. When Meaſures have been well concerted to make a vigorous Effort for a Private or a Publick Bank, then ſome time before the next Seſſion of the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſpecial care has been taken from time to time to make People ſenſible of all their Diſtreſſes. Tho' ſome of the Diſtreſſes have been ſuch as the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002190_0010_0FBCCC702ACBA488"/>
made no Complaint of, nor tho't any thing about, 'till <hi>more ſenſible Perſons</hi> put them in mind of them. Among other Artifices uſual at ſuch times, People have been told that the Bills are hoarded.</p>
            <p>If the Bills are indeed hoarded, I could not imagine any Men under ſo much Temptation to unfair Dealing in this matter, as thoſe that employ a great Number of Labourers, for the Reaſon given in my former Letter, Page 18, 19. However, I am far from charging them with it. I ſay there plainly, that I don't know that any ſuch Thing hath been practis'd. If our Author hath found another Sett of Men, whom he <hi>knows</hi> to be guilty. I have nothing to plead in their Excuſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only obſerve a Paſſage which to me (perhaps for want of underſtanding,) ſeems to be an inconſiſtency. He tells us <hi>thoſe who advance the Price of Silver and Gold hurt us</hi>; and he ſays very true: but how came our Author to be of this mind? In his <hi>Great</hi> Argument for a Private Bank, Page 5. He tells us <hi>that it is and always will be the Intereſt of every Private Man to undervalue the Publick Bills by Selling his Silver to the higheſt Bidder.</hi> If this be the Intereſt of <hi>Every Private Man,</hi> then it is the Intereſt of the Country in General; for all the Private Perſons contain'd in it, will make up the whole Country; How then could our Author think <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Price of Silver hurts us?</hi> Now let the Reader ſay how well it becomes a Gentleman who writes at this Extraordinary rate, to wiſh others to <hi>write per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,</hi> and to charge them with <hi>Evaſions, Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, Amuſements &amp; Trifling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next Place he makes himſelf merry with my Project to leave off Truſting. In this place (like a wiſe Man) I ſhall forbear <hi>running into this Argument,</hi> but I doubt I ſhall be playing the Fool again before I have done my Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Reaſons given againſt a Private Bank I think are not unanſwerable. However I ſhall not enter upon that Argument, &amp;c.</hi> Wiſely done! Arguments are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Things. When a Man don't Know but that they
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002190_0011_0FBCCC71A67AB158"/>
may prove unanſwerable, it is much ſafeſt to let them alone. But perhaps the Gentleman may wave <hi>this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the preſent,</hi> hoping it will again be <hi>driven fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at a Convenient Seaſon,</hi> where (it may be) he thinks I ſhall not be preſent to defend my Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Private Bank under the Inſpection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wou'd not be liable to that Objection,</hi> viz. <hi>That it will be in the power of the Bankers, to accompliſh any of their own Private Deſigns, &amp;c.</hi> I believe any Man that duly conſiders the power of Money to byaſs Men's Thot's, and pervert their Actions will be of another mind.</p>
            <p>I think <hi>I did not miſ-underſtand the Propoſal of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, &amp;c.</hi> For where People are Settled down already, it ſounds pretty odd to me, to talk of <hi>Encouraging them to ſit down.</hi> Therefore I underſtood it of Settling Places as yet Unſettled. But be that as it will; I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire that what is already Settled (under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Government) may be well protected. If any great matters could be done at raiſing Proviſions in the Eaſtern Country, it would be a great Benefit to Boſton, for Supplies may be brought in from thence, at almoſt any time in Winter, which cannot be done from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. However I hope ſpecial Care will be taken that no Settlements be made, without the Allowance and Direction of the Government: for if People may go of their own Heads, and Settle where-ever they claim a Right, the Eaſtern Frontier will quickly be ſo Enlarged, that ſeveral Thouſand Men will not be enough to defend it, in caſe we ſhould have another Indian War.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman hath now almoſt done with <hi>me</hi>; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall take notice of a few Things more in <hi>him,</hi> as I turn him over. In the 10th. Page he reckons up a terrible Catalogue of Evils, that will come upon us, <hi>when once the Bills are all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ve off Truſting, as far as it <hi>may be left well enough,</hi> and Silver will come in, and ſtay among us, to ſucceed the Province Bills as they are gradually call'd in. I ſhall tell how this may be done preſently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002190_0012_0FBCCC7327235150"/>In his 11th. Page he ſays the ſhort Anſwer in the News-Letter, which did but juſt hint at things, <hi>gives no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Miſchiefs a Private Bank would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us in.</hi> I deſire the Gentleman to look back to the 6th Page of my former Letter, and read it carefully. Then let him turn to the 20th &amp; 21ſt Pages, and he will in thoſe Three Pages (I hope) find miſchiefs enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt need in. When he was at thoſe Places, <hi>He wiſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined entering upon the Argument,</hi> yet now He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains <hi>that we are all for general Terms upon this Head, and don't care to deſcend to Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what cou'd the Gentleman mean, &amp;c.</hi> Page 12. I ſuppoſe he meant that Bridges, Fortifications, &amp;c. are <hi>great and expenſive</hi> Works. See Diſtreſſed State, pag. 8.</p>
            <p>In his 13th. Page, He tells us that Country People ſay <hi>that they can't improve their Lands for want of Money to hire Labourers, &amp;c.</hi> I think he tells us elſewhere that he hath lately <hi>travel'd in the Country.</hi> I alſo have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd in the Country, and liv'd in it too, but never heard this Complaint before. I have often heard in many parts of the Country, from very intelligent Perſons, that it was an hard matter to find Labourers: and that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was ſo dear, that it turned to little or no Account to improve their Lands, if they muſt hire Labour. But I never heard before that they could not get Money to hire Labourers with, if they would work at a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rate. The Gentlemen of our General Aſſembly will be the proper Judges of this matter.</p>
            <p>I heartily join with the Gentleman in his wiſhes that all would ſincerely ſtudy the Publick Good, and that Men of Wiſdom, Fidelity and an Excellent Spirit may be choſen Counſellours; and that the Governour and General Aſſembly may have the Guidance and Bleſſing of Heaven in their Conſultations for our Welfare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Something muſt be done, or the Place will ſink and the Trade come to nothing, &amp;c.</hi> I queſtion not but the Caſe of Boſton is really very bad, but how comes it to be ſo? If the Gentleman can obtain an Act of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly to cruſh the <hi>Foreign Trade</hi> of other Towns
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002190_0013_0FBCCC74B18DBAE0"/>
of this Province, which begins now to grow ſo big; and it he can prevail to have Country People diſcouraged from making their own Cloaths ſo much as of late they begin to do; Boſton will revive it's Trade, without the help of either Private or Publick Bank. But after all I hope and believe the ruin of Boſton is not ſo near, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſeems to apprehend. The Trade of Boſton is leſſen'd for the Reaſons juſt hinted at. And I ſuppoſe as the Town in General, ſo particular Gentlemen in it find their Buſineſs contracted conſiderably. Now when Men find their Means to be growing leſs than they have ſometimes been (tho' they may be like to be ſufficient ſtill, to live very well upon) yet (I ſay in ſuch a Caſe) they are very apt to be in a Fright and to think Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Ruin are coming upon them like an Armed Man. And I believe this is pretty much the preſent Caſe of Boſton.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman returns at length once more to me, and with great Sagacity <hi>perceives that all I drive at is, only that by calling in the Bills ſome Men may have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get their Neighbours hands at half Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, &amp;c.</hi> I have told him in my former Letter, page 18. that ſuch a Thing will never be effected. But I ſhall take this occaſion to Explain that matter a little more. If any Men ſet their Province Bills lie by them unimproved, in expectation that the Scarcity of them, will in a while raiſe their Value equal to Silver, I dare not charge them for it, with the Sin of <hi>Ahab in the matter of Naboths Vineyard,</hi> becauſe the Bills really ought to be in value equal to Silver, as the Inſcription of them tells us they ſhall be: and every Poſſeſſor of them is more or leſs a ſufferer in that in Fact they are not ſo. But who the Men are that may be like to do thus by any great quantities of the Bills I can't pretend to gueſs. I can truly clear my ſelf, and ſay that the few I have are imploy'd in Trade. And the Gentlemen in Trade I believe will Generally deny themſelves to be hoarders. As for the Gentlemen that Let their Money at Intereſt, I can ſee no Policy in <hi>their</hi> Letting their Bills lie unimproved neither. For by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002190_0014_0FBCCC762697A768"/>
Letting them out they increaſe their number, and ſo will have more to make an Advantage of, if an Opportunity ſhould preſent. Thus becauſe I could never ſee whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt it was to hoard the Bills, I have taken the Cry about it, to be only a Stratagem to create Diſcontent and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities among the People, and ſo promote ſome Politick Deſigns.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe I am miſtaken in this, and ſome Men really do hoard Bills expecting to make an Advantage of it, yet they will never get their Neighbours Lands at half Value. A Scarcity of Bills may poſſibly raiſe their Value equal to Silver, and no Body will be wrong'd by this, for this is the Value they ought to go at. But if it once comes to this, the Man hath a mind to think hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Government, who won't believe that it will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Mortgages to be redeemed and Taxes to be paid in the Produce of the Country or in Silver. In Silver (I ſay) for I hope before that Day, it will begin to ſtay, and to paſs from Man to Man in the Country.</p>
            <p>I return therefore according to promiſe to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal about the Limitation of Credit, and indeed had it not been for for the ſake of Explaining my tho't better about that matter, I ſhould hardly have given my ſelf or you the trouble of this Second Letter. I underſtand that I have been miſtaken to intend that no Credit at all ſhou'd be given, becauſe I have expreſſed my ſelf in too ſtrong terms in one or two places; tho' afterwards I ſpeak only of ſhortening it as much as poſſible.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that ſome Credit is abſolutely neceſſary among Traders. And indeed if it were practicable to make ſuch a difference, it wou'd anſwer all the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, if Credit were forbidden only to the Conſumers of Foreign Commodities. For if the Conſumers are not Truſted, then none of them can ſpend more than they can Earn. And if ſome of them wont ſpend ſo much, then all things will follow of courſe (as is argued in the 10, 11, and 12. pages of my former Letter) let the Traders carry on how they will among themſelves. But to make ſuch a difference is impracticable, becauſe Traders themſelves
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002190_0015_0FBCCC77AD9C9708"/>
are generally ſome of the greateſt Conſumers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Thouſand Sh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s would ſoon be found to Evade the Law, which no precautions could ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt.</p>
            <p>As to the Time it might be proper to reſtrain Credit to, I am aſſured that ſome Subſtantial Traders in the Town (who have as great Payments to make as almoſt any Men in New England) think it might well enough be Limitted to Six Months, but ſuppoſing it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to run to Nine, or even to Twelve, and ſtop there, I believe it would have all the deſired Effects. For as the Law wou'd not allow it's running beyond that time, ſo the general practice wou'd reſtrain it to ſomething ſhorter Limits. And if it were reſtrained in the way I ſhall propoſe preſently, the natural operation or the thing wou'd be ſuch, that Truſting wou'd become daily more and more diſuſed. And the leſs Truſting ſhall be practiſed, the better Circulation what Money we have will be put into, and ſo there will be the leſs need or temptation to Truſt.</p>
            <p>I don't propoſe that an Act to ſhorten Credit ſhou'd have regard to any thing that is <hi>paſt,</hi> but only that it ſhould look <hi>forward</hi> to ſuch Debts as ſhall be contracted after the paſſing ſuch an Act. However, even ſo I know it will be a very ungratefu Propoſal to moſt Gentlemen that have already entangled their Affairs, or that are going upon vaſt Undertakings, or that are Ambitious and Reſolved to Extend their Trade and Encreaſe the Importation of Foreign Commodities by all ways poſſible, whither their Country ſinks or ſwims: but I earneſtly deſire that all others, and even ſuch as theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo far as they can forego their preſent private Intereſt for the Publick Good, in expectation of proſpering together with the Publick hereafter, would conſider deliberately the certainty and ſafety of the Propoſal.</p>
            <p>For to ſee the certainty of the good Effects of ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Credit, pleaſe to look again on the 10, 11, 12, &amp; 13. pages of my former Letter.</p>
            <p>As to the ſafety of the Propoſal I think no Man can
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002190_0016_0FBCCC7928AB1260"/>
doubt of this: whereas both the Publick and Private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which have hitherto been ſet on foot (conſidering the dependent ſtate of this Country) have always been thought by many wiſe Men, liable to very dangerous Conſequences. It were eaſy to inſtance in Particulars: but I forbear, partly becauſe it would ſwell this Letter too much, but principally becauſe I wou'd not put an Argument againſt us for what hath been done already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Man's mouth.</p>
            <p>But how ſhall Truſting be reſtrain'd in a natural and eaſy way? Why, ſuppoſing it be done Effectually it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not much what ſafe way it is done in. However till ſome better way be tho't on, I humbly propoſe that after a Debt hath been contracted ſo long as the Law ſhall direct, Ten per Cent. Intereſt ſhould be allow'd till it be paid.</p>
            <p>I believe Sir, you ſtart at the Propoſal, and think it the moſt unhappy one I could have hit on. But if you can have patience deliberately and calmly to read and weigh what I have to ſay upon it, I flatter my ſelf that before you have done, you won't think it a thing ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and Formidable, as very likely it will appear to moſt Men at the firſt glance.</p>
            <p>For firſt, it is no unreaſonable Favour to the Trader, who had rather have his Money to improve, than have it lying out, tho' at Ten per Cent Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly the intention of ſuch a Law, is not to give Ten per Cent Intereſt to the Seller, but to prevent the Buyer's running farther into Debt than he ſees any way of getting out again, in a reaſonable time. Now why any wiſe and honeſt Man ſhould deſire to do thus or ſhould think himſelf wrong'd by being diſcouraged from it I can't well imagine.</p>
            <p>Beſides 'tis certain no Law is too ſevere &amp; ſtrict, that does but juſt attain the Good End for which it was Enacted. Now if it be plain that continuing to Truſt one another as we have done for many Years paſt will unavoidably ruin the Country in a ſhort time (which may eaſily be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if it be not ſufficiently done already in my former
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002190_0017_0FBCCC7AA5FB05C0"/>
Letter) thence it neceſſarily follows, that if Ten per Cent. Intereſt won't put an Effectual ſtop to this practice, then ſuch a Law wou'd really not be ſevere enough, but the Intereſt ought to be encreaſed (provided no better Remedy can be found) rather than the Country ſhould be ruin'd. But if upon Trial allowing ſuch an Intereſt for Book Debts be found Effectually to ſtop Truſting and Running into Debt; then ſuppoſing even Fifty per Cent Intereſt were allow'd no body would be hurt by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Body would keep clear of the danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to pay it.</p>
            <p>But indeed the natural and neceſſary Operation of the Thing would be ſuch, that if Ten per Cent Intereſt were allow'd by Law for Book Debts, it wou'd certainly put an effectual ſtop to Truſting among all Wiſe and Honeſt Men; and ſo none but Knaves and Tools cou'd poſſibly be in danger by it. And 'tis highly probable that the former of theſe wou'd be kept more Honeſt and the latter be made wiſer by the Terror of it.</p>
            <p>For the Buyer that would lie in Debt at the loſs of Ten per Cent Intereſt, rather than borrow at Six per Cent to pay his Debt, ſuch a Buyer (I ſay) wou'd by his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor immediately be tho't a Pool or a Knave, or one that cou'd not obtain Credit enough to be Truſted with Money at Intereſt, therefore the Creditor wou'd never venture to let a Debt he in ſuch a Man's hands but wou'd immediately Demands it of him, and force him to a Payment.</p>
            <p>On the other hand if the Seller to encourage taking a large quantity of Goods off his hands, ſhould promiſe the Buyer, to Truſt him a Year or two beyond the time fixt by Law, without demanding any Intereſt, yet no wiſe Man would venture to lie in Debt upon this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. For tho' he may firmly believe his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, to be a Man of his Word, yet ſince he knows not how ſoon he may be taken away by Death, therefore he can't be ſafe after the time preſcribed by Law is expired; becauſe if his Creditor ſhould die ſuddenly, he hath no ſecurity that thoſe who ſucced him, won't take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002190_0018_0FBCCC7C244E76D0"/>
which the Law gives them. For it can't be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that a Creditor who hath his Eyes in his head, will ordinarily venture by an Inſtrument under his hand, to put it out of his own and his Succeſſors power, to demand a Debt, whatever neceſſity for it may happen to ariſe, either from his own or his Debtors Circumſtances. Now unleſs it be put out of the Creditor's power to Demand it; the Debtor can't be ſecure, that the Advantage of the Law won't be taken.</p>
            <p>Again the Merchant who Sells large quantities of Goods at once to the Shopkeeper may very conveniently take the Benefit of the Law, and demand Intereſt of the Shopkeeper, if he lies in his Debt after the Expiration of the ſet time. But the Shopkeeper who Retails ſmall parcels of Goods, at ſundry times, to many Perſons, ſcattered up and down the Country, and ſome of them in other Provinces too; will find ſo much vexation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and impracticableneſs in Demanding Intereſt of theſe Conſumers for their petty Debts, at ſundry times contracted; that being himſelf ſo Obnoxious to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant (as is ſaid before) he will certainly never dare to truſt any Body, but will fell only for ready Money. Now if the Shopkeeper takes ready Money for all he ſells, he can then as well pay the Merchant as not; unleſs he is ſo fooliſh as to ſpend more in his Family than his Advance upon his Goods will anſwer for. And if he does ſo, he will ſoon ruin himſelf, whither he pays Intereſt or not.</p>
            <p>From theſe Things it ſeems plain, that if a Law to allow ſuch Intereſt were Enacted, it would compleatly attain its end, to put an effectual ſtop to Truſting, in ſuch a natural and neceſſary way, that hardly any Body wou'd ever come to ſuffer the Penalty of it. And then certainly no Body hath any reaſon to fear it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon the whole, Extravagant Importing and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Foreign Commodities hath undone us, &amp; wou'd ſoon impoveriſh the beſt Country in the World. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Truſting hath made way for the practice of theſe Evils. The General Court cannot take away the inclination of the People to ſuch Extravagancies;
