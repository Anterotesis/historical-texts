            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To know that at this moment throughout our exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive continent a great and happy people are assembled round the altar of freedom to offer before it that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense most acceptable to heaven<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a grateful heartâ€”To see them in the sublime delight of their souls stretch forth their hands as one man and swear to preserve the liberty with which God ha<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

The blood of a hermit grows warm at it, and the countenance of angels becomes animated!</p>

as any in the world. The consciousness that you despise the sword as the criterion of truth among yourselves, and have submitted, and can again submit your greatest questions to your own discretion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> while it is elevating every feature of the individual, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring foreign honours for the nation. And the high minded moderation which you are called upon to preserve, evincing the value you place upon the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment which it attends upon, is slowly proving to the world the possibility of a republican, and the steadiness of a balanced, constitution. Time will come, when, after suitable trials and escapes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the public mind will be versed in difficulty and familiar with resources, when there will be no more self-denial in doing right; and then the will of Heaven will be accomplished that mankind shall perceive that knowledge, not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, freedom not slavery, is the true secret of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
            <p>It was indeed fortunate for these <hi>now</hi> United States, when in the order of things the time of emancipation from the state of pupillage was come, that they were furnished with as good forms of government as any which then existed. From a rigid and unreasonable parent they had inherited good constitutions at least, and such as after passing the ordeal of philosophy have only become a little more popular than before. I am aware that same will expect from the speaker a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that has now become improper.

               </gap>ted with the respect due to one of the friends of the United States by treaty. It was highly fit, while any doubt of our ultimate independence remained, to cherish the resentment of indignation; and habit or apprehension fully justified the continuance of it a few years longer while no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection subsisted: But just sentiments of national character and obligations, together with that dignity
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032900_0006_0FF5CAAD37014C80"/>
of mind which we <hi>must</hi> cultivate, will teach us to lay aside alike the hacknied epithet, the tortured stigma, and the thread-bare jest. What! professing and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the school of political investigation, shall we be unable to surmount a prejudice no longer founded in a doubt of complete success?</p>
            <p>But it is always useful to retrace the progress of power freely and periodically delegated by the people, usurped on the ground of precedent or practice to accumulate forever, or assumed with no appearance of one or the other justification. An accurate history of all times and nations respecting this particular would be a revelation of inestimable value. As it would thunder the truth, so possibly it might be celes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial lightning upon our extravagant dispositions. Of the little history we have, scarcely two centuries and those the last, are exempt from fable, and not a year from fallacy. The true causes of known consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are seldom discernible through the interested co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, or the implicit credulity of the historian. So true it is that mankind have never yet had the heroism to know and to beware of themselves, or have not had power to preserve either the knowledge or the example.</p>
            <p>But our date is recent. Less than two hundred years ago the territory of the United States was a wilderness, and the now embellished scene of six mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people had for ages been only beaten with mutual dread by the wary foot of the wild beast and solitary savage. The truly great, because truly useful Columbus had imagined, sought, and explored this asylum from the misfortunes, discontents or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the old world. Our ancestors came hither to enjoy the freedom of their minds, and faithfully have they transmitted the same freedom to us. Gloomy

was the immense forest which they had to penetrate; but with a courage which too I hope we inherit<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they encountered and by degrees subdued it. What a birthright have they left to us! A territory near two thousand miles square<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with all the climates of the temperate zone<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> abounding even to wantonness in all the blessings of nature, is the noble legacy of these poor persecuted men!â€”A thousand leagues from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where every thing was artificial and vicious, they recovered a simplicity of mind, which was a yet m<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wonderful age! No sooner had America taken the firm ground which was so necessary for her, than France, leavened by her legions sent to these shores with very different views, perceived within herself the revolutionary fermentation. The States had become independent and united; but excepting these two grand epochas, things remained essentially the same. France began with reformation; but the difference between us and France was in circumstance immense. In France a despotic monarchy, not less fantastical in government than the popedom is in religion, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the abuses of a thousand years, was to be corrected. The empiricism of financiers was in vain resorted to, for the cant of ages would no longer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade. Whether it was through dreadful necessity, or the desperation of leaders, time will disclose; but the catastrophe was not the change of a dynasty as theretoforeâ€”The Monarchy itself fell!â€”and the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial balance of Europe, so much boasted of in latter times, was probably destroyed.

The ambassador of France affected to receive and answer addresses which were intended, at least by him, to controul the government, and paralise the constitution, of the United States. The too amiable hospitality of the people encouraged him to arm and commission vessels in our ports, and troops in our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, against the express orders of the President.â€”And when the conflict between foreign influence and our own constituted authorities could no longer be suppressed, wi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

on the part of France easy to be reconciled when some affronts should be repaired.</p>
            <p>But what eventually are the points which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America are invited to consider as concessible to a foreign nation?â€”The repeal of a law, the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of judiciary decisions, and the abolition of a treaty. Citizens, does not indignation warm your cheeks at the developement of a design so long and so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed? The friendship of America for France was sincere and full of a noble simplicity and singleness of heart. Was it well then, was it generous, to elevate esteem to love in order to betray?â€”What! repeal a law on foreign demand, without the least right to delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate? Reverse judicial decisions, which by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution it is impossible for the legislative or executive power to do, which in no possible manner can be brought again before the courts, and would depress American justice below the idea of chance if they were thus to be reversed? Annul a treaty with a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nation, and so forever commit our inconstancy and persidy to history and to the world?â€”Modest demands indeed from a nation but little longer fated to speak imperiously to this, if you do not suffer them to despise a government which they affect to imitate.</p>
            <p>Citizens, there is naturally no such thing as party in these highly favoured and enlightened States. The full horn of plenty forms the body, and an elective government the soul of our contentment. Depend upon it, that when you feel a great commotion, the hand of some foreign nation is inserted. The apostles of disaffection to your government are foreigners, and do you think disinterested and purely benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent!â€”No, surely! their design is to dissolve your only cement by your own hands; and in the terrible event to laugh at your calamity and mock when
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032900_0012_0FF5CABED71D1570"/>
your fear comes. Good God! what would have become of our country with thirteen heads instead of one!</p>
            <p>France, having as she imagined a party in America which in some way or other would be able to perplex the government, by her own act, and at a very critical time, the election of the President, suspended all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with the United States to give her party the last chance of laying the odium of her defection upon the President and Senate. Consummate politicians! But the cupidity of the nation has been a sad marplot to these really fine manoeuvres. The immense cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and detentions of our commercial property have opened all eyes, and the salvation of the country may yet result from its losses.!</p>
            <p>Is this language which has not yet been heard? With a dignity that is his own, and which infinitely becomes his country, the President has laid before us a state of facts which it would be something more than heresy to misbelieve. It is a new era in this country. The Executive, in obedience to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, declares that this can no longer be concealed. Both houses reverberate the sound. France has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddled with our domestic affairs, and attempted what she has every where attempted, by dividing the people from their government, TO TAKE AWAY LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY FROM THE NATION. She has endeavored to throw us into situations with none or desperate alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives. She has plowed with the heifer, and abused the generous but imprudent confidence of the people. She has put to hazard the existence of your constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <p>It is made because the dignified moderation of our government has thought it not inconsistent with national honour to institute a fresh attempt at nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, after the haughty rejection of a minister.â€”Death is a trifle compared with the forlorn necessity of believing that my countrymen have the "colonial spirit of fear."

She appears to be magnanimous in success, and may yet repair the wrongs of which we so justly complain. War has run its usual course, and weary human nature begs for peace. Heaven may accord itâ€”and in that event, returning philanthropy and kindness will hardly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to be the only exception. In the mean time let us keep alive the fervent wish that France may see the final establishment, and live in the peaceable enjoyment of a free constitutionâ€”that under its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, she may become a blessing, and not a terror
