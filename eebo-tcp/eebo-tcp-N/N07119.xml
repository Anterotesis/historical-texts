            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE Slave-Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a Truth, as ſorrowful as obvious, that Mankind too generally are actuated by falſe Motives, and ſubſtitute an imaginary Intereſt in the Room of that which is real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent: And it muſt be acknowledged by every Man, who is ſincerely deſirous of becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with himſelf, and impartially inſpects his own Heart, that Weakneſs and inbred Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption attends human Nature; which cannot be reſtored to its original Purity, but through the Efficacy of the Blood of JESUS CHRIST, our bleſſed Saviour. So that notwithſtanding the imagined moral Rectitude pleaded for, and the boaſted Pretences of the preſent Age to refined Conceptions of Things beyond our Forefathers, all this Divine Help is embraced, the bent of the Heart of Man will remain corrupt, and its Power of diſtinguiſhing between Good and Evil liable to be obſcured by Prejudice, Paſſion and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009066_0003_1031182859DD7D90"/>Intereſt. Covetouſneſs and Pride have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many iniquitous Practices into Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome of which being eſtabliſhed by Cuſtom, and adapted to flatter our Favourite Paſſions, tho' odious in themſelves, and moſt pernicious in their Conſequences, yet, through the Influence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Uſe, become familiar to us, and our depraved Reaſon has Recourſe to plauſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, to cover and palliate the moſt atrocious Crimes; ſo that by Degrees we ſilence the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Conſcience, and reconcile ourſelves in the Perpetration of ſuch Things which, when firſt propoſed to our unprejudiced Minds, would ſtrike us with Amazement and Horror.</p>
            <p>A lamentable and ſhocking Inſtance of the Influence which the Love of Gain has upon the Minds of thoſe who yield to its Allurements, even when contrary to the Dictates of Reaſon, and the common Feelings of Humanity, appears in the Proſecution of the <hi>Negroe Trade,</hi> in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation has long been deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and ſome in this Province have alſo lately engaged. An Evil of ſo deep a Dye, and attended with ſuch dreadful Conſequences to all that are concerned in it, that no well-diſpoſed Perſon, anxious for the Welfare of himſelf, his Country, or Poſterity, who knows the Tyranny, Oppreſſion and Cruelty with which this iniquitous Trade is carried on, can be a ſilent and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Spectator. How many Thouſands of our harmleſs Fellow Creatures have, for a long Courſe of Years, fallen a Sacrifice to that ſelfiſh Avarice, which gives Life to this complicated Wickedneſs.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009066_0004_10311829E14C1028"/>The Iniquity of being ſo deeply engaged in a Trade, by which ſo great a Number of innocent People are yearly deſtroyed, in ſo untimely and miſerable a Manner, is greatly aggravated from the Conſideration that we, as a Nation, have been peculiarly favoured with the bright Beams of the Goſpel; that Revelation of Divine Love, which the Angels introduced to the World, by a Declaration of Peace on Earth, and Good Will to Men—of every Nation, Kindred, Tongue and People. How miſerable then muſt be our Condition, if, for filthy Lucre, we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to act ſo contrary to the Nature of this Divine Call, the Purpoſe of which is to introduce an univerſal and affectionate Brotherhood in the whole human Species; by removing from the Heart of every Individual, who ſubmits to its Operation, the Darkneſs and Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and transforming the ſelfiſh, wrathful, proud Spirit, into Meekneſs, Purity and Love: For this End the Son of GOD became Man, ſuffered, and died; and the whole Tenor of the Goſpel declares, that for thoſe who refuſe, or neglect, the Offers of this great Salvation, the Son of GOD has ſuffered in vain.</p>
            <p>The End propoſed by this Eſſay, is to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the candid Reader the Depth of Evil which attends this iniquitous Practice, in the Proſecution of which, our Duty to GOD, the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family of the whole Earth, and our Duty of Love to our Fellow Creatures, is totally diſregarded; all ſocial Connection and tender Ties of Nature being broken, and Deſolation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009066_0005_1031182B6BE653B8"/>and Bloodſhed continually fomented in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy People's Country. It is alſo intended to invalidate ſome falſe Arguments, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently advanced, for the Palliation thereof, in Hopes it may be ſome Inducement to thoſe who are not defiled with this Trade, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves clear; and to lay before ſuch as have unwarily engaged in it, the Danger they are in of totally loſing that tender Senſibility to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of their Fellow Creatures, the Want whereof ſets Men beneath the Brute Creation, which muſt unavoidably be the State of every one that continues to partake of the Profits ariſing from this wicked Traffick: A Trade by which ſo many Thouſands of innocent People are brought under the greateſt Anxiety and Suffering, being violently rent from their Native Country, in the moſt cruel Manner, and brought to our Colonies, to be employed in hard Labour, either in Northern Climates, unſuited to their Nature, or in a State of the moſt tyrannick and barbarous Slavery, ſubject to the Humours and inhuman Laſh of ſome of the moſt hard hearted and inconſiderate of Mankind, without any Hopes of ever returning to their Native Land, or ſeeing an End to their Miſery: Nor muſt we omit, in this diſmal Account, the Weight of Blood which lies on the Promoters of this Trade, from the great Numbers that are yearly butchered in the Incurſions and Battles which happen between the <hi>Negroes,</hi> in order to procure the Number deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the <hi>Europeans;</hi> and the many of theſe poor Creatures whoſe Hearts are broken, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009066_0006_10311830CB1B9508"/>who periſh, through Miſery and Grief, on the Paſſage. Heaven preſerve the Inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> from being further defiled by a Trade, which is entered upon from ſuch ſenſual Motives, and carried on by ſuch deviliſh Means. And although theſe Scenes of Horror are acted in Places far remote, and out of the Sight of thoſe who are the moſt enriched thereby; whoſe Senſes being uſually exerciſed only by preſent Objects, are little affected with the diſtant Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Fellow Creatures; yet every Mind, which is not ſo hardened with the Love of Wealth as to be void of feeling, muſt, upon ſerious Conſideration of this inhuman Practice, be impreſſed with Surprize and Terror, from a Senſe that there is a righteous GOD, and a State of Retribution, which muſt laſt for ever. It is frequently alledged, in Excuſe for this Trade, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> ſold in our Plantations, are moſtly Perſons who have been taken Priſoners in thoſe Wars which ariſe amongſt themſelves, from their mutual Animoſities; and that theſe Priſoners would be ſacrificed, to the Reſentment of thoſe who have taken them Captives. If they were not purchaſed and brought away by the <hi>Europeans.</hi> It is alſo repreſented, that the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> are generally a ſtupid ſavage People, whoſe Situation in their own Country is neceſſitous and unhappy, which has induced many to believe, that the bringing the <hi>Africans</hi> from their Native Land is to them rather a Kindneſs than an Injury.</p>
            <p>To confute theſe falſe Repreſentations, the following Extracts are propoſed to the candid
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009066_0007_103118325697EB98"/>Reader's Conſideration; they are taken from the Writings of the principal Officers, not only in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Factories or Settlements in <hi>Guiney,</hi> ſome of whom have lived many Years in thoſe Countries, and have been Eye Witneſſes to thoſe Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whoſe Station in the Factories will not admit of any Doubt of the Truth of what they relate; by which it will appear, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> are generally ſenſible, humane and ſociable, and that their Capacity is as good, and as capable of Improvement, as that of the White People: That their Country, though unfriendly to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> yet appears peculiarly agreeable, and well adapted to the Nature of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> and ſo fruitful, as to furniſh its Inhabitants plentifully with the Neceſſaries of Life, with much leſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than is neceſſary in our more Northern Countries. And as to the common Argument, alledged in Defence of the Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Slaves ſold to the <hi>Europeans</hi> are Captives ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in War, who would be deſtroyed by their Conquerors, if not thus purchaſed, it is without Foundation, it being made clearly to appear, from the forementioned Teſtimonies, that the Wars and Incurſions made by the <hi>Negroes,</hi> one upon another, are moſtly at the Solicitation of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who inſtigate them by every Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, even the moſt iniquitous and cruel, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Slaves to load their Veſſels, which they freely purchaſe, without any Regard to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, the feelings of Humanity, or the common Dictates of Reaſon and Equity.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009066_0008_10311833ED184020"/>For though it is ſcare to be doubted, but that there were Wars amongſt ſome of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> before the <hi>Europeans</hi> began to trade with them, yet certain it is, that theſe Calamities are not only ſince that Time prodigiouſly encreaſed, and the <hi>Europeans,</hi> by encouraging them thereto, and gladly purchaſing the Captives they take, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come come not only Parties with them therein, but the ſole Cauſe of that Encreaſe. This is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Account given by <hi>N. Brue,</hi> Director of the <hi>French</hi> Factory at <hi>Senegal,</hi> who lived Twenty-ſeven Years in that Country, who ſays, <q>That the <hi>Europeans</hi> are far from deſiring to act as Peace Makers amongſt the <hi>Negroes,</hi> which would be acting contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſince the greater the Wars, the more Slaves are procured.</q>

               <hi>William Boſman,</hi> Factor for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> at <hi>Delmina,</hi> where he reſided ſixteen Years, relates, <q>That one of the former Commanders hired an Army of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> of <hi>Jafferia</hi> and <hi>Cabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteria,</hi> for a large Sum of Money, to fight the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Commany,</hi> which occaſioned a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which was more bloody than the Wars of the <hi>Negroes</hi> uſually are: And that another Commander gave, at one time, <hi>Five Hundrea Pounds,</hi> and at another time <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds,</hi> to two other <hi>Negroe</hi> Nations, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to take up Arms againſt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People.</q> This is confirmed by <hi>Barbot,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent General of the <hi>French African</hi> Company, who ſays; <q>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a People very zealous for their Commerce at the Coaſt, were very
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009066_0009_1031183699EFE098"/>ſtudious to have the War carried on amongſt the <hi>Blacks,</hi> to diſtract, as long as poſſible, the Trade of the other <hi>Europeans;</hi> and to that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect were very ready to aſſiſt upon all Occaſions the <hi>Blacks,</hi> their Allies, that they might beat their Enemies, and ſo the Commerce fall into their Hands.</q> But nothing ſhews more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Europeans</hi> are the chief Inſtruments in inciting the <hi>Negroes</hi> to the Perpetration of thoſe unnatural Wars, by which they are kept in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Alarms, their Country laid waſte, and ſuch great Numbers carried into Captivity, than the Account given by <hi>William Smith,</hi> who was ſent by the <hi>African</hi> Company to viſit their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Year 1726, from the Information he received of one of the Factors, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided ten Years in that Country, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the diſcerning Natives account it their greateſt Unhappineſs that they were ever viſited by the <hi>Europeans:</hi>—That we Chriſtians introduced the Traffick of Slaves, and that before our coming they lived in Peace; but, ſay they, it is obſervable, that wherever Chriſtianity comes, there comes with it a Sword, a Gun, Powder and Ball.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Account of the natural Diſpoſition of many of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and of the Fruitfulneſs of their Country, the forementioned Authors, as well as many others, have wrote largely upon it. <hi>M. Adanſon,</hi> in his Account of the Country and Natives of <hi>Goree,</hi> where he was ſo lately as the Year 1754, after giving an Account of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Aſpect of the Country, ſays; <q>The Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009066_0010_1031183B2325F490"/>of the Natives, their Dreſs and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, revived in my Mind the Idea of our firſt Parents; and I ſeemed to contemplate the World in its primitive State;—they (the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>) are generally ſpeaking, very good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, ſociable and obliging. I was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſed (ſays he) with this my firſt Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; —it convinced me, that there ought to be a conſiderable Abatement made in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I had read and heard every where of the ſavage Character of the <hi>Africans.</hi>—I obſerved, both in <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> great Humanity and Sociableneſs, which gave me ſtrong Hopes that I ſhould be very ſafe amongſt them, and meet with the Succeſs I deſired in my Enquiries after the Curioſities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boſman,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Negroes</hi> of that Part <hi>Guiney</hi> where he then was, ſays; <q>They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally a good Sort of People, honeſt in their Dealings; others he deſcribes as being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally friendly to Strangers, of a mild Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, courteous, affable, and eaſy to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with Reaſon; in Converſation they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a great Quickneſs of Parts and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</q> He adds, <q>That ſome <hi>Negroes,</hi> who have had an agreeable Education, have manifeſted a Brightneſs of Underſtanding equal to any of us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Account of the Natives is, <q>That he found them a civil good natured People, induſtrious to the laſt Degree, and their Country exceeding Fertile.—It is eaſy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009066_0011_1031183CF6B62A20"/>(ſays he) to perceive what happy Memories they are bleſſed with, and how great Progreſs they would make in the Sciences, in caſe their Genius was cultivated with Study: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves in choice Terms, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions noble, and Manners polite;—this (he adds) is to be underſtood of the People of Diſtinction, as Officers, Merchantmen, and the like; for Peaſants, Workmen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, are as ignorant in theſe Parts as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbot</hi> ſays, <q>The Inhabitants of <hi>Oedo</hi> are, for the Generality, very civil, good natured People, eaſy to be dealt with, condeſcending to what the <hi>Europeans</hi> require of them, in a civil Way; but if treated with Haughtineſs and rudely, they are ſtiff and high, and will not yield on any Account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some Writers have repreſented the Natives of <hi>Cape Meſurado</hi> as faithleſs and cruel; but it is very likely this Repreſentation of their Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was occaſioned by the Reſentment they had ſhewn for the ill Uſage received from the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans;</hi> for Captain <hi>Philips</hi> declared them to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and courteous. And <hi>Snoek</hi> ſays, <q>He found them a civil good-natur'd People; but that the late Injury they had received from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had carried off ſome of their People, had ſo exaſperated them, that it was to be feared ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> People they had in their Power, would fall a Sacrifice to their Reſentment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although the extream Heat in many Parts of <hi>Guiney,</hi> is ſuch as is neither agreeable nor healthy
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009066_0012_1031183E82C39888"/>to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> yet it is well ſuited to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Negroes:</hi> And it is to theſe Heats that they are indebted for the fertility of their Land, which in moſt Places is ſo great, that with little Labour Grain and Fruit will grow in the greateſt Plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brue,</hi> in his Account of the Fertility of the Country, and Induſtry of the Natives, ſays; <q>He was ſurprized to ſee the Land ſo well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as he obſerved it to be, in one of his Journies; ſcarce a Spot lay unimproved; the low Grounds, divided by ſmall Canals, were all ſowed with Rice; the higher Grounds planted with <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Millet, and Peaſe of different Sorts, Beef and Mutton very cheap, as well as all other Neceſſaries of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boſman</hi> ſays, <q>The <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Guiney</hi> Corn is here ſown and reaped twice every Year; the firſt Harveſt is in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the other the latter End of the Year, though but ſmall, Corn grows with little Trouble, very ſpeedily taking Root, ſo that one or two Men can manure and plow as much Land as one Plow can turn up in <hi>Holland. Indian</hi> Corn grows in the upper Lands, in prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and where Corn won't grow, there Rice encreaſes in Abundance, and Yamms and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes are in the greateſt Plenty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the Kingdom of <hi>Fida,</hi> he ſays, <q>The Country was very populous, many large Villages, beſides innumerable ſmall Ones, through the whole Country, plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Corn, Potatoes and Fruit, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009066_0013_103118422F2440A8"/>grew cloſe to each other; in ſome Places a Foot Path is the only Ground that is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with them, the <hi>Negroes</hi> leaving no Place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated, even within the Hedges which incloſe their Villages: And the very next Day after they have reaped they are ſure to ſow again. This ſine Country is now very much depopulated, which it is likely, was owing to the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made upon them by their Neighbours, in order to get Slaves to ſell to the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
               </q> For the ſame <hi>Boſman,</hi> ſpeaking of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation of <hi>Pope,</hi> ſays; <q>They depend on Plunder and the Slave Trade, in which they exceed ſome of their Neighbours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other Parts of the Country he deſcribes, as <q>being full of Towns and Villages; the Soil very rich, and ſo well cultivated, as to look like and entire Garden, abounding in Rice, Corn, Oxen, Goats and Poultry; and the <hi>Negroes</hi> to be laborious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Smith</hi> gives much the ſame Account of the Country of <hi>Delmina,</hi> and <hi>Cape Corſe,</hi> &amp;c. for Beauty and Goodneſs; and adds, <q>The more you come downward towards that Part called the <hi>Slave Coaſt</hi> (I ſuppoſe becauſe the moſt Slaves are brought from thence) the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and rich the Sol appears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbot</hi> ſays, <q>The Inland People employ themſelves in Tillage and Trade, and ſupply the Markets with Corn, Fruit and Palm Wine; the Country producing ſuch vaſt Plenty of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Wheat, that Abundance is daily export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009066_0014_1031184592673650"/>as well by <hi>Europeans</hi> as <hi>Blacks,</hi> reſorting thither from other Parts.</q> He adds, <q>That the Country of <hi>Delmina,</hi> which was formerly very powerful and populous, though now ſo much drained of its Inhabitants, by the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Wars fomented amongſt the <hi>Negroes</hi> by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that there does not remain enough Inhabitants to till the Country; abounded with fine well-built and populous Towns, enriched with vaſt Fields of Corn, Cattle, Palm Wine and Oil. The Inhabitants all applying themſelves, without Diſtinction, to Agriculture, ſowing Corn, preſſing Oil, and drawing Wine from Palm Trees, with both of which it is plentifully ſtored others to fiſhing, and boiling Salt, and other Trades, on their own Account, or as Brokers for the Inland Blacks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many more Accounts could be given of the good Diſpoſition of the Generality of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> and of the Plenty their Coutry affords, in which it, perhaps, exceeds moſt Countries in the World; but this is ſufficient to ſhew that they might have lived happily, more eſpecially if the <hi>Europeans</hi> had not only bore the Name, but had acted the Part of Chriſtians, in uſing their Endeavour, by Example as well as Precept, to make the <hi>Negroes</hi> acquainted with the glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel, and with that Change of Heart, and Redemption from Sin, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity prorpoſes; this, if attended to, would have neceſſarily been productive of the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs; Innocency and Love
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009066_0015_1031184719B325B8"/>would have prevailed, and nothing would have been wanting to compleat theſe poor <hi>Africans</hi> Happineſs. But the Reverſe has happened; the <hi>Europeans,</hi> forgetful of their Profeſſion and Duty as Men and Chriſtians, have conducted in ſo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous a Manner, as muſt neceſſarily raiſe in the Minds of the thoughtful and well-diſpoſed <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> the utmoſt Scorn and Deteſtation of the very Name of Chriſtians. They have made all other Conſiderations give Way to an inſatiable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Gain, and are become the principal and moving Cauſe of the moſt iniquitous and dreadful Scene that was, perhaps, ever acted upon this Globe: Inſtead of making uſe of their ſuperior Knowledge to ſtir up the Principle of Peace and Good-will in the Breaſts of the ſimple unwary <hi>Negroes,</hi> they have acted as Agents for the great Enemy of the Happineſs of Mankind, and have ſtirred up and ſtrengthened the earthly Principle of Craft and Covetouſneſs in the poor <hi>Africans,</hi> who have thereby been induced to captivate and ſell their unhappy Countrymen; every Thing, even the Power of their Kings, has been made ſubſervient to anſwer this wicked Purpoſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Protectors of their Subjects, theſe Rulers, allured by the tempting Baits laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them by the Factors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have invaded the Liberties of their unhappy Subjects, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Oppreſſors; as is fully evidenced by the following Account, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> Factor to the <hi>african</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in 1730, tells his Reader, <q>That when the King of <hi>Barſalli</hi> wants Goods or Brandy, he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009066_0016_10311848C8BC30D8"/>ſends a Meſſenger to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governor at <hi>James</hi>'s Fort, to deſire he would ſend up a Sloop with a Cargoe of Goods, which, ſays the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the Governor never fails to do: Againſt the Time the Veſſel arrives, the King plunders ſome of his Enemies Towns, ſelling the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſuch Goods as he wants, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is Brandy or Rum, Gunpowder, Ball, Fire-arms, Piſtols and Cutlaſſes for his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Coral and Silver for his Wives and Miſtreſſes.—If he is at War with no neighbouring King, he falls upon one of his own Towns, and makes bold to ſell his own miſerable Subjects. He often goes with ſome of his Troops by a Town in the Day-time, and returns in the Night, and ſets Fire to three Parts of it, placing Guards at the Fourth, to ſeize the People that run out of the Fire, then ties their Arms behind them, and marches them to <hi>Joar</hi> or <hi>Rohone,</hi> where he ſells them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brue,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Factor befóre-mentioned, ſays, <q>That having received Goods, he wrote to the King, that if he had a ſufficient Number of Slaves, he was ready to trade with him, this Prince, ſays that Author, as well as the other <hi>Negroe</hi> Monarchs, have always a ſure Way of ſupplying his Deficiencies, by ſelling their own Subjects, for which they ſeldom want Pretenſions of ſome Kind or other, to juſtify their Rapine.</q> Theſe <hi>Negroe</hi> Kings, thus ſeeking Pretences to cover their Crimes, ſhews they are not quite void of Shame, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible that Covetouſneſs induces them to act a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009066_0017_1031184B37A62F70"/>Part ſo inconſiſtent with their Duty; but here they may plead the Example and Solicitation of the more knowing <hi>Europeans.</hi> 
               <q>The King had Recourſe to this Method, by ſeizing Three Hundred of his own People, and ſent Word to <hi>Brue,</hi> that he had the Slaves ready to deliver for the Goods.</q> The ſame Author further adds, <q>That ſome of the Natives are, on all Occaſions, endeavouring to ſurprize and carry off their Country People; they land (ſays he) without Noiſe, and if they find any lone Cottage, without Defence, they ſurround it, and carry off all the People and Effects to their Boat: The Slaves are ſold to the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> unleſs they be Perſons of ſome Rank, whoſe Friends can redeem them, by paying two Slaves, or five or ſix Oxen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Barbot</hi> ſays, <q>The Slaves ſold by the <hi>Negroes</hi> are for the moſt Part Priſoners of War, or taken in the Incurſions they make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Enemies Territories; others are ſtolen away by their own Countrymen. Abundance of little <hi>Blacks,</hi> of both Sexes, are ſtolen away by their Neighbours, when found abroad, on the Roads, or in the Woods, or elſe in the Corn Fields, at the Time of the Year when their Parents keep them there all Day, to ſcare away the devouring ſmall Birds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Moore,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor, ſays, <q>That captivating the People is, by Cuſtom, become ſo familiar, that when the King of <hi>Kayor</hi> wants to make a Preſent to the Factor, for what he has received of him, he ſends to have two or
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009066_0018_1031184F8BF44998"/>three Slaves taken up at the neareſt Village. Unhappy (ſays that Author) are they, who at that Time fall into the Hands of his Guards, for they ſtay to make no Choice.</q> And he further ſays, <q>That in Battle they ſpare the Enemies as much as poſſible, but it is only that they may have the more Slaves; from which even Perſons of Quality, taken Priſoners, are not exempted: That the Merchants bring down ſome Years, to that Factory, to the Amount of Two Thouſand Slaves; which, they ſay, are taken Priſoners in War: Theſe they buy from the different Princes who take them; many of them come from a great Way In-land. Their Way of bringing them, is tying them by the Neck with Leather Thongs, at about a Yard Diſtance from each other, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally a Bundle of Corn, or Elephants Teeth, on each of their Heads, Thirty or Forty in a String.</q> The Author judges, <q>That the Number of Merchants who followed this Trade were about an Hundred.</q> Some Authors ſay, <q>They go Six or Seven Hundred Miles up the Country, with Goods bought from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with which they purchaſe theſe Slaves, and Ivory: Beſides thoſe Slaves, there are many bought along the River; theſe are either taken in War, as the former, or Men condemned for Crimes, or Perſons ſtolen, which is very frequently. Since the Slave Trade has been introduced, all Puniſhments are commuted in this; and they ſtrain hard for Crimes, in order to have the Benefit of ſelling
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009066_0019_10311851160B43C8"/>the Criminal; ſo that not only great Crimes but even trifling ones, are at preſent puniſhed with Slavery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boſman</hi> ſays, That being in the Kingdom of <hi>Pope,</hi> who depend on Plunder and the Slaves Trade, in which they exceed ſome of their Neighbours, becauſe, being endued with a much larger Share of Courage, they rob more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, they aſſured him, that if he would have Patience for three Days, they would be able to deliver him One or Two Hundred Slaves, and that their Incurſions ſucceeded ſo well, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with about Two Hundred Slaves. That the Inhabitants of <hi>Arda</hi> were ſo diligent in the Slave Trade, that they were able to deliver a Thouſand Slaves every Month; and that if there happened to be no Stock of Slaves when the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels arrived, they would ſometimes ſend their Commodities Two Hundred Miles deep in the Country (a later Author ſays, they have now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Trade Five Hundred Miles farther, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Seven Hundred Miles back into the Country) where Markets of Men were kept in the ſame Manner as thoſe of Beaſts with us. Moſt of the Slaves are Priſoners of War, which are ſold by the Victors as their Booty. When theſe Slaves come to <hi>Fida,</hi> they are put in Priſon alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and when (ſays he) we treat concerning baying them, they are all brought out together in a large Plain, where, by our Surgeons, they are thoroughly examined, and that naked too, both Men and Women, without the leaſt Diſtinction or Modeſty. Thoſe which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009066_0020_103118538459E440"/>as good, are ſet on one Side; in the mean while a burning Iron, with the Arms or Name of the Companies, lies in the Fire, with which ours are marked on the Breaſt. When we have agreed with the Owners of the Slaves, they are returned to their Priſons, where, from that Time forward, they are kept at our Charge, coſt us <hi>Two-pence</hi> a Day a Slave, which ſerves to ſubſiſt them like our Criminals on Bread and Water; ſo that, to ſave Charges, we ſend them on board our Ships with the very firſt Opportunity; before which, their Maſters ſtrip the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of all they have on their Backs, ſo that they come on board ſtark naked, as well Women as Men: In which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are obliged to continue, if the Maſter of the Ship is not ſo charitable (which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is) as to beſtow ſomething on them to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Nakedneſs.—Six or Seven Hundred are ſometimes put on board a Veſſel, where they lie as cloſe together as poſſible for them to be crouded.—I doubt not, ſays the ſame Author, but this Trade ſeems very barbarous to you, but, ſince it is followed by meer Neceſſity, it muſt go on. What Neceſſity does the Author mean, no other Neceſſity appears but that ariſing from the Deſire of amaſſing Riches; a Neceſſity laid on worldly Men by their hard Taſk-maſter the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Many more Examples might be given to ſhew the arbitrary and tyrannick Oppreſſion with which this Trade is carried on, and the Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Bloodſhed it occaſions in thoſe unhappy People's Country; but I truſt this is ſufficient to convince the candid, conſiderate Reader of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009066_0021_10311855EE148DF8"/>Unlawfulneſs and Iniquity of the Trade. And indeed what Diſtreſs can we conceive equal to the Alarms, the Anxiety and Wrath, which muſt ſucceed one another in the Breaſts of the tender Parents, or affectionate Children, in continual Danger of being torn one from another, and dragged into a State of cruel Bondage; Reader, if the Impreſſions of Grace, or even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Feelings of Humanity, are not ſuppreſſed in thy Heart by the Love of Gain, compare what thou haſt read with the Equity, the Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, the Tenderneſs and affectionate Love which is the Life of Chriſtianity, and then ſay, what Concord or Affinity can theſe Fruits have one with the other. May not this Trade be truly ſaid to be the moſt iniquitous and crueleſt Act of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Rapine, when conſidered in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that, to our Knowledge, is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in any Part of the World, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves every one who is deſirous to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, and enjoy Reſt and Peace in Time and Eternity, to avoid being, in any Reſpect, defiled by the Gain reſulting therefrom. And Thanks be to the Great Father of the Family of the whole Earth, that it is not alone in <hi>America</hi> that ſome are raiſed to bear their Teſtimony againſt this mighty Evil, but that a noble Indignation is alſo raiſed in the Breaſts of ſome in our Mother Country, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to declare againſt ſo unparalelled Invaſion upon the Rights and Liberties of Mankind, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>George Wallis,</hi> a Gentleman of the Law, in a Book wrote by him, intituled, <hi>A Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009066_0022_103118594CC07338"/>of the Principles of the Law of</hi> Scotland; in which, ſpeaking of the Slavery of the <hi>Negroes</hi> in our Colonies, he ſays; "We all know that they (the <hi>Negroes</hi>) are purchaſed from their Princes, who pretend to have a Right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them, and that they are, like other Commodities, tranſported by the Merchants, who have bought them, into <hi>America,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be expoſed to Sale. If this Trade ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a moral or a rational Juſtification, every Crime, even the moſt atrocious, may be juſtified. Government was inſtituted for the Good of Mankind; Kings, Princes, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, are not Proprietors of thoſe who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Authority; they have not a Right to make them miſerable. On the contrary, their Authority is veſted in them, that they may, by the juſt Exerciſe of it, promote the Happineſs of their People. Of Courſe, they they have not a Right to diſpoſe of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and to ſell them for Slaves. Beſides, no Man has a Right to acquire or to purchaſe them; Men and their Liberty are not <hi>(in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercio)</hi> they are not either ſaleable or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeable. One, therefore, has no body but himſelf to blame, in caſe he ſhall find himſelf deprived of a Man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a Price, made his own; for he dealt in a Trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the moſt obvious Dictates of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. For theſe Reaſons every one of thoſe unfortunate Men, who are pretended to be Slaves, has a Right to be declared to be free,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009066_0023_1031185AD456CD68"/>for he never loſt his Liberty; he could not loſe it; his Prince had no Power to diſpoſe of him. Of Courſe the Sale was <hi>ipſo Jure</hi> void. This Right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get it declared. As ſoon, therefore, as he comes into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in which the Judges are not forgetful of their own Humanity, it is their Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is a Man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been ſaid, that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions concerning the State of Perſons ought to be determined by the Law of the Country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a Slave in <hi>America,</hi> ought, in caſe he ſhould happen to be imported into <hi>Britain,</hi> to be adjudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>America</hi> to be a Slave; a Doctrine than which nothing can be more barbarous. Ought the Judges of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, out of Reſpect to the Law of another, to ſhew no Reſpect to their Kind, and to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Out of Reſpect to a Law, which is in no Sort obligatory upon them, ought they to diſregard the Law of Nature, which is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on all Men at all Times, and in all Places: Are any Laws ſo binding as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws of Juſtice? Is it doubtful, whether a Judge ought to pay greater Regard to them, than to thoſe arbitrary and inhuman Uſages which prevail in a diſtant Land? Aye, but our Colonies would be ruined, if Slavery was aboliſhed. Be it ſo; would it not from thence follow, that the Bulk of Mankind ought to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009066_0024_1031185C59EBECE0"/>abuſed, that our Pockets may be filled with Money, or our Mouths with Delicacies? The Purſes of Highwaymen would be empty in caſe Robberies were totally aboliſhed; but have Men a Right to acquire Money by going out to the Highway? Have Men a Right to acquire it by rendering their Fellow Creatures miſerable? Is it lawful to abuſe Mankind, that the Avarice, the Vanity, or the Paſſions of a few may be gratified? No! there is ſuch a Thing as Juſtice, to which the moſt ſacred Regard is due. It ought to be inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Have not theſe unhappy Men a better Right to their Liberty, and to their Happineſs, than our <hi>American</hi> Merchants have to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which they make by torturing their Kind? Let therefore our Colonies be ruined, but let us not render ſo many Men miſerable. Would not any of us, who ſhould—be ſnatched by Pyrates from his native Land, think himſelf cruelly abuſed, and at all Times intitled to be free. Have not theſe unfortunate <hi>Africans,</hi> who meet with the ſame cruel Fate, the ſame Right? Are not they Men as well as we, and have they not the ſame Senſibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or ſupport a Uſage which is contrary to all the Laws of Humanity.</p>
            <p>But it is falſe, that either we or our Colonies would be ruined by the Abolition of Slavery. It might occaſion a Stagnation of Buſineſs for a ſhort Time. Every great Alteration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces that Effect; becauſe Mankind cannot, on a ſudden, find Ways of diſpoſing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009066_0025_1031185FB88D4798"/>and of their Affairs: But it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many happy Effects. It is the Slavery which is permitted in <hi>America</hi> that has hindered it from becoming ſo ſoon populous, as it would otherwiſe have done. Let the <hi>Negroes</hi> free, and, in a few Generations, this vaſt and fertile Continent would be crowded with Inhabitants; Learning, Arts, and every Thing would flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh amongſt them; inſtead of being inhabited by wild Beaſts, and by Savages, it would be peopled by Philoſophers, and by Men."— Thus far this honeſt and noble ſpirited <hi>Briton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now Reader, if from the Example of others, and without a ſufficient Knowledge of the deplorable Conſequences attendant on this Trade, thou haſt inadvertently engaged therein, let me beſeech thee, by the Mercies of CHRIST JESUS our LORD (thoſe Mercies which, perhaps, e'er long, thou and I ſhall deſire to fly to as our only Refuge) that thou wouldſt refrain a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo inconſiſtent with thy Duty, both as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and a Man. Remember, the firſt and chief Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.</hi> And that the Second like unto it is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> That our bleſſed Redeemer has enjoined us to <hi>do unto others as we would they ſhould do unto us;</hi> and that it will be thoſe who have been <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> to their Fellow Creatures, that will be intitled to the Mercy of the Great Judge of Heaven and Earth, before whom we muſt all appear, to give an Account of the Deeds done in the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:009066_0026_1031186314C853E8"/>
And as for thoſe who confeſs themſelves now, convinced of the Iniquity of this Trade, and the Injuſtice of buying and ſelling their Fellow Creatures, and yet continue to keep thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> they are poſſeſſed of in Bondage, for the Sake of the Profit ariſing from their Labour, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them ſeriouſly to conſider their Motives for ſuch a Conduct; whether the Diſtinction they make between buying a <hi>Negroe,</hi> and keeping the ſame <hi>Negroe,</hi> or his Offspring, in perpetual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is not a Plea founded more in Words than ſupported by Truth; for it muſt be obvious to every Perſon, who is not blinded by the Deſire of Gain, that the Right by which theſe Men hold the <hi>Negroes</hi> in Bondage, is no other than what is derived from thoſe who ſtole them, or received them from the Thief, who having no other Title, but that which Robbers have over their Prey, could not convey any better to the Purchaſer; and that therefore to continue to hold them in Bondage, for worldly Advantage, by no other Right than that which thoſe guilty Men gave them, is conſenting to, and partaking of their Guilt. Inſtances may fall out, where Men of Candour may be concerned in the Purchaſe of <hi>Negroes,</hi> purely from a Principle of Charity; and there are alſo many of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> amongſt us, whoſe Diſpoſtions, Infirmities or Age, render them unfit for Freedom; but in the Caſe before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, where Perſons declare themſelves convinced of the Injuſtice and Iniquity of this Trade, and are poſſeſſed of <hi>Negroes</hi> who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of managing for themſelves, and have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009066_0027_103118649B29A0E8"/>paid, by their Labour, for their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe or bringing up, beſides the Profit ſome Families have reaped, during a long Courſe of Years, from the Labour of their Progenitors; it is the undoubted Duty of their Poſſeſſors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to them that Liberty, of which they, or their Parents, have been unjuſtly deprived; and they ought alſo to uſe all reaſonable Endeavours, to enable them to procure a comfortable Living, not only as an Act of Juſtice to the Individuals, but as a Debt due to them, on Account of the Oppreſſion and Injuſtice perpetrated on them, or their Anceſtors; and as the beſt Means in their Power, to avert the Judgments of GOD, which it is to be feared will fall on Families and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in Proportion as they have, more or leſs, defiled themſelves with this iniquitous Traffick.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>African</hi> Blacks are as properly and truly Men, as the <hi>European</hi> Whites; they are both of the ſame Species, and are originally deſcended from the ſame Parents;—they have the ſame rational Powers as we have; they have free moral Agents, as we are, and many of them have as good natural Genius, as good and as brave a Spirit, as any of thoſe to whom they are made
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009066_0028_103118670DA31E90"/>Slaves. To trade in <hi>Blacks,</hi> then, is to trade in Men; the black-ſkin'd and the white-ſkin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of the ſame Species, all of the human Race, are by Nature upon an Equality; one Man in a State of Nature, as we are with Reſpect to the Inhabitants of <hi>Guiney,</hi> and they with Reſpect to us, is not ſuperior to another Man, nor has any Authority or Dominion over him, or any Right to lay his Commands upon him: He that made us, made them, and all of the ſame Clay: We are all the Workmanſhip of his Hands, and he hath aſſigned this Globe to the human Race, to dwell upon: He hath given this Earth, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to the Children of Men.—GOD gave to Man Dominion over <hi>the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping Thing that creepeth upon the Earth,</hi> Gen. i. 26; but not to any one Man over another: Nor can one Man, on any Suppoſition whatever, become the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, or Part of the Goods or Eſtate, of another Man; as his Horſe or his Dog is.</p>
            <p>The <hi>European</hi> Whites, and the <hi>African</hi> Blacks, are all under the ſame Moral Law, the eternal Law of Reaſon, which GOD hath written upon the Table of Man's Heart. We and they are Members of one and the ſame great Society, ſpread over the Face of the whole Earth, under one and the ſame Supreme Law-giver and Judge; and are joined together, by the cloſe and ſtrong Ties of human Nature, common to us all; and it is in this Bond of Humanity, that is the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of all other particular Ties and Connections
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009066_0029_1031186A6E571920"/>between Men, and gives Strength to them all. —A Patriot, or a Lover of his Country, is a brave Character; but a Lover of Mankind is a braver Character.</p>
            <p>Our being Chriſtians does not give us any worldly Superiority, or any Authority whatever, over thoſe who are not Chriſtians. CHRIST'S Kingdom is not of this World; neither does Chriſtianity diſſolve or free us from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Juſtice, Equity, and Benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Fellow Creatures of the ſame Species, be they <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> or even black-ſkin'd <hi>Heathens,</hi> which the Law of Nature lays us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but, on the contrary, greatly ſtrengthens them. The <hi>Jews,</hi> in our Saviour's Time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf,</hi> in a very confined Senſe, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating only to their own Countrymen. But this Precept, as adopted into the Chriſtian Religion, takes in all Mankind. By our Neighbour we are to underſtand every Individual of the human Species. We are commanded in the Goſpel; <hi>to render all their Dues, and to do unto others, as we would they ſhould do unto us, to be kind, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and compaſſionate, to be ready to communicate, and to do Good.</hi> Which Precept, and many others to the ſame Purpoſe, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in ſuch a narrow Senſe, as if they related only to thoſe who are of the ſame Religion with ourſelves, or whoſe Skin is of the ſame Colour with ours, as is evident from other Precepts of the Goſpel. We are commanded to <hi>do Good to all, eſpecially to thoſe who are of the Houſhold of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009066_0030_1031186D0FB04FC8"/>Faith,</hi> to imitate our <hi>Heavenly Father, who doeth Good to all, and whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works,</hi> yea, and to <hi>love our Enemies.</hi> —Theſe Propoſitions I believe no body would have refuſed to grant; but though they are ſo evident that few will expreſly deny, or diſpute the Truth of them, yet, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that thoſe who are concerned in the Man-Trade, do not allow themſelves to think on theſe Truths impartially, ſeriouſly to conſider them, and lay them to Heart; but that on the contrary, they have, ſome how or other, a Kind of confuſed Imagination, or half formed Thought, in their Minds, that the <hi>Blacks</hi> are hardly of the ſame Species with the white Men, but are Creatures of a Kind ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what inferior: I ſay it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſo; for I do not know how to think that any white Men could find in their Hearts, that the common Sentiments of Humanity would permit them to treat the black Men in that cruel, barbarous Manner in which they do treat them, did they think and conſider that theſe have rational im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, that they are made after the Image of GOD, as well as themſelves, and that, being in the ſame Body, they have the ſame Paſſions, Senſes and Feelings, as they have, and are as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of Pain and Grief, and upon the ſame Occaſions, as they.—Man-ſtealing is not only unlawful—I think it the moſt atrocious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate Crime. To ſteal a Horſe, or to rob a Man on the Road of his Money, is reckoned, among us, a capital Crime, deſerving Death and is, by Law, puniſhable with Death. What then
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009066_0031_1031186F437DF778"/>does he deſerve, what Puniſhment can be great enough for him, who ſteals a Man, a Crime, in Compariſon with which Horſe-ſtealing or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing on the Highway is but a little trifling Fault, quite excuſeable and venial. Man-ſtealers were, by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> puniſhed with Death. <hi>He that ſtealeth a Man, or if he be found in his Hand, he ſhall ſurely be put to Death,</hi> Exod. xxi. 16. And in the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 10. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealers are reckoned amongſt the very worſt of Men. Can any Thing be more cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, than to ſeize upon human Creatures, and take them away by Force from their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from their Friends and Relations, for ever; Children from their tender Parents, Parents from their dear Children, Women from their beloved Huſbands, and Huſbands from their beloved Wives, and drive them, like Hogs, to Market, there to be ſold for Slaves for Life? How great muſt be the Miſery thoſe poor Creatures are in, and the Agonies of Mind they fell, when they are thus carried off; ſo great, that, to relieve themſelves, ſome of them have put an End to their Lives. And how grievous, how diſtreſſed, muſt be the Condition of their Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are deprived of them, and ſhall never ſee their Faces any more? It is horrid, it is ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to think of ſuch Cruelty and Barbarity. What Monſters in Nature then, deſtitute of all Humanity and Compaſſion, muſt they be, who are guilty of it. The black Men have the ſame natural Affection for their Kindred, and as ſtrong, as we have.—To ſell and buy human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009066_0032_10311870CC379810"/>without their Conſent, yea and ſore againſt, their Will, to trade in Men, as you would in brute Creatures, or any other Commodities, is really impious as well as cruel. Man is a noble Creature, made but a little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and crowned with Glory and Honour. He is the Offspring of GOD; therefore thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him, and to bring him down upon a Level with the Brutes, yea with Things inanimate, is great Impiety, it is an high Affront offered to him, who is the kind and merciful Father of us all, who hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, to dwell on the Face of the Earth, and hath united them all in one Body by the Ties of Nature. It is likewiſe an Affront put upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, upon the whole human Race, which ſhould raiſe a generous Reſentment and Indignation in the Breaſt of every one that partakes of the human Nature, and has any Notion of the Dignity of it, or any Senſe of Humanity, which he ſhould expreſs and diſcover upon all proper Occaſions, and in all proper Ways.—And I think the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, in this Caſe, will appear to be worſe, to be more guilty, in ſome Reſpects, than the bare Thief, if we fairly conſider the Matter.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the <hi>Europeans,</hi> in ſending Ships yearly to the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> to buy Slaves, without enquiring how thoſe they purchaſe them of came by them, do encourage thoſe Thieves, and tempt them to make a Practice and Trade of ſtealing their own Countrymen; for this is the ſame Thing in Effect, as if they were to tell them in ſo many Words, <q>
                  <hi>You get Men ready for us,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009066_0033_103118784FE492B0"/>how you can, and we will take them off your Hands.</hi>
               </q> Beſides, thoſe Men-merchants not only encourage others in this cruel flagitious Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Man-ſtealing, but are really guilty of it themſelves. You will obſerve, that what is done by their Command, and according to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I conſider as done by themſelves. As thoſe poor miſerable Creatures were ſtolen, thoſe who did ſteal them, could not convey any Right in them to others, though theſe others ſhould give ever ſo much in Purchaſe of them, any more than if they had them for nothing. For thoſe Purchaſers then to deprive them of their Liberty, and, by Force, keep them in their Poſſeſſion, in whom they have no Right (ſuppoſing one Man could be the Property of another) and who never injured them in the leaſt, nor forfeited their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; to keep them in Bonds, and carry them away Captives, is, properly ſpeaking, Man-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And what aggravates this Crime in the <hi>European</hi> Man-merchants, and renders it much more heinous in them than in the <hi>Africans,</hi> is, that the former enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, and profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Man-ſtealing is a Kind, and indeed the worſt Kind, of Sacrilege, which Conſideration farther ſhews the Impiety of it. Man is ſacred, and is, by Nature, devoted to the Service of GOD, to whoſe Authority alone he is obliged to yield an abſolute, unlimited Obedience; for one Man therefore to aſſault another, and, by meer Force, to make a Captive of him, not for any Crime that he has been guilty of, but to make a <hi>Penny</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009066_0034_10311879D8D7C978"/>of him, conſidering him as Part of his Poſſeſſions or Goods, with which he can do what he pleaſes, is robbing of GOD, which is Sacrilege.</p>
            <p>It is very common in the Countries, where the <hi>Europeans</hi> carry on this Trade, for the petty Kings and Princes, of which there are a great many, to go to War with their Neighbours, not in Defence of their Right, not to get Satisfaction for any Injuries done them, or to repair any Damages they have unjuſtly ſuffered by thoſe Neighbours, but purely to get Priſoners againſt the Time the Ships from <hi>Europe</hi> arrive upon their Coaſt, that with them they may be able to purchaſe of the Captains of thoſe Ships the Goods they have on board.</p>
            <p>Now here the Injury and Crime is the ſame in Kind as in the former Caſe, and indeed greater in the Kind: In both Caſes it is ſtealing Man, but in the latter it is attended with ſhedding of Blood, with Slaughter and Deſtruction; which Conſideration doth aggravate the Crime of our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, who purchaſe thoſe Priſoners. CHRIST hath ſaid, that <hi>bleſſed are the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of</hi> GOD. But how contrary to what our Saviour recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, the making of Peace among Men, is the Spirit and Practice of thoſe, who, for Lucre Sake, provoke and encourage others to go to War with their Neighbours, and by unjuſt Force to kill and deſtroy ſome, and others of them to make Priſoners.</p>
            <p>But let us now ſuppoſe,—that the Priſoners, which are bought, were even engaged in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009066_0035_1031187B75FE4400"/>War, that they were the firſt Invaders or Aggreſſors—When one King or Prince goes to War with another, the common Men are not capable of judging of the Merits of the Cauſe, which Party has or has not Right of their Side; but, laying aſide this Conſideration, they are forced to go whitherſoever their King or Captain leads them; they are obliged to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to deſert would be Death to them: Therefore I think it would be unjuſt and cruel, in him who comes off Conqueror, though he had Right of his Side, and was engaged in a juſt War, to deprive thoſe common Men, who are taken Priſoners, of their Liberty, after the War is over, or at any Time to ſell them for Slaves for Life, either by Way of Puniſhment or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, unleſs they be ſuppoſed to be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for whatever Damage or Injury is done by their King, or that they are his Goods or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; both which are abſurd, and the latter a Suppoſition unworthy of human Nature, and ſhocking to the human Mind; conſequently, the buying of them for ſuch, muſt be altogether as criminal in the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reckoned we have now in this Kingdom Thirty Thouſand <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, or more; and we ſay, that in the War we are carrying on againſt <hi>France,</hi> we have Right on our Side; that we entered into it for the Recovery and Defence of our Territories, invaded by them; but though it be true (as I believe it is) that our Cauſe is good, yet would it not be cruel and inhuman in us, to ſell theſe Priſoners into Slavery for Life,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009066_0036_1031187D04535490"/>and in any other Nation, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for Inſtance, to buy them of us, in order to ſend them to work in their Mines in <hi>Peru,</hi> as long as they live? And would not all the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe</hi> exclaim againſt us, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> as inhuman, barbarous People, for ſo doing? If it be replied, that ſuch a Thing would be contrary to Cuſtom, and to the Law of Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> whereas in <hi>Guiney</hi> and <hi>Negroeland</hi> it is a common Cuſtom, to ſell for Slaves the Priſoners they take in War; there they make a Trade of it. I own—that may be one Reaſon, among others, why ſuch a Thing practiſed in thoſe Countries is not looked upon, by us here, with ſo much Abhorrence and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, as it would be if it were to be practiſed in <hi>Europe:</hi> But this makes no Difference, as to the Nature of the Thing in itſelf; for as I have ſhewn before, the Man-trade in this laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Caſe, wherein the Men who are ſold, are ſuppoſed to be Priſoners, that were engaged in an unjuſt War, is in itſelf wicked and inhuman, contrary to the Law of Nature, the Obligations of which are eternal and unchangeable, not to be altered or diſannulled by Uſe or Cuſtom, be it ever ſo ancient or univerſal, they are the ſame all over the World, the ſame in <hi>Guiney,</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain of the <hi>Guiney</hi> Ship, when he has finiſhed his Marketing, when he has bought as many reaſonable Creatures as he wants, and is full freighted, having on board (we will ſay) Two Hundred of them, coupled in Irons, and

I remember I read an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in one of the News-Papers laſt Year; a Ship, belonging to <hi>Liverpool,</hi> that had a Hundred and Ninety Slaves on board, Eighty of whom died on the Voyage, which is more than two Fifths—Taking all the Slaves together, that are brought on board our Ships yearly, from the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> where they are bought by our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, I think one may venture to affirm, that, at leaſt, a Tenth Part of them die on the Voyage;—the Merchants are certainly chargeable with taking away the Lives of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe poor Creatures, as come by their Death by being ſo confined and treated, and are guilty of Murder; for to take away a Man's Life, unjuſtly, is Murder; whether it be done in two or three Minutes, or two or three Months, that makes no Difference.—I do not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to convict a Man of Murder,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009066_0038_10311886F2226960"/>to make it appear that he had an Intention to commit Murder: Whoever does, by unjuſt Force and Violence, deprive another of his Liberty, and, while he has him in his Power, reduces him to ſuch a Condition, and gives him ſuch Treatment, as evidently endangers his Life, and, in the Event, do actually deprive him of his Life, is guilty of Murder.—By the Account given in the ſecond Volume of the <hi>Compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Geography,</hi> the Number of <hi>Negroes</hi> brought away by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the Year 172.5, appeared to be about Fifty Thouſand.—We will ſuppoſe that the Number of <hi>Negroes</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, one Year with another, are no more than Thirty-five Thouſand: Now, in the Account given by that Author of the <hi>Negroes</hi> in our Plantations, it is ſaid, that, in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> almoſt Half of the new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>Negroes</hi> die in the Seaſoning, and that, in <hi>Barbados,</hi> it is reckoned that a fourth Part die in Seaſoning; and, according to the ſame Account there are twice as many imported into theſe two Iſlands, as into all our other Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and all our Colonies in <hi>North-America.</hi> At a moderate Computation, therefore, it may be reckoned, that of all thoſe who are purchaſed by our <hi>African</hi> Merchants in a Year, Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand die upon the Voyage, and in the Seaſoning.</p>
            <p>What a ſad dreadful Affair then is this Man-Trade, whereby ſo many Thouſands of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rational Creatures loſe their Lives, are, truly and properly ſpeaking, murdered every Year; I do not think there is an Inſtance of ſo great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009066_0039_103118888103A8A8"/>and Cruelty carried on in any Part of the World, as is this, Year after Year. It is enough to make one tremble, to think what a Load of Guilt lies upon this Nation, on this Account, and that the Blood of Thouſands of poor innocent Creatures, murdered every Year, in carrying on this curſed Trade, cry aloud to Heaven for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Were we to hear or read of any other Nation in the World that did deſtroy every Year, in ſome other Way, or on ſome other Account, as many human Creatures as are deſtroyed by this Trade, we ſhould look upon them as a very bloody, cruel, barbarous People. We, to this Day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the Cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſo many of the Inhabitants of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> when they unjuſtly invaded thoſe Countries, though it is a Queſtion, whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not deſtroyed as many of the Inhabitants of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſince the Commencement of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Man-Trade among us, and of our Popiſh Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Reign is looked upon as the most cruel and inhuman of any in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, though there were not above Three Hundred burnt, for Hereſy, in the five Years of her Reign, and you know that the Papiſts believe, or proſeſs to believe, that they ought to put He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks to Death, at leaſt they did then: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have, for many Years paſt, put to Death Ten or Twelve Thouſand a Year, in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on this Trade, which they ſtill continue for the Sake of getting Money, and furniſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Superfluities of Life, which ſhews a greater Degree of Barbarity; and many of thoſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009066_0040_1031188B16714510"/>poor Wretches have endured more Pain, before they died, than thoſe Hereticks did in being burnt. There is nothing that ſhews the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Mankind more, that caſts a greater Blemiſh on human Nature, or expoſes it in a more diſadvantageous Light, than this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whole Nations, Chriſtians as well as Heathens, profeſs to believe the greateſt Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Contradictions, and juſtify the moſt wicked and vileſt Practices.—If it be ſaid that I charge the Legiſlature—becauſe they have encouraged, and ſtill do encourage, this Trade, —what I have aſſerted, I think I can defend. —No Legiſlature on Earth, which is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power in every civil Society, can alter the Nature of Things, or make that to be lawful which is contrary to the Law of GOD, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Legiſlator and Governor of the World. Miſchief may be framed, and eſtabliſhed by a Law, but if it be, it is Miſchief ſtill, as much ſo as it was before it was eſtabliſhed, though its being ſo may make Men inſenſible of their Guilt, or bold and fearleſs in the Perpetration of it; for too many, among Chriſtians, are, contrary to CHRIST's Exhortation, more influenced by the Fear of Man, than by the Fear of GOD.—It is really a ſerious Subject, and I own it raiſes a ſerious Concern in my Mind, that ſuch Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be ſuffered in Chriſtian Nations. It is enough to make a Man's Heart ach, unleſs he has loſt all Love and Regard to his Kind, to think that ſo many Thouſands of the human
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009066_0041_1031188EB4B2B130"/>Race ſhould be ſacrificed every Year to that greedy voracious God <hi>Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs ſhocking to hear or read the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have of the barbarous Treatment that thoſe black Men, who ſtand and ſurvive the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, as it is called, meet with. According to the Accounts in the forementioned Author, it is inhuman and unmerciful.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hans Sloan,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> ſays; <q>That a rebellious <hi>Negroe,</hi> or he that twice ſtrikes a white Man, is condemned to the Flames; being chained flat on his Belly, at the Place of Execution, and his Arms and Legs extended, Fire is then ſet to his Feet, and he is burnt gradually up to his Head. They ſtarve others to Death, with a Loaf hanging before their Mouths, ſo that ſome gnaw the very Fleſh off their own Shoulders, and expire with all the frightful Agonies, expreſſing the moſt horrid Tortures. For Crimes of a leſs Nature, they geld the Offender, and chop off Half of his Foot with an Ax; for Negligence only, they whip him till his Back is raw, and then ſcatter Pepper and Salt on his Wounds, to heighten the Smart; and ſome Planters will drop melted Wax on their Skins, which puts them to intolerable Pain.</q> Now muſt not the human Nature, in thoſe People, be changed into the Deviliſh, who can put theſe poor Creatures to ſuch Torments?—It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the ſame Author, that <q>Some excuſe theſe Severities by telling us, that the <hi>Blacks,</hi> being ſo perverſe, ſullen, and miſchievous a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009066_0042_103118918F1F46E0"/>Generation, deſerve ſuch Treatment, and that milder Uſage would not reclaim them.</q>— It is no Wonder they are ſullen; would not white Men be ſo, were they in their Condition, and treated as they are? No Doubt but they would. But the <hi>Blacks,</hi> though they be unjuſtly deprived of their Liberty, baniſhed from their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from all their Friends and Relations, and made Captives and Slaves for Life, though they are treated worſe than Dogs, and made to wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k harder than Horſes, yet they ought to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, good humoured, and obliging to them that do thus treat them; and, if they be not, they ſhould be put to Pain and Torment. And they are, it ſeems, a miſchievous Generation, apt to mutiny and rebel; that is, in Truth, they want to recover their Liberty, and would attempt to do it, if they were not kept in Awe by hard Uſage, and ſevere Diſcipline. In the Account of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> we are told that the <hi>Negroes,</hi> when firſt brought thither from <hi>Guin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> are very ſimple, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creatures, but ſoon turn roguiſh, and when they come to be whipp'd, urge the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Whites for their Excuſe. Whereas, in that of <hi>Barbados,</hi> the ſame Author ſays, <q>That the Maſters of the <hi>Negroes</hi> are obliged to treat them very ſeverly, not only becauſe of the ſtubborn, treacherous Temper, which is ſo peculiar to all of their Complexion and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but becauſe they are three times the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Whites in this Iſland, and have made frequent Attempts to get the Maſtery;</q> that is, their Liberty, or to deliver themſelves out
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009066_0043_10311893154271A0"/>of the miſerable Slavery they are in.—But how come they to be three times the Number of the Whites in this Iſland? Is it not owing to the white Inhabitants, to their purchaſing them, and keeping them in Bondage? How weak then is this Excuſe? Where is the Senſe of aſſigning this Majority, which is of their own procuring, as a Reaſon for their treating the <hi>Blacks</hi> with ſuch Severity?—We have alſo an Account from that Author, of thoſe Plots laid by the <hi>Blacks</hi> in <hi>Antigua,</hi> but which were diſcovered by the Whites, before they could be brought to bear, and of the horrid Executions which followed upon the Diſcovery. "The King, that is, he who was to have been King of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> had the Plot ſucceeded, and his two Generals, with two others, were all broke on a Wheel (that is, their Bones were broke with an Iron Bar whilſt alive.) Four more of the principal Conſpirators were burnt the ſame Day; as were Seven on the next Day. Six were hung alive in Chains on Gibbets, and ſtarved to Death; after which their Heads were cut off, and their Bodies burnt; and Fifty-eight others were, at ſeveral Times, chained to Stakes, and burnt alive." Now, was not this a lamentable Affair (and there have been ſeveral Inſtances of ſuch Cruelty in our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) that ſo many poor Creatures ſhould be put to the greateſt Tortures, and be made to ſuffer the moſt painful Deaths. Some of the <hi>French.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Condition is far prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of moſt of the Salves in our Colonies, have attempted to break out of Priſon, but, being
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009066_0044_10311895A4D81930"/>diſcovered in Time, failed in their Attempt. Now ſhould not we have been reckoned, by all the World, a cruel barbarous People, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had ordered ſome of them to be broke on the Wheel, ſome to be burnt alive, and others to be ſtarved to Death, though the <hi>French</hi> are our Enemies, and are engaged in an unjuſt War againſt us; whereas thoſe Slaves had never done any Hurt or Injury to thoſe who torture them to Death.—We reckon ourſelves to be a brave, generous, humane, civilized People;—but is this a true Character, while that barbarous, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Man-Trade, in the carrying on of which ſo many Thouſand Lives are ſacrificed every Year, is not only winked at, but countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged amongſt us.—There are other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides ours, concerned in this Trade, but that does not leſſen the Guilt in our People, though it may keep them in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are now more concerned, I believe, than all the other Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> taken together, in this abominable Trade, which is the greateſt Scandal and Reproach that lies upon this Nation; the removing of which, by proclaiming Liberty to thoſe Captives now in our Plantations, making them Freemen, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting for ever, upon the ſevereſt Penalties, the Man-Trade throughout all His Majeſty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and thereby leading the Way, and giving a good Example to the other Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> concerned in the Man-Trade, would be much to the Honour of our Government, and I am ſure would give great Pleaſure to all who are Lovers
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009066_0045_103118995450B6D0"/>of Mankind, and have a Regard for the Honour, Safety, and Proſperity of their Country.—It is objected, that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were to drop this Trade entirely, it would be immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon carried on by other Nations, to a much greater Degree than it now is.—Perhaps that might be the Conſequence, and if it ſhould, they muſt be anſwerable for that, the Guilt and Scandal would lie upon them. But if it were certain that this would be the Caſe, this Conſideration cannot be a juſt Reaſon for our continuing to carry on ſuch a wicked Trade. If we ſhould not carry on this Trade others would, therefore we may, would be a ſtrange Way of reaſoning.</p>
            <p>And as this Slave-Trade has been encouraged by the Government, for many Reigns back, it is queried, whether the preſent Government, in caſe they were to ſet thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> in our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at Liberty, ſhould not make good that Loſs to their Maſters; but I ſhall not take upon me to determine that Point; our Governors are beſt Judges of that, only I think they had better do ſo, though it ſhould require ſome Millions to do it, than ſuffer thoſe poor Creatures to continue in the miſerable State of Slavery they are now in. There is one Conſequence more which, ſome People fear, would follow upon prohibiting of the <hi>Negroe</hi> Trade, and that is, that ſuch a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition would greatly leſſen, if not utterly ruin, ſome other conſiderable Branches of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, eſpecially the Sugar and the Tobacco Trades, becauſe of the Difficulty of getting Hands enough, in the Room of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> to work
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009066_0046_1031189C63601F30"/>and labour in thoſe Plantations, where theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are produced; but this can be no real Objection againſt what I have aſſerted, or in Juſtification of the Man-Trade; for if this Trade be in itſelf one continued Scene of ſuch Cruelty and Barbarity, as it hath been repreſented to be, it muſt be allowed, that it ought to be ſtrictly prohibited, let the Conſequences of ſuch a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition be what they will, that none ſhould be ſuffered to go on, tormenting and murdering their Fellow-creatures, Year after Year, though we were never any more to ſee an Ounce of Tobacco or Sugar in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The Inconveniences, or worldly Diſadvantage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
