            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE Slave-Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a Truth, as ≈øorrowful as obvious, that Mankind too generally are actuated by fal≈øe Motives, and ≈øub≈øtitute an imaginary Intere≈øt in the Room of that which is real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent: And it mu≈øt be acknowledged by every Man, who is ≈øincerely de≈øirous of becoming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him≈øelf, and impartially in≈øpects his own Heart, that Weakne≈øs and inbred Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption attends human Nature; which cannot be re≈øtored to its original Purity, but through the Efficacy of the Blood of JESUS CHRIST, our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour. So that notwith≈øtanding the imagined moral Rectitude pleaded for, and the boa≈øted Pretences of the pre≈øent Age to refined Conceptions of Things beyond our Forefathers, all this Divine Help is embraced, the bent of the Heart of Man will remain corrupt, and its Power of di≈øtingui≈øhing between Good and Evil liable to be ob≈øcured by Prejudice, Pa≈ø≈øion and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009066_0003_1031182859DD7D90"/>Intere≈øt. Covetou≈øne≈øs and Pride have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many iniquitous Practices into Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øome of which being e≈øtabli≈øhed by Cu≈øtom, and adapted to flatter our Favourite Pa≈ø≈øions, tho' odious in them≈øelves, and mo≈øt pernicious in their Con≈øequences, yet, through the Influence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and U≈øe, become familiar to us, and our depraved Rea≈øon has Recour≈øe to plau≈øible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øes, to cover and palliate the mo≈øt atrocious Crimes; ≈øo that by Degrees we ≈øilence the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Con≈øcience, and reconcile our≈øelves in the Perpetration of ≈øuch Things which, when fir≈øt propo≈øed to our unprejudiced Minds, would ≈øtrike us with Amazement and Horror.</p>
            <p>A lamentable and ≈øhocking In≈øtance of the Influence which the Love of Gain has upon the Minds of tho≈øe who yield to its Allurements, even when contrary to the Dictates of Rea≈øon, and the common Feelings of Humanity, appears in the Pro≈øecution of the <hi>Negroe Trade,</hi> in which the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Nation has long been deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and ≈øome in this Province have al≈øo lately engaged. An Evil of ≈øo deep a Dye, and attended with ≈øuch dreadful Con≈øequences to all that are concerned in it, that no well-di≈øpo≈øed Per≈øon, anxious for the Welfare of him≈øelf, his Country, or Po≈øterity, who knows the Tyranny, Oppre≈ø≈øion and Cruelty with which this iniquitous Trade is carried on, can be a ≈øilent and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Spectator. How many Thou≈øands of our harmle≈øs Fellow Creatures have, for a long Cour≈øe of Years, fallen a Sacrifice to that ≈øelfi≈øh Avarice, which gives Life to this complicated Wickedne≈øs.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009066_0004_10311829E14C1028"/>The Iniquity of being ≈øo deeply engaged in a Trade, by which ≈øo great a Number of innocent People are yearly de≈øtroyed, in ≈øo untimely and mi≈øerable a Manner, is greatly aggravated from the Con≈øideration that we, as a Nation, have been peculiarly favoured with the bright Beams of the Go≈øpel; that Revelation of Divine Love, which the Angels introduced to the World, by a Declaration of Peace on Earth, and Good Will to Men‚Äîof every Nation, Kindred, Tongue and People. How mi≈øerable then mu≈øt be our Condition, if, for filthy Lucre, we ≈øhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to act ≈øo contrary to the Nature of this Divine Call, the Purpo≈øe of which is to introduce an univer≈øal and affectionate Brotherhood in the whole human Species; by removing from the Heart of every Individual, who ≈øubmits to its Operation, the Darkne≈øs and Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and transforming the ≈øelfi≈øh, wrathful, proud Spirit, into Meekne≈øs, Purity and Love: For this End the Son of GOD became Man, ≈øuffered, and died; and the whole Tenor of the Go≈øpel declares, that for tho≈øe who refu≈øe, or neglect, the Offers of this great Salvation, the Son of GOD has ≈øuffered in vain.</p>
            <p>The End propo≈øed by this E≈ø≈øay, is to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the candid Reader the Depth of Evil which attends this iniquitous Practice, in the Pro≈øecution of which, our Duty to GOD, the common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Family of the whole Earth, and our Duty of Love to our Fellow Creatures, is totally di≈øregarded; all ≈øocial Connection and tender Ties of Nature being broken, and De≈øolation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009066_0005_1031182B6BE653B8"/>and Blood≈øhed continually fomented in tho≈øe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy People's Country. It is al≈øo intended to invalidate ≈øome fal≈øe Arguments, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently advanced, for the Palliation thereof, in Hopes it may be ≈øome Inducement to tho≈øe who are not defiled with this Trade, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves clear; and to lay before ≈øuch as have unwarily engaged in it, the Danger they are in of totally lo≈øing that tender Sen≈øibility to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of their Fellow Creatures, the Want whereof ≈øets Men beneath the Brute Creation, which mu≈øt unavoidably be the State of every one that continues to partake of the Profits ari≈øing from this wicked Traffick: A Trade by which ≈øo many Thou≈øands of innocent People are brought under the greate≈øt Anxiety and Suffering, being violently rent from their Native Country, in the mo≈øt cruel Manner, and brought to our Colonies, to be employed in hard Labour, either in Northern Climates, un≈øuited to their Nature, or in a State of the mo≈øt tyrannick and barbarous Slavery, ≈øubject to the Humours and inhuman La≈øh of ≈øome of the mo≈øt hard hearted and incon≈øiderate of Mankind, without any Hopes of ever returning to their Native Land, or ≈øeeing an End to their Mi≈øery: Nor mu≈øt we omit, in this di≈ømal Account, the Weight of Blood which lies on the Promoters of this Trade, from the great Numbers that are yearly butchered in the Incur≈øions and Battles which happen between the <hi>Negroes,</hi> in order to procure the Number deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the <hi>Europeans;</hi> and the many of the≈øe poor Creatures who≈øe Hearts are broken, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009066_0006_10311830CB1B9508"/>who peri≈øh, through Mi≈øery and Grief, on the Pa≈ø≈øage. Heaven pre≈øerve the Inhabitants of <hi>Penn≈øylvania</hi> from being further defiled by a Trade, which is entered upon from ≈øuch ≈øen≈øual Motives, and carried on by ≈øuch devili≈øh Means. And although the≈øe Scenes of Horror are acted in Places far remote, and out of the Sight of tho≈øe who are the mo≈øt enriched thereby; who≈øe Sen≈øes being u≈øually exerci≈øed only by pre≈øent Objects, are little affected with the di≈øtant Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Fellow Creatures; yet every Mind, which is not ≈øo hardened with the Love of Wealth as to be void of feeling, mu≈øt, upon ≈øerious Con≈øideration of this inhuman Practice, be impre≈ø≈øed with Surprize and Terror, from a Sen≈øe that there is a righteous GOD, and a State of Retribution, which mu≈øt la≈øt for ever. It is frequently alledged, in Excu≈øe for this Trade, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> ≈øold in our Plantations, are mo≈øtly Per≈øons who have been taken Pri≈øoners in tho≈øe Wars which ari≈øe among≈øt them≈øelves, from their mutual Animo≈øities; and that the≈øe Pri≈øoners would be ≈øacrificed, to the Re≈øentment of tho≈øe who have taken them Captives. If they were not purcha≈øed and brought away by the <hi>Europeans.</hi> It is al≈øo repre≈øented, that the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> are generally a ≈øtupid ≈øavage People, who≈øe Situation in their own Country is nece≈ø≈øitous and unhappy, which has induced many to believe, that the bringing the <hi>Africans</hi> from their Native Land is to them rather a Kindne≈øs than an Injury.</p>
            <p>To confute the≈øe fal≈øe Repre≈øentations, the following Extracts are propo≈øed to the candid
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009066_0007_103118325697EB98"/>Reader's Con≈øideration; they are taken from the Writings of the principal Officers, not only in the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but al≈øo in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Factories or Settlements in <hi>Guiney,</hi> ≈øome of whom have lived many Years in tho≈øe Countries, and have been Eye Witne≈ø≈øes to tho≈øe Tran≈øac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and who≈øe Station in the Factories will not admit of any Doubt of the Truth of what they relate; by which it will appear, that the <hi>Negroes</hi> are generally ≈øen≈øible, humane and ≈øociable, and that their Capacity is as good, and as capable of Improvement, as that of the White People: That their Country, though unfriendly to the <hi>Europeans,</hi> yet appears peculiarly agreeable, and well adapted to the Nature of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> and ≈øo fruitful, as to furni≈øh its Inhabitants plentifully with the Nece≈ø≈øaries of Life, with much le≈øs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than is nece≈ø≈øary in our more Northern Countries. And as to the common Argument, alledged in Defence of the Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Slaves ≈øold to the <hi>Europeans</hi> are Captives ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in War, who would be de≈øtroyed by their Conquerors, if not thus purcha≈øed, it is without Foundation, it being made clearly to appear, from the forementioned Te≈øtimonies, that the Wars and Incur≈øions made by the <hi>Negroes,</hi> one upon another, are mo≈øtly at the Solicitation of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who in≈øtigate them by every Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, even the mo≈øt iniquitous and cruel, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Slaves to load their Ve≈ø≈øels, which they freely purcha≈øe, without any Regard to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Go≈øpel, the feelings of Humanity, or the common Dictates of Rea≈øon and Equity.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009066_0008_10311833ED184020"/>For though it is ≈øcare to be doubted, but that there were Wars among≈øt ≈øome of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> before the <hi>Europeans</hi> began to trade with them, yet certain it is, that the≈øe Calamities are not only ≈øince that Time prodigiou≈øly encrea≈øed, and the <hi>Europeans,</hi> by encouraging them thereto, and gladly purcha≈øing the Captives they take, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come come not only Parties with them therein, but the ≈øole Cau≈øe of that Encrea≈øe. This is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Account given by <hi>N. Brue,</hi> Director of the <hi>French</hi> Factory at <hi>Senegal,</hi> who lived Twenty-≈øeven Years in that Country, who ≈øays, <q>That the <hi>Europeans</hi> are far from de≈øiring to act as Peace Makers among≈øt the <hi>Negroes,</hi> which would be acting contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, ≈øince the greater the Wars, the more Slaves are procured.</q>

               <hi>William Bo≈øman,</hi> Factor for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> at <hi>Delmina,</hi> where he re≈øided ≈øixteen Years, relates, <q>That one of the former Commanders hired an Army of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> of <hi>Jafferia</hi> and <hi>Cabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteria,</hi> for a large Sum of Money, to fight the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Commany,</hi> which occa≈øioned a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which was more bloody than the Wars of the <hi>Negroes</hi> u≈øually are: And that another Commander gave, at one time, <hi>Five Hundrea Pounds,</hi> and at another time <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds,</hi> to two other <hi>Negroe</hi> Nations, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to take up Arms again≈øt their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People.</q> This is confirmed by <hi>Barbot,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent General of the <hi>French African</hi> Company, who ≈øays; <q>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> a People very zealous for their Commerce at the Coa≈øt, were very

               <q>That the di≈øcerning Natives account it their greate≈øt Unhappine≈øs that they were ever vi≈øited by the <hi>Europeans:</hi>‚ÄîThat we Chri≈øtians introduced the Traffick of Slaves, and that before our coming they lived in Peace; but, ≈øay they, it is ob≈øervable, that wherever Chri≈øtianity comes, there comes with it a Sword, a Gun, Powder and Ball.</q>

            <p>As to the Account of the natural Di≈øpo≈øition of many of the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and of the Fruitfulne≈øs of their Country, the forementioned Authors, as well as many others, have wrote largely upon it. <hi>M.

               <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Account of the Natives is, <q>That he found them a civil good natured People, indu≈øtrious to the la≈øt Degree, and their Country exceeding Fertile.‚ÄîIt is ea≈øy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009066_0011_1031183CF6B62A20"/>(≈øays he) to perceive what happy Memories they are ble≈ø≈øed with, and how great Progre≈øs they would make in the Sciences, in ca≈øe their Genius was cultivated with Study: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them≈øelves in choice Terms, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions noble, and Manners polite;‚Äîthis (he adds) is to be under≈øtood of the People of Di≈øtinction, as Officers, Merchantmen, and the like; for Pea≈øants, Workmen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, are as ignorant in the≈øe Parts as el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbot</hi> ≈øays, <q>The Inhabitants of <hi>Oedo</hi> are, for the Generality, very civil, good natured People, ea≈øy to be dealt with, conde≈øcending to what the <hi>Europeans</hi> require of them, in a civil Way; but if treated with Haughtine≈øs and rudely, they are ≈øtiff and high, and will not yield on any Account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some Writers have repre≈øented the Natives of <hi>Cape Me≈øurado</hi> as faithle≈øs and cruel; but it is very likely this Repre≈øentation of their Di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was occa≈øioned by the Re≈øentment they had ≈øhewn for the ill U≈øage received from the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans;</hi> for Captain <hi>Philips</hi> declared them to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and courteous. And <hi>Snoek</hi> ≈øays, <q>He found them a civil good-natur'd People; but that the late Injury they had received from the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> who had carried off ≈øome of their People, had ≈øo exa≈øperated them, that it was to be feared ≈øome <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> People they had in their Power, would fall a Sacrifice to their Re≈øentment.</q>

            <p>Although the extream Heat in many Parts of <hi>Guiney,</hi> is ≈øuch as is neither agreeable nor healthy

            <p>
               <hi>Brue,</hi> in his Account of the Fertility of the Country, and Indu≈øtry of the Natives, ≈øays; <q>He was ≈øurprized to ≈øee the Land ≈øo well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as he ob≈øerved it to be, in one of his Journies; ≈øcarce a Spot lay unimproved; the low Grounds, divided by ≈ømall Canals, were all ≈øowed with Rice; the higher Grounds planted with <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Millet, and Pea≈øe of different Sorts, Beef and Mutton very cheap, as well as all other Nece≈ø≈øaries of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bo≈øman</hi> ≈øays, <q>The <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Guiney</hi> Corn is here ≈øown and reaped twice every Year; the fir≈øt Harve≈øt is in <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> and the other the latter End of the Year, though but ≈ømall, Corn grows with little Trouble, very ≈øpeedily taking Root, ≈øo that one or two Men can manure and plow as much Land as one Plow can turn up in <hi>Holland. Indian</hi> Corn grows in the upper Lands, in prodigious Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and where Corn won't grow, there Rice encrea≈øes in Abundance, and Yamms and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes are in the greate≈øt Plenty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the Kingdom of <hi>Fida,</hi> he ≈øays, <q>The Country was very populous, many large Villages, be≈øides innumerable ≈ømall Ones, through the whole Country, plentifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Corn, Potatoes and Fruit, which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009066_0013_103118422F2440A8"/>grew clo≈øe to each other; in ≈øome Places a Foot Path is the only Ground that is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with them, the <hi>Negroes</hi> leaving no Place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated, even within the Hedges which inclo≈øe their Villages: And the very next Day after they have reaped they are ≈øure to ≈øow again. This ≈øine Country is now very much depopulated, which it is likely, was owing to the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions made upon them by their Neighbours, in order to get Slaves to ≈øell to the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
               </q> For the ≈øame <hi>Bo≈øman,</hi> ≈øpeaking of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation of <hi>Pope,</hi> ≈øays; <q>They depend on Plunder and the Slave Trade, in which they exceed ≈øome of their Neighbours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Other Parts of the Country he de≈øcribes, as <q>being full of Towns and Villages; the Soil very rich, and ≈øo well cultivated, as to look like and entire Garden, abounding in Rice, Corn, Oxen, Goats and Poultry; and the <hi>Negroes</hi> to be laborious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Barbot</hi> ≈øays, <q>The Inland People employ them≈øelves in Tillage and Trade, and ≈øupply the Markets with Corn, Fruit and Palm Wine; the Country producing ≈øuch va≈øt Plenty of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Wheat, that Abundance is daily export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009066_0014_1031184592673650"/>as well by <hi>Europeans</hi> as <hi>Blacks,</hi> re≈øorting thither from other Parts.</q> He adds, <q>That the Country of <hi>Delmina,</hi> which was formerly very powerful and populous, though now ≈øo much drained of its Inhabitants, by the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine Wars fomented among≈øt the <hi>Negroes</hi> by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that there does not remain enough Inhabitants to till the Country; abounded with fine well-built and populous Towns, enriched with va≈øt Fields of Corn, Cattle, Palm Wine and Oil. The Inhabitants all applying them≈øelves, without Di≈øtinction, to Agriculture, ≈øowing Corn, pre≈ø≈øing Oil, and drawing Wine from Palm Trees, with both of which it is plentifully ≈øtored others to fi≈øhing, and boiling Salt, and other Trades, on their own Account, or as Brokers for the Inland Blacks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many more Accounts could be given of the good Di≈øpo≈øition of the Generality of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes,</hi> and of the Plenty their Coutry affords, in which it, perhaps, exceeds mo≈øt Countries in the World; but this is ≈øufficient to ≈øhew that they might have lived happily, more e≈øpecially if the <hi>Europeans</hi> had not only bore the Name, but had acted the Part of Chri≈øtians, in u≈øing their Endeavour, by Example as well as Precept, to make the <hi>Negroes</hi> acquainted with the glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Go≈øpel, and with that Change of Heart, and Redemption from Sin, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity prorpo≈øes; this, if attended to, would have nece≈ø≈øarily been productive of the peaceable Fruits of Righteou≈øne≈øs; Innocency and Love
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009066_0015_1031184719B325B8"/>would have prevailed, and nothing would have been wanting to compleat the≈øe poor <hi>Africans</hi> Happine≈øs. But the Rever≈øe has happened; the <hi>Europeans,</hi> forgetful of their Profe≈ø≈øion and Duty as Men and Chri≈øtians, have conducted in ≈øo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous a Manner, as mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily rai≈øe in the Minds of the thoughtful and well-di≈øpo≈øed <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> the utmo≈øt Scorn and Dete≈øtation of the very Name of Chri≈øtians.

He often goes with ≈øome of his Troops by a Town in the Day-time, and returns in the Night, and ≈øets Fire to three Parts of it, placing Guards at the Fourth, to ≈øeize the People that run out of the Fire, then ties their Arms behind them, and marches them to <hi>Joar</hi> or <hi>Rohone,</hi> where he ≈øells them.</q>

               <hi>Brue,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Factor bef√≥re-mentioned, ≈øays, <q>That having received Goods, he wrote to the King, that if he had a ≈øufficient Number of Slaves, he was ready to trade with him, this Prince, ≈øays that Author, as well as the other <hi>Negroe</hi> Monarchs, have always a ≈øure Way of ≈øupplying his Deficiencies, by ≈øelling their own Subjects, for which they ≈øeldom want Preten≈øions of ≈øome Kind or other, to ju≈øtify their Rapine.</q> The≈øe <hi>Negroe</hi> Kings, thus ≈øeeking Pretences to cover their Crimes, ≈øhews they are not quite void of Shame, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen≈øible that Covetou≈øne≈øs induces them to act a

               <q>The King had Recour≈øe to this Method, by ≈øeizing Three Hundred of his own People, and ≈øent Word to <hi>Brue,</hi> that he had the Slaves ready to deliver for the Goods.</q> The ≈øame Author further adds, <q>That ≈øome of the Natives are, on all Occa≈øions, endeavouring to ≈øurprize and carry off their Country People; they land (≈øays he) without Noi≈øe, and if they find any lone Cottage, without Defence, they ≈øurround it, and carry off all the People and Effects to their Boat: The Slaves are ≈øold to the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi> unle≈øs they be Per≈øons of ≈øome Rank, who≈øe Friends can redeem them, by paying two Slaves, or five or ≈øix Oxen.</q>

That the Inhabitants of <hi>Arda</hi> were ≈øo diligent in the Slave Trade, that they were able to deliver a Thou≈øand Slaves every Month; and that if there happened to be no Stock of Slaves when the Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels arrived, they would ≈øometimes ≈øend their Commodities Two Hundred Miles deep in the Country (a later Author ≈øays, they have now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Trade Five Hundred Miles farther, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Seven Hundred Miles back into the Country) where Markets of Men were kept in the ≈øame Manner as tho≈øe of Bea≈øts with us.

When the≈øe Slaves come to <hi>Fida,</hi> they are put in Pri≈øon alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and when (≈øays he) we treat concerning baying them, they are all brought out together in a large Plain, where, by our Surgeons, they are thoroughly examined, and that naked too, both Men and Women, without the lea≈øt Di≈øtinction or Mode≈øty.

If this Trade ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a moral or a rational Ju≈øtification, every Crime, even the mo≈øt atrocious, may be ju≈øtified. Government was in≈øtituted for the Good of Mankind; Kings, Princes, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, are not Proprietors of tho≈øe who are ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Authority; they have not a Right to make them mi≈øerable. On the contrary, their Authority is ve≈øted in them, that they may, by the ju≈øt Exerci≈øe of it, promote the Happine≈øs of their People. Of Cour≈øe, they they have not a Right to di≈øpo≈øe of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and to ≈øell them for Slaves. Be≈øides, no Man has a Right to acquire or to purcha≈øe them; Men and their Liberty are not <hi>(in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercio)</hi> they are not either ≈øaleable or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øeable. One, therefore, has no body but him≈øelf to blame, in ca≈øe he ≈øhall find him≈øelf deprived of a Man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a Price, made his own; for he dealt in a Trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the mo≈øt obvious Dictates of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. For the≈øe Rea≈øons every one of tho≈øe unfortunate Men, who are pretended to be Slaves, has a Right to be declared to be free,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009066_0023_1031185AD456CD68"/>for he never lo≈øt his Liberty; he could not lo≈øe it; his Prince had no Power to di≈øpo≈øe of him. Of Cour≈øe the Sale was <hi>ip≈øo Jure</hi> void. This Right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get it declared. As ≈øoon, therefore, as he comes into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in which the Judges are not forgetful of their own Humanity, it is their Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is a Man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been ≈øaid, that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions concerning the State of Per≈øons ought to be determined by the Law of the Country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a Slave in <hi>America,</hi> ought, in ca≈øe he ≈øhould happen to be imported into <hi>Britain,</hi> to be adjudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of <hi>America</hi> to be a Slave; a Doctrine than which nothing can be more barbarous. Ought the Judges of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, out of Re≈øpect to the Law of another, to ≈øhew no Re≈øpect to their Kind, and to Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Out of Re≈øpect to a Law, which is in no Sort obligatory upon them, ought they to di≈øregard the Law of Nature, which is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on all Men at all Times, and in all Places: Are any Laws ≈øo binding as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws of Ju≈øtice? Is it doubtful, whether a Judge ought to pay greater Regard to them, than to tho≈øe arbitrary and inhuman U≈øages which prevail in a di≈øtant Land? Aye, but our Colonies would be ruined, if Slavery was aboli≈øhed. Be it ≈øo; would it not from thence follow, that the Bulk of Mankind ought to be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009066_0024_1031185C59EBECE0"/>abu≈øed, that our Pockets may be filled with Money, or our Mouths with Delicacies? The Pur≈øes of Highwaymen would be empty in ca≈øe Robberies were totally aboli≈øhed; but have Men a Right to acquire Money by going out to the Highway? Have Men a Right to acquire it by rendering their Fellow Creatures mi≈øerable? Is it lawful to abu≈øe Mankind, that the Avarice, the Vanity, or the Pa≈ø≈øions of a few may be gratified? No! there is ≈øuch a Thing as Ju≈øtice, to which the mo≈øt ≈øacred Regard is due. It ought to be inviolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved. Have not the≈øe unhappy Men a better Right to their Liberty, and to their Happine≈øs, than our <hi>American</hi> Merchants have to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which they make by torturing their Kind? Let therefore our Colonies be ruined, but let us not render ≈øo many Men mi≈øerable. Would not any of us, who ≈øhould‚Äîbe ≈ønatched by Pyrates from his native Land, think him≈øelf cruelly abu≈øed, and at all Times intitled to be free. Have not the≈øe unfortunate <hi>Africans,</hi> who meet with the ≈øame cruel Fate, the ≈øame Right? Are not they Men as well as we, and have they not the ≈øame Sen≈øibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or ≈øupport a U≈øage which is contrary to all the Laws of Humanity.</p>
            <p>But it is fal≈øe, that either we or our Colonies would be ruined by the Abolition of Slavery. It might occa≈øion a Stagnation of Bu≈øine≈øs for a ≈øhort Time.

And as for tho≈øe who confe≈øs them≈øelves now, convinced of the Iniquity of this Trade, and the Inju≈øtice of buying and ≈øelling their Fellow Creatures, and yet continue to keep tho≈øe <hi>Negroes</hi> they are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of in Bondage, for the Sake of the Profit ari≈øing from their Labour, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them ≈øeriou≈øly to con≈øider their Motives for ≈øuch a Conduct; whether the Di≈øtinction they make between buying a <hi>Negroe,</hi> and keeping the ≈øame <hi>Negroe,</hi> or his Offspring, in perpetual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is not a Plea founded more in Words than ≈øupported by Truth; for it mu≈øt be obvious to every Per≈øon, who is not blinded by the De≈øire of Gain, that the Right by which the≈øe Men hold the <hi>Negroes</hi> in Bondage, is no other than what is derived from tho≈øe who ≈øtole them, or received them from the Thief, who having no other Title, but that which Robbers have over their Prey, could not convey any better to the Purcha≈øer; and that therefore to continue to hold them in Bondage, for worldly Advantage, by no other Right than that which tho≈øe guilty Men gave them, is con≈øenting to, and partaking of their Guilt.

            <p>Our being Chri≈øtians does not give us any worldly Superiority, or any Authority whatever, over tho≈øe who are not Chri≈øtians.

And in the New Te≈øtament, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 10. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtealers are reckoned among≈øt the very wor≈øt of Men. Can any Thing be more cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, than to ≈øeize upon human Creatures, and take them away by Force from their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from their Friends and Relations, for ever; Children from their tender Parents, Parents from their dear Children, Women from their beloved Hu≈øbands, and Hu≈øbands from their beloved Wives, and drive them, like Hogs, to Market, there to be ≈øold for Slaves for Life? How great mu≈øt be the Mi≈øery tho≈øe poor Creatures are in, and the Agonies of Mind they fell, when they are thus carried off; ≈øo great, that, to relieve them≈øelves, ≈øome of them have put an End to their Lives. And how grievous, how di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, mu≈øt be the Condition of their Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are deprived of them, and ≈øhall never ≈øee their Faces any more? It is horrid, it is ≈øhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to think of ≈øuch Cruelty and Barbarity. What Mon≈øters in Nature then, de≈øtitute of all Humanity and Compa≈ø≈øion, mu≈øt they be, who are guilty of it. The black Men have the ≈øame natural Affection for their Kindred, and as ≈øtrong, as we have.‚ÄîTo ≈øell and buy human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009066_0032_10311870CC379810"/>without their Con≈øent, yea and ≈øore again≈øt, their Will, to trade in Men, as you would in brute Creatures, or any other Commodities, is really impious as well as cruel. Man is a noble Creature, made but a little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and crowned with Glory and Honour. He is the Offspring of GOD; therefore thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈øe him, and to bring him down upon a Level with the Brutes, yea with Things inanimate, is great Impiety, it is an high Affront offered to him, who is the kind and merciful Father of us all, who hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men, to dwell on the Face of the Earth, and hath united them all in one Body by the Ties of Nature. It is likewi≈øe an Affront put upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, upon the whole human Race, which ≈øhould rai≈øe a generous Re≈øentment and Indignation in the Brea≈øt of every one that partakes of the human Nature, and has any Notion of the Dignity of it, or any Sen≈øe of Humanity, which he ≈øhould expre≈øs and di≈øcover upon all proper Occa≈øions, and in all proper Ways.‚ÄîAnd I think the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, in this Ca≈øe, will appear to be wor≈øe, to be more guilty, in ≈øome Re≈øpects, than the bare Thief, if we fairly con≈øider the Matter.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that the <hi>Europeans,</hi> in ≈øending Ships yearly to the Coa≈øt of <hi>Africa,</hi> to buy Slaves, without enquiring how tho≈øe they purcha≈øe them of came by them, do encourage tho≈øe Thieves, and tempt them to make a Practice and Trade of ≈øtealing their own Countrymen; for this is the ≈øame Thing in Effect, as if they were to tell them in ≈øo many Words, <q>
                  <hi>You get Men ready for us,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009066_0033_103118784FE492B0"/>how you can, and we will take them off your Hands.</hi>
               </q> Be≈øides, tho≈øe Men-merchants not only encourage others in this cruel flagitious Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Man-≈øtealing, but are really guilty of it them≈øelves. You will ob≈øerve, that what is done by their Command, and according to their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I con≈øider as done by them≈øelves. As tho≈øe poor mi≈øerable Creatures were ≈øtolen, tho≈øe who did ≈øteal them, could not convey any Right in them to others, though the≈øe others ≈øhould give ever ≈øo much in Purcha≈øe of them, any more than if they had them for nothing. For tho≈øe Purcha≈øers then to deprive them of their Liberty, and, by Force, keep them in their Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, in whom they have no Right (≈øuppo≈øing one Man could be the Property of another) and who never injured them in the lea≈øt, nor forfeited their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; to keep them in Bonds, and carry them away Captives, is, properly ≈øpeaking, Man-≈øteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And what aggravates this Crime in the <hi>European</hi> Man-merchants, and renders it much more heinous in them than in the <hi>Africans,</hi> is, that the former enjoy the Light of the Go≈øpel, and profe≈øs them≈øelves to be Chri≈øtians.</p>
            <p>Man-≈øtealing is a Kind, and indeed the wor≈øt Kind, of Sacrilege, which Con≈øideration farther ≈øhews the Impiety of it. Man is ≈øacred, and is, by Nature, devoted to the Service of GOD, to who≈øe Authority alone he is obliged to yield an ab≈øolute, unlimited Obedience; for one Man therefore to a≈ø≈øault another, and, by meer Force, to make a Captive of him, not for any Crime that he has been guilty of, but to make a <hi>Penny</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009066_0034_10311879D8D7C978"/>of him, con≈øidering him as Part of his Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions or Goods, with which he can do what he plea≈øes, is robbing of GOD, which is Sacrilege.</p>
            <p>It is very common in the Countries, where the <hi>Europeans</hi> carry on this Trade, for the petty Kings and Princes, of which there are a great many, to go to War with their Neighbours, not in Defence of their Right, not to get Satisfaction for any Injuries done them, or to repair any Damages they have unju≈øtly ≈øuffered by tho≈øe Neighbours, but purely to get Pri≈øoners again≈øt the Time the Ships from <hi>Europe</hi> arrive upon their Coa≈øt, that with them they may be able to purcha≈øe of the Captains of tho≈øe Ships the Goods they have on board.</p>
            <p>Now here the Injury and Crime is the ≈øame in Kind as in the former Ca≈øe, and indeed greater in the Kind: In both Ca≈øes it is ≈øtealing Man, but in the latter it is attended with ≈øhedding of Blood, with Slaughter and De≈øtruction; which Con≈øideration doth aggravate the Crime of our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, who purcha≈øe tho≈øe Pri≈øoners. CHRIST hath ≈øaid, that <hi>ble≈ø≈øed are the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, for they ≈øhall be called the Children of</hi> GOD. But how contrary to what our Saviour recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, the making of Peace among Men, is the Spirit and Practice of tho≈øe, who, for Lucre Sake, provoke and encourage others to go to War with their Neighbours, and by unju≈øt Force to kill and de≈øtroy ≈øome, and others of them to make Pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>But let us now ≈øuppo≈øe,‚Äîthat the Pri≈øoners, which are bought, were even engaged in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009066_0035_1031187B75FE4400"/>War, that they were the fir≈øt Invaders or Aggre≈ø≈øors‚ÄîWhen one King or Prince goes to War with another, the common Men are not capable of judging of the Merits of the Cau≈øe, which Party has or has not Right of their Side; but, laying a≈øide this Con≈øideration, they are forced to go whither≈øoever their King or Captain leads them; they are obliged to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and to de≈øert would be Death to them: Therefore I think it would be unju≈øt and cruel, in him who comes off Conqueror, though he had Right of his Side, and was engaged in a ju≈øt War, to deprive tho≈øe common Men, who are taken Pri≈øoners, of their Liberty, after the War is over, or at any Time to ≈øell them for Slaves for Life, either by Way of Puni≈øhment or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, unle≈øs they be ≈øuppo≈øed to be an≈øwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for whatever Damage or Injury is done by their King, or that they are his Goods or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; both which are ab≈øurd, and the latter a Suppo≈øition unworthy of human Nature, and ≈øhocking to the human Mind; con≈øequently, the buying of them for ≈øuch, mu≈øt be altogether as criminal in the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is reckoned we have now in this Kingdom Thirty Thou≈øand <hi>French</hi> Pri≈øoners, or more; and we ≈øay, that in the War we are carrying on again≈øt <hi>France,</hi> we have Right on our Side; that we entered into it for the Recovery and Defence of our Territories, invaded by them; but though it be true (as I believe it is) that our Cau≈øe is good, yet would it not be cruel and inhuman in us, to ≈øell the≈øe Pri≈øoners into Slavery for Life,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009066_0036_1031187D04535490"/>and in any other Nation, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for In≈øtance, to buy them of us, in order to ≈øend them to work in their Mines in <hi>Peru,</hi> as long as they live?

            <p>The Captain of the <hi>Guiney</hi> Ship, when he has fini≈øhed his Marketing, when he has bought as many rea≈øonable Creatures as he wants, and is full freighted, having on board (we will ≈øay) Two Hundred of them, coupled in Irons, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009066_0037_1031188020C7D498"/>clo≈øely crammed up in a Ship of about One Hundred Tons Burthen, he ≈øets out for one of our Plantations,‚Äîand may be two or three Months on the Voyage; during which Time, from the Filth and Stench that mu≈øt be among them, occa≈øioned by their being put down under Deck, and penn'd together in ≈øo little Room,‚Äî Di≈øtempers break out among them, and carry off a great many, a Fifth, or Fourth, yea, ≈øometimes a third Part of them; and it is rea≈øonable to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, that ≈øome of them have their Hearts broke, and die with Grief and Angui≈øh, to think that they ≈øhall never more ≈øet Foot on their Native Soil, and that the Eye that hath ≈øeen them, ≈øhall ≈øee them no more. I remember I read an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in one of the News-Papers la≈øt Year; a Ship, belonging to <hi>Liverpool,</hi> that had a Hundred and Ninety Slaves on board, Eighty of whom died on the Voyage, which is more than two Fifths‚ÄîTaking all the Slaves together, that are brought on board our Ships yearly, from the Coa≈øt of <hi>Africa,</hi> where they are bought by our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, I think one may venture to affirm, that, at lea≈øt, a Tenth Part of them die on the Voyage;‚Äîthe Merchants are certainly chargeable with taking away the Lives of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of tho≈øe poor Creatures, as come by their Death by being ≈øo confined and treated, and are guilty of Murder; for to take away a Man's Life, unju≈øtly, is Murder; whether it be done in two or three Minutes, or two or three Months, that makes no Difference.‚ÄîI do not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, in order to convict a Man of Murder,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009066_0038_10311886F2226960"/>to make it appear that he had an Intention to commit Murder: Whoever does, by unju≈øt Force and Violence, deprive another of his Liberty, and, while he has him in his Power, reduces him to ≈øuch a Condition, and gives him ≈øuch Treatment, as evidently endangers his Life, and, in the Event, do actually deprive him of his Life, is guilty of Murder.‚ÄîBy the Account given in the ≈øecond Volume of the <hi>Compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtem of Geography,</hi> the Number of <hi>Negroes</hi> brought away by the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> in the Year 172.5, appeared to be about Fifty Thou≈øand.‚ÄîWe will ≈øuppo≈øe that the Number of <hi>Negroes</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed by our <hi>Guiney</hi> Merchants, one Year with another, are no more than Thirty-five Thou≈øand: Now, in the Account given by that Author of the <hi>Negroes</hi> in our Plantations, it is ≈øaid, that, in the I≈øland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> almo≈øt Half of the new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>Negroes</hi> die in the Sea≈øoning, and that, in <hi>Barbados,</hi> it is reckoned that a fourth Part die in Sea≈øoning; and, according to the ≈øame Account there are twice as many imported into the≈øe two I≈ølands, as into all our other I≈ølands in the <hi>We≈øt-Indies,</hi> and all our Colonies in <hi>North-America.</hi> At a moderate Computation, therefore, it may be reckoned, that of all tho≈øe who are purcha≈øed by our <hi>African</hi> Merchants in a Year, Twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand die upon the Voyage, and in the Sea≈øoning.</p>
            <p>What a ≈øad dreadful Affair then is this Man-Trade, whereby ≈øo many Thou≈øands of our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low rational Creatures lo≈øe their Lives, are, truly and properly ≈øpeaking, murdered every Year; I do not think there is an In≈øtance of ≈øo great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009066_0039_103118888103A8A8"/>and Cruelty carried on in any Part of the World, as is this, Year after Year. It is enough to make one tremble, to think what a Load of Guilt lies upon this Nation, on this Account, and that the Blood of Thou≈øands of poor innocent Creatures, murdered every Year, in carrying on this cur≈øed Trade, cry aloud to Heaven for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Were we to hear or read of any other Nation in the World that did de≈øtroy every Year, in ≈øome other Way, or on ≈øome other Account, as many human Creatures as are de≈øtroyed by this Trade, we ≈øhould look upon them as a very bloody, cruel, barbarous People.

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009066_0040_1031188B16714510"/>poor Wretches have endured more Pain, before they died, than tho≈øe Hereticks did in being burnt. There is nothing that ≈øhews the Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Mankind more, that ca≈øts a greater Blemi≈øh on human Nature, or expo≈øes it in a more di≈øadvantageous Light, than this Con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whole Nations, Chri≈øtians as well as Heathens, profe≈øs to believe the greate≈øt Ab≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Contradictions, and ju≈øtify the mo≈øt wicked and vile≈øt Practices.‚ÄîIf it be ≈øaid that I charge the Legi≈ølature‚Äîbecau≈øe they have encouraged, and ≈øtill do encourage, this Trade, ‚Äîwhat I have a≈ø≈øerted, I think I can defend. ‚ÄîNo Legi≈ølature on Earth, which is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power in every civil Society, can alter the Nature of Things, or make that to be lawful which is contrary to the Law of GOD, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Legi≈ølator and Governor of the World.

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009066_0043_10311893154271A0"/>of the mi≈øerable Slavery they are in.‚ÄîBut how come they to be three times the Number of the Whites in this I≈øland? Is it not owing to the white Inhabitants, to their purcha≈øing them, and keeping them in Bondage? How weak then is this Excu≈øe? Where is the Sen≈øe of a≈ø≈øigning this Majority, which is of their own procuring, as a Rea≈øon for their treating the <hi>Blacks</hi> with ≈øuch Severity?‚ÄîWe have al≈øo an Account from that Author, of tho≈øe Plots laid by the <hi>Blacks</hi> in <hi>Antigua,</hi> but which were di≈øcovered by the Whites, before they could be brought to bear, and of the horrid Executions which followed upon the Di≈øcovery. "The King, that is, he who was to have been King of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> had the Plot ≈øucceeded, and his two Generals, with two others, were all broke on a Wheel (that is, their Bones were broke with an Iron Bar whil≈øt alive.) Four more of the principal Con≈øpirators were burnt the ≈øame Day; as were Seven on the next Day. Six were hung alive in Chains on Gibbets, and ≈øtarved to Death; after which their Heads were cut off, and their Bodies burnt; and Fifty-eight others were, at ≈øeveral Times, chained to Stakes, and burnt alive." Now, was not this a lamentable Affair (and there have been ≈øeveral In≈øtances of ≈øuch Cruelty in our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) that ≈øo many poor Creatures ≈øhould be put to the greate≈øt Tortures, and be made to ≈øuffer the mo≈øt painful Deaths. Some of the <hi>French.</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners in <hi>England,</hi> who≈øe Condition is far prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that of mo≈øt of the Salves in our Colonies, have attempted to break out of Pri≈øon, but, being
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009066_0044_10311895A4D81930"/>di≈øcovered in Time, failed in their Attempt. Now ≈øhould not we have been reckoned, by all the World, a cruel barbarous People, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had ordered ≈øome of them to be broke on the Wheel, ≈øome to be burnt alive, and others to be ≈øtarved to Death, though the <hi>French</hi> are our Enemies, and are engaged in an unju≈øt War again≈øt us; whereas tho≈øe Slaves had never done any Hurt or Injury to tho≈øe who torture them to Death.‚ÄîWe reckon our≈øelves to be a brave, generous, humane, civilized People;‚Äîbut is this a true Character, while that barbarous, ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Man-Trade, in the carrying on of which ≈øo many Thou≈øand Lives are ≈øacrificed every Year, is not only winked at, but countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged among≈øt us.‚ÄîThere are other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Europe,</hi> be≈øides ours, concerned in this Trade, but that does not le≈ø≈øen the Guilt in our People, though it may keep them in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> are now more concerned, I believe, than all the other Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> taken together, in this abominable Trade, which is the greate≈øt Scandal and Reproach that lies upon this Nation; the removing of which, by proclaiming Liberty to tho≈øe Captives now in our Plantations, making them Freemen, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting for ever, upon the ≈øevere≈øt Penalties, the Man-Trade throughout all His Maje≈øty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and thereby leading the Way, and giving a good Example to the other Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> concerned in the Man-Trade, would be much to the Honour of our Government, and I am ≈øure would give great Plea≈øure to all who are Lovers
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009066_0045_103118995450B6D0"/>of Mankind, and have a Regard for the Honour, Safety, and Pro≈øperity of their Country.‚ÄîIt is objected, that if the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were to drop this Trade entirely, it would be immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon carried on by other Nations, to a much greater Degree than it now is.‚ÄîPerhaps that might be the Con≈øequence, and if it ≈øhould, they mu≈øt be an≈øwerable for that, the Guilt and Scandal would lie upon them. But if it were certain that this would be the Ca≈øe, this Con≈øideration cannot be a ju≈øt Rea≈øon for our continuing to carry on ≈øuch a wicked Trade. If we ≈øhould not carry on this Trade others would, therefore we may, would be a ≈øtrange Way of rea≈øoning.</p>
            <p>And as this Slave-Trade has been encouraged by the Government, for many Reigns back, it is queried, whether the pre≈øent Government, in ca≈øe they were to ≈øet tho≈øe <hi>Negroes</hi> in our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at Liberty, ≈øhould not make good that Lo≈øs to their Ma≈øters; but I ≈øhall not take upon me to determine that Point; our Governors are be≈øt Judges of that, only I think they had better do ≈øo, though it ≈øhould require ≈øome Millions to do it, than ≈øuffer tho≈øe poor Creatures to continue in the mi≈øerable State of Slavery they are now in. There is one Con≈øequence more which, ≈øome People fear, would follow upon prohibiting of the <hi>Negroe</hi> Trade, and that is, that ≈øuch a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition would greatly le≈ø≈øen, if not utterly ruin, ≈øome other con≈øiderable Branches of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, e≈øpecially the Sugar and the Tobacco Trades, becau≈øe of the Difficulty of getting Hands enough, in the Room of the <hi>Blacks,</hi> to work
