            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF SIR MATTHEW HALE.</head>
            <p>SIR Matthew Hale, a man of great learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench in the laſt century, was born at Alderly, in Glouces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire. November 1, 1609. His grandfather was Robert Hale, an eminent clothier in the ſame county, where he and his anceſtors had lived for many deſcents, and were remarkable for their liberality to the poor. This Robert acquired an eſtate of ten thouſand pounds, which he divided equally amongſt his five ſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the portions be gave his daughters. His ſecond ſon was Robert Hale, a Barriſter of Lincoln's Inn, who married Joan, the daughter of Matthew Poyntz, of Alderly, Eſq. Of this marriage, the great man, the ſubject of theſe memoirs, was the only iſſue. His father was a man of that ſtrictneſs of conſcience, that he gave over the practice of the law, becauſe he could not underſtand the reaſon of giving colour in pleadings, which he thought was to tell a lie, and that, with ſome other things commonly practiſed, ſeemed to him contrary to that exactneſs of truth and juſtice which became a Chriſtian, ſo that he withdrew himſelf from the Inns of Court, to live on his eſtate in the country. (A rare inſtance! and ſcarcely to be found now-a-days.) But as the care he had to ſave his ſoul made him aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a profeſſion by which he might have raiſed his family much higher, ſo his charity made him not only deal his alms largely while he lived, but at his death he left 20<abbr>l.</abbr> per ann. to the poor at Wotton, which his ſon confirmed to them with ſome additions.</p>
            <p>Thus he was deſcended rather from a good than a noble family; and what was wanting in the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant titles of high birth, and "the boaſt of heraldry," was more than made up in the worth of his anceſtors. But he was ſoon deprived of his father's care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:022548_0003_0FB947ECE808B3F8"/>
—as his mother died when he was three years old, ſo his father died when he was no more than five. But as Providence, when it takes one bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from us, or one friend, takes care to raiſe up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our comfort, ſo was he taken under the care of Anthony Kingſcot, Eſq. who was his next kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after his uncles, by his mother.</p>
            <p>Great care was taken of his education, and his guardian intended to breed him a Divine, and being inclined to the Puritans, he was put to ſchools that were taught by that party, and in the ſeventeenth year of his age he was ſent to Magdalen Hall, in Oxford. He was an extraordinary proficient at ſchool, and for ſome time at Oxford; but the players coming thither, by ſeeing ſo many plays, he was ſo much corrupted, that he almoſt wholly forſook his ſtudies, by which he loſt much time, which he was not only ſenſible of, but found his head filled with vain images of things, which were unprofitable, if not hurtful to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved upon coming to London, never to ſee a play more; to which he ſtrictly adhered.</p>
            <p>The corruption of a young man's mind in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, frequently brings on a great many more after it; ſo now being taken off from following his ſtudies, and from that gravity which was before his character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic, he now ſet himſelf to many of the vanities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to younger years, but yet he preſerved his purity, and a great probity of mind. He loved fine cloaths, and delighted much in company, and being of a ſtrong and robuſt make, he was maſter of all thoſe exerciſes which require ſtrength and agility of body. He learned to fence, in which he became ſo expert, that ſcarcely any could maſter him in that art. One of his teachers told him one day that he could now inſtruct him no more, for that he was now better at his trade than he himſelf was; this Hale looked upon as flattery, to make a diſcovery of which, he promiſed him the houſe he lived in (for he was his tenant,) if he would hit
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022548_0004_0FB947EF99ECBBE8"/>
him on the head, and bid him do his beſt, for he would be as good as his word; after a little engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the maſter being really ſuperior, hit him on the head, and he perfomed his promiſe freely. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhewed a good judgment, and gave ſome hopes of better things; and he was not unwilling at that rate to learn ſo early to diſtinguiſh flattery from truth. He was now ſo taken up with martial matters, that inſtead of being a ſcholar or divine, he reſolved to be a ſoldier; and his tutor, Obadiah Sedgewick, going to the Low Countries, Chaplain to the renowned Lord Vere, he reſolved to go along with him, and to trail a pike in the Prince of Orange's army: but a happy ſtop was put to this reſolution, which might have proved fatal to himſelf, and deprived his country of the great example he gave, and the uſeful ſervices he did. He was engaged in a ſuit of law with Sir William Whitmore, who laid claim to part of his eſtate, and his guardian being a man of a retired tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not made for buſineſs, he was obliged to leave the Univerſity, after he had been three years in it, and go to London to ſolicit for his own buſineſs. Being recommended to Serjeant Glanvil for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, and he obſerving in him a clear apprehenſion of things, and a ſolid judgment, and a great fitneſs for the law, took pains to perſuade him from being a ſoldier, and to apply to the law; this had ſo good an effect on him, that on the eighth of November, 1632, he was admitted into Lincoln's Inn, and being ſenſible how much time he had loſt, he reſolved to redeem it, and followed his ſtudies with a diligence that ſcarcely could be believed, if the ſignal effects of it did not gain it credit. He ſtudied for many years at the rate of ſixteen hours a day; he threw aſide all fine cloaths, and betook himſelf to a plain faſhion, which he continued to his dying day. Yet he did not at firſt break off from keeping too much company with ſome vain people, till a ſad accident drove him
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:022548_0005_0FB947F0A04CFF48"/>
from it; for he and ſome other young ſtudents being invited out of town to be merry, one of them called for ſo much wine, that notwithſtanding all Mr. Hale could do to prevent it, he carried his exceſs to ſuch an height, that he fell down dead before them. They were all much affrighted at it, and did what they could to bring him to himſelf again. Mr. Hale was ſo particularly affected, that he went into another room, fell on his knees, and prayed earneſtly to God, both for himſelf and friend, that he might be reſtored to life again, and be forgiven for giving ſuch counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to exceſs; and he then vowed to God, that he would never again keep company in that manner, nor drink a health while he lived, and he moſt religiouſly obſerved his vow.</p>
            <p>This wrought an entire change on him: he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forſook all vain company, and divided himſelf between the duties of religion, and the ſtudies of his profeſſion; in the former he was ſo regular, that for thirty ſix years time, he never once failed going to church on the Lord's day; this obſervation he made when an ague interrupted that conſtant courſe, and he reflected on it, as an acknowledgment of God's great goodneſs to him, in ſo long a continuance of his health.</p>
            <p>Not ſatisfied with the law books then publiſhed, but reſolved to take things from the fountain head, he was very diligent in ſearching records, and with col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections out of the books he read, together with his own learned obſervations, he made a moſt valuable common place book. He was early taken notice of by the Attorney General Noy, who directed him in his ſtudies, and admitted him to ſuch an intimacy, that he was called by many Young Noy. The great and learned Mr. Selden alſo ſoon found him out, and took ſuch a liking to him, that he not only lived in great friendſhip with him, but made him one of his executors. Mr Selden put him upon a more enlarged purſuit of learning, which he had before confined to
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022548_0006_0FB947F25C0A2190"/>
his own profeſſion; ſo that he arrived in time to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable knowledge in the civil law, in arithmetic, algebra, and other mathematical ſciences, as well as in phyſic, anatomy, and ſurgery. He was alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in experimental philoſophy, and other branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of philoſophical learning; and in ancient hiſtory and chronology. But above all, he ſeemed to have made divinity his chief ſtudy, ſo that thoſe who read what he has written upon theological queſtions, might be inclined to think, that he had ſtudied nothing elſe. "It is incredible, ſays Dr. Burnet, that one man in no great compaſs of years ſhould have acquired ſuch a variety of knowledge, and that, in ſciences which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much leiſure and application. But as his parts were quick, and his apprehenſion lively, his memory great, and his judgment ſtrong, ſo his induſtry was almoſt indefatigable. He roſe always betimes in the morning; was never idle; ſcarce ever held any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about news, except with ſome few in whom he entirely confided. He entered into no correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by letters, except about neceſſary buſineſs, or matters of learning, and ſpent very little time in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, for as he never went to public feaſts, ſo he gave no entertainments but to the poor. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed our Saviour's directions, of feaſting none but theſe, literally; and in eating and drinking, he obſerved not only great plainneſs and moderation, but lived ſo philoſophically, that he always ended his meal with an appetite; by which he not only loſt little time when he dined, but was fit for any exerciſe of the mind immediately after. By theſe means he gained a great deal of time, which others for the moſt part waſte unprofitably."</p>
            <p>He took a ſtrict account of his time, of which the reader will beſt judge by the following ſcheme he drew for a diary, and which ſhows, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the wording of them, they were only
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:022548_0007_0FB947F9901971D8"/>
intended for his privacies; they are here ſet down with the ſimplicity in which he writ for his private uſe.</p>
            <p>MORNING.—1. To lift up the heart to God in thankfulneſs for renewing my life.—2. To renew my covenant with God in Chriſt. 1ſt. By renewed acts of faith, receiving Chriſt and rejoicing in the height of that relation. 2d. Reſolution of being one of his people doing allegiance.—3. Adoration and prayer.—4. Setting a watch over my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and paſſions, over the ſnares laid in our way. <hi>Petimus Iliatis.</hi>—DAY EMPLOYMENT. There muſt be an employment, two kinds. 1.

"It is a ſervice to God, though never ſo mean." <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3 Here faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, diligence, cheerfulneſs. Not to overlay myſelf with more buſineſs than I can bear.</p>
            <p>Our ſpiritual employments: mingle ſomewhat of God's immediate ſervice in this day.—REFRESH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS. 1. Meat and drink, moderation ſeaſoned with ſomewhat of God.—2. Recreations, 1. Not our buſineſs. 2. Suitable. No games, if given to covetouſneſs or paſſion.—IF ALONE. 1. Beware of wandering, vain, luſtful thoughts; fly from thyſelf rather than entertain theſe.—2. Let thy ſolitary thoughts be profitable; view the evidences of thy ſalvation, the ſtate of thy ſoul, the coming of Chriſt, thy own mortality: it will make thee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and watchful.—COMPANY. Do good to them. Uſe God's name reverently. Beware of leaving an ill impreſſion of ill example. Receive good from them if more knowing.—EVENING. Caſt up the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the day. If aught be amiſs, beg pardon. Gather reſolution of more vigilance. If well, bleſs the mercy and grace of God that hath ſupported thee.</p>
            <p>Our author paſſing from the extreme of vanity
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:022548_0008_0FB947FB23599B38"/>
in his dreſs, to that of neglecting himſelf too much, was once taken by a preſs gang, as a perſon fit for the King's ſervice; for he was a ſtrong and a well-built man; but ſome coming by that knew him, and giving notice who he was, the preſs-men let him go. This made him return to more decency in his cloaths, but never to any ſuperfinity or vanity in them.</p>
            <p>Once as he was buying ſome cloth for a ſuit of cloaths, the draper, with whom he differed about the price, told him, he ſhould have it for nothing, if he would promiſe him an hundred pounds when he came to be Lord Chief Juſtice of England; to which he anſwered, That he could not with a good conſcience wear any man's cloth, unleſs he paid for it; ſo he paid the draper his price; and carried away the cloth; yet the draper lived to ſee him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that dignity.</p>
            <p>Some time before the civil wars broke out, he was called to the bar, and began to make a figure in the world; but upon their breaking out, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how difficult it was to preſerve his integrity, and yet live ſecurely, he reſolved to follow thoſe two rules of Pomponius Atticus, whom he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to himſelf as a pattern, <hi>viz.</hi> "To engage in no faction, or meddle in public buſineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to relieve and favour thoſe that were loweſt." He often relieved the royaliſts in their neceſſities, which ſo ingratiated him with them, that he was generally employed by them. He was one of the counſel to the Earl of Strafford, Archbiſhop Land, and King Charles; as alſo to the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, the Lord Capel, and the Lord Craven But being eſteemed a plain honeſt man, and of great knowledge in the law, he was entertained by both parties. In 1643, he took the covenant, and appeared ſeveral times with other
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:022548_0009_0FB947FCAEA76F88"/>
lay perſons among the aſſembly of divines. He was then in great eſteem with the Parliament, and employed by them in ſeveral affairs for his counſel, particularly in the reduction of the garriſon at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; being, as a lawyer, added to the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners named by the Parliament, to treat with thoſe appointed by the King. In that capacity he did good ſervice, by adviſing them, eſpecially General Fairfax, to preſerve that famous ſeat of learning from ruin. Afterwards, though he was grieved at Charles's death, he took the oath called the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; and on the 20th of January, 1651-2, was one of thoſe appointed to conſider of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law; and Cromwell knowing his great abilities, never leſt importuning him, till he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the place of one of the Juſtices of the Common Bench, for which purpoſe he was made Serjeant at Law, on January 25, 1653-4. In that ſtation he acted with integrity and courage. He had at firſt great ſcruples concerning the authority under which he was to act: and after having gone two or three circuits, he refuſed to ſit any more on the crown ſide. When Cromwell died, he excuſed himſelf from accepting the mourning that was ſent him, and alſo refuſed the commiſſion offered him by Richard. He did not ſit in Cromwell's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Parliament in 1656; but in Richard's, which met in January, 1658-9, he was one of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes for the Univerſity of Oxford. In the Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament in 1660, which recalled King Charles II. he was elected one of the Knights for the county of Glouceſter, and moved that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee might be appointed to look into the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that had been made, and the conceſſions that had been offered by Charles I. during the late war, and from thence ſuch propoſitions might be
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:022548_0010_0FB94801959A74E0"/>
digeſted, as they ſhould think ſit, to be ſent over to the King at Breda. The King upon his return recalled him in June to the degree of Serjeant at Law; and upon ſettling the Courts in Weſtminſter Hall, conſtituted him in November Chief Baron of the Exchequer. When the Lord Clarendon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him his commiſſion, he told him, that "If the King could have found out an honeſter and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man for that employment, he would not have advanced him to it; and that he had therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him, becauſe he knew none that deſerved it ſo well." It is uſual for perſons ſo promoted to be Knighted, but he deſired to avoid having that honor done him; which the Lord Chancellor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, ſent for him upon buſineſs one day, when the King was at his houſe, and told his Majeſty there was his modeſt Chief Baron; upon which, he was unexpectedly Knighted.</p>
            <p>He continued eleven years in that place, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the court with ſingular juſtice. It was obſerved by the whole nation how much he raiſed the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and practice of it; and thoſe who held places in it could declare not only the impartiality of his juſtice, but his generoſity, his vaſt diligence, and his great exactneſs in trials. This gave occaſion to the only complaint ever made of him, "that he did not diſpatch matters quick enough." But the great care he uſed to put ſuits to a juſt and final end, made him ſlower in deciding them,—ſo that cauſes tried before him were ſeldom, if ever, tried again.</p>
            <p>But it will not ſeem ſtrange that a Judge behaved himſelf as he did, who, at the entry of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, ſet theſe excellent rules to himſelf, which are copied from his own hand writing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Things neceſſary to be had in continual remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the adminiſtration of juſtice, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:022548_0011_0FB94803AB24FBA0"/>
for God, the King, and country; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,—2. That it be done, 1. Uprightly. 2. Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately. 3. Reſolutely.—3. That I reſt not upon mine own underſtanding or ſtrength, but implore and reſt upon the direction and ſtrength of God.—4. That in the execution of juſtice, I carefully lay aſide my own paſſions, and not give way to them, however provoked.—5. That I may be wholly intent upon the buſineſs I am about, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other cares and thoughts as unſeaſonable, and interruptions.—6. That I ſuffer not myſelf to be prepoſſeſſed with any judgment at all, till the whole buſineſs and both parties be heard.—7. That I never engage myſelf in the beginning of any cauſe, but reſerve myſelf unprejudiced till the whole be heard.—8. That in buſineſs capital, though my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prompt me to pity; yet to conſider, that there is a juſtice due to my country.—9. That I be not too rigid in matters purely conſcientious, where all the harm is diverſity of judgment.—10. That I be not biaſſed with compaſſion to the poor, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the rich, in point of juſtice.—11. That the popular or court applauſe, or diſtaſte, have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into any thing I do in point of diſtributing of juſtice.—12. Not to be ſolicitous what men will ſay or think, ſo long as I keep myſelf exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of juſtice.—13. If in criminals it be a meaſuring caſt, to incline to mercy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittal —14. In criminals that conſiſt merely in words, when no harm enſues, moderation is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.—15. In criminals of blood, if the fact be evident, ſeverity is juſtice.—16. To abhor all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſolicitations, of what kind ſoever, and by whomſoever, in matters depending.—17. To charge my ſervants, 1. Not to interpoſe in any buſineſs
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:022548_0012_0FB94805790B7C30"/>
whatſoever. 2. Not to take more than their known fees. 3. Not to give any undue precedence to cauſes. 4. Not to recommend council.— 18. To be ſhort and ſparing at meals, that I may be the fitter for buſineſs.</p>
            <p>He would never receive private addreſſes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations from the greateſt perſons, in any matter in which juſtice was concerned. One of the firſt Peers in England went once to his chamber, and told him, "That having a ſuit in law to be tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better underſtand it, when it ſhould come to be heard in court." Upon which the Lord Chief Baron interrupted him, and ſaid, "He did not deal fairly to come to his chamber about ſuch affairs, for he never received any infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of cauſes but in open court, where both parties were to be heard alike;" ſo he would not ſuffer his Grace to go on; ſo that the Duke went away very much diſſatisfied, and complained of it to the King as a rudeneſs that was not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            <p>But his Majeſty bid him content himſelf that he was not worſe uſed, and ſaid, "He verily believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he would have uſed himſelf no better, if he had gone to ſolicit him in any of his own cauſes."</p>
            <p>Another inſtance occurred in one of his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, which alſo flowed from his exactneſs to the rules he had ſet himſelf.</p>
            <p>A gentleman had ſent him a buck for his table, that had a trial at the aſſizes; ſo when he heard his name, he aſked, "If he was not the ſame perſon who had ſent him the veniſon?" and finding he was the ſame, told him, "he could not ſuffer the trial to go on, till he had paid him for his buck:" To which the gentleman anſwered, "That he never ſold his veniſon, and that he had done nothing to
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:022548_0013_0FB9480665A44E88"/>
him, which he did not do to every Judge that had gone that circuit;" which was confirmed by ſeveral gentlemen then preſent: but all would not do, for the Lord Chief Baron had learned from Solomon, that <hi>"A gift perverteth the ways of judgment;"</hi> and therefore, he would not ſuffer the trial to go on till he had paid for the preſent; upon which the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman withdrew the record. When he was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for Lord Craven, he pleaded with that force of argument, that the then Attorney General, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Prideanx, threatened him for appearing againſt the government: to whom he anſwered, "He was pleading in defence of thoſe laws, which they declared they would maintain and preſerve, and he was doing his duty to his client, ſo that he was not to be daunted with threatenings."</p>
            <p>Sir Matthew Hale continued in his office of Lord Chief Baron till the 18th of May, 1671, when on the death of the Lord Chief Juſtice, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to that honor. And here he ſpent the reſt of his public life and employment: but about four years and a half after his advancement, he who had hitherto enjoyed a firm and vigorous health, to which his great temperance, and the equality of his mind, did not a little conduce, was on a ſudden brought very low by an inflammation in his midriff, which in two days broke the conſtitution of his health to ſuch a degree, that he never recovered it: he became ſo aſhmatical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he could fetch his breath: that determined in a dropſy, of which he afterwards died. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood phyſic ſo well, that conſidering his age, he concluded his diſtemper muſt carry him off in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time; and he therefore reſolved to have ſome of the laſt months of his life to himſelf, that being freed from all worldly cares, he might be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:022548_0014_0FB9480AC5ECA9A0"/>
for his change; he was alſo ſo much diſabled in his body, that he could hardly, though ſupported by his ſervants walk through Weſtminſter-Hall, or endure the toil of buſineſs: he had been a long time wearied with the diſtractions that his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had brought on him, and his profeſſion was become ungrateful to him; he loved to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to better purpoſes, as will appear by the following paper, which he wrote on this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If I conſider the buſineſs of my profeſſion, whether as an advocate, or a judge, it is true, I do acknowledge, by the inſtitution of Almighty God, and the diſpenſation of his providence, I am bound to induſtry and fidelity in it: and as it is an act of obedience unto his will, it carries with it ſomething of religious duty, and I may, and do take comfort in it, and expect a reward of my obedience to him, and the good that I do to mankind therein, from the bounty and beneficence, and promiſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; and it is true alſo, that without ſuch employments, civil ſocieties cannot be ſupported, and great good redounds to mankind from them, and in thoſe reſpects, the conſciouſneſs of my own induſtry, fidelity and integrity in them is a great comfort and ſatisfaction to me. But yet this I muſt ſay concerning theſe employments, conſidered ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in themſelves, that they are very full of cares, anxieties, and perturbations.—2. That though they are beneficial to others, yet they are of the leaſt benefit to him that is employed in them.—3. That they do neceſſarily involve the party, whoſe office it is, in great dangers, difficulties, and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. 4. That they only ſerve for the meridian of life, which is ſhort and uncertain.—5. That though it be my duty faithfully to ſerve in them, while I am called to them, and till I am duly called from them,
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:022548_0015_0FB9480D189ECBA0"/>
yet they are great conſumers of the little time we have here, which, as it ſeems to me, might be ſpent in a pious contemplative life, and a due proviſion for eternity. I do not know a better temporal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than Martha had, in teſtifying her love and duty to our Saviour, making proviſion for him; yet our Lord tells her, "that though ſhe was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about many things, there was only one thing neceſſary, and Mary had choſen the better part."</p>
            <p>By this the reader will ſee that he continued in his ſtation upon no other conſideration, but the being ſet in it by the providence of God, he judged he could not abandon the poſt which was aſſigned him, without prefering his own private inclination to the choice God had made for him: but now that ſame Providence, having by this great diſtemper, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged him from the obligation of holding a place, which he was no longer able to diſcharge, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſign it: this was no ſooner ſurmiſed abroad, than it drew upon him the importunities of his friends, and the clamour of the whole town, to divert him from it, but to no purpoſe: ſo that he made applications to his majeſty for his writ of eaſe, which the king was very unwilling to grant him, and offered to let him hold his place ſtill (he doing what buſineſs he could in his chamber); but he ſaid, "He could not with a good conſcience continue in it, ſince he was no longer able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties belonging to it."</p>
            <p>His majeſty deferred granting his requeſt as long as poſſible; but at laſt having wearied himſelf, and all his friends, with his importunate deſires, and growing ſenſibly weaker in body, he formally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered his office the 21ſt of February, 28 Car. 1675-6. He had now nothing to do, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for that change which is equally the lot of all human beings; he returned home with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:022548_0016_0FB94810233CB0E0"/>
and calling all his ſervants of office together, diſmiſſed them with conſiderable preſents. He lived only to December following; but all the time was ſo ill, no hopes were given of his recovery; he ſtill continued to retire often, both for his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtudies At laſt, as the winter came on, he ſaw, with great joy, his deliverance approaching; for beſides being weary of the world, and his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the bleſſings of another ſtate, his pains ſo increaſed, that no patience inferior to his could have borne them ſo meekly; yet he expreſſed to the laſt ſuch ſubmiſſion to the will of God, and ſuch an equal temper under his afflictions, that it was viſible, what mighty effects his philoſophy and Chriſtianity had on him in ſupporting him under ſuch a heavy and grievous load.</p>
            <p>Not long before his death, the miniſter told him, "There was to be a ſacrament next Sunday at church, but he believed he could not come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it; therefore he would give it to him in his own houſe;" but he anſwered, "No, his heavenly father had prepared a feaſt for him, and he would go to his father's houſe and partake of it," which he, with the help of his ſervants, did.</p>
            <p>He had ſome preſages of his death, for he ſaid, if he did not die on a certain day, viz. 25th of November, he ſhould ſurvive a month longer; and he died that day month.</p>
            <p>He was twice married, firſt to Ann, daughter of Sir Henry More, of Flay, in Berkſhire, by whom he had ten children. He out lived them all, except his eldeſt daughter and youngeſt ſon: and ſecondly to Ann, daughter to Mr. Joſeph Biſhop, of Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, by whom he had no iſſue.</p>

               <p>I INTENDED to have been at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly this Whitſuntide, deſirous to renew thoſe counſels and advices which I have often given you, in order to your greateſt concernment; namely, the everlaſting good and welfare of your ſouls hereafter, and the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of your lives and converſations here.</p>
               <p>And although young people are apt, through their own indiſcretion, or the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022548_0018_0FB9481574B9B228"/>
ill advice of others, to think theſe kind of entertainments but dry and empty matters, and the moroſe and needleſs interpoſitions of old men: yet give him leave to tell you, that very well knows what he ſays, theſe things are of more importance and concernment to you, than external gifts and bounties; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nevertheleſs, I have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you according to my ability.</p>
               <p>This was my intention in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and though I have been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed therein, yet I thought good, by letters and meſſages, to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might be done that way for your benefit, that I had otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have done for your perſon.</p>
               <p>Aſſure yourſelves therefore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it from one that knows what he ſays; from one that neither can have any reaſon or end to deceive you, that the beſt gift I can give you, is good counſel; and the beſt counſel I can give you, is that which relates to your greateſt import and concernment;— namely, <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, therefore, ſince I cannot, at
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022548_0019_0FB94817A04D5538"/>
this time, deliver it to you in perſon, I ſhall do it by this letter; wherein I ſhall not be very large, but keep my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within the bounds proper for a letter; and thoſe things only, at this time, which may be moſt of preſent uſe and moment to you: and by your due obſervance to theſe directions, I ſhall have a good character, both of your dutifulneſs to God, your obedience to your father, and alſo of your diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prudence; for it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that as religion is the beſt means to advance and rectify human nature, ſo no man ſhall be either truly wiſe, or truly happy without it, and the love of it; no, not in this life, much leſs in that which is to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore, every morning and evening, upon your knees, humbly commend yourſelves to Almighty God in prayer, begging his mercy to pardon your ſins, his grace to direct you, his providence to protect you; returning him humble thanks for all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations towards you; yea, even for his very corrections and afflictions, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022548_0020_0FB9481B272FE028"/>
him to give you wiſdom and grace to make a ſober, patient, humble, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable uſe of them; and in his due time, to deliver you from them; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding your prayers with the Lord's Prayer. This will be a certain means to bring your mind into a right frame; to procure you comfort and bleſſing, and to prevent thouſands of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and miſchiefs, to which you will be otherwiſe ſubjected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every morning read ſeriouſly and reverently, a portion of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and acquaint yourſelf with the hiſtory and doctrine thereof: it is a book full of light and wiſdom, will make you wiſe to eternal life, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with directions and principles to guide and order your life ſafely and prudently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conclude every evening with read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of the ſcripture and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in your family.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſtrict and religious obſervers of the Lord's day; reſort to your pariſh church twice that day, if your health will permit, and attend diligently and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022548_0021_0FB9481C2297E560"/>
reverently to the public prayers and ſermons; he cannot reaſonably expect a bleſſing from God, the reſt of the week, that neglects his duty to God, in the due conſecration of this day, to the ſpecial ſervice and duty of God, which this day requires.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Receive the Sacrament, at leaſt, three times in the year, and oftener, as there is occaſion, in your pariſh church. The laws of the land require this, and the law of your Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and the law of duty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude requires it of you. Prepare yourſelves ſeriouſly for this ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, and perform it with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and thankfulneſs: the neglect of this duty procures great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſtrangeneſs; and commonly the neglect hereof ariſeth from ſome conceited opinion that people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately take up; but moſt ordinarily from a ſluggiſhneſs of mind, and an unwillingneſs to fit and prepare the mind for it; or to leave ſome ſinful and vain courſe that men are not willing to leave, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022548_0022_0FB9481D9C9CE3E0"/>
themſelves in the practice of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Beware of thoſe who go about to ſeduce you from that religion wherein you have been brought up hitherto. It is not unknown to any that obſerves the ſtate of things in the world, how many erroneous religions are ſcattered abroad in the world; and how induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious men of all perſuaſions are to make proſelytes.</p>
               <p>And that you may know and obſerve the better, you ſhall ever find theſe artifices practiſed by them: 1. They will uſe all flattering applications and inſinuations, to be maſter of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and when they have gotten that advantage, they that ſeem before to ſerve you, will then command you. 2. They will uſe all poſſible ſkill to raiſe in you jealouſy and diſlike towards thoſe who may otherwiſe continue and keep you in the truth; as to raiſe diſlike in you againſt your miniſter; nay, rather than fail, to raiſe diſſention among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; yea, to caſt jealouſies and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes among them, if it may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to corrupt them. 3. They will
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022548_0023_0FB94821F4644AE0"/>
endeavour to withdraw people from the public miniſtry of God's word, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to ſlight and neglect it; and when they have once effected this, they have a fair opportunity to infuſe their own corrupt principles. 4. They will engage you, by ſome means or other, to them; either by ſome real, but moſt ordinarily, by ſome pretended kindneſs or familiarity; that in a little time, you ſhall not dare to diſpleaſe them; you muſt do and ſpeak what they will have you, becauſe ſome way or other you are entangled with them, or engaged to them; and then they become your governors, and you will not dare to diſobey them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe artifices whereby crafty and ſubtle ſeducers gain proſelytes, and bring men under captivity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be very careful to moderate your paſſions, eſpecially of choler and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; it inflames the blood, diſorders the brain, and, for a time, extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates not only religion, but common reaſon; it puts the mind into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022548_0024_0FB94827624FDBF8"/>
and throws wild-fire into the tongue, whereby men give others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt them; it renders a man incapable of doing his duty to God, and puts a man upon acts of violence, unrighteouſneſs, and injuſtice to men: therefore keep your paſſions under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and under as ſtrict a chain as you would keep an unruly maſtiff; look to it, that you give it not too much line at firſt. But if it hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any fire within you, quench it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, with conſideration, and let it not break out into paſſionate or unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words and actions; but whatever you do, let it not gangrene into malice, envy, or ſpite.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Send your children early to learn their catechiſm, that they take in the true principles of religion betimes, which may grow up with them, and habituate them both to the knowledge and practice of it; that they may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the danger of corruption by error or vice, being antecedently ſeaſoned with better principles.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Receive the bleſſings of God with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022548_0025_0FB94828E1BA1438"/>
very much thankfulneſs to him, for he is the root and fountain of all the good you do, or can receive.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Bear all afflictions and croſſes patiently; it is your duty, for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come not from the duſt. The great God of heaven and earth is he that ſends theſe meſſengers to you, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly evil occurrence may be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſtruments of them: you owe to Almighty God an infinite ſubjection and obedience, and to expoſtulate with him, is rebellion; and as it is your duty, ſo it is your wiſdom, and your prudence: impatience will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your yoke, but it will make its gall the worſe, and ſit the harder.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Learn not only patience under your afflictions, but alſo profitably to improve them to your ſoul's good; learn by them how vain and unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the world, and the pleaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are, that a ſharp, or a lingering ſickneſs renders utterly taſteleſs. Learn how vain and weak a thing human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, which is pulled down to the gates of death, and cloathed with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs

and corruption by a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the blood, in a nerve, in a vein, in an artery. And ſince we have ſo little hold of a temporal life, which is ſhaken and ſhattered by any ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, accident, or diſtemper: learn to lay hold on eternal life, and of that covenant of peace and ſalvation, which Chriſt hath bought for all that believe, and obey the goſpel of peace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: there ſhall be no death, no ſickneſs, no pain, no weakneſs, but a ſtate of unchangeable, and everlaſting happineſs: and if you thus improve afflictions, you are gainers by it; and moſt certain it is, that there is no more probable way under heaven to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from affliction, if the wiſe God ſee it fit, than thus to improve it; for affliction is a meſſenger, and the rod hath a voice; and that is to require mankind to be the more patient, and the more humble, and the more to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Almighty God in all our ways; and if men liſten to this voice of the rod, and conform to it, the rod, hath done his errand; and will

               <p n="12">12. Reverence your miniſter; he is a wiſe, and a good man, and one that loves you, and has a tender care and reſpect for you: do not grieve him either by neglect or diſreſpect. Aſſure yourſelves if there be any perſon that ſets any of you againſt him, or provokes or encourageth any of you to deſpiſe or neglect him, that perſon, whoever he be, loves not you, nor the office he bears; and therefore, as the laws of the land, and the Divine Providence, hath placed him at Alderly, to have a care of your ſouls; ſo I muſt tell you, I do expect you ſhould reverence and honor him for his own, for your, and for his office ſake.</p>
               <p>And now I have written this long Epiſtle to you, to perform that office
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022548_0028_0FB9482D5DCB8488"/>
for me that I ſhould have done in perſon, if I could have taken this journey. The epiſtle is long, but it had been longer had I had more time. And although perchance ſome there be in the world, that, when they hear of it, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it to be but the excurſions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe rules of old age, unneceſſary, and ſuch as might have been ſpared; yet, I am perſuaded it will find much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acceptation from you that are my children. I am now on the ſhady ſide of threeſcore years; I write to you what you have often heard me in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpeak: and poſſibly when I ſhall leave this world, you will want ſuch a remembrancer as I have been to you. The words that I now, and at former times have written to you, are words of truth and ſoberneſs; and words and advices that proceed from a heart full of love and affection to you all. If I ſhould ſee you do amiſs in any thing, and ſhould not reprove you; or, if I ſhould find you wanting coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and direction, and ſhould not give

As I have never ſpared my purſe to ſupply you according to my abilities, and the reaſonableneſs of occaſions; ſo I have never been wanting to you in good and prudent counſels; and the God of Heaven give you wiſdom, conſtancy, and fidelity in the obſervance of them.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I THANK God, I came well to Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington this Saturday, about five of the clock: and becauſe I have ſome
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022548_0030_0FB94834DF4D7550"/>
leiſure time at my inn, I could not ſpend the time more to my own contentment, and to your benefit, than by my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to give you all good counſel: the ſubject whereof, at this time ſhall be concerning ſpeech; becauſe much of the good or evil that befals perſons, doth occaſionally happen by the well or ill-managing of that part of human converſation. I ſhall, as I have leiſure and opportunity, at other times, give you my directions concerning other ſubjects.</p>
               <p>And herein I ſhall adviſe you, firſt, how you are to entertain the ſpeeches of others, according to the divers deſires thereof. Secondly, how you are to manage and order your own ſpeech.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. As concerning the former, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve and mark as well as you may, what is the temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe perſons whoſe ſpeeches you hear, whether they be grave, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſober, wiſe, diſcreet perſons; if they be ſuch, their ſpeeches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022548_0031_0FB9483669F2FBB0"/>
are like themſelves, and will deſerve your attention and obſervation.</p>
               <p>But if they be light, impertinent, vain, paſſionate perſons, their ſpeech is for the moſt part according; and the beſt advantage that you will gain by their ſpeech, is but thereby to learn their diſpoſitions, to diſcern their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to make yourſelves the more cautious both in your converſation with them, and in your own ſpeech and deportment; for in the unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of their ſpeech, you may diſcern and avoid the like in yourſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any perſon, that you do not very well know to be a perſon of truth, ſobriety, and weight, relate ſtrange ſtories, be not too ready or eaſy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, nor report them after him: and yet (unleſs he be one of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintance) be not forward to contradict him; or if the neceſſity of the occaſion require you to declare your opinion of what is reported, let it be modeſtly and gently, not too bluntly or coarſely; by this means, on the one ſide, you ſhall avoid being
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022548_0032_0FB94837DE557120"/>
abuſed by your too much credulity; on the other ſide, you ſhall avoid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and diſtaſte.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any man ſpeak any thing to the diſadvantage or reproach of one that is abſent, be not too ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, only obſerve and remember it; for it may be, it is not true, or it is not all true, or ſome other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances mingled with it, which might give the buſineſs reported a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt an allay, an extenuation, or a reaſonable excuſe: in moſt actions, if that which is bad alone, or ſeems to be ſo, be reported, omitting that which is good, or the circumſtances that accompany it, any action may be eaſily miſrepreſented; be not too haſty therefore to believe a reproach, till you know the truth, and the whole truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If any perſon report unto you ſome injury done to you by another, either in words or deeds, do not be over-haſty in believing it, nor ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry with the perſon ſo accuſed; for poſſibly it may be falſe or miſtaken;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022548_0033_0FB948395DBB0DB0"/>
and how unſeemly a thing will it be, when your credulity and paſſion carry you, upon a ſuppoſed injury, to do wrong to him that hath done you none; or, at leaſt, when the bottom and truth of the accuſation is known, you will be aſhamed of your paſſion? Believe not a report, till the party accuſed be heard; and if the report be true, yet be not tranſported either with paſſion, haſty anger, or revenge, for that will be your own torment and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ever, when a perſon is accuſed, or reported to have injured you, before you give yourſelf leave to be angry, think with yourſelf, why ſhould I be angry before I am certain it is true? or, if it be true, how can I tell how much I ſhould be angry till I know the whole matter? Though, it may be, he hath done wrong, yet poſſibly it is not ſo much as is reported, or it was done by miſtake, or, it may be, he is ſorry for it: I will not be angry till I know there be cauſe; and if there be a cauſe, yet I will not be angry till I know the whole cauſe, for till then, if I muſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022548_0034_0FB9483B9A517128"/>
be angry at all, yet I know not how much to be angry; it may be, it is not worth my anger, or, if it be, it may be, it deſerves but a little. This will keep your mind and carriage, upon ſuch occaſions, in a due temper and order; and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint malicious or officious tale-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If a man, whoſe integrity you do not very well know, makes you great and extraordinary profeſſions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, give him as kind thanks as may be, but give not much credit to it: caſt about with yourſelf what may be the reaſon of this wonderful kindneſs; it is twenty to one but you will find ſomething that he aims at, beſides kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to you: it may be he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to beg or buy of you, or to ſell to you, or ſome ſuch bargain that ſpeaks out, at leaſt his own advantage, and not yours; and if he ſerve his turn of you, or if he be diſappointed, his kindneſs will grow cold.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If a man flatter and commend you to your face, or to one that he thinks will tell you of it, it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022548_0035_0FB9483D1BEF42A8"/>
to one, either he hath deceived and abuſed you ſome way, or means to do ſo: remember the fable of the fox, commending the ſinging of the crow, when ſhe had ſomewhat in her mouth that the fox liked.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If a perſon be choleric, paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, and give you ill language, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1. Rather to pity him, than to be moved into anger and paſſion with him; for moſt certainly, that man is in a diſtemper and diſorder; obſerve him calmly, and you ſhall ſee him in ſo much perturbation and diſturbance, that you will eaſily believe he is not a pattern to be imitated by you; and, therefore, return not choler or anger, for angry words; for you do but put yourſelf in a phrenſy, becauſe you ſee him ſo. 2. Be ſure you return not railing, reproaching, or reviling, for reviling, for it doth but kindle more heat, and you will find ſilence, or, at leaſt, very gentle words, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite revenge of reproaches that can be; for either it will cure the diſtemper in the other, and make him ſee and be ſorry for his paſſion, or it will torment
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022548_0036_0FB94840E2B3E558"/>
him with more perturbation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance. But howſoever, it keeps your innocence, gives you deſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of wiſdom and moderation, and keeps up the ſerenity and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of your mind; whereas paſſion and anger do make a man unfit for any thing that becomes him, as a man, or as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some men are excellent in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of huſbandry, ſome of planting, ſome of gardening, ſome in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, ſome in one kind, ſome in another: in your converſation, learn, as near as you can, wherein the ſkill and excellence of any perſon lies, and put him upon talk of that ſubject, and obſerve it, and keep it in memory, or writing: by this means, you will glean up the worth and excellence of every perſon you meet with, and at an eaſy rate put together that which may be for your uſe on all occaſions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Converſe not with a liar, or a ſwearer, or a man of obſcene or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton language; for either he will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you, or at leaſt it will hazard your
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022548_0037_0FB948428DA247B8"/>
reputation to be one of the like mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, if it do neither, yet will fill your memory with ſuch diſcourſes, that will be troubleſome to you in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and the returns of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the paſſages which you long ſince heard of this nature, will haunt you when your thoughts ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employed.</p>
               <p>Now, as concerning your own ſpeech, and how you are to manage it; ſomething may be collected out of what goes before, but I ſhall add ſome things elſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let your ſpeech be true; never ſpeak any thing for a truth, which you know, or believe, to be falſe: it is a great ſin againſt God, that gave you a tongue to ſpeak your mind, and not to ſpeak a lie: it is a great offence againſt humanity itſelf; for where there is no truth, there can be no ſociety between man and man; and it is an injury to the ſpeaker; for beſides the baſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation it caſts upon him, it doth in time bring a man to that baſeneſs of mind, that he can ſcarce tell how to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022548_0038_0FB94847ED214C88"/>
tell truth, or to avoid lying, even when he hath no colour of neceſſity for it; and in time he comes to ſuch a paſs, that as another man cannot believe he tells a truth, ſo he himſelf ſcarce knows when he tells a lie; and, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, a lie ever returns with diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſhame at laſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As you muſt be careful not to lie, ſo you muſt avoid coming near it: you muſt no equivocate; you muſt not ſpeak that abſolutely, which you have but by hearſay or relation; you muſt not ſpeak that as upon knowledge, which you have but by conjecture or opinion only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let your words be few, eſpecially when your betters, or ſtrangers, or men of more experience or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are preſent; for you do yourſelf at once two great miſchiefs. 1. You betray and diſcover your own weakneſs and folly. 2. You rob yourſelf of that opportunity which you might otherwiſe have to gain knowledge, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and experience, by hearing thoſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022548_0039_0FB9484C0B04E858"/>
that you ſilence by your impertinent talking.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not over earneſt, loud, or violent in talking, for it is unſeemly; and earneſt and loud talking makes you overſhoot and looſe your buſineſs; when you ſhould be conſidering and pondering your thoughts, and how to expreſs them ſignificantly, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you are ſtriving to keep your tongue going, and to ſilence your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, not with reaſon, but with noiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be careful not to interrupt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his talk; hear him out, you will underſtand him the better, and be able to give him the better anſwer; it may be, if you will give him leave, he will ſay ſomewhat more than you have yet heard, or well underſtood, or that which you did not expect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Always before you ſpeak, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the buſineſs is of moment, conſider before hand, weigh the ſenſe in your mind, which you intend to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, think upon the expreſſions you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to uſe, that they may be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022548_0040_0FB9484CE0ACA790"/>
pertinent, and inoffenſive; and whereas it is the ordinary courſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate perſons to ſpeak their words, and then to think, or not to think till they ſpeak: think firſt, and ſpeak after, if it be in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment or ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be willing to ſpeak well of the abſent, if you do not know they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ill: by this means you ſhall make yourſelf many friends; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an undeſerved commendation is not loſt to the party to whom it is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en: I have known ſome men, that have met with an undeſerved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, out of ſhame of being worſe than they have been reported, ſecretly to make up practices anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their commendation, and ſo to make themſelves as good as they are reported.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be ſure you give not an ill report to any that you are not ſure deſerves it; and in moſt caſes, though a man deſerves ill, yet you ſhould be very ſparing to report him ſo: in ſome caſes, indeed, you are bound, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022548_0041_0FB9484E682D7A08"/>
and juſtice, to give that account concerning the demerit or default of a perſon that he deſerves; as, namely, when you are called to give teſtimony for the ending of a controverſy, or when the concealing of it may harden and encourage a perſon in an evil way, or bring another into danger; in ſuch caſes, the very duty of charity binds you to ſpeak your knowledge; nay, your probable fear or ſuſpicion of ſuch a perſon, ſo it be done for prevention of greater inconvenience, and in love; and eſpecially if the diſcovery be made to a perſon that hath a ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, care, or authority over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon complained of; for this is an act of love and duty. But for any perſon, maliciouſly, buſily, and with intent to ſcandaliſe another, to be whiſpering tales and ſtories to the prejudice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, this is a fault; if you know any good of any perſon, ſpeak it as you have opportunity; if you know any evil, ſpeak it, if it be really and prudently done, for the good of him, and the ſafety of others; otherwiſe,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022548_0042_0FB948504B92A968"/>
rather chooſe to ſay nothing, than to ſay any thing reproachfully, maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or officiouſly, to his prejudice.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Avoid ſwearing in your ordinary communication, unleſs called to it by the magiſtrate, and not only the groſſer oaths, but the leſſer; and not only oaths, imprecations, earneſt and deep proteſtations: as you have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable example of good men to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a ſolemn oath before a magiſtrate, ſo you have the precept of our Saviour forbidding it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Avoid ſcoffing, and bitter and biting jeering, and jeſting, eſpecially at your friends' condition, credit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or natural defects of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for theſe leave a deep impreſſion, and are a moſt apparent injuſtice; were you ſo uſed, you would take it inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amiſs; and many times ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury coſts a man dear, when he little thinks of it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be very careful, that you give no reproachful, bitter, menacing or ſpiteful words to any perſon; nay, not to ſervants, or other perſons of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022548_0043_0FB94851C1774650"/>
condition; and that upon theſe conſiderations, 1. There is not the meaneſt perſon but you may ſtand in need of him in one kind, or at ſome time or other; good words make friends, bad words make enemies: it is the beſt prudence in the world to make as many friends as you honeſtly can, eſpecially when it may be done at ſo eaſy a rate as a good word; and it is the greateſt folly that can be to make an enemy by ill words, which do not at all any good to the party that uſeth them. 2. Ill words provoke ill words again, and commonly ſuch ill words as are gained by ſuch a provocation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of an inferior, ſtick cloſer, and wound deeper, than ſuch as come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked by ill language, or from an equal. 3. Where faults are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they may, and by a ſuperior, muſt be reproved; but let it be done without reproaches, or bitterneſs, otherwiſe it looſeth its due end and uſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reforming the offence, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates the offender, and makes him worſe, and gives him the cudgel to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022548_0044_0FB948532085F550"/>
ſtrike again, becauſe it diſcovers your own weakneſs when you are reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, and lays you juſtly open to his reproof, and makes your own but ſcorned and diſeſteemed: I preſs this the rather, becauſe, moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, ill language is the folly of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of weak and paſſionate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If there be occaſion for you to ſpeak in any company, always be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if you ſpeak at all, to ſpeak lateſt, eſpecially if ſtrangers are in company; for by this means, you will have the advantage of knowing the ſenſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, temper, and relations of others, which may be a great light and help to you, in ordering your ſpeech; and you will better know the inclination of the company, and ſpeak with more advantage and acceptation, and with more ſecurity againſt giving offence.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Be careful, that you commend not yourſelves: it is the moſt unuſeful and ungrateful thing that can be. You ſhould avoid flattering of yourſelves; it is a ſign your reputation is ſmall and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022548_0045_0FB94855DE6FE2A8"/>
ſinking, if your own tongues muſt be your flatterers or commenders; it is a fulſome and unpleaſant thing for others to hear it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Abhor all foul, unclean, and obſcene ſpeeches; it is a ſign that the heart is corrupt, and ſuch kind of ſpeeches will make it worſe; it will taint, and corrupt yourſelves, and thoſe that hear it, and brings diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to thoſe that uſe it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Never uſe any profane ſpeeches, nor make jeſts of ſcripture expreſſions: when you uſe the names of <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any paſſages or words of the holy ſcripture, uſe them with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſeriouſneſs, and not lightly, vainly, or ſcurrilouſly, for it is taking the name of God in vain.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If you hear of any unſeemly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed in religious exerciſes, you muſt be careful to forget, and not to publiſh; or if you at all mention them, let it be with pity and ſorrow, not with deriſion or reproach.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Do not upbraid any, or deride any man, for a pious, ſtrict, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022548_0046_0FB94857D9CF4108"/>
converſation; for if he be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, you diſhonor God and injure him: if he be an hypocrite, yet it is more than you know; or if you know him to be ſuch, yet his external piety and ſtrictneſs is not his fault, but his diſſimulation and hypocriſy; and tho' his hypocriſy be to be deteſted, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal piety and religion is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, not derided.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH, by reaſon of the contagiouſneſs of your diſeaſe,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022548_0050_0FB9485E9B0FB430"/>
and the many dependents I have upon me, I thought it not convenient to come unto you, during your ſickneſs, yet I have not been wanting in my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayers to Almighty God for you, nor in uſing the beſt means I could for your recovery.</p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed God to hear my prayers for you, and, above means and hopes, now to reſtore you to a competent degree of health, for which I return unto him my humble and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks; and now you are almoſt ready to come abroad again; therefore I have thought fit to write this little book to you, for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe it is not yet ſeaſonable for you to come to me, in reſpect of theſe ſame reaſons above-mentioned, which have hitherto reſtrained my coming to you. 2. Becauſe at your coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, you will be ſubject to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by young and inconſiderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which, inſtead of ſerious thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God for his mercy to you, might perchance perſuade you to a vain and light jollity: and I thought

fit to ſend you theſe lines to prevent ſuch inconſiderate impreſſions, and to meet you juſt at your coming abroad, to ſeaſon you with more wiſe and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles. 3. Becauſe you are even now come out of a great and ſore viſitation; and, therefore, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the fitteſt temper to receive the impreſſions of a ſerious epiſtle from your father.</p>
               <p>And I have choſen to put it into this little volume, becauſe it is ſomewhat too long for a letter; and may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſerved for your future uſe and memory.</p>
               <p>God Almighty hath brought you to the very gates of death, and ſhowed you the tenor and danger of it; and after that he hath ſhown you this ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of your own mortality, he hath marvellouſly reſcued and delivered you from that danger, and given you life, even from the dead, ſo that you are as a man new born into the world, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to life again, which now you ſeem as it were to begin: you have paſſed through thoſe two great diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022548_0052_0FB94866B2ED46F8"/>
of Divine Providence, thoſe two great experiments, that God is pleaſed to uſe ſometimes towards the children of men: namely, correction, and deliverance; his rod and ſtaff: and therefore, in all reaſonable conjecture, this is the moſt ſeaſonable time to give you a lecture upon both, and thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions which may render the one and the other profitable to you: and this I ſhall endeavour to do in theſe following lines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſhall not need to fear that I intend to upbraid you with the errors of your youth, or to expoſtulate with you touching them; for I do aſſure you, I do from my heart forgive you all your follies and miſcarriages; and I do aſſure myſelf, that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of them, and reſolved againſt them for the time to come, and that thereupon God Almighty hath alſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgiven what is paſt; and this is a great aſſurance thereof to me, in that he hath ſo wonderfully reſtored you, and given you, as it were, a new life, wherein you may obey and ſerve him
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022548_0053_0FB94868A07BFE88"/>
better than ever you yet did; and therefore, if in this letter there be any touches concerning former vanities, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yourſelf they are not angry repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, but only neceſſary cautions for your future ordering of your life.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of theſe papers is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to commend unto you two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remembrances, and certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and collections that ariſe from them; they are all ſeaſonable for your preſent condition, and will be of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe and benefit to you, in the whole enſuing courſe of your life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would have you, as long as you live, remember your late ſickneſs in all its circumſtances, and theſe plain and profitable inferences and advices that ariſe from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would have you remember, as long as you live, your great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the ſeveral circumſtances of it, and thoſe neceſſary duties that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon you in relation thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>It is evident to daily experience, that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022548_0054_0FB9486A30998F10"/>
while afflictions are upon us, and while deliverances are freſh, they commonly have ſome good effect upon us; but as the iron is no ſooner out of the fire, but it quickly returns to its coldneſs, and hardneſs; ſo when the affliction or deliverance is paſt, we uſually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them, count them common things, attribute them to mean and ſecond cauſes; and ſo the good, that mankind ſhould gather from them, vaniſhes, and men grow quickly to be but what they were before they came; their ſick-bed promiſes are forgot when the ſickneſs is over.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall give you an account of your ſickneſs, and of your recovery: and let them never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you; as often as thoſe ſpots and marks in your face are reflected to your view from the glaſs, as often as this paper comes in your ſight, nay, as often as you open your eyes from ſleep, which were once cloſed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver likely to open again, ſo often, and more often, remember your ſickneſs, and your recovery, and the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022548_0055_0FB9486BB86AD348"/>
that this paper lends you from the conſideration of both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore, touching your late ſickneſs, I would have you remember theſe particulars. 1. The diſeaſe itſelf, in its own nature, is now become ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily very mortal, eſpecially to thoſe of your age; look upon even the laſt year's general bill of mortality, you will find near two thouſand died<note n="*" place="bottom">Inoculation was not introduced into England at that time: this ſalutary inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was brought from Turkey about 1721, by Lady W. Montague, and firſt tried on criminals.</note> of that diſeaſe the laſt year: and had not God been very, very merciful to you, you might have been one of that number with as great likelihood as any of them that died of that diſeaſe. 2. It was a contagious diſeaſe, that ſecluded the acceſs of your neareſt relations. 3. Your ſickneſs rendered you noiſome to yourſelf, and to all that were about you, and a ſpectacle full of deformity,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022548_0056_0FB9486D4ACF8848"/>
by the exceſs of your diſeaſe beyond moſt that are ſick thereof. 4. It was a fierce and violent ſickneſs: it did not only take away the common ſupplies of nature, as digeſtion, ſleep, ſtrength, but it took away your memory, your underſtanding, and the very ſenſe of your condition, or what might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to your good; all that you could do, was only to make your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more deſperate in caſe they that were about you had not prevented it, and taken more care for you, than you did or could for yourſelf. 5. Your ſickneſs was deſperate, inſomuch that your ſymptoms, and the violence of your diſtemper, were without example; and you were in the next degree to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute rottenneſs, putrefaction, and death itſelf.</p>
               <p>Look upon the foregoing deſcription, and remember that ſuch was your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; you were as ſad a picture of mortality and corruption, as any thing, but death itſelf, could make: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; and remember alſo theſe enſuing inſtructions, that may make that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022548_0057_0FB9486EB54632E8"/>
profitable and uſeful to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember, that <hi>"Affliction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not forth of the duſt, nor doth trouble ſpring out of the ground."</hi>—Job v. 6.— But this terrible viſitation was ſent to you from the wiſe over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; it is he that bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up again. It is true, that this diſeaſe may ſeem common, but you may, and muſt know, that there was more than the common hand of God in ſending it upon you, in ſuch a manner, and ſuch a meaſure, and at ſuch a ſeaſon, when you were grown up to a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent age and degree of underſtanding, to make a due uſe of it, that you might ſee his juſtice in afflicting you, and his goodneſs in delivering you from ſuch danger.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Remember that Almighty God is of moſt infinite wiſdom, juſtice, and mercy; he hath excellent ends in all the diſpenſations of his providence: he never ſends an affliction, but it brings
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022548_0058_0FB948701ECB8B80"/>
a meſſage with it; his rod has a voice commanding us to ſearch and try our ways, and to examine ourſelves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there hath not been ſome great ſin againſt him, or neglect of duty to him; a voice commanding us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of what is amiſs, to be more watchful, circumſpect, and obedient to him; in the future courſe of our lives to fear to offend him: and if a man hear this voice, God hath his end of mercy and goodneſs; and man hath the fruit, benefit, and advantage of this affliction, and commonly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable iſſue of it; read often and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively the 33d. Job, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember how uncertain and frail a creature man is, even in his ſeeming ſtrongeſt age and conſtitution of health; even then a peſtilential air, ſome evil humour in his blood, ſome obſtruction, it may be, of a little vein, or artery, a little meat ill-digeſted, and a thouſand ſmall occurrences may, upon a ſudden, without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able warning, plunge a man into a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:022548_0059_0FB948719E2DB928"/>
and mortal ſickneſs, and bring a man to the grave. Remember, this terrible ſickneſs ſeized upon you ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, pulled down your ſtrength quickly, and brought you to the very brink of the grave: and though God hath recovered you, you know not how ſoon you may be brought into the like condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Remember, therefore, that you make and keep peace with God, and walk in his fear in the days of health, eſpecially after ſo great a deliverance; and that for many reaſons. 1. You know not whether you may not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with ſudden death, and then it will be impoſſible for you to begin that work. 2. If you have ſickneſs to give you warning of the approach of death, yet you know not whether that ſickneſs may not ſuddenly take away your ſenſes, memory, underſtanding, whereby you may be diſabled to make your peace with God, or to exerciſe any ſerious thoughts about it. 3. But if that ſickneſs give you fair warning, and take not away your underſtanding,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022548_0060_0FB9487328B39610"/>
yet your own experience cannot chooſe but to let you know, that pain, and weakneſs, and diſtraction of mind, and impatience, and unquietneſs, are the common attendants of a ſick-bed, and render that ſeaſon, at leaſt, very difficult then to begin that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and ſolemneſt, and moſt important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of a man's life. 4. But if your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be not ſo ſharp, but that it leaves you patience, and attention of mind for that great buſineſs, how do you know whether your heart ſhall be inclined to it? Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion to God is his gift, though it muſt be our endeavour: and though the merciful God never refuſeth a repenting, returning offender; yet, how can a man, that, all the time of his health, hath neglected Almighty God, refuſed his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſerved his luſts and his ſins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect reaſonably, that God in the time of ſickneſs, when the man can ſerve his ſins no longer, will give him the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
               <p>Whatever you do, therefore, be ſure you make peace with God, and keep it in the days of your health, eſpecially after ſo great a deliverance from ſo deſperate a ſickneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Remember your condition is never ſo low, but that God hath power to deliver
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022548_0061_0FB9487505B9FCF8"/>
you, and therefore truſt in him: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member withal, that your condition is never ſo ſafe and ſecure, but you are within the reach of his power to bring you down. You are now, by the mercy of God, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from a terrible ſickneſs; think not with yourſelf that your turn is now ſerved, and that you ſhall have no more need of him, and therefore that you may live as you liſt, and never regard your duty to him; deceive not yourſelf herein; remember that this ſickneſs, within two or three days, brought you upon your knees even from a ſeeming ſtate of health: the caſe is the ſame ſtill, nay much worſe, if this affliction make you not better; Almighty God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you to love, to ſerve, and obey him, by the ſtill voice of his word, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of your friends, by the advices and reproofs of your father: and when theſe were not ſo effectual, as I know you now wiſh they had been, he ſent a meſſenger that ſpeaks louder, that would be heard, even this terrible ſickneſs; and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if you have heard the voice of this rod, as I am hopeful you have, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon entirely turned to your duty to God in all ſincerity and obedience, it is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt providence that ever befel you; and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022548_0062_0FB94876A9C56BA0"/>
you will, upon ſound conviction, conclude with the Prophet, <hi>"It was good for me that I was afflicted."</hi> But on the other ſide, if notwithſtanding this voice of the rod, you ſhall after your recovery return again to folly, and vanity, and exceſs, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den yourſelf againſt this meſſenger; know for certain, you are within the reach of the divine juſtice and power; and if you walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to you, "and puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins." <hi>[Levit.]</hi> Therefore I give you that counſel that our Lord gave to him that he had healed, "Behold thou art made whole, go thy way and ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing befal thee." There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with Almighty God; he is ready and eaſy to be reconciled to the worſt of men, upon humiliation and true repentance, but he is not to be maſtered or conquered by obſtinacy and oppoſition: <hi>"Who hath hardened himſelf againſt him, and proſpered?"</hi> Job ix. 5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I would have you remember, that ſickneſs, as well as death, doth undeceive mankind, and ſhows them where their true wiſdom lies; when a young man eſpecially is in the full career of his vanity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he thinks that religion, and the fear
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022548_0063_0FB948779C3B5350"/>
of God, and walking according to his word, and the ſerious practice of duties and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion towards God, prayer unto him, making our peace with him, are pitiful, low, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and inconſiderable matters; and that thoſe that practiſe them are a ſort of brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, melancholy, unintelligent perſons, that want wit, or breeding, and underſtand not themſelves or the world, that they are mere empty fancies and imaginations, whimſies, puritaniſm, and I know not what elſe; but on the other ſide, they think they are brave men that live ſplendidly, deny themſelves no pleaſure, can drink, and roar, and whore, and debauch, and wear the new faſhions; it may be, this gallant or wiſe man comes to be taken with a fit of ſickneſs that tells him he muſt die, death is at his door, his glaſs is almoſt out, and but a few ſands left in it; and then the man becomes quite of another judgment, he cries out for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fooliſhneſs, he finds his pleaſures, and intemperance, and exceſs, are not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect follies, but madneſs, vexation, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and religion, and prayer to God, and devotion, and peace with God—they are now in requeſt; and ſo now nothing but declamations againſt thoſe courſes, which in his health he valued as the only
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022548_0064_0FB94879DC999C08"/>
wiſdom; and nothing but promiſes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and reformation of life, and devotion to God; ſo ſickneſs hath unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the man, and given him a true and rectified judgment concerning wiſdom and folly, quite contrary to what he had before. Therefore I would have you to recollect yourſelf, and if the violence of your diſeaſe left you at any time the uſe of your reaſon, bethink yourſelf what opinion you then had of intemperance, waſting of time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful luſt, or any of thoſe ſins that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pleaſed you in your health, whether they did not appear to you in your ſickneſs very vain, fooliſh, vexing things, ſuch as you wiſhed never to have been committed: and on the other ſide, what opinion you had in your ſickneſs touching piety towards God, hearing of his word, calling upon his name, redeeming of time, modeſty, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: whether thoſe actions of your life paſt, that ſavoured of theſe, were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and contenting to you in your ſickneſs; whether your purpoſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and reſolutions of your ſick-bed, were not full of ſuch thoughts as theſe: if it pleaſe God to recover me, I will never be ſuch a fool as I have been: I will never drink to exceſs, miſpend my time; I will
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022548_0065_0FB9487FB07CC010"/>
never keep ſuch idle company as I have done; I will be more devout towards God, more obedient to his word, more obſervant of good counſel; and the like: and if you find it to be ſo, I muſt deſire you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that affliction is the ſchool of wiſdom, it rectifies men's judgments; and I muſt again deſire you to keep your judgment right ſtill, and let not the recovery of your health become the loſs of your wits; but in your health retain that wiſdom your ſickneſs taught you, and practiſe what you then promiſed: <hi>"Remember, he is the wiſeſt man that provideth for his latter end."</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Remember by your former ſickneſs, how pitiful and inconſiderable a thing the body of man is; how ſoon is the ſtrength of it turned to faintneſs, and weakneſs, and the beauty of it to uglineſs and deformity, the conſiſtency of it to putrefaction and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs! and then remember how fooliſh a thing it is, to be proud of ſuch a carcaſs, to ſpend all, or the greateſt part of our time in trimming or adorning it: in ſtudying new faſhions, and devices, to ſet it out, in ſpending our time and proviſions in pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering it, in pleaſing the appetite; and yet this is the chief buſineſs of moſt young men of this age: learn therefore humility
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022548_0066_0FB94883802EB508"/>
and lowlineſs; learn to furniſh thy noble and immortal part, thy ſoul, with religion, grace, knowledge, virtue, goodneſs; for that it will retain to eternity. How miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is that man's condition, that, whilſt ſickneſs has made his body a deformed, weak, loathſome thing, ſin hath made his ſoul as ugly and deformed! The grave will heal or cover the deformity of the former, but the ſoul will carry its ulcers and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity without repentance, into the next world: learn and remember, therefore, to have thy greateſt care for thy nobleſt part, furniſh it with piety, grace, knowledge, the fear and love of God, faith in Chriſt: and as for thy body, uſe it decently, ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and comely, that it may be a fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thy ſoul to uſe in this life; but be not proud of it, nor make it thy chiefeſt care and buſineſs to adorn, much leſs to defile it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Remember to avoid intemperance and ſinful luſts; it is true, ſickneſs and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and, finally, death, are by the laws and conſtitutions of our nature, incident to all mankind: but intemperance, exceſs of eating and drinking, drunkenneſs, whoring, uncleanneſs, and diſorder, bring more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, eſpecially upon young men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

more young, ſtrong, healthy men, than the plague or other natural, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental diſtempers; they weaken the brain, corrupt the blood, decay and diſtemper the ſpirits, diſorder and putrify the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and make the body a very bag full of putrefaction; ſome diſeaſes are, as it were, ſpecifical, and appropriate to theſe vices; other diſeaſes are commonly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by them, by their inflammation and putrefaction of the blood and humours: and all diſeaſes, even thoſe that are epidemical, natural, or caſual, yet are rendered by thoſe vices far more ſharp, laſting, malignant, and incurable, by that ſtock of corrupted matter that lodges in the body, to feed thoſe diſeaſes, and that impotency that theſe vices bring upon nature to reſiſt them; therefore if ever you expect to have, as well a ſound body, as a ſound mind, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid intemperance and debauchery; the moſt temperate and ſober perſons are ſubject to ſickneſs, weakneſs, and diſeaſes; but the intemperate can never be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the proſpect of your diſeaſe, and at leaſt many of thoſe profitable uſes you may gather from the remembrance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:022548_0068_0FB94885E6521AB8"/>2. I ſhall now, in the ſecond place, put you in remembrance of your deliverance; touching which, you muſt remember, 1. That it was a great, eminent, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deliverance; you need no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, than by looking back upon the greatneſs and ſeverity of your diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned. 2. It was a deliverance by the immediate power and mercy of that God that ſent you the viſitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame hand inflicted the wound and effected the cure.</note> 
                  <hi>Una eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit.</hi> If you had been delivered by the immediate efficacy of means, yet you are blind if you ſee not, that the efficacy of means, depends upon the providence of God; it is he that provides it, and that makes the means effectual. But in this deliverance, God hath pleaſed to hedge up, as it were, your way from attributing it to means, and hath given you an indication, that it was done by his own immediate power, and that he delivered you, above and beyond means. It is true, you had a very able and careful phyſician, and very great attendance and care was uſed about you; but when your phyſician, and all that were about you, began to deſpair of your recovery; when means proved ineffectual; when the ſtrength
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022548_0069_0FB94887EB86E9F0"/>
of nature was exhauſted and baffled by your diſeaſe; God Almighty, upon a ſudden, and beyond expectation, relieved you; and, as it were by his own hand, brought you back from the very threſhold of the grave: and thus he did, that you and all about you, and all your relations, might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, that it was he that did it.</p>
               <p>And thus Almighty God hath exerciſed towards you, two great experiments; the firſt of his ſeverity; the ſecond of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and as your ſickneſs and rod had its voice, a loud and ſharp voice, ſo your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and deliverance hath its voice, and I will, as ſhortly as I can, tell you what it is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember this benefit; remember it was reached out unto you, from the mere power, goodneſs and mercy of God: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member evermore, in your heart and ſoul, to be thankful to him for it: remember, as long as you live, upon all occaſions, to acknowledge it; daily to return upon your knees humble thanks for it, to him that had regard to you, and remembered you in your low eſtate; to him that forgave your iniquities, and healed your diſeaſe; to him that did this for you, when all means failed; that did it for you, when you had not the underſtanding to call upon him for
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022548_0070_0FB94888E1686DE0"/>
it; to him that did it for you, that deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not, for you that had provoked him, and neglected him in the time of your health. This God it was that delivered you; read often the 103d. Pſalm attentively, and apply it to your condition: it will do you good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember to acknowledge this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God with all humility; your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance was not the purchaſe of your own power, nor of your own deſert, it was an act of the free undeſerved goodneſs of God. What Almighty God ſaid by Moſes unto the Iſraelites, Deut. ix. 4, 6, I ſhall ſay to you, with ſome variation;—Underſtand therefore that the Lord thy God hath not given this deliverance for thy righteouſneſs; no, it is the mere effect of his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to give you opportunity to praiſe him, and ſerve him better than ever you did before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember, that although great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances require your great acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet there is ſomewhat more required; namely, a real, practical glorifying of God, by ordering your converſation aright, by ſerving him, pleaſing him, obeying him, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his honor: this Almighty God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, as well as praiſes, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as the end of God in afflictions is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022548_0071_0FB9488A6EC20FF0"/>
to make men better; ſo the end of God in deliverances is to make men better; and if we are not the better men by both diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we do, as much as in us lies, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Almighty God in his deſign, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint ourſelves of the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage intended in both, and eaſily to be gained by both. This therefore is the voice of this deliverance, it calls ſweetly, and gently indeed, but earneſtly, and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for amendment of life, and that upon two great and moving arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your recovery, and great deliverance, calls for this from you, upon the account of common ingenuity and good nature, which obligeth a man to be obſervant and dutiful to his benefactor. God Almighty is the greateſt benefactor, and hath manifeſted himſelf ſuch to you, upon a viſible eminent account; this is engagement enough, upon the account of common humanity, to be dutiful and obedient to him; when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are at any time, by the temptation of your own corruption, or by the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil perſons, ſolicited to evil actions, conſider thus with yourſelf;—is this a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming return to that God, that hath thus wonderfully delivered me? is this the requit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that I ſhall make unto him for his mercy? ſhall I pleaſe the great God of heaven and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022548_0072_0FB9488BE31C9A08"/>
earth, that hath thus delivered me, and done me more good than all the world could ever do me, or than I can ever recompenſe? <hi>"Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye fooliſh people, and unwiſe? hath he not made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee?</hi> Deut. xxxiii.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This his mercy calls for your obedience to God in an eminent manner upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of common prudence and diſcretion; the benefit of your obedience to him will be your own, your own happineſs in this life, and in that to come; there is no greater moral ſecurity againſt future dangers and troubles, than obedience and reformation of life, upon great deliverances received; nor is there any greater invitation of new troubles and miſchiefs than ingratitude, diſobedience, and great ſins after great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deliverances; there is a kind of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible connexion, between great ſins, after great mercies received, and great judgments to follow; <hi>Ingentia beneficia, ingentia peccata, ingentia ſupplicia</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Great favours, followed by great crimes, are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by great puniſhments.</note>.</p>
               <p>Again, as I have formerly told you, you do not know how ſoon you may ſtand in need of the ſame mercy and goodneſs of God, which you have formerly found; you are never out of the reach of his power, and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022548_0073_0FB9488D62D81310"/>
the neceſſity of his help; whatever you do, therefore, never diſoblige him by whom you live, and whoſe extraordinary mercy you may ſtand in need of, you know not how ſoon; there is nothing in the world doth more provoke God than neglect, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, or wilful diſobedience after ſignal mercies; theſe provoke the merciful God to a ſeverity of the higheſt kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſweeteſt and moſt obliging call of mercy and deliverance is neglected; read the firſt chapter of the Proverbs attentively. And the merciful God hath given us a plain rule and method, how he may be ſerved, obeyed, and pleaſed; he hath given us a plain diſcovery of his will in the Scriptures of both Teſtaments; read that often, you have it by you, and you need not go far to find what is your Maker's will, and what that obedience is that he requires, as the return of this, and all other his mercies; yet I think it not amiſs to mind you of ſome particulars, that may be uſeful for you upon this occaſion, and to direct you how parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to improve it, and ſo order your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life in ſome meaſure anſwerable to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would have you make it your firſt buſineſs, after your recovery, to conſider the courſe of your life paſt, ſince you came
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022548_0074_0FB9488EE664B858"/>
to the age of diſcretion, and ſee what hath been amiſs in it; whether you have not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected religion, and the duties of it, too much, as prayer, hearing the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, obſerving the Lord's day, receiving the Sacrament, whether you have not been guilty of intemperance, exceſs of drinking, wantonneſs, uncleanneſs, idleneſs, miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your time, and thoſe ſupplies which have been allowed for your maintainance; whether you have not too much delighted in vain, ſinful, and diſorderly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, vanity and expenſe in apparel; and if ſuch, or the like faults have been, repent of them; be ſorry for them, reſolve againſt them; and let the future courſe of your life be amended in relation thereunto. I have before told you that your heavenly Father hath forgiven you, and I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you, neither do I mention thoſe things to upbraid you for them, but that you, upon the conſideration of what hath been amiſs, may be thereby the better enabled to rectify and ſet in order your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life; if this be done and practiſed, I will reckon your late ſickneſs and diſtemper one of the greateſt bleſſings that ever befel you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would have you always keep a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the fear of God upon your heart;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022548_0075_0FB948920A1C39F0"/>
conſider his preſence, order your life as in his preſence; conſider that he always ſees you, beholds and takes notice of you, and eſpecially whether you carry yourſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to this great deliverance: it is one of thoſe talents for which he will expect an account from you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would have you frequently and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſider of the great love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath given to be the inſtructor and governor, and ſacrifice for the ſins of you and all mankind: through whom, upon repentance, you have aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the remiſſion of your ſins, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: and frequently conſider how great an engagement this is upon you, and all mankind, to live according to ſuch a hope, and ſuch a mercy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would have you every morning read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, till you have read the bible from the beginning to the end: obſerve it well, read it reverently and attentively, ſet your heart upon it, and lay it up in your memory, and make it the direction of your life; it will make you a wiſe and good man: I have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomewhat with men and books, and have had long experience in learning, and in the world: there is no book like the bible for excellent learning, wiſdom, and uſe: and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022548_0076_0FB948935FFD02B8"/>
it is the want of underſtanding, in them that think or ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Every morning and every evening, upon your knees, with all reverence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind, return hearty thanks to God for his mercy to you, and particularly for this deliverance; deſire his grace to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to walk in ſome meaſure anſwerable to it; beg his providence to protect you, his grace to direct you, to keep you from evil actions, and evil perſons, and evil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences; beg his pardon for your ſins, and the continuance of his favour; always concluding with the Lord's prayer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Obſerve conſcientiouſly the Lord's day to keep it holy; avoid idle company, idle diſcourſe, recreations, and ſecular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon that day; reſort that day twice to the public prayers and ſermon; go early to it, be attentive at it, and keep your eyes and mind from roving after vain thoughts or objects; ſpend the reſt of that day, that is free from neceſſary occaſions, in reading the Scriptures or ſome good books of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Once every term, at leaſt, come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly and reverently to the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, receive it with great reverence and thankfulneſs, and due conſideration to the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022548_0077_0FB94894DFA7F160"/>
end of its inſtitution; renew your covenant with Almighty God, that you made in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly before him, and beg his grace and ſtrength to perform it.</p>
               <p>And as thoſe directions before do more eſpecially relate to Almighty God, and your deportment immediately towards him; ſo theſe that follow, more eſpecially relate to yourſelf and others, and your moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be very moderate in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; drunkenneſs is the great vice of the time; and by drunkenneſs, I do mean, not only groſs drunkenneſs, but alſo tippling, drinking exceſſively or immoderately, or more than is convenient, and neceſſary; avoid thoſe companies that are given to it; come not into thoſe places that are devoted to that beaſtly vice, namely, taverns and ale-houſes; avoid and refuſe thoſe devices that are uſed to occaſion it, as drinking and pledging of healths: be reſolute againſt it, and when your reſolution is once known, you will never be ſolicited to it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites were commanded by their father not to drink wine, and they obeyed it, and had a bleſſing for it: my command to you is not ſo ſtrict; I allow you the moderate
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022548_0078_0FB948965E6C8360"/>
uſe of wine and ſtrong drink at your meals; I only forbid you exceſs, or the unneceſſary uſe of it, and thoſe places and companies and artifices, that are temptations to it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Avoid wanton and laſcivious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpeeches, and company: read pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs ii. 5, 6, 7, 9. An harlot hunts for the precious life of a man, and that vice brings a ruin with it to the ſoul, body, and eſtate: if you cannot conveniently contain yourſelf in a ſingle life, and be of competent health, marry, but with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counſel of your father while he lives.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Be frugal of your time, it is one of the beſt jewels we have; and to that end avoid idleneſs, it conſumes your time, and lays you open to worſe inconveniences; let your recreations be healthy, and creditable, and moderate, without too much expenſe of time or money; go not to plays, they are waſting of time; value time by that eſtimate we would have of it, when we want it; what would not a ſick man give for thoſe portions of time, and health, that he had formerly improvidently waſted?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be diligent in your ſtudy and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is an act of duty to Almighty God, that requires it, and it will be your wiſdom and benefit; and it will be a good expenſe
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022548_0079_0FB9489A29882420"/>
of time, a prevention from a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies and temptations that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe will befal a man; it will furniſh you with knowledge and underſtanding, give you the advantage and means of a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and plentiful ſubſiſtence, and make you a ſupport, comfort, and benefit to your friends and country.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Be frugal in your expenſes; live within the compaſs of that exhibition that God's providence, and your father's abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhall ſupply you withal; it is enough to maintain an honeſt provident man, and ten times more will not be enough to a profuſe mind; a frugal man will live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and plentifully, upon a little, and a profuſe man will live beggarly, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitouſly, and in continual want, whatever his ſupplies be.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In all your expenſes, conſider before hand; can I not be well enough without this that I am about to buy? is there an abſolute neceſſity for it? can I not forbear till I am in a better condition to compaſs it? If I buy or borrow, can I pay—and when?—and am I ſure?—will this expenſe hold out?—how ſhall I bring about the next quarter, or the next year?—If young men would but have the patience to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022548_0080_0FB9489ADBB7E6C8"/>
and aſk themſelves queſtions of the like nature, it would make them conſiderate in their expenſes, and provident for the future; and theſe conſiderations will, in an eſpecial manner, concern you, in reſpect of your father's expenſes for you, which though I have forgiven and forgotten, I would have you remember with gratitude and caution.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The vanity of young men, in loving fine cloaths and new faſhions, and valuing themſelves by them, is one of the moſt childiſh pieces of folly that can be, and the occaſion of great profuſeneſs and undoing of young men. Avoid curioſity and too much expenſiveneſs in your apparel: be comely, plain, decent, cleanly—not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or coſtly:—it is the ſign of a weak head-piece, to be ſick for every new faſhion, or to think himſelf the better in it, or the worſe without it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Be careful, what company you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort with—and much more careful, what perſons you grow intimate with. Chooſe ſober, wiſe, learned, honeſt, religious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:—you will gain learning and wiſdom, and improve yourſelf in learning and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by converſing with them:—but avoid debauched, fooliſh, intemperate, prodigal, atheiſtical, profane company, as you would
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022548_0081_0FB948A092DD4110"/>
avoid the plague:—they will corrupt and undo you:—they are a ſort of the moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fools in the world; and familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and converſation with them will endanger to make you like them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Weigh and conſider your words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſpeak them; and do not talk at random or at a venture. Let your words be few, and to the purpoſe:—be more ready to hear others, than to ſpeak yourſelf:—ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom yourſelf to ſpeak leiſurely and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately:—it will be a means to make you ſpeak warily and conſiderately.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Be very careful to ſpeak truth; and beware of lying. As lying is diſpleaſing to God, ſo it is offenſive to man; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, at the latter end, returns to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or diſadvantage of him that uſeth it:—it is an evidence of a weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly mind. Be careful that you believe not haſtily ſtrange ſtories; and be much more careful that you do not report them, though at the ſecond hand:—for, if it prove an untruth, as commonly ſtrange ſtories prove ſo, it brings an imputation of levity upon him that reports it, and poſſibly ſome diſadvantage to others.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Take heed, what you promiſe:— ſee that it be juſt, and honeſt, and lawful,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022548_0082_0FB948A35B2A1230"/>
and what is in your power honeſtly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to perform: and when you have ſo promiſed, be true to your word. It is, for the moſt part the faſhion of inconſiderate and young men, eſpecially that run in debt; they will, with great aſſeverations, promiſe preciſe payment at this day, or that day, when either they certainly know they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform, or at leaſt have no probable aſſurance that they can do it; and when their turn is ſerved, they are as backward in their performance, as they were before liberal in their promiſes. Breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and lying, are much of a nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly go together, and are arguments of an impotent and unmanly mind.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Beware of gaming; it is the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſumption of an eſtate that can be, and that vice ſeldom goes alone; commonly debauchery of all kinds accompanies it: beſides it makes a man of a wild, vaſt, and unſettled mind; and ſuch men are impatient of an honeſt calling, or of moderate or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt gain.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Run not in debt, either for wares ſold, or money borrowed; be content to want things that are not of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, rather than to run upon the ſcore; ſuch a man pays at the latter end, one third part more than the principal comes to, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022548_0083_0FB948A4AB25D660"/>
is in perpetual ſervitude to his creditors, lives uncomfortably, is neceſſitated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his debts, to ſtop his creditors' mouths, and many times falls into deſperate courſes.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Be reſpectful to all, familiar and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with few: be grateful to your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, eſpecially to thoſe who, under God, were inſtrumental for your good, in your late ſickneſs, and return your thanks to them; to your father, that ſpared no coſt for your recovery; to your doctor, that was exceedingly diligent about you; to thoſe that attended you in your ſickneſs; to thoſe that, together with your father, often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God for your recovery, and for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon this affliction, whoſe names you ſhall, in due time, particularly know; but above all, to Almighty God, who not only provided and bleſſed the means, but ſaved and delivered you above all means and when means failed.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Laſtly, I ſhall conclude with one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice more, without the obſervance whereof, my labour in writing this long epiſtle will be probably fruitleſs: be not wiſe in your own conceit; this is the unhappy error, and many times the ruin of young men eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; they are uſually raſh, giddy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, and yet extremely confident of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022548_0084_0FB948A623F4B640"/>
that which they have the leaſt reaſon to truſt; namely, their own underſtanding, which renders them moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>erved from them that are willing and beſt able to adviſe them, impatient of reproof, love to be flattered, and ſo become incapable of good and wiſe counſel, till their follies have reduced them to extreme ſtraits and inconveniencies; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect therefore your own judgment: adviſe often with your father, eſpecially in all things of moment; be glad of counſel, and be contented and willing to follow it; at leaſt till ripeneſs of age, obſervation, and experience have enabled you to adviſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; this is an eaſy, and ready, and cheap way of attaining wiſdom, and avoiding infinite inconveniencies.</p>
               <p>And thus I have in this long epiſtle, given you the means how you may improve both your own ſickneſs, and recovery, to the glory of God, and your own benefit. I ſhall therefore conclude with two conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that may the more engage you to the uſe of both theſe diſpenſations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The danger is great, if afflictions make not a man more humble and dutiful; and the danger is yet greater, if any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances and mercies do not make a man more thankful and obedient to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022548_0085_0FB948A819527F88"/>
it is the moſt obliging method that the gracious God can uſe towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men for that end, in this life; and the neglect of that invitation adds ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and contempt to the neglect of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The benefit that you will receive by making a good uſe of theſe two diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in improving your dutifulneſs and obedience to God, will be ſingular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. 1. It will make you a wiſe man, by making you a good and religious man: believe it from your father, who will not deceive you; nay, believe it from a greater than your father, the very Spirit of Truth, who cannot deceive you; the true fear of God, is the only true wiſdom: Read Deut. iv. 6; Job xxvii. 28; Pſalm cxi. 10; Prov. i. 7; Prov. ix. 10; Eccls. xii. 13; and very many more declarations there are of this great truth. 2. It will make you a happy man, it will give you the favour and love of God, which is better than life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: you ſhall have his mercy to pardon you, his providence to protect you, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct you, his goodneſs to bleſs you, and to forgive and to forget whatever hath heretofore been done amiſs by you: this will make all conditions comfortable to you; whether life or death, ſickneſs or
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022548_0086_0FB948A959940110"/>
health: by this means you may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your father, a ſupport to your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, an inſtrument of good to your country, and attain an honeſt, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable, and competent ſubſiſtence in this world, and an everlaſting inheritance of glory and immortality in the world to come.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a large letter of found and good counſel: ſet your heart to it, and obſerve and remember it: we ſee how unſtable our lives are; you nor I know not how ſoon either, or both of us, may leave this world: it may be, this may be the laſt paper of advice that your father may give you; but however it ſhall pleaſe God to deal with you or me, touching our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in this world, yet let me leave this with you, in the cloſe of this letter; if I ſhall find that theſe directions are dutifully obſerved, I ſhall be ready, from time to time, freely to adviſe and direct you: and as I have paſſed by your former extravagances, ſo I ſhall hereby have great aſſurance, that God hath bleſſed this viſitation to you. But on the other ſide, if I ſhall find that you neglect my counſels, that you make light of them, that you ſtill purſue thoſe courſes, that will certainly be bitterneſs in the end, I muſt then tell you, I ſhall pray
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022548_0087_0FB948AAA1CC7F10"/>
for you, and be ſorry for you with my heart; but I ſhall not eaſily be perſuaded to give you any more advice, or counſels, where I find them deſpiſed or neglected. In this paper there are many things omitted, which might have been inſerted; but the conſtant read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy ſcriptures, will ſupply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that defect; I have choſen only, in this paper, to mention ſuch things to you as are ſeaſonable on this occaſion. God Almighty hath not been wanting to you in admonition, correction, mercy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; neither hath your-father been wanting to you in education, counſel, care and expenſe; I pray God Almighty to bleſs all unto you. This is the prayer of</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I SENT you formerly divers inſtructions concerning your ſpeech, and how you ſhould manage it; and being now come well
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022548_0088_0FB948AC28D2AF00"/>
to F*****, from whence I wrote you my former inſtructions, I intend to write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you of another ſubject, viz. your obſervation of the Lord's day, commonly called Sunday:—and this I do for theſe reaſons:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it hath pleaſed God to caſt my lot ſo, that I am to reſt at this place upon that day, and the conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of that duty is proper for me and you: it is <hi>opus diei in die ſuo,</hi> the work fit and proper for that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe I have found by long and ſound experience, that the due obſervance of this day, and of the duties of it, hath been of ſingular comfort and advantage to me; and I doubt not but it will prove ſo to you. God Almighty is the Lord of our time, and lends it to us; and it is but juſt we ſhould conſecrate this part of that time to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe I find in the world much looſeneſs and apoſtacy from this duty. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple begin to be cold and careleſs in it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing themſelves ſports and recreations and ſecular employments in it, without any neceſſity; which is a ſad ſpectacle and an ill preſage. It concerns me therefore (that am your father) as much as I may, to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022548_0089_0FB948ADB19E9F18"/>
you from that ſin, which the example of others, and the inclination and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs of youth, is otherwiſe apt to lead you into.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore ſet down to you parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (and not in generals only) theſe things—1. What is the reaſon and ground of your obſervation of this day. 2. What things ought not to be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day, which poſſibly may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon another day. 3. What things may be done upon this day. 4. What things are either fit or neceſſary to be done, in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der to the ſanctification of this day.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, viz. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the obſervation and ſanctification of this day:—and the reaſons are theſe:—</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a moral duty, that, ſince the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God gives me my time, I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and ſet apart ſome portion of that time, in a ſpecial manner, to his ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And becauſe the glorious God beſt knows, what portion of time is fit to be peculiarly dedicated to his ſervice, that ſo the morality of that time might be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined unto ſome certainty, he hath, by his expreſs precept, given to his ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Jews, limited one day of ſeven, to be that ſpecial portion of time, which he
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022548_0090_0FB948AF93572C00"/>
would have peculiarly dedicated to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſo to conclude into it the mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of that duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſeventh portion of time, under the old law given to the Jews, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the precept and command of God, in the fourth command; and likewiſe by his own example, confined to the ſeventh day from the creation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But our ſaviour, Chriſt, who is the ſon of God, bleſſed for ever, and is the Lord of the Sabbath, [<hi>Matt.</hi> xii.] fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of our redemption, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection upon the firſt day of the week, and by his miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly the firſt day of the week, and by the ſecret meſſage of the ſpirit to the apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and primitive church, hath tranſlated the obſervation of the ſeventh day of the week, to the firſt day of the week, which is our Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond—It is certain that what is unlawful to be done upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day, is much moſt unlawful upon this; as exceſs and intemperance, and the like ſinful and unlawful actions. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are many things, that may be lawfully done on another day, which may not lawfully be done upon this; and many
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:022548_0091_0FB948B0AAFD66D0"/>
that are not only lawful upon another day, but alſo fit and decent, which are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be done upon this day. Upon other days we may and muſt employ ourſelves in our ſecular and ordinary callings—we may uſe bodily exerciſes and recreations, as bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhooting, hunting, and divers others— we may ſtudy human learning:—but I hold theſe to be not only unfit, but unlawful to be uſed upon this day: and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it. Moderate walking may thus far be uſed, ſo far only, as it enableth you to the more cheerful performance of the duties of this day: and therefore I allow you to walk ſoberly, about half an hour after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to digeſt your meat, that you be not drowſy nor indiſpoſed, in the religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the day. Feaſtings may be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably uſed ſometimes upon other days, but are unfit upon this. Let only ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be made upon this day, as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the family and the poor: and therefore I hold, that curioſities, baking of meats, and ſuperfluous proviſions, upon this day, are to be avoided, as being an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary breaking of the reſt of this day, and unbeſeeming the ſolemnity of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,—What things may be done this day, is a queſtion of great latitude; becauſe
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022548_0092_0FB948B22E4A7E90"/>
circumſtances are many, that do much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify the actions of men, and many times render them lawful or unlawful, according to thoſe varieties of circumſtances. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſhortly ſet down thoſe things, that do not of themſelves directly tend to the ſanctitication of this day, that yet may, and ſometimes muſt, be done upon this day. For there were many things, that were ſtrictly enjoined to the Jews in their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath, which were ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and concerned only that ſtate, and do not oblige under the goſpel; as their dreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meat upon this day was prohibited to them, but not to us: and many more things they did forbear and count unlawful, which in truth were not only not forbidden, but enjoined and commanded;—for which our Lord reproves the Phariſees, who account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a breach of the Sabbath, to heal the ſick, or to pluck the ears of corn for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary relief of hunger. <hi>Mat.</hi> xii.</p>
               <p>Therefore—1. Works of abſolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for man or beaſt, may be done upon the Lord's day. And thoſe I call works of neceſſity, which cannot be done before this day, or after, without apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as, for inſtance, ſtopping of the breach of a ſea-wall—ſupporting a houſe, that,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022548_0093_0FB948B39C8C1718"/>
upon a ſudden tempeſt or caſualty, is ready to fall—pulling out an ox or other beaſt, fallen into a ditch—preventing of a treſpaſs, by a ſudden accident, that may be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to my corn, or my neighbour's—ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a broken bone—phyſic to remove an imminent diſeaſe or pain—milking of cows—feeding of cattle—the neceſſary dreſſing of meat for the family—and many more inſtances of that kind. But yet there in warineſs and integrity muſt be uſed; for otherwiſe men, under the pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, will take the liberty to do what they pleaſe. Therefore take theſe cautions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is not a neceſſity, that excuſeth a work upon this day, which might have been reaſonably foreſeen and done before the day; as, for inſtance, a man hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to dreſs meat for his family, which he might have provided on the Saturday; and neglects it:—this neceſſity will not juſtify him in ſending two or three miles to buy meat on the Sunday.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That is not a neceſſity, which may be forborne to be done, without any abſolute deſtruction or loſs of the thing, until the morrow. If a rick of hay be on fire, I may endeavor to quench it on the Lord's day:
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022548_0094_0FB948B559B64298"/>
but if my corn be cut and lying upon the ground, on the Saturday, though the weather be rainy or inclining to wet, I may not make it into cocks, or fetch it home, upon the Lord's day; becauſe poſſibly Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God may ſend fair weather to-morrow: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in my forbearance, I do two duties under one, viz. obſerve his law, and reſt upon his providence. Men have neceſſities many times, to ſerve their caſe, and ſloth, and fancies, when in truth there is none; but the buſineſs may be deferred without any danger. If we would be more faithful in our obedience to God, we ſhould find many pretended neceſſities to vaniſh into mere imaginations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Works of charity—relief of the poor—admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtering phyſic upon an apparent neceſſity—viſiting or comforting the afflicted—admoniſhing the diſorderly —perſuading peace between neighbors offended—and endeavoring to compoſe differences which require not much examination, or cannot be deferred without an apparent danger of greater miſchief—theſe are not only permitted, but commendable, nay commanded, upon this day. But if the buſineſs require examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or may be deferred till to-morrow, then it is beſt to defer ſuch examinations, and treaties between offended parties, till another day; becauſe they will take away too much of the little precious portion of time of this day, and may be as well done to-morrow.</p>
               <p>As to the fourth,—what is proper, fit, or neceſſary to be done, in order to the ſanctification of this day— I will ſet down particularly; for generals ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any great effect, becauſe every man is apt to conſtrue them according to his own mind and liking.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would not have you meddle with any recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, paſtimes, or ordinary work of your calling, from Saturday evening to Monday morning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Riſe at leaſt three hours before morning ſermon; and when you have made yourſelf ready, and waſhed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022548_0095_0FB948B711674E98"/>
and fitted yourſelf for the ſolemnity of the day, read two chapters in the bible; and then go ſolemnly to your private prayer, and deſire of God his grace to enable you to ſanctify his day: and after your private prayer, read another chapter; and let your reading be with attention, obſervation, and your head uncovered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When you are in the public worſhip and ſervice of God, be uncovered all the while of reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or preaching.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Kneel upon your knees at prayer; ſtand up at the reading of the pſalms, and at the firſt and ſecond leſſon, and the epiſtle and goſpel, &amp;c.—ſo you ſhall avoid offence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sit at the ſermon, and be very attentive at your prayers, and in your hearing. I recommend your writing the ſermon, eſpecially until you are one or two and twenty years old; becauſe young minds are apt to wander; and writing the ſermon fixeth them, and maketh them more attentive.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the miniſter readeth any pſalms or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, turn to them in your bible, and read along with him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be very attentive and ſerious at church: uſe no laughing, nor gazing about, nor whiſpering.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sing the pſalms with the reſt of the congregation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Eat moderately at dinner—rather ſparingly than plentifully—upon this day; that you may be fit for the afternoon's exerciſe, without drowſineſs or dulneſs.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Walk half an hour after dinner in the garden, to digeſt your meat: then retire to your chamber, to 'commune with your own heart' until church-time.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If you are well, be ſure to go to church morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and afternoon; and be there before the miniſter begin, and ſtay until he hath ended: and all the while you are at church, carry yourſelf gravely, ſoberly, and reverently.</p>
               <p n="12">12. After evening ſermon, go up to your chamber,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022548_0096_0FB948B9036191F0"/>
and read a chapter in your bible; then examine what you have written of the ſermon.</p>
               <p n="13">13 In all your ſpeeches or actions of this day, let there be no lightneſs nor vanity: but let your actions and ſpeech be ſuch as the day is, ſerious and ſacred, tending to learn or inſtruct in the great buſineſs of your knowledge of God, and his will, and your own duty.</p>
               <p n="14">14. After ſupper, every one of you, going to bed, kneel down upon your knees, and deſire of God his pardon for what you have done amiſs this day, and his bleſſing upon what you have heard, and his acceptance of what you have endeavored in his ſervice.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Perform all this cheerfully, and uprightly, and honeſtly; and account it not a burden to you: for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yourſelves, you ſhall find a bleſſing from God in ſo doing. And remember, it is your father, that tells you ſo, and that loves you, and will not deceive you.</p>
               <p>And thus I have written to you of the obſervation of the Lord's day; wherein though I have omitted many things, that might have been fit to be inſerted, yet you muſt conſider, that I had but a ſmall portion of time allowed me to write, while I lay at an inn, and upon that day wherein I have performed thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which I now enjoin you. Let the original be laid up ſafely for your brother R —; and every one of you take copies of it, that you may thereby remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the counſels of,</p>
