            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TRIAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON Tueſday, the 8th of October, 1793, at the court of Oyer and Terminer, and Gaol delivery for the County of New-York, came on the trial of <hi>Henry Bedlow,</hi> for committing a rape on the body of <hi>Lanah Sawyer,</hi> ſpinſter, a young girl of about 17 years of age. The counſel for the proſecution, were, The <hi>Attorney General,</hi> Meſſrs <hi>Hoffman</hi> and <hi>Kent;</hi> for the priſoner, Meſſrs. <hi>Thompſon, Hughes, B. Livingſton, Troup, Cozine</hi> and <hi>Harriſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the uſual preliminaries were over, the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General opened the proſecution with a few general obſervations on the nature of the evidence in an affair of this kind; and remarked that it muſt always be drawn from the party herſelf, whoſe teſtimony, if clear and poſitive, and not impeached, was deemed in law, ſuffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t to ground a conviction. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> called the Proſecutrix.</p>
            <p>LANAH SAWYER, who, being ſworn, teſtified, That "on a Sunday evening, the latter end of Auguſt, ſhe was going through Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dway, and received ſeveral inſults from ſome Frenchmen, whoſe language ſhe could not underſtand; and that the Priſoner came up—reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued her, and then attended her home to her father's houſe in Gold-Street—. That he told her his name was lawyer Smith. On the Sunday following, ſhe met him again—he accoſted her—they entered into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the courſe of which, he aſked her if ſhe would
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026513_0003_0FD07E2CD1FD7BE8"/>
take a walk with him on the battery the following evening; ſhe replied, ſhe was engaged; he then mentioned Tueſday evening; ſhe told him ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; he ſaid, ſurely you are not engaged on every evening—you can certainly go on, Wedneſday; to which ſhe told him ſhe was not then engaged. He conveyed her home, and departed. In the morning, a Mr. Hone, who lived oppoſite to her, obſerved what a ſmart Beau ſhe had got. She told him it was a lawyer Smith; but Mr. Hone ſaid it was not, for it was <hi>Harry Bedlow,</hi> a very great rake; ſhe ſaid it could not be, as he had ſaid his name was lawyer Smith. On the Wedneſday evening following, being the 4th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, ſhe was ſitting on her father's ſtoop, and the Priſoner came up to her, aſked her to take a walk, and told her that Miſs Steddiford (whom ſhe had before mentioned to him to be a young lady of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) would, with another gentleman, accompany them. That ſhe went with the priſoner to the houſe of Mr. Steddiford, but found his daughter out; that Bedlow ſuggeſted they had gone to the battery. She accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly went with him towards that place, down Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. They ſtop'd at Corre's, and took ſome ice cream, and afterwards proceeded to the Battery, round which they walked twice. During this time ſhe heard the clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſtrike, and counted twelve; this alarmed her, ſhe mentioned her fears to the Priſoner, but he quieted them by telling her it was only ten. They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and going into Broadway, met three watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who, upon being asked by Bedlow, told them it was one o'clock. They then went on to John-Street, where ſhe was going to turn down, but the Priſoner would not let her. He kept his arm around her, and brought her on to Ann-Street, which he wanted her to turn down, but ſhe would not, as ſhe knew there were vacant lots there—had heard the ſtreet was filled with bad people, and thought it improper for a young girl
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026513_0004_0FD083D4C08F5368"/>
to go down there. He kept tight hold of her;—ſhe ſcreamed, and he ſtopt her mouth. She then, for the firſt time, began to ſuſpect his intentions. He then dragged her along to oppoſite the Brick-Meeting-houſe, with-one arm round her, the other having both her hands; he then knocked with his ſtick at the door of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Mrs. Cary opened the window; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; admittance; ſhe refuſed, ſaying, that her doors were locked—that her huſband was out of town, and ſhe could not open them. The Proſecutrix, during this, eſcaped from the Priſoner, and run near to the corner of Naſſau-Street; Bedlow dragged her back again; ſhe again eſcaped, and fled quite to the corner; he forcibly made her return, ſhe again ran away, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exhauſted, and not knowing, what ſhe did, run upwards; the Priſoner followed her; told her ſhe ſhould not go back again, and keeping tight hold of her, bro't her to Ann-Street, ſhe reſiſting; he carried her down there, took her through a vacant lot, keeping faſt hold of her arms, and going backwards himſelf, drew her through a paſſage, puſhed open a gate, led her thro' a garden, where they were obſtructed by buſhes—then came to a back door, at which he knocked and demanded admittance; the door was opened by Mrs. Cary, who ſaid, "there is a room;" the Priſoner drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her into it; ſhe ſcreamed; he called for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>dle, which was afterwards put in at the door by Mrs. Cary, and the door was then ſhut. Bedlow then pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off his coat and waiſtcoat, during which, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix ſcreamed and endeavored to eſcape, that he then ſeized her, ſtopped, her mouth, and laughed loud to prevent her ſcreams from being heard; he then threw off her hat, tore the pins out of her gown, and placing her before him, drew it off her ſhoulders; he aſked her conſent three or four times, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, calling him a brute, a dog, and a villain; he next aſked her conſent to put out the candle, which ſhe

When they came to

the houſe, he deſired her to go in firſt, which ſhe did; that on ſeeing Mrs. Cary, her father aſked her if ſhe knew that young woman, pointing to the Witneſs; Mrs. Cary, to repeated queſtions of this kind, replied ſhe had never ſeen her before in her life. The father aſked the Witneſs if that was not the houſe; ſhe told him before Mrs. Cary, it was the houſe ſhe was dragged into the night-before-laſt; that Mrs. Cary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed her father a fight of the back room.</p>

When the witneſs had put on ſome clothes, ſhe ſhoved the candle in at the door, and went away. In the morning the family aroſe, breakfaſted at 8, and paſſed and repaſſed thro' the entry ſeveral times. The Proſecutrix came out of the room at 10 o'clock, and then the witneſs had the converſation with the Proſecutrix as mentioned by her, except as to wiſhing to meet her father; that ſhe appeared perfectly compoſed and ſatisfied; that ſhe

That in the room they ſlept there were no means of making it totally dark, for part of the ſhutter was broke, and the leaſt light might be seen through the cracks; that the back paſſge to her houſe was obſtructed by logs and clam-ſhells; the back gate was faſtened at night, ſo that nobody could open it from without; no faſtenings to the windows of the room, no faſtening to its door.</p>
               <p>That on the next evening being Thurſday, at the hour of lighting candles, the Proſecutrix called, and enquired for Mr. Bedlow: the Witneſs told her he was not there: The Witneſs had ſome pumpkin pye—gave ſome to a lady who was there, and aſked the Proſecutrix to have ſome, which ſhe refuſed; the lady then went into the kitchen to ſee her child. The Witneſs afterwards, requeſted the Proſecutrix to go into another room, as gentlemen might come in; the Proſecutrix told her ſhe could not stay; upon which, the Witneſs ſaid, if ſhe left a meſſage for Mr. Bedlow, it ſhould be conveinced to him; the proſecutrix ſaid, "give my love to him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeing his daughter the next morning, and hearing the ſtory from her, he made her go with him and Mr. Hone to Mrs. Cary's; that they went into a ſide room; he demanded of Mrs. Cary whether ſhe knew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix; Mrs. Cary repeatedly ſaid, in anſwer to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent interrogatories, that ſhe had never ſeen her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went with Mr. Callahan and his daughter to Mrs. Cary's; that Mr. Callahan aſked her if ſhe knew that young woman; Mrs. Cary replied ſhe had never ſeen her before; Mrs. Cary alſo refuſed to ſhew her back room.</p>

the Witneſs went, and finding her aſleep, drew the clothes off her, and examined her linen; ſaw it much diſcoloured and very bloody, and evident marks of her being no longer a virgin; ſhe then went to Mrs. Calla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, and told her what ſhe had ſeen. In the morning Mrs. Callahan came to her houſe, and before the girl had ſpoke a word, threw her down and examined her linen. Then the Proſecutrix told her the ſtory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſimilar to that given in evidence. That the character of the Proſecutrix is generally good and ſhe reputed to be a diſcreet, prudent girl, never kept much company.</p>

               <p>Another witneſs had known the Proſecutrix about 14 months, had lived 2 months in the ſame houſe, without ever ſeeing any lightneſs in her conduct, but ſhe was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought a modeſt, prudent, and diſcreet girl.</p>

               <p>Another witneſs depoſed, That the Proſecutrix, on Thurſday afternoon, came to Mrs. Bruce's to ſee an aged lady, that ſhe appeared very much down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; ſtayed to tea, and went away between 6 and 7 —nearer 7.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TOWT depoſed, That on Thurſday evening, about ſeven, or a little after, the Proſecutrix going down George Street, was called to, by Miſs Pine, then looking over her door; that he then went into a neighbor's houſe, but was called out by his wife to go with her home, as ſhe was afraid of her father; that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026513_0018_0FD083DFE0373910"/>
he offered to go, but ſhe ſaid ſhe would not trouble him; that he ſaid, ſhe and Miſs Pine might go on firſt, and he would follow; that he only went, as ſhe was afraid of going home, and had no apprehenſion of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an improper place, as ſhe was a decent girl; that he followed them home; the Proſecutrix went into her father's houſe, and then into Mr. Hone's—and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Miſs Pine.

               <p>THE ſolemnity of the preſent occaſion; the awful ſituation of the priſoner at the bar, charged with having committed a crime of the deepeſt dye; the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, if proved againſt him, is the loſs of his life, has no doubt impreſſed you with the ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the cauſe you are now to determine. The magnitude of offence, the wild character of Mr. Bedlow, the ſtories which have been circulated, have excited the attention of the public, ſufficiently evinced by the numerous auditory preſent, and have no doubt created ſtrong prejudices againſt the priſoner; they are prejudices however, which, after a fair and impartial view of the evidence even of the Proſecutrix herſelf, it is time to diſmiſs. By examining the various incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies and contradictions throughout the whole of her teſtimony; by ſeparating truth from falſhood, I pledge myſelf to prove that the preſent proſecution is founded in fraud and malice. The taſk, gentlemen, may be long, and the hour is late; but you will not require an apology for that length, when the life of a fellow-citizen is at ſtake.</p>
               <p>In order to determine whether Mr. Bedlow is guilty
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026513_0019_0FD083BBCEB3EA80"/>
of a rape, let us ſee the nature of that crime; whether the facts ſworn to, amount to a proof of the Priſoners' culpability. An eminent writer of the Engliſh law, who is deſervedly eſteemed of high authority in that nation, Lord HALE, defines Rape to conſiſt "in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Knowledge of a woman, forcibly and againſt her will." Has the Proſecutrix proved any force? Has the proved a violation againſt her will? Gentlemen, I by no means pretend to justify the conduct of Mr. Bedlow,</p>
               <p>[Here a cry of <hi>"Priſoner at the Bar."</hi>]</p>
               <p>I will call him Mr. Bedlow, or Priſoner at the Bar, as I think proper for his defence. I know of no obligation to call him one more than the other. Gentlemen, as I was going to obſerve, Mr. Bedlow may have been highly culpable, and yet not guilty of a Rape. He may have ſeduced this girl; yet he did not force her. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his aſſiduities, his attentions, his addreſs, his perſuaſions, ſhe may have fallen a victim to ſeduction, but ſhe has not experienced the monſtrous brutality of a rape. The Priſoner is known to be a gallant man, fond of women, one who will not refuſe the favors of the Fair, and one perhaps, who will go conſiderable lengths in ſoliciting their conſent to his wiſhes; but he is not known to be a wretch ſo loſt to every ſenſe of honor and decency, as to be capable of ſatisfying his luſtful appetite by a recourſe to the brutality of force. Beſides, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as a man of gallantry, is by no means a circumſtance againſt him, it is ſtrongly in his favor; accuſtomed to the company of women; a genteel figure; an inſinuating addreſs; would probably open ſufficient avenues to the gratification of his pleaſures, and prevent the neceſſity of force from ever occurring to his mind. His character, gentlemen, is almoſt a demonſtrative proof, that ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not rape, was the crime committed. We ſhall preſently ſee from examining the teſtimony of Miſs Sawyer, that throughout the whole of her tale, there are evident marks of the former—none of the latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:026513_0020_0FD083E14F87B928"/>In caſes of this kind, it is true the law has from the neceſſity of the caſe, admitted the teſtimony of the party herſelf; but it has not allowed it to be concluſive; it muſt be accompanied with circumſtances which ſhow that the party is entitled to credibility. The ſame writer whom I juſt now mentioned, and the reſpectability of whoſe authority does not require my word in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, has a paſſage ſo extremely applicable to the preſent occaſion, that I cannot forbear quoting it: <q>And firſt, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the party raviſhed, may give evidence upon oath, and is in law a competent witneſs; but the credibility of her teſtimony, and how far forth ſhe is to be believed, muſt be left to the jury, upon the circumſtances of fact that appear in that teſtimony. For inſtance, if the witneſs be of good fame; if ſhe preſently diſcovered the offence, and made ſearch for the offender; if the party accuſed fled for it; theſe and the like are concurring circumſtances which give greater probability to her evidence. But on the other ſide, if ſhe be of evil fame, and ſtand unſupported by others; if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the injury for any conſiderable time, after ſhe had opportunity to complain; if the place where the fact is alledged to be committed, was where it was poſſible ſhe might have been heard, and ſhe made no out-cry, theſe, and the like circumſtances, carry a ſtrong, but not concluſive preſumption, that her teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony <g ref="char:endq">”</g>is feigned.</q> Theſe, gentlemen, are the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances by which you can put the evidence of Miſs Sawyer to the teſt—Do they appear in the preſent caſe? Or do they not? Is ſhe of good fame? Did ſhe make complaint as ſoon as ſhe had the power? Was ſhe in a place where ſhe might have been heard, and did ſhe make any out-cry? Did the Priſoner, conſcious of guilt, fly? If all theſe were the caſe, admit him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If they were not, you muſt ſay he is innocent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, gentlemen, I will ſhow, from the ſingle teſtimony of the Proſecutrix, without comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026513_0021_0FD083BD4B0C9148"/>
evidence produced by the Priſoner at the bar, that all theſe circumſtances are wanting. We may be told that our witneſſes appear in a ſuſpicious light, but even if they are not worthy belief, I want them not; the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix has ſaid ſufficient to acquit Mr. Bedlow.</p>
               <p>What is her reputation? A cloud of witneſſes have ſworn that ſhe is a modeſt, diſcreet, prudent girl. It is true, before this diſcovery, ſhe might have been ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed. She may have had the art to carry a fair out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, while all was foul within. She may have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed modeſt, diſcreet and prudent to her neighbourhood, while ſhe was the very reverſe, when not under their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Poſſibly before this affair, there were no means of judging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> her diſcretion and prudence. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before in the way of temptation, ſhe had been inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the want of opportunity. But gentlemen, facts ſpeak for themſelves; the teſtimony of a whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood in her behalf, is not ſo ſtrong and convincing, as what ſhe herſelf has diſcloſed. Determine her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from her own evidence, you will judge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the material part of her ſtory—you will then fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the real motives which actuate the preſent proſecution.</p>
               <p>Her firſt acquaintance with the Priſoner at the bar, is a proof of her diſcretion. She walks alone through the city, at a late hour of the night—picks up the Priſoner, (than an utter ſtranger) in the ſtreet, ſuffers him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey her home, and appears to be pleaſed with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. On the Sunday following ſhe ſees him again; inſtead of exerciſing her prudence on this occaſion, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> makes no attempt to repel his aſſiduities; permits him to walk with her again, to attend her home, and actually makes an appointment to walk with him on the Battery the next Wedneſday evening. Whatever prudence ſhe might have previouſly had, ſhe ſeems, throughout the whole of her conduct towards the Priſoner at the bar, to have thought it no longer neceſſary. But this is not all, it ſeems he had told her his name was Smith, a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026513_0022_0FD083E2D0A43548"/>
that next morning, ſhe had a converſation with her neighbor Hone, who told her ſhe had got a ſmart beau and that it was Harry Bedlow. Upon receiving this information, would not a diſcreet girl have been alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Would ſhe not, ſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed at the idea of deception, have made enquiries into the reaſon? no, nothing of this; ſhe ſuffered no fears or alarms to poſſeſs her; but by her conduct on this occaſion evinced a diſpoſition to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a willing victim to what enſued. But it will be inferred, that the Priſoner at the bar concealing his name and aſſuming that of lawyer Smith, is evidence of his guilty intentions. Recollect gentlemen the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Priſoner, as a man of gallantry, had he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his real name, he was ſo well known, he might have ſuppoſed the girl would have been ſhy, and that he ſhould have been reſiſted in his efforts to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her. This concealment is conſiſtent with an intention to ſeduce, and we cannot ſuppoſe, without doing violence to our reaſon, that Mr. Bedlow at that inſtant meditated a rape.</p>
               <p>Knowing this to be Mr. Bedlow, yet willing to be deceived, ſhe accompanies the Priſoner at a late hour on a walk; goes with him into Corre's Hotel, and inſtead of taking a ſingle glaſs of ice-cream, and returning, as would a girl, jealous of her reputation, ſhe ſtays with him here a full hour and an half; and according to her own ſtory, at the late hour of near ten o'clock, quits the hotel, and turns, not homewards, but towards the battery with the Priſoner. Here they walked round twice, before ſhe diſcovers any wiſh to go home; at laſt ſhe hears the clock ſtrike, diſtinctly counts twelve, tells us ſhe is much alarmed, but at the Priſoner ſaying it was only ten, her fears become compoſed, and they set off on their return. At the head of Broadway they meet with three watchmen, of whom Mr. Bedlow enquires the hour, and was told near one. Here let us reſt gentlemen, and reflect a little on this: curious teſtimony. You will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026513_0023_0FD083BECC432518"/>
wonder how ſo much time could have elapſed ſince their, departure from the Hotel. They leave it at near ten, walk ſlowly to be ſure twice round the battery; return to the head of Broadway, and it is one o'clock. Had they crawled with the pace of ſnails, they ſurely could not have employed all this time; they muſt either have ſat out later, or it was not ſo late when they quitted the battery. If the firſt was the caſe, we are told it was not later, to make us ſuppoſe ſhe had more diſcretion than ſhe really had. If the laſt was the caſe, if it was not really one, it was artfully ſaid, to account for there being no people in the ſtreet, when ſhe was returning. You will likewiſe obſerve gentlemen, that Mr. Bedlow, and not the Proſecutrix, enquired what it was o'clock; he could then have no intention to deceive; but fairly ſuffered the real time to be diſcloſed. Had the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix likewiſe been alarmed at the lateneſs of the hour; had ſhe felt that the Priſoner had deceived her, would ſhe not have applied to the firſt people ſhe ſaw for assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Would ſhe not have made known to the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men her fears and her alarms? Prudence I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, would have dictated this conduct; but her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence appears to be of a curious nature; it led her to continue in the paths of deſtruction, though ſhe had the means of turning aſide.</p>
               <p>She proceeds quietly with the Priſoner, till they came to John-Street—From her we have a lamentable tale of her being dragged by him to the door of Mrs. Cary; of her ſcreaming aloud; the inefficacy of her reſiſtance; and of her being finally exhauſted. Gentlemen, view the Priſoner; is he of that Herculean make which is necessary to accompliſh all that has been related of him? Or rather does he not appear to be of equal ſtrength with the Proſecutrix?</p>

In going thro' with this tale, I am amazed at the blindneſs of the girl, in ſuppoſing her incredible relation could gain belief. I am ſtill more amazed at the blindneſs of her parents, in being impoſed on by a ſtory ſo unnatural. Had they drawn the veil of prejudice from their eyes, they never would have ſuffered her to publiſh her ſhame.</p>
               <p>The farther we proceed, the more inconſiſtencies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear —the nearer do we approach to the falſhood of the charges. At the door of Mrs. Cary's houſe, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue which the Priſoner muſt have undergone, ſhe is ſtill held down, and her mouth ſtopped, one arm round her waiſt, the other on her mouth; yet he knocks at the door and at the window; but as to how he knocked, or with what, we are left in the dark, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he had a third hand, this knocking was not poſſible. The truth is, willing to go in, ſhe was ſitting quietly on the ſloop while he was endeavouring to gain admittance.</p>
               <p>At laſt we find the Priſoner dragging the girl through the back way, ſhe ſcreaming, and nobody is alarmed— Here, tho' it has been ſufficiently proved there were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, ſuch as logs and clam-ſhells in the way, he had held of both hands, and going backwards, pulled her along, and none of theſe obſtructions were perceived. She is next let into the houſe of Mrs. Cary, making a noiſe which nobody ever heard; and we find the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner and her together in a room. She muſt then have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026513_0025_0FD083C04DF84370"/>
had no doubt of his intentions. She tells you indeed ſhe ſcreamed; but were there no other means which a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman would have employed in defence of her chaſtity? Would ſhe have exerciſed her voice alone? Would ſhe not rather have ſtamped with her feet? And even if ſhe was exhauſted, have exerted her ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ſtrength in oppoſing the raviſher? Let me aſk you, gentlemen, whether the deſcription ſhe gave amounted to a rape? Was ſhe forced? Did the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er accompliſh his wiſhes againſt her will?</p>
               <p>After the affair, Mr. Bedlow ſlept: Why did ſhe not then eſcape? She informs us ſhe aroſe and went to the windows, but could not open them; the door likewiſe was faſtened, but it has been proved there were neither bolts nor bars to either; how eaſily might ſhe have ſhoved open the window and got into the ſtreet? But on this occaſion ſhe loſt her ſenſe of feeling; in the morning, people were paſſing and repaſſing in the paſſage, yet ſhe heard them not. The room in which ſhe lay was totally dark for ſome hours after ſun-riſe, though the ſhutter was broke, and the light always before had appeared through the cracks. It ſeems that ſhe who had loſt her ſenſe of feeling, and was deaf before, had of a ſudden became blind. The ſun which had roſe for others, did not riſe for her, and truly one would imagine ſhe had loſt her ſenſes, when ſhe attempted to impoſe ſuch an incredible ſtory on the minds of an enlightened jury. What kind of credit, gentlemen, can you give to ſuch a ſtring of falſhoods; the nature of which, without oppoſite teſtimony, is ſufficient to ſhow the character of the Proſecutrix.</p>
               <p>Thus far, gentlemen, I have proved the falſhood of the charge, from the ſtory of the Proſecutrix. It is now time to compare it with the teſtimony offered in behalf of the Priſoner, and from that to corroborate his innocence. The character of theſe witneſſes I am aware will be ſtrongly attacked by the counſel for the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026513_0026_0FD083E5D0E4CC70"/>
You will be told to pay no credit to their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, conſidering their habits of life. Mrs. Cary's oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, too well known to deny, will be thought to impeach her credibility. She has, it is true, been charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an accomplice with the Priſoner; but nothing of the kind has been made out. Her very refuſal to admit the Priſoner and the Proſecutrix into her houſe, is a clear proof of her innocence. Had this been a previous concerted ſcheme, contrived between Mrs. Cary and Mr. Bedlow, would her doors have been ſhut? Would ſhe have hazarded a diſcovery by keeping them in the ſtreet? Surely if this is a fact, though Mrs. Cary has been termed a woman of intrigue, ſhe poſſeſſed very little intrigue in this inſtance. Her doors being ſhut at ten o'clock, evinces, that though ſhe is a woman who keeps a bad houſe, ſtill it is one of a decent kind. But why did ſhe open her back door, when ſhe was ſo careful of her front door? She tells us ſhe was alarmed, ſuppoſed thieves were breaking in; hearing Mr. Bedlow's voice ſhe opened the door. Was there any thing ſtrange in this? From the Priſoner's character as a man of gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was probably well known at the houſe; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happy to find her fears diſſipated, with gladneſs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door. It will likewiſe be ſaid, when before the Mayor, ſhe told him ſhe had never ſeen the girl; and that when the father of the Proſecutrix went to Mrs. Cary's houſe, ſhe likewiſe denied any knowledge of the Proſecutrix. But was there any obligation on Mrs. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to diſcloſe the ſecrets of her houſe? Out of decency and delicacy ſhe refuſed to publiſh Miſs Sawyer's ſhame, for which purpoſe ſhe concealed the truth to queſtions that were improper. When queſtioned in this Court upon oath, ſhe, actuated by conſcience, diſcloſes the whole truth. Every part of Mrs. Cary's evidence, ſtrongly concurs with that of the Proſecutrix in many circumſtances; ſhe does not appear to be influenced by any undue motives; ſhe cannot be intereſted in the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026513_0027_0FD083C1CE766868"/>
event, not have any Witneſſes been brought forward againſt her credibility. Mrs. Cary has teſtified, That the Proſecutrix came to her houſe on the next evening, enquired in a friendly manner after Mr. Bedlow, and left a meſſage for him, which by no means comported with the injury ſhe pretends to have ſuſtained. This is confirmed by the evidence of Mrs. M'Faul, a poor decent woman, who, though a relation of Mrs. Cary, appears not to be in the ſame walk of life. The girl denies it. Who, Gentlemen of the Jury, are you to believe? A ſingle intereſted witneſs, or two who derive no benefit from the event of this trial? For my own part, I cannot doubt but that ſhe did go; and if this is the caſe, what credit can we give to the whole of her teſtimony, when ſhe has the audacity to ſtep forward and deliberately ſwear to a falſhood? Is it likely, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, that if this pretended violence had been committed on her the preceding night; that if ſhe had been actually raviſhed, ſhe would ſo mildly have fought her ſeducer, and have appointed to meet him the next evening? This tranſaction evidently explains the nature of the whole affair, and demonſtrates beyond a doubt, that if ſhe had been injured at all, it was by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and not rape.</p>
               <p>I believe Gentlemen, it is time to ſlop on this head: The queſtion whether Miſs Sawyer's character is ſuch as to command belief, has been ſufficiently anſwered: Credulity itſelf cannot credit her improbable tale.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider her conduct ſubſequent to the violence of which ſhe complains. Did ſhe immediately purſue the offender? She tells us, though it is flatly contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mrs. Cary; ſhe ſaid to her <q>I will go out at the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>front door, and wiſh the firſt man I meet, may be my <g ref="char:endq">”</g>father or ſome other friend.</q> When ſhe was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely her own miſtreſs in the ſtreet, did ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? When Mr. Bedlow paſſed her, did ſhe call to the people paſſing, ſtop that raviſher? Surely ſhe did
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026513_0028_0FD083E7506714D8"/>
not want a father to redreſs an injury of this atrocious nature. Had ſhe mentioned it to a ſingle citizen, he would have immediately ſtopped the offender, and deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him into the hands of juſtice. Smarting with the violence ſhe had received; impreſſed with a deep and ſtrong s;enſe of her wrongs; one would hardly ſuppoſe ſhe could mildly ſuffer the wretch who cauſed them, to paſs her without complaint to the public. Inſtead of following what nature would dictate on ſuch an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how different her conduct. If delicacy had prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her complaining in the ſtreet, why did ſhe not go immediately home? Why direct her ſteps towards the bathing-houſe, and feat herſelf down by the ſide of the river? Had ſhe been ſeduced; had ſhe been overcome through the entreaties of the Priſoner at the Bar to conſent to her ruin, this would have been very natural; we might reaſonably ſuppoſe that a ſenſe of guilt had filled her parents in the face, ſhe had retired to ruminate on her crime in ſolitude. While ſhe was in this place, ſhe tells us of a very romantic ſcene; after which ſhe goes to her aunt's, to whom ſhe does not mention a ſingle word of what had paſſed. After loitering in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner throughout the whole day, ſhe in evening again enters the ſtreets. Here, Gentlemen, it is again neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to recur to the circumſtance of her going to the houſe of of Mrs. Cary the ſecond night; that explains the reaſon of her not going home this day, ſhe wiſhed to ſee Mr. Bedlow again; had ſhe gone to her father's, ſhe had reaſon to believe ſhe would have been prevented; but when ſhe went to Mrs. Cary's, finding him not there, ſhe began to ſuſpect he had done with her, and that home was her only refuge. An idea of a rape never entered her head; we find ſhe never mentioned it to any body, not even to her aunt; inſtead of making a hue and cry, ſhe again ſeeks the raviſher in the very houſe where ſhe had been raviſhed; not finding him
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026513_0029_0FD083C42BC92310"/>
there, ſhe then goes home; but to her mother, whom the ſays ſhe wiſhed to ſee firſt, ſhe mentions not a word; to Mrs. Harper, who kindly took her home, ſhe ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſilence; it is not till ſhe is in bed that any diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is made, and then a circumſtance occurs which clears up the whole myſtery; which ſufficiently accounts for the preſent proſecution. The curioſity of Mrs. Harper diſcovers the whole; ſhe finds from inſpection, the girl muſt have had connection with a man; tells her mother; the mother goes to the houſe; before ſhe hears a word, throws her daughter down, and the ſecret is diſcovered. The girl obliged to account for theſe appearances, to juſtify herſelf from theſe marks of guilt, to allay the wrath of her parents; invents this rape, which probably before never entered into her head; whence originates the preſent proſecution. Had it not been for the impertinent curioſity of Mrs. Harper, it would have reſted to this day in ſilence. After this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, five day elapſed before any proſecution, and no reaſon aſſigned for the delay. Another ſtrong mark of Mr. Bedlow's innocence is, his continuance in the city, walking about the ſtreets as uſual, perfectly unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuperintending a building of his father's, and even after hearing that a warrant was iſſued, going to the Mayor to proſecute the father of the girl for an aſſault. Was this a mark of conſcious guilt or of conſcious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence? Would a man who had actually committed a crime, the penalty of which was death, hear that a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was iſſued for his apprehenſion, go to a public ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and deliver himſelf into the hands of juſtice? Or would he fly?</p>
               <p>The laſt circumſtance laid down by Lord HALE, as diſcrediting the teſtimony of a Witneſs in theſe kind of proſecution is, <q>if the fact was committed where it was <g ref="char:startq">“</g>poſſible ſhe might have been heard, and ſhe made no <g ref="char:endq">”</g>outcry.</q> This is really the caſe in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Mrs. Cary's houſe has been proved to be a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026513_0030_0FD083E8D015D410"/>
mere ſhell; any noiſe in it muſt be heard by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; almoſt every word ſaid in one room muſt be heard in another; yet notwithſtanding the ſcreams of which the Proſecutrix has told us, none were heard by three people who lay in the ſame houſe; they all tell you they heard a talking and the laugh of a woman, who appeared perfectly ſatisfied and pleaſed. I directed Mr. M'Cready to meaſure the diſtance from room to room, from bed to bed, and the cloſeneſs of them is a convincing proof, that if a noiſe had been made, it muſt have been heard by the witneſſes. When Miſs Sawyer went out in the morning, did ſhe make any complaint to Mrs. Cary? Did ſhe ſay I have been injured in your houſe, I demand redreſs? No, ſhe appeared perfectly compoſed and ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>I now truſt, Gentlemen, when you conſider the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Proſecutrix, when you obſerve that it wants thoſe eſſential marks of truth which ought to ſtamp its credibility, you can ſcarcely entertain a ſerious doubt of Mr. Bedlow's innocence. When you weigh the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a girl whoſe intereſt it is to get the priſoner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, with that of thoſe who have no intereſt in getting him acquitted, you will determine on which ſide inclines the balance. Let impartiality and juſtice hold the beam, and my client has nothing to fear.</p>
               <p>Keep in mind the ſtrong intereſt which Miſs Sawyer has in the event. In common crimes, the intereſt of the proſecutor is little compared with hers. A man robbed of his watch, goes to a court of Juſtice, perhaps with it in his pocket, and teſtifies againſt the criminal for the ſake of juſtice alone. Even if he loſes his watch, the conſequence is trivial, a ſmall ſum of money replaces his loſs; but the woman who complains of a rape has more at ſtake, if ſhe does not ſucceed, her reputation and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter are irretrievably loſt, ſhe is ſhunned by her former deareſt connections, and life itſelf muſt become a burthen. To the motive of juſtice, ſhe ſuperadds the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026513_0031_0FD083C4FB48C9D0"/>
one of revenge; actuated by their united impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive force, ſhe leaves not a ſingle effort untried to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the priſoner's conviction. All the ſtories that malice and art can contrive, are ſpread into the world; the public voice is raiſed againſt the accuſed; any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wildneſs of character, or juvenile indiſcretion, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a general prejudice, and the unhappy man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned without being heard. The univerſal abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which men feel to the crime, involves an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſuppoſed criminal; the more charge of a rape is his condemnation. When you, Gentlemen of the Jury, conſider how eaſily this offence is charged; when you conſider the various motives which may actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a woman in its proſecution, you will not fail to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the evidence in the preſent caſe by the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have mentioned. You all know how ſtrong the paſſion of revenge exiſts in a female breaſt; a deſerted woman ſets no bounds to her anger. How probable is it that Miſs Sawyer finding Mr. Bedlow had no farther occaſion for her, and neglected to meet her on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night, filled with malice, meditated his deſtruction. The love of a woman is indeed intenſe; but when turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into hatred, the latter becomes equally intenſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this nature are not wanting in hiſtory—indeed the author from whom I quoted a paſſage in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe obſervations, relates two ſo very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that it will be proper to recite them: <q>It is <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>true</q> ſays Lord Hale, <q>that rape is a moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <g ref="char:startq">“</g>crime, and therefore ought ſeverely and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be puniſhed with death; but it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that it is an accuſation eaſy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accuſed, though innocent. I ſhall never forget a trial before myſelf of a rape in the country of Suſſex. There had been one of that country, convicted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for a rape in that country, before ſome other judges, about three aſſizes before,&amp; I ſuppoſe very juſtly.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026513_0032_0FD083EA53444428"/>
Some malicious people ſeeing how eaſy it was to make out ſuch an accuſation, and how difficult it was for the party accuſed to clear himſelf, furniſhed the two aſſizes following with many indictments, wherein the parties accuſed, with ſome difficulty eſcaped. At the ſecond aſſizes following, there was an ancient wealthy man of about 63 years old, indicted for a rape, which was fully ſworn againſt him, by a young girl of 14 years old, and a concurrent teſtimony of her mother and father, and ſome other relations. The ancient man when he came to his defence, alledged that it was true the fact was ſworn, and it was not poſſible for him to produce witneſſes to the negative; but yet he ſaid his very age carried a great preſumption that he could not be guilty of that crime, but yet he had one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance more, that he believed would ſatisfy the court and jury that he neither was nor could be guilty; and being demanded what that was, he had for about ſeven years laſt paſt, he ſaid been afflicted with a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo hideous and great, that it was impoſſible he could carnally know any woman, neither had he upon that account carnally known his own wife, and offered to ſhow the ſame openly in court, which for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency of it I declined, but appointed the jury to withdraw into ſome room to inſpect this unuſual evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; they accordingly did ſo, and came back, and gave an account of it to the court, that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he ſhould have to do with any woman in that kind, much leſs to commit a rape, for all his bowels ſeemed to be fallen down in thoſe parts, that they could ſcarce diſcern his privities, the rupture being full as big as the crown of a hat; whereupon he was acquitted. Again at Northampton aſſizes, before one of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtices, upon the <hi>niſi prius,</hi> a man was indicted for the rape of two young girls, not above 14 years old, the younger ſomewhat leſs; and the rapes fully proved, though peremptorily denied by the priſoner;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026513_0033_0FD083C735E1C320"/>
he was therefore to the ſatisfaction of the judge and jury convicted; but before judgment it was moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently diſcovered, that it was but a malicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, and the party innocent, he was therefore reprieved before judgment. I mention theſe inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we may be the more cautious upon trials of offences of this nature; wherein the court and jury may with much eaſe be impoſed upon, without great care and vigilance. The heinouſneſs of the offence many times tranſporting the judge and jury with ſo much indignation, that they are overhaſtily carried to the conviction of the party accuſed thereof, by the confident teſtimony of ſometimes falſe and malicious <g ref="char:endq">”</g>witneſſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ſays lord HALE, and thus ſays reaſon. But Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I haſten to conclude; theſe inſtances need no comment; by this time you well underſtand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of this charge; you ſee the proſecutrix in her true colours; you diſcover her ſecret ſprings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and can have no heſitation to acquit the Priſoner. You cannot require deliberation, the caſe is ſo plain, and I truſt your minds will be made up, and Mr. Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's innocence determined by a verdict given without quitting the bar. The prejudices againſt the Priſoner muſt now be diſmiſſed, and this honorable acquittal you owe to juſtice, for the purpoſe of clearing his character to the public, and of ſhowing the world that you have not a ſhadow of doubt of his having never committed the crime. Renew to him the reputation deſtroyed through malice, by this honorable teſtimony in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, by acquitting him without leaving the bar.</p>

               <p>THIS cauſe no doubt will be diſcuſſed with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eloquence by the Gentlemen on the oppoſite ſide. They will atempt to awaken your paſſions and feelings
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026513_0034_0FD083EBCA5B2750"/>
in behalf of the youthful Proſecutrix. For my part, Gentlemen, I conſider the innocence of the priſoner ſo plain, that did I poſſeſs the powers of eloquence, I ſhould not uſe them on this occaſion. Reaſon is ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having recourſe to the paſſions to acquit the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this ſcandalous yet inconſiſtent charge.</p>
               <p>I cannot but conſider it as peculiarly fortunate for Mr. Bedlow, that he is a ſubject of a free country; of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whoſe laws, attentive to the preſervation of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from a malignant proſecution, has wiſely provided that no man ſhall be deprived of life, unleſs by the judgment of twelve of his fellow-citizens. Had this happened in a deſpotic country, the enormity of the crime might have haſtily tranſported the judges to find the Priſoner guilty, without a fair and impartial trial. He might not have been permitted a thorough inveſtigation into the affair, and perhaps his life would have fallen a victim to malice. But happily, Gentlemen of the Jury, he ſtands before you, his peers and his equals, and depends upon your oath to find a verdict according to evidence.</p>
               <p>Rape is a crime perhaps the moſt enormous in human ſociety. The man who dares forcibly to violate female honor; who dares thus to inſult a ſex whom it is his duty to defend, deſerves the greateſt puniſhment which the vengeance of man can inflict. Rape is a crime indeed which poiſons the ſweeteſt ſprings of human happineſe. The enormity of its guilt however induces a preſumption in favor of the Priſoner at the Bar; common charity will not let us ſuppoſe him this abandoned wretch, unleſs the proof is as clear as the open face of day. The more abominable the crime, the leſs probability there is of its having been committed. This reflection, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury, will make you conſider the evidence in ſupport of the proſecution, with the greateſt degree of caution; will make you call for the cleareſt teſtimony, are you deprive a fellow-citizen of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:026513_0035_0FD07E23B97FF0B0"/>It has been well obſerved by the Gentleman v ſpoke laſt, that ſeduction, and not rape, is the crime with which Mr. Bedlow ſhould have been charged. View the whole of Miſs Sawyer's narration from beginning to end, and what can you pronounce, but that ſhe fell an eaſy prey to the ſeducing arts of the Priſoner at the Bar? I cannot indeed. Gentlemen of the Jury, excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate him from all degree of blame; neither can I from the whole of the evidence, collect a ſingle circumſtance which appears to evince that the Proſecutrix was forced againſt her will. This material eſſence of a rape is wanting in proof; it cannot be collected from any part of the teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Lord HALE, in the paſſage judiciouſly quoted by Mr. LIVINGSTON, tells us that though the party injured is in law a competent witneſs of the rape, yet that her evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt be taken with many grains of allowance. The character of the Proſecutrix muſt be pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed; if the fact happened in a place where ſhe could have been heard, ſhe muſt have made all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries in her power; after ſhe was at liberty, ſhe muſt have made immediate complaint of the outrage; if theſe circumſtances are wanting, the credibility of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix is deſtroyed; and unfortunately for Miſs Sawyer, they are indeed wanting in the preſent inſtance. Though Mr. LIVINGSTON has entered very fully into an examination of Miſs Sawyer's teſtimony by theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and though your patience may be nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with the extreme length of this trial, yet the importance of the ſubject to the Priſoner, and the ſafety of his life, will excuſe my going again through the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and placing it in the light which truth and juſtice requires; of making his innocence manifeſt.</p>
               <p>As to the character of Miſs Sawyer, this is pretended to be eſtabliſhed by a multitude of Witneſſes, who have told you a great deal of her prudence, diſcretion, and modeſty; but who are theſe Witneſſes? An obſcure
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026513_0036_0FD083EDA95A8C40"/>
ſet of people, perhaps of no character themſelves. We know none of them, and the very girls who have teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in behalf of the Proſecutrix, require teſtimony in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their own reputation. But after we have heard ſo much of this prudence and diſcretion, it is aſtonishing we ſee nose of it in her conduct towards the priſoner. Her very ſtory gives her witneſſes the lie, and is in fact a ſcene of indiſcretion and imprudence, from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement to the concluſion. Was it prudent to pick up a man in the ſtreets and become inſtantly acquainted with him? To meet him again and make an aſſignation for another evening? Was it diſcreet to go on the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with this ſtranger, and amuſe herſelf with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond midnight? After theſe confeſſions, let us bury the idea of her diſcretion and prudence; let us put no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in witneſſes who are contradicted by the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix herſelf.</p>
               <p>The improbability and ſometimes impoſſibility of the ſtory, is a convincing proof of Miſs Sawyer's not being worthy of credit; that malice is the foundation of her charge, and falſhood the ſuperſtructure. She tells us that Mr. Bedlow dragged her through the ſtreets at a late hour of the night, notwithſtanding her ſcreams. Can you ſuppoſe, Gentlemen of the Jury, that at this ſtill hour of the night, the ſcreams of a woman who was in danger of being raviſhed, would not have been heard?

               <p>It has been proved by Mrs. Cary;—but before I mention her evidence let me remark, that though much may be ſaid againſt her general character, yet on this occaſion her credibility ought not to be impeached. She Can have no temptation to come into a court of juſtice, and deliberately to ſwear to a falſhood. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  </gap>ath. I ſay it has been proved by Mrs. Cary, that the garden gate on the back of her houſe was faſtened on the evening of this affair, by a ſtrong latch and a nail; yet the Proſecutrix has aſſerted that Mr. Bedlow having hold of her hand, drew her along, he walking backwards, and ſhoved open this gate with his back. This was impoſſible, he muſt have jumped over the fence to unfaſten the gate, and Miſs Sawyer muſt have willingly waited till this was done: Inſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this opportunity to make her eſcape, ſhe abides, and voluntarily conſents to her own rain. Theſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently mark the features of the proſecution.</p>
               <p>As to the outcries, ſhe was in a place where the leaſt noiſe muſt have been heard; ſhe herſelf tells you ſhe ſcreamed, but this is flatly contradicted by three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the ſame houſe; they all tell you they heard the Proſecutrix and Priſoner converſe together in a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner; that they heard a woman's voice; and that when ſhe came out in the morning, ſatisfaction and compoſure appeared on her countenance. But a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtronger ſtill, is not to be forgotten; theſe loud ſcreams were not capable of awakening a child who lay in the ſame room, ſcarcely two feet from the bed. The Proſecutrix has owned that the child continued aſleep. Gentlemen, need I comment on this fact? Need I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make that plainer which is ſo extremely plain? Need I aſk you what outcry, what ſtruggles could a woman make, when this child was not awakened?</p>
               <p>Let us now attend to the conduct of the Proſecutrix when ſhe left the houſe of Mrs. Cary. One would have ſuppoſed a women who had been injured in ſuch an atrocious manner, would have flown immediately to her friends, have diſcloſed her wrongs, and had proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures purſued to arreſt the offender. Inſtead of this, we view the Proſecutrix coolly walking through the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026513_0038_0FD083EECC6BDAF8"/>
ſtreets; inſtead of going home, directing her ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north-river, and at laſt repoſing herſelf by the bathing-houſe. Can there be a ſtronger proof of her feeling herſelf a willing party in the ſcene that had been acted the night before. Shame, Gentlemen of the Jury, is ever attendant on guilt; fear, and ſhunning the ſight of the world, are ſtrong marks of criminality. The miſery which this unhappy girl had brought on herſelf; the loſs of her chaſtity; her continuance out all night; the probability of being diſcarded by her friends, and of being thrown into the wide world, bereft of the means of ſupporting her future exiſtence, muſt now become objects of contemplation, and ſolitude was ſought to deviſe the means of averting theſe horrors. Here, perhaps, the idea of rape firſt occurred, to ſave herſelf from impending ruin, wiſhing firſt to ſee her ſeducer, with whom ſhe might accommodate and prevent recourſe to this diabolical meaſure. This was probably the idea which brought her the ſecond night to the houſe of Mrs. Cary; not meeting with Mr. Bedlow there, ſhe went home, determined to juſtify herſelf by pretending ſhe was forced. This accounts for the extreme back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs ſhe had in relating her ſtory to her friends. Though ſhe ſaw her mother on the firſt night; though ſhe was treated with kindneſs by her couſin Mrs. Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſtill the pretended violence is concealed; not a word is mentioned till an examination has made appearances ſo ſtrong againſt her, that her only alternative is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit herſelf of blame by inventing a rape. The threat of being turned out of doors by her father, conveyed to her ears by her mother, urges the neceſſity of this falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. By this means ſhe impoſes on her parents; partial to their child; not willing to deem her guilty; the Priſoner becomes the object of their vengeance, and ſtands charged before you with this enormous crime.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of theſe circumſtances, Gentlemen of the Jury, muſt influence you in favor of the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

To ſuppoſe him guilty, you muſt believe what never could have happened; you muſt credit the moſt abſurd inconſiſtencies, and ſuppoſe falſhood to be truth.

               <p>THIS caſe has been ſo fully argued by the gentlemen who have preceded me, that it is perfectly unneceſſary now to enter into a minute detail of the evidence. I ſhall fulfil my duty as Counſel for the Priſoner, in going through ſuch material parts as evince his innocence, and offering ſome additional obſervations to thoſe adduced by the Counſel on the ſame ſide with myſelf.</p>
               <p>The evident indiſcretion of the Proſecutrix, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by her own narrative, affords a circumſtance ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong to found the concluſion, that ſhe had as much deſire as the Priſoner at the Bar to conſent to his wiſhes.

muſt have ſeen that luſt and nothing elſe was his only aim. Thus acquainted with his views, ſhe ſtill permits his attentions, and ſtays with him till an extreme late hour in the night, ſtrolling through the ſtreets, and up and down the battery. Gentlemen of the Jury, is it Probable that a girl who had thus abandoned the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of her chaſtity, and left every paſs to it unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be long in ſurrendering the citadel? Would a girl who appears to have been ſo kind and yielding, ſo complying with the deſires of the Priſoner in every other inſtance, have heſitated in granting him his laſt wiſh?</p>
               <p>The very deſcription which Miſs Sawyer has given us of this pretended rape, is a convincing proof that it wants the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to conſtitute a crime of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anner of her acquaintance with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; her indiſcretion throughout the whole of her behavior to him, affords a ſtrong preſemption of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> conduct confirms this preſumption; may, renders it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap>table. She tells us in the act of which the complains that Mr. Bedlow did not uſe his right hand; and if he did not, how he could force her, is inexplicable. For gentlemen, I believe you are pretty well convinced, that to force a woman, the right hand is abſolutely neceſſary. This circumſtance muſt induce you to pay little credit to a ſtory which carries on the face of it ſush an impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>Another aſtoniſhing part of the teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix, is that wherein ſhe mentions the ſcreams to which the had recourſe, as a means of obtaining aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. This is expreſsly contradicted by the teſtimony of there witneſſes on the part of the Priſoner, and not one brought forward to confirm it. It is true, great ſtreſs will be laid on the general bad character of theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; it will probably be ſaid that little credit is due to their evidence. But had theſe ſcreams in fact been made, how eaſy would it have been to have produced
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026513_0041_0FD083CD10A36640"/>
witneſſes who had heard them. Mrs. Cary's houſe has been proved to be a mere ſhell; the people in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide can generally hear all that paſſes in the ſtreet. I am credibly informed that the adjoining houſe is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by an induſtrious mechanic and family, who muſt have heard the outcry of a woman on the point of being raviſhed. At this time you will recollect that the ſteeple of the brick meeting was repairing; the workmen were there at a very early hour of the morning; how eaſy would it have been to have fought out ſome of theſe people, and have brought them to confirm theſe ſcreams having been made, if they had heard them? As this has not been done, we have a right to preſume that this part of Miſs Sawyer's teſtimony has foundation in truth.</p>
               <p>Another ſtrong circumſtance of diſcredit to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix's evidence, is her going the night after the affair happened to the houſe of Mrs. Cary, and enquiring for Mr. Bedlow. This indeed ſhe has poſitively contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon oath, but the evidence of the fact too ſtrong to ſuffer you to doubt it. It is not Mrs. Cary alone who proves it; but it is expreſsly confirmed by Mrs. M'Faul, and her character is not impeached. It appears that Mrs. Cary is her relation, keeps her child, and that ſhe accidentally came to the houſe that evening, ſaw Miſs Sawyer there, knew her from having ſeen her before, and confirms Mrs. Cary's relation, in every particle. We may perhaps be told that on this night one witneſs has proved that Miſs Sawyer left a houſe in Broadway, near ſeven o'clock, and that another witneſs has proved ſhe was at a houſe in George-Street about ſeven. But gentlemen, when you conſider how eaſy it is to miſtake half an hour or an hour of time, and that the witneſſes probably compute by gueſs, without referring to a time piece, it is eaſily conceived that the Proſecutrix might find an interval in her way from Broadway to George-Street, to call in at Mrs. Cary's. If this is poſſible, you ought to infer it, for we muſt reconcile teſtimony when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026513_0042_0FD083F289AA9C00"/>
we can, to prevent the preſumption of perjury. That crime is too odious to be preſumed.</p>
               <p>From all the facts on this trial, even thoſe diſcloſed by the Proſecutrix herſelf, I truſt it ſufficiently appears that the charge of a rape is unjuſtly founded. No force can be traced; the conſent Miſs Sawyer may fairly be preſumed from her conduct. How far ſhe may have been ſeduced by the Priſoner at the Bar, or won over by intreaty to conſent to his deſires is a queſtion not for me to determine; but if the facts in that light appear, let them be ever ſo ſtrong, they never will amount to a proof of the crime with which the Priſoner is now charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whatever other puniſhment he may deſerve, the laws of this country do not for that, incur a forfeiture of his life. In any point of view therefore, Gentlemen of the Jury, I truſt your verdict will acquit the Priſoner on the preſent charge of rape.</p>

               <p>IT now remains for me to cloſe the defence of the Priſoner at the Bar, and at this late hour of the night, you are probably willing to excuſe any farther obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the ſubject.

               <p>Our principal enquiries are, what is the crime with which the Priſoner is charged? And does the evidence prove him guilty of that offence?</p>

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026513_0043_0FD083CEA3383470"/>
is then ſimply, whether the Proſecutrix has ſatisfactorily proved the force and a want of her conſent? This muſt be collected from the credibility of the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix; the probability of her ſtory; her ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and that of the Priſoner. Theſe topics have been ſo well discussed already, that I ſhall confine myſelf to remarks on the principal features of the evidence, ſince by this time I truſt the innocence of Mr. Bedlow is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Some young people have teſtified that they eſteem Miſs Sawyer to be a modeſt, diſcreet and prudent girl; but the youthful appearance of theſe witneſſes, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame condition of life with the Proſecutrix, gives us a right to doubt what they mean by theſe terms. Accuſtomed to levity, to allowing male friends liberties, they may eſteem this conſiſtent with modeſty. What they term diſcretion and prudence, may by people of more mature judgment, be termed the higheſt indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the higheſt imprudence. It is well known that ſome girls frequently conſider the permiſſion of thoſe liberties innocent, which in fact lay them open eaſy victims of ſeduction. Thoughtleſſneſs and inexperience in the arts of mankind, give a wrong colouring to the ideas of youth; and lead them to indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions cretions which pride will not permit them to call by a right name. Theſe conſiderations lead me to conſider the conduct of the Proſecutrix in the melancholy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair which has led her ſo unadviſedly into a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice on the preſent charge. She appears to be highly imprudent in continuing her clandeſtine acquaintance with the Priſoner, after the warning ſhe had received from the neighbour, that he had impoſed upon her by perſonating a falſe character. Surely had ſhe a ſpark of prudence, ſhe would never have truſted herſelf alone with a man at a late hour of the night, whom ſhe had reaſon to believe had deceived her, for the purpoſe of cloaking a diſhonorable intention. Throughout the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026513_0044_0FD083F40CF97CC8"/>
whole of her intimacy with the Priſoner, the infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which led her on to ruin, is too apparent to leave us room to believe that the force uſed by the Priſoner to accompliſh his ends, was of that kind which is neceſſary to conſtitute a rape. On the very night of the affair, ſhe does not pretend to have ſtruggled much with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; the ſcreams which ſhe uttered were not loud enough to awaken a child in the ſame room. Some degree of force, Gentlemen of the Jury, poſſibly might have been uſed by the Priſoner at the Bar; but it was a force only to ſave the delicacy and feelings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix. Any woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not an abandoned Proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, will appear to be averſe to what ſhe inwardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; a virtuous girl upon the point of yielding, will not appear to give a willing conſent, though her manner ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evinces her wiſhes. But it is not this kind of force which can be ſaid to conſtitute a rape. It is not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent refuſal or the feigned ſtraggles uſed as a veil for delicacy, which the law con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted when it made death the puniſhment of a rape. It had in view the brutal violator of female innocence; not the ſeducer who had recourſe to entreaty, perſuaſion, and apparent force, but the raviſher, who ſcoring the uſe of theſe means, at once had recourſe to ſtrength, and notwithſtanding the real reſiſtance and loud ſcreams of an unwilling woman, unwilling in heart as well as in ſhow, perpetrated the deteſtable crime. This is the man who juſtly deſerves to loſe his life. This is the man to whom the law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its terrors, and declares no longer ſit to live in ſociety. But the bare ſeducer. though criminal, is not ſubjected to this; the greateſt puniſhment which man can inflict. Had the Proſecutrix and her friends been well adviſed, they would have had recourſe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mode pointed out by the law for her relief. They would have commenced a civil action, and have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a compenſation in damages for the ſeduction of the Proſecutrix; it is the purſe and not the life of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner which they can affect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:026513_0045_0FD083D15DAC34E8"/>some of the witneſſes on the proſecution, have depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that marks of violence appeared on the linen of Miſs Sawyer, after the affair. But you will, gentleman of the Jury, remember the witneſſes explained their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſaying that theſe marks were ſuch as indicated that the girl had loſt her virginity. So that no proof of a rape can be inferred from this teſtimony. If the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix has been ſeduced, and not raviſhed, the ſame conſequence would have enſued. The diſcolouring of her linen is the natural effect of her firſt connection with a man.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not, Gentlemen of the Jury, urge any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on this ſubject; I am confident you know the ſolemn obligation which your oath impoſes on you, of bringing in a verdict according to evidence. I am confident you will ſee none adduced on the preſent occaſion, capable of maintaining the charge of a rape againſt the Priſoner at the Bar. You will not ſuffer poſitive teſtimony which is flatly improbable, to induce you to deprive a fellow-citizen of life. I am ſenſible, in the courſe of theſe obſervations, I have made uſe of many arguments which have been mentioned before: but repetition is excuſable on this important occaſion.</p>

               <p>Much has been ſaid againſt the character of Miſs Sawyer; ſtrongly have the counſel on the other ſide, endeavoured to diſcredit her testimony; but the very ſources from which they have drawn their arguments againſt her, afford a convincing proof of the artleſs ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of her ſtory. The appearance of the girl; the tnedeſt manner in which ſhe deliverd her evidence; the effect it had upon her feelings; all forcibly ſtruck me, Gentlemen, and I truſt it did you, with the opinion that truth, and nothing elſe, flowed from her lips. Her very indiſcretions, which the counſel for the Priſoner tell you impeach her credibility, ſhe openly and unaſked revealed to you.

                  </gap>equer of indiſcretion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence which is a forcible mark of its truth. You find bar narration the ſame at all times. She relates it to her mother, then to her father, and when ſhe comes into court and relates it again upon oath, her friends and relations tell you it is the ſame ſhe told to them. She preſerves a uniform conſiſtency; ſhe does not vary from her tale a ſingle iota; and in itſelf it appears highly probable. Every part of her teſtimony which could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive confirmation, has been confirmed. The informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe received from Mr. Hone, relative to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Priſoner at the Bar, he repeats in the ſame words, omitting what I have mentioned. Her viſit to her aunt, the time ſhe stayed there, is proved by another witneſs; her calling on Miſs Pine, and at what time, is ſufficiently proved by ſeveral creditable people; and in ſhort there is no ſingle part of her teſtimony, which came under the eye of people of reputation, but what is ſtrongly confirmed. The only dark part is that, where unfortunate for her, none but the moſt abandoned of their ſex could be witneſſes; here we meet with what we muſt naturally expect from people of this deſcription; a total contradiction to Miſs Sawyer's evidence. Here the queſtion occurs, which are to be believed? An art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſimple girl who never varies from her tale; a girl whoſe character is proved to be fair and unblemiſhed; or women whoſe conſtant life is a ſcene of iniquity and guilt? Woman of the moſt infamous occupations, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the deſtruction of the innocent, or in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of themſelves by proſtitution? Obſerve too the ſtory of Mrs. Cary; before the father of the girl, and his honor the Mayor, ſhe tells one thing; in this court ſhe tells another. But ſay the counſel for the Priſoner at ſhe Bar, when ſhe denied what ſhe now diſcloſes, ſhe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026513_0048_0FD083F8886B3E30"/>
was not upon oath, and prudence obliged her to conceal the truth. Is this a juſtification, Gentlemen of the Jury? Is this the witneſs who is brought forward to diſcredit the teſtimony of a reputable girl? Can you believe, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that a woman who dares to tell a lie before a public Magiſtrate, will ſcruple at perjury? Can you put confidence in that abandoned wretch whoſe notorious infamy, ought, long ere this, to have made her a ſevere example to public juſtice. For my part, Gentlemen of the Jury, I would as ſoon put faith in the moſt glaring inconſiſtencies, as in the oath of her who would deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately lie with an intent to deceive. I truſt, notwith-ſtanding all that has been ſaid in favor of the witneſſes adduced on behalf of the Priſoner at the Bar, you will not ſuffer their teſtimony to give you one ſcruple in the affair.</p>
               <p>The reſiſtance of the Proſecutrix, and her outcries; the brutal force which ſhe experienced from Mr. Bedlow, are all facts which ſtand in the teſtimony of Miſs Sawyer uncontrover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It has been contended that the want of an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate complaint and purſuit, affords an inference in favor of the Priſoner's innocence. It has been ſaid that nature would have dictated the Proſecutrix to have made an hue-and-cry in the ſtreets, after the Priſoner, and have cauſed him to be inſtantly arreſted. When you conſider the delicacy of the girl's ſituation, you certainly will ſay that ſuch conduct would not have been natural. There is a ſtory in the Roman Hiſtory, which ſnows the dictates of nature on a ſimilar occaſion. You are all well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Hiſtory of Lucretia.</p>

               <p>It has been ſaid down, that a witneſs entitled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in a charge of this nature, ought to be of ſpotleſs ſame. The character of Miſs Sawyer, Gentlemen of the Jury, has been thoroughly eſtabliſhed as, pure and undefiled. A number of decent and Creditable people have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>tified, that ſhe has always beene the reputation of being modeſt, diſcreet, and prudent; that ſhe never kept much company; and that they never obſerved in her any room for cenſure. One of there witneſſes dwelt in the ſame houſe with her for the ſpace of two months, was in the habit of intimacy with her, yet never ſaw her guilty of any indiscretion. Surely, gentlemen, had ſhe been this light, this inconsiderate girl, as the counſel for the Priſoner have endeavoured to perſuade you, ſhe could never have been ſo circumſpect as to conceal it from a female friend who was conſtantly with her during two months. Had ſhe been indiſcreet and imprudent, it muſt
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026513_0050_0FD08403CBF128D0"/>
have been known to her intimates; we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> diſcover the ſmalleſt bolt in the character of a man or woman, and with the help of ſcandal eaſily magnify it into a crime of deeper dye. But imprudence and indiſcretion are of ſuch a nature, that if they exiſt, they muſt appear abroad; their very being depends alone on apparent conduct. How can the woman who regulates herſelf by a ſtrict attention to the prudential duties in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the world, be eſteemed imprudent? To ſay that ſhe muſt be ſo eſteemed, is a ſoleciſm in reaſon and in language. Evidence alone is our guide; when we depart from that, we wander into obſcurity. But the counſel ſay, ſetting aſide this evidence of character, Miſs Sawyer's indiſcretion is apparent from her own relation. Before I proceed to anſwer this objection, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that if ſhe was ſo imprudent, it does not impeach her teſtimony. She might have been thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in relying too much upon the Priſoner's honor; but it does not follow that ſhe has taken a falſe oath; you have no right from this to preſume that ſhe has perjured herſelf.</p>
               <p>But where are the marks of this indiſcretion? From a candid inveſtigation of Miſs Sawyer's ſtory, there are none to be collected. Through the natural ſimplicity of youth; through inexperience in the wiles of mankind; ſhe may probably have placed too great a confidence in the Priſoner at the Bar; but this, inſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, encreaſes his guilt. It only proves that he made uſe of her ſecurity in his honor, to get her more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his power. The counſel have called her firſt acquaintance with the Priſoner, a circumſtance of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; but recollect the occaſion which gave riſe to this acquaintance; ſhe was inſulted in the ſtreet by Frenchmen; Mr. Bedlow came to her aſſiſtance, reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and politely attended her home, to preſerve her from further inſult. Could ſhe refuſe his offer? Could
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026513_0051_0FD083FAF6E9C8F8"/>
ſhe ungratefully tell the man who had exerted himſelf in her behalf, to leave her, that ſhe would not ſpeak to him? Or, did not nature and gratitude dictate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhe really purſued? On the following Sunday ſhe met him again, he accoſted her; would the Priſoner's counſel have had her ſpurn at her generous defender, and have her treated his attentions with ſcorn? Would they have had her ſuppoſe that the man who had evinced his regard for the protection of the Fair, in his behaviour to herſelf, meditated deſigns againſt her honor? Recollect too the art of the Priſoner, he impoſed on her by a falſe name, Iawyer Smith. She preſumed him to be a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, not of looſe character with reſpect to women. But why was ſhe thus deceived? Why not liſten to Mr. Hone when he told her it was Harry Bedlow? The anſwer is at hand; not ſuppoſing from the conduct of the Priſoner towards her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k with his importunity, recollecting that this was a man to whom ſhe was highly indebted for his friendly aſſiſtance; her gratitude oppoſed her prudence, and ſhe replied ſhe was not then engaged; but obſerve, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſhe made no promiſe or appointment to take this walk. Her walking with him on the Wedneſday evening following, was not owing to any promiſe, but to a circumſtance which has been as induſtriouſly kept out of ſight by the Priſoner's counſel, and not adverted, to by the gentleman who preceded me on the part of the proſecution. The Priſoner finding he could not gain her conſent to go, has recourſe to a ſcheme, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for Miſs Sawyer, ſucceeds. On this Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026513_0052_0FD084054C14ED10"/>
evening he goes to her, requeſts her to walk, and tells her that Miſs Steddiford (with whom ſhe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted) and a gentleman, will accompany them. The Proſecutrix thinking no harm could ariſe to her, when in the company of ſo many, and with Miſs Steddiford, very naturally conſents to go. Before I proceed, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I cannot help remarking the ſuperior art with which the Priſoner conducted the whole ſcheme, and from thence, drawing a ſtrong proof of his guilt. In the whole affair, he acted as a man who meditated a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous deſign. In his firſt acquaintance with Miſs Sawyer, he perſonates the character of another man; in the proſecution of his intention, he deludes the girl with the falſhood that Miſs Steddiford would accompany them in order to get her out. But we have been told than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this might be, and yet the Priſoner meant no farther than ſeduction. The intention, however, gentlemen, is beſt judged from the concluſion of the ſtory. All theſe arts evince the intentions of a man to go the greateſt length in the accompliſhment of his wiſhes; and accompanied with the actual proof of force, ſhow the perfidious capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Priſoner, to uſe all means, however attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, to effectuate his purpoſes. The man who will ſeduce, will raviſh if opportunity ſerves; for we know of no bounds that can be ſet to the lawleſs irregularities of ſenſual deſire.</p>
               <p>But I return to the evidence—having thus artfully got the Proſecutrix out, he takes her to Mr. Steddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's; but, (as probably the Priſoner knew before) Miſs Steddiford was from home. Mr. Bedlow then ſuggeſts they had gone to the Battery, and under this pretence, ſhe is led to continue the walk. On the way, he perſuades her to go into Corre's and take ſome ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cream; nothing could be improper in this, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. When they quitted this place, it has been ſaid that propriety would have made her turn homewards, had not the Priſoner hinted that Miſs Steddiford had
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026513_0053_0FD083FC4A550CD0"/>
gone to the battery? Was it not very natural then, for the Proſecutrix to go that way in ſearch of her? After walking ſometime on the battery, ſhe for the firſt time hears a clock, and counts twelve; this alarms her, but the Priſoner allays her apprehenſions, by ſaying it was only ten. What follows? She, upon the ſuppoſition it was only ten, thinks it too late for her to be out, and they go immediately into the way home. Entering Broadway, they meet three watchmen, who, to the queſtion of Bedlow, ſay it was near one o'clock. Here it has been ſaid, that the Proſecutrix ought to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to theſe watchman, and put herſelf under their protection. Why? No rudeneſs had then been offered to her; the intentions of the Priſoner had not then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they were then on the way towards her home. It would have been abſurd to complain without occaſion. The circumſtance of the Priſoner's aſking the watchmen the time, it has been ſaid ſhews that he had no intention to deceive. This, however, was the conſequence of cunning; ſuppoſing the Proſecutrix would natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly aſk the hour, he anticipated her, and thought by this pretended fairneſs, to allay her ſuſpicions, and not to loſe her confidence. He might upon ſecond thought ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that her knowledge of the lateneſs of the hour would promote his deſigns; that ſhe being alarmed, probably ſuppoſing ſhe was ſhut out, would the more willingly go to a houſe.</p>
               <p>On their reaching Ann-Street, the Priſoner kept tight hold of her, and wanted her to turn down there—ſhe knowing it to be a bad place, refuſed. She then, (and not till then) ſuſpected his baſeneſs. What was her conduct then? Screams, and all the reſiſtance in her power. Why were not thoſe ſcreams heard? She tells you he ſtopped her mouth. He drags her on to Mrs. Cary's door; the counſel for the Priſoner have talked of the impoſſibility of his holding her in the manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and knocking at the door. This is not a fact,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026513_0054_0FD08406CFF4AFB0"/>
when at the door he left her, to knock at it; this is evinced by her eſcaping three ſeveral times: At laſt he forces her to the back way into this houſe. But was it poſſible for the Priſoner to drag Miſs Sawyer thus? Had he ſtrength equal to the talk? Her age, her ſex, her fears, her alarms, all account for her want of ſtrength; ſhe tells you, beſides, that with the force of the Priſoner ſhe was quite exhauſted.</p>
               <p>Thus far, Gentlemen of the Jury, it appears that the conduct of the Proſecutrix <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> been in no inſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. Hitherto, prudence and diſcretion have been her guides. She was brought into the room where the fact was perpetrated, by a combination of art and force, againſt her will. Let us attend to what follows: The Priſoner finding his prey in his power, exulting in the ſucceſs of his ſchemes, now ſeizes the unhappy victim; forcibly tears off her cloaths, and accompliſhes his diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ſcheme. It appears from the teſtimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutrix, that ſhe did not know what the Priſoner did with his right hand. One of the counſel catching at this circumſtance, has ingeniouſly twiſted it, and aſked how it was poſſible for the Priſoner to exerciſe this force without uſing his right hand. But, gentlemen, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſituation of the Priſoner; the whole weight of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> on the Proſecutrix, his left arm acroſs her throat, ſhe was incapable of motion or reſiſtance: She then ſays, not that he did not uſe his right hand, but that ſhe did not know what he did with it. There is no doubt, gentleman, of its being uſed, you can conceive in what manner, though from her innocence ſhe could not.</p>
               <p>From all this, Gentlemen, I cannot but conclude, that the whole of the evidence of the Proſecutrix is highly natural and probable; that no indiſcretions appear in her conduct; that what has been termed imprudence, was really unſuſpicious innocence, and that her character and good ſame ſtands confirmed by the evidence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:026513_0055_0FD083FDCA32E2B8"/>Another circumſtance, Gentlemen of the Jury, which ſupports the teſtimony of a Proſecutrix in a crime of this nature, is, if the fact was committed in a place where ſhe might have been heard, and made outcries.—Miſs Sawyer was in this ſituation, and has poſitively ſworn that ſhe repeatedly ſcreamed aloud for help, and nobody came to her aſſiſtance. But ſhe was conſtantly ſtopped by the Priſoner, who laid his hand upon her mouth and laughed aloud, to prevent her being heard. In oppoſition to this part of the teſtimony, evidence has been introduced—the <hi>reſpectable</hi> Mrs. Cary, and the <hi>Ladies</hi> of her houſe. The diſtances from room to room have been accurately meaſured; they were ſo near, the ſcreams muſt have been within ear-ſhot, and yet none of theſe <hi>credible</hi> witneſſes heard the leaſt noiſe or tokens of violence. Gentlemen, need I ſay a word to induce you to diſmiſs every particle of this teſtimony from your minds? Can you believe ſuch people? But the counſel for the Priſoner have ſeriouſly ſupported them as entitled to belief. It is ſaid no motive can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thoſe women to perjure themſelves on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But, Gentlemen, the ſtrongeſt of motives muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Mrs. Cary to come forward; the future <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of her houſe, and her own ſafety in obtaining the Priſoner's acquittal. The women of her houſe, have with her a <hi>common intereſt;</hi> their character in life, their daily habits of guilt, have long ſince bereft them of the terrors of conſcience; and words and oaths are with them but wind. Abandoned to every ſpecies of vide, how can you expect their adherance to truth? An unſpotted witneſs has declared ſhe made theſe outcries; theſe people declare they heard them not; but the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, and not the number of witneſſes, ought to be your guide. It was obſerved of the Proſecutrix, that on one occaſion ſhe was willingly deaf. This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may with much more propriety be applied to Mrs. Cary and her <hi>creatures;</hi> it was improper for them to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026513_0056_0FD084084BDB9D30"/>
hear theſe outcries; a ſudden deafneſs ſeized them, and in telling you they did not hear, they have the audacity to ſport with the ſolemnity of an oath.</p>
               <p>In ſupporting the evidence of theſe people, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for the Priſoner have departed from their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; have completely confuted their own arguments. To determine whether Mrs. Cary and her <hi>train</hi> are to be believed or not, we have only to recur to the ground on which the teſtimony of Miſs Sawyer has been attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Are theſe witneſſes of good fame? We are told that the Proſecutrix is not—therefore, you ought to pay no attention to her evidence. But the <hi>fame</hi> of the Priſoner's witneſſes is pretty notorious; the inference of his own counſel, then, determine their rejection; for the principle cannot be right in one inſtance, and wrong in another. If this affects the testimony of the Proſecutrix, it affects that of Mrs. Cary with ten-fold force; her conſtant life is an iniquitous ſcene of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and vice. Thus, gentlemen, the Priſoner's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel have impliedly admitted the incredibility of their own evidence; through over haſte to attack the Proſecutrix, where ſhe was not vulnerable, they have erected a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which has completely ſecured the ſafety of their enemy.</p>
               <p>The want of an immediate complaint and purſuit of the Priſoner, after the fact happened, is alledged as another circumſtance affecting Miſs Sawyer's credibility. After ſhe left the houſe of Mrs. Cary, the Priſoner at the Bar paſſed her in the ſtreet;—here we have been told, ſhe ought to have applied to the paſſengers for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and have cauſed the Priſoner to be arreſted. This might indeed, have been the conduct of a ſhameleſs wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or of a maſculine heroine, but ſurely not that of a young and innocent girl. She did what nature and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity dictated—conceal her ſorrows.

callous to the feelings of a woman. Overcome with horror at the tranſactions of the night, with ſhame at the involuntarily loſs of what was dearer to her than life, her fears and alarms reduced this miſerable girl to a deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation. She knew the violence of her father's temper; afraid, left his impetuoſity ſhould puniſh her ſeverely unheard, ſhe wiſhed firſt to diſcloſe her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to her mother. This accounts for her behaviour—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> her retirement to ſolitude, to ruminate on her ſad ſituation, and to deviſe the fitteſt means of obtaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs for her injured innocence. She then proceeds to her aunt's; here, full of grief, and dejected, ſhe ſtays the afternoon, but the indelicacy of telling her ſtory without a queſtion, prevents her revealing what had paſſed. She goes home, ſees her friends and relations, no queſtions that night are aſked her. Her mother is in a paſſion, and her couſin, Mrs. Harper, takes her home; and ſeeing the anguiſh of the girl, prudently ſends her to bed, without enquiring the cauſe.</p>
               <p>But before ſhe returns home, a circumſtance appears from the evidence of Mrs. Cary and Mrs. M'Faul, which has been laid great ſtreſs on by the counſel for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; the Proſecutrix going to the houſe of Mrs. Cary the ſecond night. The ſource from which this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is drawn, is of itſelf ſufficient to make it of no weight, had it not been contradicted by reſpectable witneſſes. The character of Mrs. Cary, and her temptation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ry, has been ſufficiently diſcuſſed; indeed, it needs no diſcuſſion; but it is ſaid that Mrs. M'Faul ought to be believed; who is this woman? A relation of Mrs. Cary, dependent on her for the ſupport of her child; if ſhe is not an abandoned woman, ſtill her connection ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her teſtimony ſuſpicious. It is a never failing rule, that character is to be determined from company; for had people will naturally aſſociate with the bad, as will the good with the good. But reſpectable witneſſes have proved that Miſs Sawyer was at her aunt's, at near ſeven
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026513_0058_0FD08409CCD16AF8"/>
o'clock; and that about ſeven, ſhe was in Great George Street, at Miſs Pine's; ſo that from the nearneſs of time when ſhe was at theſe two places, her calling at Mrs. Cary's muſt have been impoſſible. This ſhows the complexion of all that woman's teſtimony. When it was neceſſary for her to be deaf, ſhe became ſo; ſhe hears no noiſe or outcries. When it was neceſſary for her to have a more than uſual degree of eye-ſight; ſhe ſees Miſs Sawyer in her houſe when ſhe was not there. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhort, ſhe was a mere tool, ready to ſacrifice or uſe all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſenſes, as the Priſoner may require.</p>
               <p>The counſel for the Priſoner then aſk why this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was delayed. But reflect on the important conſequences of it to Miſs Sawyer: She was going to diſcloſe an unfortunate occurrence to the world; poor and unknown, ſhe was going to oppoſe a man of rich family and connections, who might through influence and art, or the quibbles of law, obtain an acquittal; from the character of the people in the houſe where ſhe was decoyed, ſhe probably expected a flat denial of her ſtory. It behoved her therefore to be cautious; to proceed with deliberation. But her ſtory is told almoſt immediately after her return home, and her father goes with her to Mrs. Cary's to ſearch into the truth of it; ſo that though the Priſoner was not purſued, ſhe did not conceal the fact; from which no inference can be drawn to impeach her teſtimony. Her early diſcloſure of the fact, ſtrongly confirms its truth.</p>
               <p>The Priſoner's remaining in the city after the affair, is ſet up as another mark of his innocence. It has been ſaid, if he had been guilty, he would have flown. This is a proof, gentlemen, of the Priſoner's matchleſs aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and not of his innocence. A man not hackneyed in the ways of vice, would probably through the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of fear have fled. But the Priſoner hardened, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that his flight would operate against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

cure under ſhelter, of riches, influence, and the perjury of his witneſſes, he defied the charge; this is the reaſon that he did not fly.</p>
               <p>I believe gentlemen, little further need be ſaid in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the proſecution; the Priſoner's guilt is by this time too apparent. His counsel have made ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to influence your paſſions in his favor, from the reflection that the effect of your verdict againſt him, deprives him of life. Though I acknowledge that this dreadful conſequence ought to endue you with caution; yet when once you perceive the truth and juſtice of the charge, no conſideration of this kind can be of any weight in your determination. You are ſolemnly ſworn to give a verdict according to evidence; and the facts are, I am ſorry to ſay, too plain againſt the Priſoner. If indeed you believe Mrs. Cary and her <hi>creatures,</hi> you muſt acquit him. But if you do your duty, and believe reſpectable teſtimony, you can do no otherwiſe than find him guilty.</p>
