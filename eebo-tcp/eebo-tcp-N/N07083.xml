            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IF the publication of the following ſermons is thought to need any apology, the deſire of the bearers, whom the author is under obligations to gratify and pleaſe, if it may be to their edification, and the uſefulneſs and ſeaſonableneſs of the ſubjects, muſt make it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the firſt, it was preached upon a glorious and ever to be remembered occaſion; but indeed is not worthy to bring up the rere of ſo many better diſcourſes publiſhed before it, that were delivered the ſame day. The ſubject muſt be acknowledged to be important; and tho' not well managed, yet this mite caſt into the treaſury for a thank-offering to the Lord, for this wonderful work of his, will add ſomething thereto; eſpecially if any are hereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to obey as well as ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the laſt, it can't be thought impertinent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs little children, if we conſider, that much of a paſtor's buſineſs is with the lambs of the flock. To lead and guide them a-right, requires tenderneſs and ſkill. Great concern is to be had for childrens good, and much pains taken that they may be ſober, ſerious and religious. The corruption of their nature, and the times, require it. The marvellous works of the Lord, both of</hi> Mercy, <hi>in the great things he hath done for us, whereof we are glad; and of</hi> Judgment, <hi>in that ſo many of our choſen young men have
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:009019_0004_1030722B67D649B8"/>
been brought down to the ſides of the pit, by the ſword of men, &amp; the deſtroying angel, call aloud for it; and his word ſpeaks the ſame thing. They are the hopes of the flock. If religion does not revive with the preſent riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what will the next be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This familiar compoſition was made, and delivered to ſtir up in young and tender minds, conſideration about the things of God, and an eternal world, in ſuch a way and manner as might be both profitable and pleaſing. For to pleaſe, is deſirable; to profit is more ſo; but to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is moſt of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, <hi>This little book cannot expect to gain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,—do good it may, by the bleſſing of God; with this view it ventures abroad into the world, with ſome little alterations and additions. If thoſe that heard, or read the words of it, are any thing bettered by it, and will pray for the author, that he may obtain mercy from the Lord to be faithful, and have the pleaſure of being ſucceſsful, he ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaid, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than ſacrifice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS chapter gives the hiſtory of an important expedition undertaken by King <hi>Saul,</hi> with a great army of Iſrael, and of the men of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, at the command of God, by the mouth of <hi>Samuel</hi> his Prophet, againſt the Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites; their ſucceſs,—their diſobedience to the expreſs command of God,—his reſentment, and the ſad effects thereof, to <hi>Saul,</hi> even his rejection from being King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amalek</hi> was <hi>Eſau'</hi>s grandſon; from him deſcended the Amalakites. They had no doubt heard how <hi>Jacob</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <hi>Eſau</hi> his brother, and got the birth-right; bleſſing, and conſequently the land of Canaan. For this they owed the Iſraelites a grudge from generation to generation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when Iſrael was in the wilderneſs, weak, unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, diſpirited with long ſervitude, and marching toward the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009019_0006_1030722ED56CF858"/>
land of Canaan, "They met them by the way, ſmote the hindmoſt of them, even all the feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary, and they feared not God." <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 18. <hi>Joſhua</hi> is directed to chuſe out men and go, and fight with <hi>Amalek,</hi> and by means of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s faith and prayer, and <hi>Joſhua'</hi>s ſword, <hi>Amalek</hi> and his people are diſcomfited, and Iſrael delivered. Whereupon God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Moſes</hi> to write this in a book, for a memorial, and rehearſe it in the ears of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for (ſays God) "I will utterly put out the remembrance of <hi>Amalek</hi> from under heaven," <hi>Exod.</hi> 17, 14.—not ſpeedily and abſolutely, but comparatively. "For the Lord would have war with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek</hi> from generation to generation," v. 16. Yea, he charges the Iſraelites when they ſhould be in quiet poſſeſſion of the land, which he would give them, then "Thou ſhalt blot out the remembrance of <hi>Amalek</hi> from under heaven, thou ſhalt not forget it". <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 19. The ſpecial reaſon of this ſeverity ſeems to be given in forementioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 16. which ſome tranſlate thus, as being more agreable to the Hebrew words, becauſe the hand (i. e. hand of <hi>Amalek</hi>) is upon, or againſt the Lord, therefore the Lord will have war with <hi>Amalek</hi> &amp;c. i. e. his hand was ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt God himſelf, for ſo God eſteems it, becauſe it was done againſt that people among whom he had placed his throne, his tabernacle and dwelling; according to his covenant which he had made with them and their fathers, and was now conducting to the land which he had promiſed, them; all which the Amalekites were probably acquainted with, and was a great aggravation of their ſin.</p>
            <p>Now, how great a reſemblance is there between the caſe of Gods people Iſrael of old and their Amalekitiſh enemies, and the caſe of his <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Iſrael, and their <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> adverſaries?</p>
            <p>Tho' God gave not this land to our fore-fathers by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet it was upon mature conſideration, humble prayers
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009019_0007_10307233231A8E98"/>
to God, and for ſeveral weighty reaſons, that the firſt planters of <hi>New-England</hi> at <hi>Plymouth</hi> came over; one of which, as they expreſs it, was—<q>From an inward zeal and great hope of laying ſome foundation, or making way for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the kingdom of Chriſt to the remote ends of the earth; tho' they ſhould be but ſteping ſtones to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</q> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. PRINCE'S <hi>New-England</hi> Chronol. p. 49.</note> And it's obſervable, their deſign was for ſome unknown Country further ſouthward, about <hi>Hudſon's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>River;</hi> but God in his providence guided them to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where (as the ſame writer obſerves) <q>they then unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, eſcaped the much greater danger of falling among the multitudes of ſavages, at that time filling the countries about <hi>Hudſon's-River,</hi> and are landed in a place of greater ſafety; where a general peſtilence had two or three years before, exceedingly thinn'd the natives, and prepared the way for this feeble company.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chronol. p. 84.</note> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their ſavage enemies were comparatively few, yet there were more than enough to diſtreſs them, and their poſterity ever ſince. That we may well ſay, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 1, 2, 3. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didſt in their days, in the times of old. How thou didſt drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedſt them: how thou didſt afflict the people, and caſt them out. For they got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſword, neither did their own arm ſave them: But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour to them." We may alſo adopt that language, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 1. 2. "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Iſrael now ſay—yet they have not prevailed againſt me. If it had not been the Lord, who was on our ſide, now may Iſrael ſay,—when men roſe up againſt us: then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:009019_0008_1030723963EEC2D0"/>
Now, from the wonderful interpoſitions of God in his providence from time to time, in favour of our fore-fathers, their enemies might plainly ſee, that the Lord was on their ſide, fought for them, and intended this land for their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; which notwithſtanding, as I ſuppoſe, was poſſeſſed with the conſent, or by purchaſe, from the Indian nations, as they increaſed and needed it; and yet it's likely, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there has been injuſtice done them in this matter; which may be one cauſe of their having been made ſuch pricks in our eyes, and ſuch thorns in our ſides. And there was no need of theſe our enemies being rooted out, and deſtroyed, if they would but have been true and faithful, and had not proved treacherous and perſidious, fighting againſt God, as well as men, as the Amalekites did.</p>
            <p>And as to our French neighbours, they envy'd us this good land, which we were in the rightful poſſeſſion of. They have taken crafty counſel againſt this people of God, (to allude to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.)

            <p>Our <hi>Joſhua'</hi>s therefore, have often been called upon, to chuſe out men, to go and fight with them; our <hi>Moſes'</hi>s, <hi>Aaron'</hi>s and <hi>Hur'</hi>s, to aſcend the mount, and lift their hearts with their hands, to God in the heavens, that they might prevail againſt them. And altho' we have had no command from God to blot out the remembrance of them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, yet we have had occaſion to pray, that He would bring them to reaſon, or to ruine; who have roared in the midſt of the congregations, caſt fire into his ſanctuary, have defiled by caſting down the dwelling place of his name to the ground; have ſaid in their hearts, let us deſtroy them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have burnt up the ſynagogues of God in the land.—But to return to the ſtory of the ancient Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites.</p>
            <p>In fulfilment of his threatning, God ſends <hi>Saul,</hi> with a great hoſt, ſaying, "Go and ſmite <hi>Amalek,</hi> and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both man and woman, infant and ſuckling, ox and ſheep, camel and aſs."

And yet repeatedly inſiſts upon it, that he had obey'd the voice of the Lord. <hi>v.</hi> 13 and 20. which, tho' he knew was not true, endeavours to juſtify himſelf.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By hypocritically pretending a regard to the honour and ſervice of God. But the people took of the ſpoil, ſheep and oxen; the chief of the things which ſhould have been utterly deſtroyed, to ſacrifice unto the Lord thy God in <hi>Gilgal, v.</hi> 21. He acknowledges, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to deſtruction by God, but takes upon him to ſay, when, and in what way, even by ſacrificing them, when he ſhould come to <hi>Gilgal;</hi> which pretence of piety toward God, was only to cover his impiety and avarice.</p>
            <p>Now the words of the Text, are <hi>Samuel'</hi>s anſwer to his fallacious reaſon, for diſobeying the command of God. "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey, is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of rams."</p>
            <p>For <hi>Saul'</hi>s conviction, <hi>Samuel</hi> propounds a queſtion, which admits of an eaſy anſwer, that <hi>Saul</hi> could not fail to give at the firſt propoſal; yet, that his conviction might be more full and ſtrong, he anſwers it himſelf, with a "Behold"—intimating that it was worthy of his particular notice and obſervation.</p>
            <p>From the words we may obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God hath comparatively little regard to the external and ceremonial part of the ſervices performed in his worſhip.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This he would have well taken notice of, and practiced upon.</p>

The worſhip &amp; ſervice of God may be diſtinguiſhed into natural and inſtituted, moral and ceremonial. That which the light of nature teaches, is binding upon all; but that which is ceremonial and inſtituted, may be obligatory only on ſome perſons, places &amp; ages. Much of the worſhip and ſervice of God under the Law was ceremonial; which ſtood only, in meats, and drinks, and diverſe waſhings, and carnal ordinances, impoſed on them, until the time of reformation." Great part of it, conſiſted in the offerings and ſacrifices that were brought to God's altar,—in the birds and beaſts that were ſlain and offered unto God, particularly the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. There were wholly burnt upon the altar,—were an acknowledgment that the offerers deſerved death—to make atonement for their ſins,—to be offered with a free heart, and to obtain the favour of God. So there were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the ſame kind of creatures, ſome of which were propitiatory, to procure pardon, and were typical of Chriſt, and his ſacrifice of himſelf; others, were gratulatory, to give thanks and praiſe to God, for mercies received. Of this kind were thoſe ſpoken of in the text.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe were of little account with God, tho' he had commanded them, and the Jews were often condemned for them. Sometimes, becauſe they brought only their outward oblation, <hi>beaſts;</hi> without the inward, their <hi>hearts;</hi> which were not engaged therein, tho' this was their moſt reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and ſometimes becauſe they uſed them to hide their hypocriſy and wickedneſs. Hence God ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 8. "I will not reprove thee for thy ſacrifices, or thy burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; they have been continually before me." So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 13. "Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is an abomination to me," &amp;c. So far was it from being a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him, as they imagined, conſidering with what an evil heart, and in what an unſanctified manner, they brought it. God's heart was ſo little upon theſe things, that we find him ſaying, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22. "I ſpake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them, in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009019_0012_1030724727024848"/>
day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, conc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt offerings or ſacrifices." God did command them, and he does not deny it, but comparatively ſpeaking. He did not command them <hi>at all,</hi> in compariſon with other things, which were of ſo much <hi>more</hi> weight and worth with him. Agreable to this, is that, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 6. "For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired mercy, and not ſacrifice, and the knowledge of God, more than burnt offerings;" which ſhews, what is intended by God's deſiring mercy, and <hi>not</hi> ſacrifice, i. e. <hi>rather</hi> than ſacrifice; for men in miſery, need mercy from their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but God does not need ſacrifice. So that God had little reſpect either to the offerings and ſacrifices under the Law, or to the offerers, meerly on their own account; for, "They could not make him that did the ſervice, nor the comers thereunto perfect." <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. And as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light has he in the external parts of worſhip, and attendance on ordinances under the Goſpel. For "bodily exerciſe profiteth little," 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. i. e. faſting, praying, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. wherein the body is exerciſed, though it may be of <hi>ſome</hi> uſe, it's <hi>little</hi> in compare with godlineſs, or the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of true piety.</p>
            <p>How vain then is it, to make much account, of what God makes ſo little. It's what God eſteems, and is delighted in, that will avail us any thing; and not what we ſet an high value upon. Sometimes, "that which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is abomination in the ſight of God." <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. Hence he ſaid to his people of old, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 10, 14. "To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices to me? I delight not in the blood of bullocks—Incence is an abomination to me,—the new moons, and ſabbaths, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with,—your appointed feaſts, my ſoul hateth &amp;c. The ſacrifice [or prayer] of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord," <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. It can't then be wiſe or ſafe for perſons to have any dependance upon the ceremonial, external parts of religion, to bring them into favour with God. Which leads us to the next obſervation, <hi>namely,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009019_0013_10307248DE3E91A8"/>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That it is obedience to the commands of God from the heart, yielded in the life, that is pleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>This is implied in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s queſtion, and expreſſed in his anſwer. He has not ſo great delight in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord. <hi>This,</hi> is better than ſacrifice. <hi>That,</hi> is good, ſo far as it goes, but <hi>this</hi> is better: "And to hearken, than the fat of rams." The fat was the beſt part of the ſacrifice, and appropriated to God, to be burnt upon the altar. "All the fat is the Lord's, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3. 16. That is "all the fat that is upon, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the inwards, the fat that is upon the two kidneys, and the caul above the liver," <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. It is this kind of fat that was thus devoted. Neither he that brought the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor he that offered it, was to have any part of it. This ſignified, that we ought to give the choiceſt and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of our ſervices to God; and that our inward parts, our ſouls and ſpirits, are our beſt. Theſe are the fat of goſpel ſacrifices.</p>
            <p>Now, "to hearken is better than the fat of rams." To <hi>hearken,</hi> ſuppoſes attention of mind, &amp; engagedneſs of heart; and if thereupon, obedience to the voice of God in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is yielded, this is pleaſing to him; this is his delight, and better than the fat of fed beaſts.</p>
            <p>It's the heart God requires in all religious ſervices,—is what he looks at, and is well pleaſed with, in duties. His demand, is that, "My ſon, give me thine heart." And when this is engaged in the performance of moral and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical duties, he is more delighted, than with all the Levitical ceremonies and ſervices. Hence that direction, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 1. "Keep thy foot," (i. e. thy thoughts and affections) "when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the ſacrifice of fools, for, they conſider not that they do evil." It's not enough to hear, but it muſt be in order to practice. "Bleſſed are they that hear the word
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009019_0014_1030724CA5987B30"/>
of God, and keep it," When God teſtified againſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for truſting in their offerings and ſacrifices, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. He lets them know what would anſwer their end, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. "Offer unto God thankſgiving and pay thy vows unto the moſt High: And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me." So when he had complained of their vain oblations, which were of no ſervice to them, he puts them in a way to pleaſe and pacify him, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 16. "Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well,' &amp;c. Chriſt alſo ſays to the Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13. "Go ye and learn what that mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.' But he ſets this matter in a clear and ſtrong light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. "Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites; for ye pay tithe of mint, &amp; anniſe, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." God has ſome delight in ceremonial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as they are of his inſtituting, but he has greater in obedience to moral duties and goſpel precepts. And <hi>Saul</hi>'s diſobedience to the command of God, could not be compenſated with burnt-offerings and ſacrifices; ſo neither can the want of acts of piety toward God, and juſtice and charity toward men, be atoned for by a profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and attending his worſhip and ordinances, tho' in a conſciencious manner. The penitent Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 16, 17. "Thou delighteſt not in ſacrifice, elſe would I give it: Thou delighteſt not in burnt-offerings. The ſacrifices of God, are a broken ſpirit: a broken and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe." And when an obedient, holy life is conſequent thereupon, this is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This he would have well taken notice of and practiced upon. <hi>Behold!</hi> to obey is better than ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009019_0015_1030724E820234B8"/>
Some times, this word is uſed as a note of admiration, when any thing ſtrange and ſurprizing is ſpoken of; as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7. 14. "Behold, a virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a ſon." Some times, as a note of attention, to quicken to conſideration, and to think upon a thing with due regard; as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 22. "Behold therefore, the goodneſs and ſeverity of God." And in this ſenſe, <hi>Samuel</hi> uſes it here. "Behold, to obey," &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> take notice of it, conſider it well, impreſs it upon thy heart and mind, know thou it for thy good, <hi>Saul,</hi> that the way to pleaſe God, is to obey his commands, and not diſregard them under a pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding more plentifully for ſacrificing on his altar. To obey his voice, is better than to offer thouſands of bullocks, and rams, and lambs out of the fold and ſtall.</p>
            <p>Now, this is a truth God would have <hi>us</hi> obſerve, and practice accordingly; even this, that we regard not our own imaginations, inventions, nor indeed his inſtitutions, when we are about to attend on them out of ſeaſon, or when he calls us to other duties, that are more important and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; or when we lay more weight upon them, than he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us; or would ſhew our regard to him in a way which he does not ſo much require, and is not ſo much for his honour and glory, as another; which he at this <hi>Time</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and on this <hi>great Occaſion</hi> calls us unto; Namely, to hearken to his voice, obey his commands, and not formally, and hypocritically offer praiſe to him, with our mouths ſhewing much love, when our hearts are far from him, and our lives and converſation contrary to his plainly revealed mind and will.</p>
            <p>Thus much briefly for the doctrinal part of the words.</p>

Sovereign, by his Commands, has called forth his armies, to go and ſmite our worſe than Amalekitiſh enemies, for what they have done, and contrived againſt us; not indeed utterly to deſtroy all that they have, and not ſpare them, ſlaying man and woman, infant and ſuckling, as they too much endeavoured to do by us: but to bring them to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and righteous terms of peace, that we might live quietly and ſafely in the land that God has given us for a poſſeſſion. We ſought the Lord in the day of our diſtreſs, by prayer, faſting and humbling our ſouls before him; and we truſt he has regarded us in our low eſtate: For thro' the good hand of our God upon our forces, and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeries of favourable providences, they have ſmitten and reduced them from <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> to <hi>Quebec,</hi> and from <hi>Mont-Real,</hi> until thou comeſt to <hi>Ohio,</hi> over againſt <hi>Louiſiana,</hi> and the great river <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> even their whole country of <hi>Canada,</hi> from one end thereof unto the other; and brought it under the dominion of the King of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> but on the ſpoil laid they not their hand; nor ſaid, as did <hi>Edoms</hi> ſons, "raſe it, raſe it, even to the foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;" neither have they "rewarded them as they ſerved us, taking and daſhing their little ones againſt the ſtones." But they have taken <hi>Vandreuil,</hi> their Governor; who by all account, deſerves to be "hewed in pieces before the Lord; and his mother to be made childleſs among women; as his ſword has made many women childleſs."</p>
            <p>Our armies having been thus ſucceſsful, through the mercy of the Lord, we are this day called upon to take the high praiſes of God into our mouths; while a two-edged ſword is in our hands.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, neither we, nor our Fathers, ever had ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to keep a day of thankſgiving, and which is ſo like the <hi>Jews</hi> days of <hi>Purim,</hi> wherein they reſted from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; which were turned unto them, from ſorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, which they made days

Who among the moſt ſanguine, in their hopes, could a few years ago, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſee ſuch a day as this? Who is not ſurprized at it, when he conſiders our deſerts?—How unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared we are to receive, and how unworthy of ſuch a mercy! and who ſhould not tremble for fear of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Indeed, "we are like unto them that dream."</p>
            <p>Now, what ſhall we render unto the Lord for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits? Will it ſuffice, that we teſtify our joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs by outward expreſſions of it (though theſe in a manner and meaſure are proper) by ringing bells, making bon-fires, illuminations, firing ſmall arms and cannon, eating the fat, and drinking the ſweet, not to ſay, to exceſs? Will the Lord be pleaſed with this? Or ſhall it be thought enough, that we offer a few burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, and the fat of rams?—that we ſet apart a day for thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,—come up to God's houſe,—are at the expence of a little lip-labour, or bodily exerciſe; in ſinging his praiſes, ſpeaking to the honour of his name &amp;c.? Shall this be thought a ſuitable return for his marvellous loving-kindneſs, in thus preſerving and ſecuring to us our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, poſſeſſions, properties, lives and liberties, civil and religious? No, verily. To hearken to the voice of the Lord, and to obey his commandments, which is better than all theſe performances, is the leaſt we can render to him; and if we don't, we ſhall be guilty of rebellion, which is as the ſin of witch-craft, and ſtubbornneſs, which is as ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and idolatry."</p>
            <p>Well then, let us ſee that we do ſomething that is in ſome degree anſwerable to the expectations of God from us, under the great things he has done for us.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>

O what a ſinful backſliding people are we? As we have increaſed, ſo we have ſinned. All the methods of God's providence and grace, have had an hardening, inſtead of ſoftning effect upon us.

Are we not an unbelieving, diſobedient people, that have grieved the Holy Spirit, deſpiſed Chriſt, and his glorious goſpel, and abuſed the goodneſs of God? What need then of repentance!

His goodneſs ſhould lead every one of us, to unfeigned ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If we had any ingenuity, any ſenſe of ſhame, any ſpark of gratitude, our repentings would be kindled together, our hearts would be turned in us unto the Lord, from whom we have departed, with whom we have dealt treacherouſly, and in whoſe covenant we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us look to our hearts, that they now be right with God.</p>
            <p>O what need is there to begin with them, and ſee that they are changed and ſanctified! Until that is done, how can the holy God accept an offering at our hands? The ſacrifice (whether of prayer or praiſe) of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is abomination; how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 27. Let us ſee to get

            <p n="4">4. Let us take heed to our ways and doings, that they may be good.</p>
            <p>That they have not been good, is too evident. Theſe works of the Lord, and operations of his hands, call for a reformation; and wo will be unto us, if it is not effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let us then break off from our ſins, by repentance, and from our iniquities, by turning to the Lord. And O that the time paſt of our lives might ſuffice, wherein we have ſerved diverſe luſts and corruptions; and let us now reſolve, that as for us and our houſes, we will ſerve the Lord. If not, "and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and our great treſpaſſes, ſeeing that our God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and hath given us ſuch deliverance as this; ſhould we again break his commandments, and join in affinity with the people of theſe abominations, would he not be angry with us, till he hath conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping."</p>
            <p>In a word and to conclude,</p>
            <p>What obligations are we under, to be an holy, thankful and obedient people our ſelves, and to deſire that the conqueſts that have been made, may advance the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Great Redeemer in this part of the world; and be a means to make ready a people prepared for the Lord; that his name may be one throughout all the earth!</p>

            <head>A Plain and brief Diſcourſe TO Little CHILDREN.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 JOH. ii. 1.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>My little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS epiſtle was wrote by the ſame <hi>John,</hi> who is ſometimes called the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,—that wrote the goſpel that bears his name,—the book of Revelations, and two other epiſtles that follow this. He lived the longeſt of all the apoſtles, and was probably an old man now. Thoſe to whom he wrote this epiſtle, are thought to be Jews, ſcattered in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diſtant from where he was; ſo that he could not come to ſpeak to them, and therefore from love to his own people and kindred, he writes this letter to them: For he was the apoſtle and miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and had a concern for their good. And no doubt, they were glad to receive and hear it, and attended carefully to what was in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:009019_0021_10307264DCB60578"/>
In this chapter, we find, he writes to ſeveral ſorts and ages of perſons; as to fathers, to young men, and in the text to little children.</p>
            <p>"My little children, theſe things write I unto you." One upon the place obſerves, <q>He beſpeaks them with a compellation, importing both authority and love; well becoming him, as then an aged perſon, and apoſtle, their teacher, and who was their moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate ſpiritual father.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What he writes to them about, is, not their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but ſpiritual affairs; not concerning the welfare of their bodies, but the ſafety of their ſouls.—"That ye ſin not." For ſin is to the hurt and deſtruction of ſoul and body both; in time, and to eternity. So that the apoſtle might well write to them, <hi>not to ſin.</hi> But he writes to them alſo about other things, as of Jeſus Chriſt's being their advocate with the Father;—their knowing him;—keeping his commandments;—walking as he walked;—loving their brother, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, as the apoſtle <hi>wrote</hi> unto his little children, ſo my little children of this Congregation, I would <hi>ſpeak</hi> unto you.—To you that are fifteen years old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who are capable of hearing, receiving, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practicing, what may be ſaid to you from the word of the Lord; even, all of you, both male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, in what place, or part ſoever of the meeting houſe, you ſit. I ſay, to you particularly, I ſhall direct my ſpeech at this time; but not excluſive of others. To you, O children, I call; and my voice is to every one of you; as if I called you by name.</p>
            <p>Through the patience of a ſovereign God, I have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ability to ſpeak to you, and you are alive, and have liberty to hear me. O that you might ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009019_0022_10307267C6752708"/>
your ears and hear, what may be ſpoken, agreeable to the word and will of God, as that your ſouls may live!</p>
            <p>I have with much weakneſs and fear, been preaching to your grand-parents, and parents, above thirty years. Some number of the latter, I baptized, catechiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, when they were young, as you are; and it would be a great comfort to me now, and a great advantage to them, if I had done it more faithfully, and they had lived more fruitfully.</p>
            <p>But as I ſaid, I am now ſpeaking to you, my little Children.</p>
            <p>If you aſk me, why I ſpeak to you about your ſouls, and ſerious things, now you are ſo young, and well, like to live ſo many years, and have ſo little inclination, thought and time, to ſpare for ſuch things?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; I will give you diverſe reaſons; and if you will but attend to them, the youngeſt of you may ſee, that they are good and weighty.</p>
            <p>And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt reaſon is, You have immortal ſouls to be ſaved or damned, as well as older perſons.</p>
            <p>Children do not die as the beaſts do, whoſe ſpirits go downward to the earth; and for ought that I know, die with their bodies; but Children have immortal ſpirits that go upward, to God that gave them; to be ſent to heaven or hell, according as they have been good or wicked. <hi>Abijah,</hi> the good ſon of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he died, becauſe in him, there was found ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſrael. But thoſe forty-two Children that the She-bears tare in pieces, moſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009019_0023_1030726981C36A80"/>
likely, went to hell; for they mocked an old man, and a prophet of the Lord, out of contempt of God, and religion, and he curſed them in the name of the Lord; not from ſinful paſſion, but by the direction of the Spirit of God;—which is a warning to all Children, againſt any ſuch conduct. Now, to one of thoſe two places, your ſouls will be carried when you die. Is it not then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful you ſhould be ſpoke to about ſoul concernments; one of which Chriſt has taught us to think, is of more worth than the world?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now, while you are living, you have time and opportunity to ſeek their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to ſpeak to the dead. They are paſt heating, and receiving inſtruction. They are gone into eternity, where no offers of ſalvation are made to ſinners; for it's in time, while they are in this world, that they are to mind the things of their everlaſting peace. But you are alive, in the world, and may be ſpoke to, with hope that it may be for your ſoul's good. And it is a great mercy to have time, to prepare for eternity in, though you ſpend ſo much of it in ſin and vanity;—and opportunity, to pray, read, hear the word, and to be inſtructed in your duty, and the way to eſcape the wrath and curſe of God. And don't you never think of it, that as young as you are, you muſt be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by God, how you have profited by theſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? If you don't, it will be ſo. For do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that this ſame <hi>John,</hi> in a viſion in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and were judged according to their works? O, it is then fit, now to ſpeak to you, and for you to hear, that ſo you may give up your account with joy, and not with grief.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now you are not hardened in a way and courſe of ſin, as you may be ſome years hence, when there will be leſs encouragement to ſpeak to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009019_0024_10307270806201D8"/>
You are not got into the way of lying, or profane ſpeaking, of going to taverns, or into evil company, which dreadfully harden the heart, ſtupify the conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and make it difficult to reform ſuch perſons. You know it is harder to bend a tree, than a young plant. We read of young <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that his heart was tender; that he humbled himſelf before the Lord; wept before him, and rent his cloaths. But old hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid, Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice? And ten dreadful plagues, made but little impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him. And when you grow up, and grow old, if God ſhould leave you to yourſelves, you would be as bad as <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But now, you are more afraid of ſin, and may be more eaſily brought to be ſorry for it: And by being ſpoken to ſeaſonably, it's hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you may be kept from evil ways, that lead to death and deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now God is calling upon you by his providences, and therefore I would ſpeak unto you at this time.</p>
            <p>There is a voice in the providences of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read, "The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it." And ſometimes the Lord's voice is loud and terrible in this way; and they are ſtupid, ſenſeleſs creatures, that don't hear and regard it. Now God is calling to you, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in the late deaths of a number of ſuch as were about your age. Six weeks ago, a little girl,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Huldah Witherbe,</hi> who died <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.</note> about ten years old, was taken away from among you, by death. Laſt week, another of about fifteen,<note n="‖" place="bottom">

                  </gap>d in a pond, <hi>June.</hi> 12.</note> of the ſame age, who had not been there five months before
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009019_0025_10307275A0036F40"/>
her. Divers others, in their early youth, the ſummer paſt, have found their graves, at home, or abroad in his Majeſty's ſervice; and poſſibly more than we at preſent know of. By all which inſtances, God is calling upon <hi>you,</hi> Children, to get ready for death and the grave.</p>
            <p>And though ordinarily, it is not good manners to ſpeak, when another, eſpecially a ſuperior, is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet, it's decent and duty, for God's miniſters to ſecond his call in his providences, with that of his word, that if you will not hear the one, you may hear the other. For a <hi>word</hi> at one time, will do a Child more good, than a <hi>blow</hi> at another. And ſome Children have ſo much ingenuity, that they will regard a word of inſtruction, more than others will the rod of correction. I hope, there are ſome of you, my little Children, that are of this ingenuous temper. Is there ne'er a little boy, or little girl here, that will mind, and remember what I am ſaying? If I was telling a good, merry ſtory, you would hearken to it, with both ears; and why ſhould you not, now I am puting you in mind, how many of your age have lately been nailed up in a <hi>dark coffin,</hi> and are gone into an amazing eternity, where you will ſoon follow them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now, you have the greateſt encouragement you ever will have, to hear for your lives; and therefore I ſpeak to you.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, gives particular direction to his miniſters, to feed his lambs. He took little Children into his arms, when here on earth, and bleſſed them; ſaying, "Suffer little Children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of Heaven." And, "Except ye be converted, and become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009019_0026_10307277635D3518"/>
So, there are great <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to ſuch as you are, to encourage you, to be religious betimes, "Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things, ſhall be added unto you." "I love them, (ſays Wiſdom) that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me." And are not <hi>theſe</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements enough to you? They encourage me to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and why ſhould they not you to <hi>hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. You have many examples to induce you.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Joſiah</hi> king of Judah, was but ſixteen years old, he began to ſeek after the God of <hi>David</hi> his father. And <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. king of <hi>England,</hi> died when he was ſixteen years of age, and yet, was an eminently pious prince. So there was young <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah,</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and others on ſcripture record. There have been many alſo in theſe days, that have been ſerious and religious in their childhood and youth.</p>
            <p>I remember, a few years ago, in the time of the great mortality, in this, and ſome of the neighbouring towns,<note n="*" place="bottom">In the beginning of the year 1754; when ſixteen perſons, old and young, died in this town in leſs than ſeven weeks.</note> a Lad came to me, with that important enquiry, <hi>What he ſhould do to be ſaved?</hi> But it may be, he has too much forgot it now. And I heard a young man ſay, t'other day, that when he was twelve years old, he joined to the Church. But, <hi>my little, Children,</hi> I am afraid there are few of you that have any <hi>thoughts</hi> about <hi>that.</hi> And yet, is it not your duty as well as his? And are not you obliged to walk in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs? Who gave you, or indeed your fathers and mothers, liberty
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009019_0027_103072792332D570"/>
to diſobey that command of Chriſt, "Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me?" If you ſay, you are not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſober enough; Whoſe fault is that? Or, if you ſay, it is not the cuſtom, as it is to own the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and you ſhall have no company. You are right in <hi>that;</hi> and the way you are in, you have company enough: But will that be any comfort to you, when you, with the fearful, and unbelieving, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and abominable, ſhall have your part in the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death? Surely, No! Will you follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to do evil? Will you go to hell for company's ſake? Would you creep into a flaming oven? Or dance upon the mouth of a burning pit, becauſe your companions would do ſo? No, their ſhrieks would keep you back. But to follow them, impenitently, in their evil courſes, is ten thouſand times more dreadful, tho' you don't ſee it or believe it. What a pity is it, ſo many pretty Children, as are now in this Aſſembly, ſhould follow evil examples, to their eternal ruine, when there are examples for them to follow, which would lead them to everlaſting bleſſedneſs!</p>
            <p n="7">7. The moſt that are converted, and ſhall be ſaved, began to be ſerious when young.</p>
            <p>Aſk them, and they will tell you ſo. Few grow <hi>good,</hi> when they are grown <hi>old.</hi> Many, many can tell you, they know from their own ſad and ſorrowful experience, that it <hi>is</hi> ſo; and that they wiſh now they had begun to ſeek God in earneſt, when they were of your age. For as elderly men and women, <hi>never</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their mothers wombs, and are <hi>naturally</hi> born again, ſo they <hi>ſeldom</hi> are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> born, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the new-birth, by the ſpecial operations of the Spirit of God. Such inſtances are very rare. Many are converted, when under twenty, but few when they are above forty years of age,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009019_0028_1030727AE6BFA5B0"/>
Once more,</p>
            <p n="8">8. You don't know that you ſhall live to be men and women, and what will become of you, if you ſhould die while you are little Children?</p>
            <p>There is not one of you, that <hi>know</hi> you ſhall live to <hi>grow</hi> old, or have longer opportunity to prepare for death, than thoſe Children, that have lately been laid in their graves; and if you <hi>did,</hi> do you know that the Spirit of God will ſtrive with you <hi>then,</hi> convince, convert and ſave you, when-as you will not cry to him daily, <hi>now,</hi> and live ſoberly and religiouſly? No, you would have no reaſon to expect it.</p>
            <p>Well, for theſe, among other reaſons, I thought to ſpeak to you, <hi>my little Children.</hi> And don't you think they are good reaſons, and ſufficient; and that you need to be ſpoken to, though you are young and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſet away yonder, behind others, that are older, that know more than you do, that might do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ought to live otherwiſe than they do.</p>
            <p>Now then, <hi>you</hi> are to be ſpoken unto; a Sermon is made on purpoſe for you; and ſhould you not attend to it with diligence? Therefore, as Wiſdom ſays "Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me, now therefore, O ye Children, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the words of my mouth." And as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, "Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord."</p>
            <p>Now, what I ſhall ſpeak to you about, is <hi>Sin,</hi> and then ſomething of the <hi>Saviour</hi> therefrom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, About Sin.</hi> The Aſſembly's Chatechiſin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably to the ſcriptures, tells you, That "Sin is any want of conformity unto, or tranſgreſſion of the law of God." It came into the world of men, at <hi>Alam'</hi>s
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009019_0029_1030727DC5E648D0"/>
               <hi>fall.</hi> You have <hi>original ſin</hi> in you;—are under guilt, becauſe of it;—are defiled with it, as you deſcend from him, and are naturally inclined to ſin. A clean thing, cannot come out of an unclean. A corrupt fountain will ſend forth impure ſtreams. The holieſt and beſt men find it in themſelves, and therefore it muſt be in you; for they and you deſcended from the ſame firſt parents. Becauſe ſome don't ſee it in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> or believe it is in <hi>all,</hi> it does not follow that it is not. Negative evidence will not do, in this caſe. If you feel it, and know it to be in yourſelves, you will believe it, if twenty men tell you it is not. Hence it is, that you are ſo inclined to evil, going aſtray as ſoon as you are born, ſpeaking lies, ſerving divers Juſts and corruptions. Now you muſt ſee this, and lament it, if you would ever come to any ſaving good; ſo far as I can underſtand the ſcripture.</p>
            <p>So you are <hi>actual ſinners;</hi> have ſinned in thoughts, words and actions. O how many vain thoughts lodge within you. How many idle, ſinful words have you ſpoken! And how many wicked things have you done againſt God, your parents, your neighbours and your ſelves? Indeed the young man in the goſpel thought he had kept all the commands Chriſt mentioned to him, from his youth up, becauſe he did not know himſelf, and the bredth and ſpirituality of the law of God; when-as he had broken them all, and kept none of them right, becauſe he had not done it out of love to God, and Chriſt. And you muſt know it is ſo with you, if you don't love the Lord with all your heart, ſoul and ſtrength. And we read, that "Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."</p>
            <p>You muſt alſo ſee what an evil and bitter thing it is, that you have ſinned,—what wrath and curſe from God you deſerve,—what miſery and anguiſh
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009019_0030_10307282D70E0210"/>
you are expoſed to here, and for ever. <hi>This,</hi> is what you muſt be deeply ſenſible of, and diſtreſſingly concerned about.</p>
            <p>Further, you muſt be convinced, that you cannot make amends for your ſins, or pacify the anger of God, but muſt be everlaſtingly miſerable, for all you can do; and muſt expect no other, unleſs God has mercy on you, and freely pardons you. But how little have you <hi>known,</hi> and how little <hi>concern</hi> have you <hi>had</hi> about theſe things? Does not your thoughtleſneſs and inconſiderateneſs, convince you, that ſo it is with you? And can it be ſafe, or how can you be eaſy, to live ſo, in your ſins, and in danger every moment of dropping into hell? But then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muſt know, that there <hi>is,</hi> and be ſpoken to <hi>about,</hi> a Saviour, even Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who ſaves his people from their ſins.</p>
            <p>He can help you, deliver you from ſin, and the wrath to come; and make you holy and happy. He was born of a woman, yielded perfect obedience to the whole law, fulfilled all righteouſneſs, ſuffered and died, that you might be ſaved. But then, you muſt be intereſted in his juſtifying righteouſneſs; be qualified for his preſence, and the enjoyment of him. And this muſt be by experiencing a ſpecial work of the Holy Ghoſt, in your ſouls. You muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, converted, and ſanctified,—be made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, to repent of all your ſins; abhor your ſelves, love God and Chriſt, his commands, his people, his day, and all that whereby he makes himſelf and his will known unto you. Then you will be new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, quite other Children than now you are; the Children of God; and not of the devil; will be fit to <hi>live,</hi> and anſwer the end of living; living in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will, and to his glory; then alſo, you will be fit to <hi>die,</hi> let death come when it will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:009019_0031_10307285F66A4470"/>
Thus, my little Children; I have ſpoken a few things unto you, very briefly. Now, will you, "Set your hearts unto all the words which I teſtify among you this day?" Will you try to remember them, and live according to them? There is <hi>that</hi> little Boy, and <hi>this</hi> little Girl; will not you mind them for your good, if no body elſe will? If you will not mind them <hi>now,</hi> they will come into your mind often enough in the other world. <hi>Now,</hi> you complain of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, that you can't remember what is ſaid to you; but <hi>then,</hi> your memories will be ſtrong and tenacious. Probably, you will then be able to recollect and call to mind, all the counſels, cautions and warnings that were ever given you, and your fooliſh and obſtinate refuſal thereof;—all the ſermons you have heard;—all your neglected opportunities, &amp; abuſed mercies, which you have now forgotten; Yea, every ſinful action you have done, and idle word you have ſpoken, and evil thought that has paſt through your mind; theſe you will think of in that long Eternity, over and over, a thouſand, thouſand times, to your unutterable ſhame, confuſion and anguiſh of ſpirit. O then, don't make light of them now!</p>
            <p>My little Children, I ſpeak to you, <hi>that ye ſin not.</hi> I would perſwade and charge you, not to neglect any duty, or live in any known ſin. Don't forget to pray to God in ſecret, every day; if you would not go to hell. For God will pour out his fury upon perſons, as well as "families, that call not on his name." Neglect not to read his holy word; and to hear it as often as you can, with ſeriouſneſs and reverence. Spend not your time idly, and ſinfully, in vain company, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mirth; you will repent it, when it is too late. Don't profane God's holy day. If you allow yourſelves in playing on the Sabbath, and at Meeting, you cannot be godly, and go to heaven. Sabbath-breakers, are wicked people, tho' there are ſo many of them. Get out of

the way and company of ſuch, and go not with them. Let them go to hell without you, if they will go in this high-road thereunto; and ſhame older perſons out of this evil, by your ſober, decent behaviour.</p>
            <p>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, nor any way of wickedneſs be practiced in your life. Walk not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful. "My ſon, if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not." Flee youthful luſts. Shun the appearance of evil. Quench not the Spirit. Reſt not, till you come to ſee the hatefulneſs of ſin, and the excellency of Chriſt; to love God above all things, and to have the fear of God, even always before your eyes.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a cloſe.—I have done ſpeaking to you for this time.</p>
            <p>Now tell me, will any of you reſolve, by the grace of God; to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly?—to put away childiſh, ſinful things, and chooſe the ways of religion, and true holineſs? If ſo, you will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and honour to your father that begat you, and to your mother that bear, nouriſhed and brought you up; If not, you will be a grief of heart to all that love you, and have a ſerious concern for you; and it will be good for you, if you had never been born.</p>
            <p>What remains, is to beg the bleſſing of God on you, and on what has been ſaid; and that the Spirit of God would accompany it with his effectual Operations; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, my ſpeaking, and your hearing, will be to no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; but we ſhall be eventually the worſe, inſtead of the better therefor.</p>
