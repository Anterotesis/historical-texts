            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT is with the utmoſt diffidence that the following pages are ſubmitted to the inſpection of the Public: yet, however the limited abilities of the author may have prevented her from ſucceeding to her wiſh in the execution of her preſent attempt, ſhe humbly truſts that the uprightneſs of her intention will procure it a candid and favourable reception. The following little Eſſays are chiefly calculated for the younger part of her own ſex, who, ſhe flatters herſelf, will not eſteem them the leſs, becauſe they were written im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately for their ſervice.

               </gap> offended if ſhe has occaſionally pointed out certain qualities, and ſuggeſted certain tempers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions as <hi>peculiarly feminine,</hi> and hazarded ſome obſervations which naturally aroſe from the ſubject, on the different characters which mark the ſexes. And here again ſhe takes the liberty to repeat that theſe diſtinctions cannot be too nicely maintained; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe important qualities common to both, each ſex has its reſpective, appropriated qualifications, which would ceaſe to be meritorious, the inſtant they ceaſed to be appropriated. Nature, propriety, and cuſtom have preſcribed certain bounds to each; bounds which the prudent and the candid will never attempt
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:019810_0004_0FACB40B49CD6A28"/>
to break down; and indeed it would be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic to annihilate diſtinctions from which each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires excellence, and to attempt innovations by which both would be loſers.</p>
            <p>WOMEN therefore never underſtand their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts ſo little, as when they affect thoſe qualities and accompliſhments, from the want of which they derive their higheſt merit. "The <hi>porcelain</hi> clay of human kind," ſays an admired writer, ſpeaking of the ſex. Greater delicacy evidently implies greater fragility; and this weakneſs, natural and moral, clearly points out the neceſſity of a ſuperior degree of caution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and reſerve.</p>
            <p>IF the author may be allowed to keep up the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the poet, juſt quoted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e would aſk, if we do not put the fineſt vaſes, and the coſtlieſt images in places of the greateſt ſecurity, and moſt remote from any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ability of accident or deſtruction? By being ſo ſituated, they find their protection in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their ſafety in their delicacy. This meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor is far from being uſed with a deſign of placing young ladies in a trivial, unimportant light; it is only introduced to inſinuate, that where there is more beauty, and more weakneſs, there ſhould be greater circumſpection and ſuperior prudence.</p>
            <p>MEN, on the contrary, are formed for the more public exhibitions on the great theatre of human life. Like the ſtronger and more ſubſtantial wares, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no injury, and loſe no poliſh by being always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and engaged in the conſtant commerce of the world. It is their proper element, where they reſpire their natural air, and exert their nobleſt powers, in ſituations which call them into action. They were intended by Providence for the buſtling ſcenes of life; to appear terrible in arms, uſeful in commerce, ſhining in counſels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:019810_0005_0FACB40C481179B8"/>
THE author fears it will be hazarding a very bold remark, in the opinion of many ladies, when ſhe adds, that the female mind in general, does not appear capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attaining ſo high a degree of perfection in ſcience as the male. Yet ſhe hopes to be forgiven when ſhe obſerves alſo, that as it does not ſeem to derive the chief portion of its excellence from extraordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of this kind, it is not at all leſſened by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of not poſſeſſing them. It is readily allowed, that the ſex have lively imaginations, and thoſe exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite perceptions of the beautiful and defective, which come under the denomination of Taſte. But preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to that ſtrength of intellect, which is requiſite to penetrate into the abſtruſer walks of literature, it is preſumed they will readily relinquiſh. There are green paſtures, and pleaſant vallies, where they may wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſafety to themſelves, and delight to others. They may cultivate the roſes of imagination, and the valuable fruits of morals and criticiſm; but the ſteeps of Parnaſſus few, comparatively, have attempted to ſcale with ſucceſs. And when it is conſidered, that many languages, and many ſciences, muſt contribute to the perfection of poetical compoſition, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear leſs ſtrange. The lofty Epic, the pointed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and the more daring and ſucceſsful flights of the Tragic Muſe, ſeem reſerved for the bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers of the other ſex.</p>
            <p>NOR does this aſſertion, it is apprehended, at all injure the intereſts of the women; they have other pretenſions, on which to value themſelves, and other qualities much better calculated to anſwer their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſes. We are enamoured of the ſoft ſtrains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan Muſe, while, to the ſweet notes of the paſtoral reed, they ſing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Shepherds, the Bleſſings of Love, or the innocent Delights of rural Life. Has it ever been aſcribed to them as a defect, that their Eclogues
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019810_0006_0FACB40D0396DA90"/>
do not treat of active ſcenes, of buſy cities, and of waſting war? No: their ſimplicity is their perfection, and they are only blamed when they have too little of it.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, the lofty bards who ſtrung their bolder harps to higher meaſures, and ſung the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Peleus' Son,</hi> and <hi>Man's firſt Diſobedience,</hi> have never been cenſured for want of ſweetneſs and refinement. The ſublime, the nervous, and the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, characteriſe their compoſitions; as the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, the ſoft, and the delicate, mark thoſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Grandeur, dignity, and force, diſtinguiſh the one ſpecies; eaſe, ſimplicity, and purity the other. Both ſhine from their native, diſtinct, unborrowed merits, not from thoſe which are foreign, adventitious, and unnatural. Yet thoſe excellencies, which make up the eſſential and conſtituent parts of poetry, they have in common.</p>
            <p>WOMEN have generally quicker preceptions: men have juſter ſentiments.—Women conſider how things may be prettily ſaid; men how they may be properly ſaid.—In women, (young ones at leaſt) ſpeaking accompanies, and ſometimes precedes reflection; in men, reflection is the antecedent.—Women ſpeak to ſhine or to pleaſe; men, to convince or confute.—Women admire what is brilliant; men what is ſolid.—Women prefer an extemporaneous ſally of wit, or a ſparkling effuſion of fancy, before the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reaſoning, or the moſt laborious inveſtigation of facts. In literary compoſition, women are pleaſed with point, turn, and antitheſis; men with obſervation, and a juſt deduction of effects from their cauſes.—Women are fond of incident, men of argument.—Women admire paſſionately, men approve cautiouſly.—One ſex will think it betrays a want of feeling to be moderate in their applauſe, the other will be afraid of expoſing a want of judgment by being in raptures
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019810_0007_0FACB40DE958ABC8"/>
with any thing.—Men refuſe to give way to the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they actually feel, while women ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to be tranſported beyond what the occaſion will juſtify.</p>
            <p>As a farther confirmation of what has been advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the different bent of the underſtanding in the ſexes, it may be obſerved, that we have heard of many female wits, but never of one female logician—of many admirable writers of memoirs, but never of one chronologer.—In the boundleſs and aerial regions of romance, and in that faſhionable ſpecies of compoſition which ſucceded it, and which carries a nearer approx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imation to the manners of the world, the women can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excelled: this imaginary ſoil they have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar talent for cultivating, becauſe here,
<q>Invention labours more, and judgment leſs.</q>

It farther conſiſts in the art of intereſting the tender feelings by a pathetic repreſentation of thoſe minute, endearing, domeſtic circumſtances, which take captive the ſoul before it has time to ſhield itſelf with the armour of reflection. To amuſe, rather than to inſtruct, or to inſtruct indirectly by ſhort inferences, drawn from a long concatenation of circumſtances, is at once the buſineſs of this ſort of compoſition, and one of the characteriſtics of female genius<note n="*" place="bottom">THE author does not apprehend it makes againſt her GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL poſition, that this nation can boaſt a female critic, poet, hiſtorian, linguiſt, philoſopher, and moraliſt, equal to moſt of the other ſex.

IN ſhort, it appears that the mind in each ſex has ſome natural kind of bias, which conſtitutes a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of character, and that the happineſs of both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, in a great meaſure, on the preſervation and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of this diſtinction. For where would be the ſuperior pleaſure and ſatisfaction reſulting from mixed converſation, if this difference were aboliſhed? If the qualities of both were invariably and exactly the ſame, no benefit or entertainment would ariſe from the tedious and inſipid uniformity of ſuch an intercourſe; whereas conſiderable advantages are reaped from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſociety of both ſexes. The rough angles and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities of male manners are imperceptibly filed, and gradually worn ſmooth, by the poliſhing of female con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the refining of female taſte; while the ideas of women acquire ſtrength and ſolidity, by their aſſociating with ſenſible, intelligent, and judicious men.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, (even if fame be the object of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit) is it not better to ſucceed as women, than to fail as men? To ſhine, by walking honourably in the road which nature, cuſtom, and education ſeem to have marked out, rather than to counteract them all, by moving awkwardly in a path diametrically oppoſite? To be good originals, rather than bad imitators? In a word, to be excellent women, rather than indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men?</p>

            <p>AS an argument in favour of modern manners, it has has been pleaded, that the ſofter vices of Luxury and Diſſipation, belong rather to gentle and yielding tempers, than to ſuch as are rugged and ferocious: that they are vices which increaſe civilization, and tend to promote refinement, and the cultivation of humanity.</p>
            <p>BUT this is an aſſertion, the truth of which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all ages contradicts. Nero was not leſs a tyrant for being a ſidler; He<note n="*" place="bottom">The Emperor Caligula.</note> who wiſhed the whole Roman people had but one neck, that he might diſpatch them at a blow, was himſelf the moſt debauched man in Rome; and Sydney and Ruſſel were condemned to bleed under the moſt barbarous, though moſt diſſipated and voluptuous, reign that ever diſgraced the annals of Britain.</p>
            <p>THE love of diſſipation is, I believe, allowed to be the reigning evil of the preſent day. It is an evil which many content themſelves with regretting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking to redreſs. A diſſipated life is cenſured
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019810_0010_0FACB40FD4C707E0"/>
in the very act of diſſipation, and prodigality of time is as gravely declaimed againſt at the card table, as in the pulpit.</p>
            <p>THE lover of dancing cenſures the amuſements of the theatre for their dulneſs, and the gameſter blames them both for their levity. She, whoſe whole ſoul is ſwallowed up in <hi>"opera extacies,"</hi> is aſtoniſhed, that her acquaintance can ſpend whole nights in preying, like harpies, on the fortunes of their fellow-creatures; while the grave ſober ſinner, who paſſes her pale and anxious vigils, in this faſhionable ſort of pillaging, is no leſs ſurprized how the other can waſte her precious time in hearing ſounds for which ſhe has no taſte, in a language ſhe does not underſtand.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, every one ſeems convinced, that the evil ſo much complained of does really exiſt ſomewhere, though all are inwardly perſuaded that it is not with themſelves. All deſire a general reformation, but few will liſten to propoſals of particular amendment; the body muſt be reſtored, but each limb begs to remain as it is; and accuſations which concern all, will be likely to affect none. They think that ſin, like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is diviſible, and that what is ſcattered among ſo many, cannot materially affect any one; and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals contribute ſeparately to that evil which they in general lament.</p>
            <p>THE prevailing manners of an age depend more than we are aware, or are willing to allow, on the conduct of the women; this is one of the principal hinges on which the great machine of human ſociety turns. Thoſe who allow the influence which female graces have, in contributing to poliſh the manners of men, would do well to reflect how great an influence female morals muſt alſo have on their conduct. How much then is it to be regretted, that the Britiſh la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould ever ſit down contented to poliſh, when they are able to reform, to entertain, when they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019810_0011_0FACB412B67D0538"/>
might inſtruct, and to dazzle for an hour, when they are candidates for eternity!</p>
            <p>UNDER the diſpenſation of Mahomet's law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, theſe mental excellencies cannot be expected, becauſe the women are ſhut out from all opportunities of inſtruction, and excluded from the endearing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a delightful and equal ſociety; and, as a charming poet ſings, are taught to believe, that
<q>

            <p>THESE act conſiſtently in ſtudying none but exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior graces, in cultivating only perſonal attractions, and in trying to lighten the intolerable burden of time, by the moſt frivolous and vain amuſements. They act in conſequence of their own blind belief, and the tyranny of their deſpotic maſters; for they have neither the freedom of a preſent choice, nor the proſpect of a future being.</p>
            <p>BUT in this land of civil and religious liberty, where there is as little deſpotiſm exerciſed over the minds as over the perſons of women, they have every liberty of choice, and every opportunity of improvement; and how greatly does this increaſe their obligation to be exemplary in their general conduct, attentive to the government of their families, and inſtrumental to the good order of ſociety!</p>
            <p>SHE who is at a loſs to find amuſements at home, can no longer apologize for her diſſipation abroad, by ſaying ſhe is deprived of the benefit and the pleaſure of books: and ſhe who regrets being doomed to a ſtate of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the injuſtice, or tyranny of the men, complains of an evil which does not exiſt.</p>

IT it a queſtion frequently in the mouths of illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſſipated females—"What good is there in reading? To what end does it conduce?" It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, too obvious to need inſiſting on, that unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, as the beſt things may be, reading anſwers many excellent purpoſes beſides the great leading one, and is perhaps the ſafeſt remedy for diſſipation. She who dedicates a portion of her leiſure to uſeful read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, feels her mind in a conſtant progreſſive ſtate of improvement, whilſt the mind of a diſſipated woman is continually loſing ground. An active ſpirit rejoiceth, like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The remark may perhaps be thought too ſtrong, but I believe it is true, that next to religious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, an habit of ſtudy is the moſt probable preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the virtue of young perſons. Thoſe who cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate letters have rarely a ſtrong paſſion for promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous viſiting, or diſſipated ſociety; ſtudy therefore induces a reliſh for domeſtic life, the moſt deſirable temper in the world for women. Study, as it reſcues the mind from an inordinate fondneſs for gaming, dreſs, and public amuſements, is an oeconomical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity; for a lady may read at much leſs expence than ſhe can play at cards; as it requires ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it gives the mind an habit of induſtry; as it is a relief againſt that mental diſeaſe, which the French emphatically call <hi>ennui,</hi> it cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019810_0013_0FACB416F27ED970"/>
knowledge of the Supreme Being, and his laws, it riſes into an act of religion.</p>
            <p>The rage for reformation commonly ſhews itſelf in a violent zeal for ſuppreſſing what is wrong, rather than a prudent attention to eſtabliſh what is right; but we ſhall never obtain a fair garden merely by rooting up weeds, we muſt alſo plant flowers; for the natural richneſs of the ſoil we have been clearing will not ſuffer it to lie barren, but whether it ſhall be vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or beneficially prolific, depends on the culture. What the preſent age has gained on one ſide, by a more enlarged and liberal way of thinking, ſeems to be loſt on the other, by exceſſive freedom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded indulgence. Knowledge is not, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, confined to the dull cloyſter, or the gloomy college, but diſſeminated, to a certain degree, among both ſexes and almoſt all ranks. The only misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, that theſe opportunities do not ſeem to be ſo wiſely improved, or turned to ſo good an account as might be wiſhed. Books of a pernicious, idle, and frivolous ſort, are too much multiplied, and it is from the very redundancy of them that true knowledge is ſo ſcarce, and the habit of diſſipation ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>IT has been remarked, that the prevailing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the preſent age is not that of groſs immorality: but if this is meant of thoſe in the higher walks of life, it is eaſy to diſcern, that there can be but little merit in abſtaining from crimes which there is but little temptation to commit. It is, however, to be feared, that a gradual defection from piety, will in time draw after it all the bad conſequences of more active vice; for whether mounds and fences are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly deſtroyed by a ſweeping torrent, or worn away through gradual neglect, the effect is equally deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. As a rapid fever and a conſuming hectic are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fatal to our natural health, ſo are flagrant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019810_0014_0FACB4175CDA1008"/>
and torpid indolence to our moral well being.</p>
            <p>THE philoſophical doctrine of the ſlow receſſion of bodies from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un, is a lively image of the reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with which we firſt abandon the light of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The beginning of folly, and the firſt entrance on a diſſipated life, coſt ſome pangs to a well diſpoſed heart; but it is ſurpriſing to ſee how ſoon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ceaſes to be impeded by reflection, or ſlackened by remorſe. For it is in moral as in natural things, the motion in minds as well as bodies is accelerated by a nearer approach to the centre to which they are tending. If we recede ſlowly at firſt ſetting out, we advance rapidly in our future courſe; and to have begun to be wrong, is already to have made a great progreſs.</p>
            <p>A CONSTANT habit of amuſement relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders it totally incapable of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſtudy, or virtue. Diſſipation not only indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes its votaries to every thing uſeful and excellent, but diſqualifies them for the enjoyment of pleaſure it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It ſoftens the ſoul ſo much, that the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial employment becomes a labour, and the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inconvenience an agony. The luxurious Sybarite muſt have loſt all ſenſe of real enjoyment, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for true gratification, before he complained that he could not ſleep, becauſe the roſe leaves lay double under him.</p>
            <p>LUXURY and diſſipation, ſoft and gentle as their approaches are, and ſilently as they throw their ſilken chains about the heart, enſlave it more than the moſt active and turbulent vices. The mightieſt conquerors have been conquered by thoſe unarmed foes: the flowery ſetters are faſtened, before they are felt. The blandiſhments of Circe were more fatal to the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Ulyſſes, than the ſtrength of Polypheme, or the brutality of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

In ſhort, he had ceaſed to love virtue long before he thought of committing actual vice; and the duties of a manly piety were burdenſome to him, before he was ſo debaſed as to offer perfumes, and burn incenſe on the altar of the licentious goddeſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Nothing can be more admirable than the manner in which this allegory is conducted; and the whole work, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ſilence of liſtleſs ignorance, and the ſilence of ſparkling intelligence, are perhaps as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately marked, and as diſtinctly expreſſed, as the ſame feelings could have been by the moſt unequivocal lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. A woman, in a company where ſhe has the leaſt influence, may promote any ſubject by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and invariable attention, which ſhews that ſhe is pleaſed with it, and by an illuminated countenance, which proves ſhe underſtands it. This obliging atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the moſt flattering encouragement in the world to men of ſenſe and letters, to continue any topic of inſtruction or entertainment they happen to be engaged in: it owed its introduction perhaps to accident, the beſt introduction in the world for a ſubject of ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which, though it could not have been formally propoſed without pedantry, may be continued with eaſe and good humour; but which will be frequently and effectually ſtopped by the liſtleſſneſs, inattention,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019810_0020_0FACB41BE77AD790"/>
or whiſpering of ſilly girls, whoſe wearineſs betrays their ignorance, and whoſe impatience expoſes their ill-breeding. A polite man, however deeply intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſubject on which he is converſing, catches at the ſlighteſt hint to have done: a look is a ſufficient intimation, and if a pretty ſimpleton, who ſits near him, ſeems <hi>diſtraite,</hi> he puts an end to his remarks, to the great regret of the reaſonable part of the company, who perhaps might have gained more improvement by the continuance of ſuch a converſation, than a week's reading would have yielded them; for it is ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as this, that give an edge to each other's wit, "as iron ſharpeneth iron."</p>
            <p>THAT ſilence is one of the great arts of converſation is allowed by Cicero himſelf, who ſays, there is not only an art but even an eloquence in it. And this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord Bacon.</note>, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing little anecdote from one of the ancients:</p>
            <p>WHEN many Grecian philoſophers had a ſolemn meeting before the ambaſſador of a foreign prince, each endeavoured to ſhew his parts by the brilliancy of his converſation, that the ambaſſador might have ſomething to relate of the Grecian wiſdom. One of them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity of his companions, obſerved a profound ſilence; when the ambaſſador, turning to him, aſked, <q>But what have you to ſay, that I may report it?</q> He made this laconic, but very pointed reply: <q>Tell your king that you have found one among the Greeks who knew how to be ſilent.</q>

            <p>THERE is a quality infinitely more intoxicating to the female mind than knowledge—this is Wit, the moſt captivating, but the moſt dreaded of all talents: the moſt dangerous to thoſe who have it, and the moſt feared by thoſe who have it not. Though it is againſt all the rules, yet I cannot find in my heart to abuſe this charming quality. He who is grown rich with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

it, in ſafe and ſober dulneſs, ſhuns it as a diſeaſe, and looks upon poverty as its invariable concomitant. The moraliſt declaims againſt it as the ſource of irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and the frugal citizen dreads it more than bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy itſelf, for he conſiders it as the parent of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and beggary. The Cynic will aſk of what uſe it is? Of very little perhaps: no more is a flower gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and yet it is allowed as an object of innocent amuſement and delightful recreation. A woman, who poſſeſſes this quality, has received a moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſent, perhaps not leſs ſo than beauty itſelf: eſpecially if it be not ſheathed in a temper peculiarly inoffenſive, chaſtiſed by a moſt correct judgment, and reſtrained by more prudence than falls to the common lot.</p>
            <p>THIS talent is more likely to make a woman vain than knowledge; for as Wit is the immediate property of its poſſeſſor, and learning is only an acquaintance with the knowledge of other people, there is much more danger, that we ſhould be vain of what is our own, than of what we borrow.</p>
            <p>BUT Wit, like learning, is not near ſo common a thing as is imagined. Let not therefore a young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be alarmed at the acuteneſs of her own wit, any more than at the abundance of her own knowledge. The great danger is, leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake pertneſs, flippancy, or imprudence, for this brilliant quality, or imagine ſhe is witty, only becauſe ſhe is indiſcreet. This is very frequently the caſe, and this makes the name of wit ſo cheap, while its real exiſtence is ſo rare.</p>
            <p>LEST the flattery of her acquaintance, or an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening opinion of her own qualifications, ſhould lead ſome vain and petulant girl into a falſe notion that ſhe has a great deal of wit, when ſhe has only a redundancy of animal ſpirits, ſhe may not find it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to attend to the definition of this quality, by one

            <p>BUT thoſe who actually poſſeſs this rare talent, cannot be too abſtinent in the uſe of it. It often makes admirers, but it never makes friends; I mean, where it is the predominant feature; and the unprotect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defenceleſs ſtate of womanhood calls for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip more than for admiration. She who does not deſire friends has a ſordid and inſenſible ſoul; but ſhe who is ambitious of making every man her admirer, has an invincible vanity, and a cold heart.</p>
            <p>BUT to dwell only on the ſide of policy, a prudent woman, who has eſtabliſhed the reputation of ſome genius, will ſufficiently maintain it, without keeping her faculties always on the ſtretch to ſay <hi>good things.</hi> Nay, if reputation alone be her object, ſhe will gain a more ſolid one by her forbearance, as the wiſer part of her acquaintance will aſcribe it to the right motive, which is, not that ſhe has leſs wit, but that ſhe has more judgment.</p>
            <p>THE fatal fondneſs for indulging a ſpirit of ridicule, and the injurious and irreparable conſequences which ſometimes attend the <hi>too prompt reply,</hi> can never be too ſeriouſly or too ſeverely condemned. Not to offend is the firſt ſtep towards pleaſing. To give pain is as much an offence againſt humanity, as againſt good breeding; and ſurely it is as well to abſtain from an action becauſe it is ſinful, as becauſe it is unpolite. In
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019810_0023_0FACB420E7850120"/>
company, young ladies would do well before they ſpeak, to reflect, if what they are going to ſay may not diſtreſs ſome worthy perſon preſent, by wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their perſons, families, connexions, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious opinions. If they find it will touch them in either of theſe, I would adviſe them to ſuſpect, that what they are going to ſay, is not ſo <hi>very</hi> good a thing as they at firſt imagined. Nay, if even it was one of thoſe bright ideas, which <hi>Venus has imbued with a fifth part of her nectar,</hi> ſo much greater will be their merit in ſuppreſſing it, if there was a probability it might offend. Indeed, if they have the temper and prudence to make ſuch a previous reflection, they will be more richly rewarded by their own inward triumph, at having ſuppreſſed a lively but ſevere remark, than they could have been with the diſſembled applauſes of the whole company, who, with that complaiſant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which good breeding too much authoriſes, affect openly to admire what they ſecretly reſolve never to forgive.</p>
            <p>I HAVE always been delighted with the ſtory of the little girl's eloquence, in one of the Children's Tales, who received from a friendly Fairy the gift, that at every word ſhe uttered, pinks, roſes, diamonds and pearls, ſhould drop from her mouth. The hidden moral appears to be this, that it was the ſweetneſs of her temper which produced this pretty fanciful effect: for when her malicious ſiſter deſired the ſame gift from the good natured tiny Intelligence, the venom of her own heart converted it into poiſonous and loathſome reptiles.</p>
            <p>A MAN of ſenſe and breeding will ſometimes join in the laugh, which has been raiſed at his expence by an ill-natured repartee; but if it was very cutting, and one of thoſe ſhocking ſort of truths, which as they can ſcarcely be pardoned even in private, ought never to be uttered in public, he does not laugh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019810_0024_0FACB42108458208"/>
he is pleaſed, but becauſe he wiſhes to conceal how much he is hurt. As the ſarcaſm was uttered by a lady, ſo far from ſeeming to reſent it, he will be the firſt to commend it; but notwithſtanding that, he will remember it as a trait of malice, when the whole company ſhall have forgotten it as a ſtroke of wit. Women are ſo far from being privileged by their ſex to ſay unhandſome or cruel things, that this is the very circumſtance which renders them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. When the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is no relief to him who is wounded to reflect, that the hand which ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him was a fair one.</p>
            <p>MANY women, when they have a favourite point to gain, or an earneſt wiſh to bring any one over to their opinion, often uſe a very diſingenuous method: they will ſtate a caſe ambiguouſly, and then avail themſelves of it, in whatever manner ſhall beſt anſwer their purpoſe; leaving your mind in a ſtate of indeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as to their real meaning, while they triumph in the perplexity they have given you by the unfair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions they draw, from premiſes equivocally ſtated. They will alſo frequently argue from exceptions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of rules, and are aſtoniſhed when you are not willing to be contented with a prejudice, inſtead of a reaſon.</p>
            <p>IN a ſenſible company of both ſexes, where women are not reſtrained by any other reſerve than what their natural modeſty impoſes; and where the intimacy of all parties authoriſes the utmoſt freedom of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſhould any one inquire what were the general ſentiments on ſome particular ſubject, it will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, commonly happen that the ladies whoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have kept pace with the narration, have anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated its end, and are ready to deliver their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on it, as ſoon as it is finiſhed.

It is eaſier to confound than to convince an opponent; the former may be effected by a turn that has more happineſs than truth in it. Many an excellent reaſoner, well ſkilled in the theory of the ſchools, has felt himſelf diſcom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itted by a reply, which, though as wide of the mark, and as foreign to the queſtion as can be conceived, has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted him more than the moſt ſtartling propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the moſt accurate chain of reaſoning could have done; and he has borne the laugh of his fair antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, as well as of the whole company, though he could not but feel, that his own argument was attended with the fulleſt demonſtration: ſo true it is, that it is not always neceſſary to be right in order to be applauded.</p>
            <p>BUT let not a young lady's vanity be too much elated with this falſe applauſe, which is given, not to merit, but to her ſex: ſhe has not perhaps gained a victory, though ſhe may be allowed a triumph; and it ſhould humble her to reflect, that the tribute is paid, not to her ſtrength but to her weakneſs. It is worth while to diſcriminate between that applauſe, which is given from the complaiſance of others, and that which is paid to our own merit.</p>
            <p>WHERE great ſprightlineſs is the natural bent of the temper, girls ſhould endeavour to habituate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019810_0026_0FACB423929C0DA8"/>
to a cuſtom of obſerving, thinking, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I do not mean that they ſhould devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to abſtruſe ſpeculation, or the ſtudy of logic; but ſhe who is accuſtomed to give a due arrangement to her thoughts, to reaſon juſtly and pertinently on common affairs, and judiciouſly to deduce effects from their cauſes, will be a better logician than ſome of thoſe who claim the name, becauſe they have ſtudied the art: this is being "learned without the rules;" the beſt definition, perhaps, of that ſort of literature which is propereſt for the ſex. That ſpecies of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which appears to be the reſult of reflection rather than of ſcience, ſits peculiarly well on wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. It is not uncommon to find a lady, who, though ſhe does not know a rule of Syntax, ſcarcely ever vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates one; and who conſtructs every ſentence ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with more propriety than many a learned dunce, who has every rule of Ariſtotle by heart, and who can lace his own thread-bare diſcourſe with the golden ſhreds of Cicero and Virgil.</p>
            <p>IT has been objected, and I fear with ſome reaſon, that female converſation is too frequently tinctured with a cenſorious ſpirit, and that ladies are ſeldom apt to diſcover much tenderneſs for the errors of a fallen ſiſter.
<q>If it be ſo, it is a grievous fault.</q>
No arguments can juſtify, no pleas can extenuate it. To inſult over the miſeries of an unhappy creature is inhuman, not to compaſſionate them is unchriſtian. The worthy part of the ſex always expreſs themſelves humanely on the failings of others, in proportion to their own undeviating goodneſs.</p>
            <p>AND here I cannot help remarking, that young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do not always carefully diſtinguiſh between run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the error of detraction, and its oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019810_0027_0FACB42408940798"/>
of indiſcriminate applauſe. This proceeds from the falſe idea they entertain, that the direct contrary to what is wrong muſt be right. Thus the dread of being only ſuſpected of one fault makes them actually guilty of another. The deſire of avoiding the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of envy, impels them to be inſincere; and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a reputation for ſweetneſs of temper and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, they affect ſometimes to ſpeak of very indifferent characters with the moſt extravagant applauſe. With ſuch the hyperbole is a favourite figure; and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of compariſon but the ſuperlative is rejected, as cold and inexpreſſive. But this habit of exaggeration greatly weakens their credit, and deſtroys the weight of their opinion on other occaſions; for people very ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what degree of faith is to be given both to their judgment and veracity. And thoſe of real merit will no more be flattered by that approbation, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh the value of what it praiſes, than the celebrated painter muſt have been at the judgment paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on his works by an ignorant ſpectator, who, being aſked what he thought of ſuch and ſuch very capital but very different pieces, cried out in an affected rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "All alike! all alike!"</p>
            <p>IT has been propoſed to the young, as a maxim of ſupreme wiſdom, to manage ſo dexterouſly in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as to appear to be well acquainted with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, of which they are totally ignorant; and this, by affecting ſilence in regard to thoſe, on which they are known to excel.—But why counſel this diſingenuous fraud? Why add to the numberleſs arts of deceit, this practiſe of deceiving, as it were, on a ſettled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple? If to diſavow the knowledge they really have, be a culpable affectation, then certainly to inſinuate an idea of their ſkill, where they are actually ignorant, is a moſt unworthy artifice.</p>
            <p>BUT of all the qualifications for converſation, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, if not the moſt brilliant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANGER is leſs reaſonable and more ſincere than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.—Anger breaks out abruptly; envy is a great prefacer—anger wiſhes to be underſtood at once; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is fond of remote hints and ambiguities; but, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as its oracles are, it never ceaſes to deliver them till they are perfectly comprehended:—anger repeats

his malice out of calamity itſelf, if he finds his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary bears it with dignity, or is pitied or aſſiſted in it. The rage of the paſſionate man is totally extinguiſhed by the death of his enemy: but the hatred of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious is not buried even in the grave of his rival: he will envy the good name he has left behind him; he will envy him the tears of his widow, the proſperity of his children, the eſteem of his friends, the praiſes of his epitaph—nay, the very magnificence of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>"THE ear of jealouſy heareth all things," (ſays the wiſe man) frequently I believe more than is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, which makes the company of perſons infected with it ſtill more dangerous.</p>
            <p>WHEN you tell thoſe of a malicious turn, any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that has happened to another, though they perfectly know of whom you are ſpeaking, they often affect to be at a loſs, to forget his name, or to miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend you in ſome reſpect or other; and this, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have an opportunity of ſlily gratifying their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, by mentioning ſome unhappy defect or perſonal infirmity he labours under; and not contented "to tack his every error to his name," they will by way of farther explanation, have recourſe to the faults of his father, or the misfortunes of his family; and this, with all the ſeeming ſimplicity and candour in the world, merely for the ſake of preventing miſtakes, and to clear up every doubt of his identity.—If you are ſpeaking of a lady, for inſtance, they will perhaps em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh their enquiries, by aſking if you mean her, whoſe great grandfather was a bankrupt, though ſhe has the vanity to keep a chariot, while others who are much better born walk on foot; for they will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recollect, that you may poſſibly mean her couſin, of the ſame name, whoſe mother was ſuſpected of ſuch or ſuch an indiſcretion, though the daughter had the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019810_0033_0FACB428CBB52D58"/>
luck to make her fortune by marrying, while her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are overlooked.</p>
            <p>TO <hi>hint at a fault,</hi> does more miſchief than ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; for whatever is left for the imagination to finiſh, will not fail to be overdone: every haitus will be more than filled up, and every pauſe more than ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. There is leſs malice, and leſs miſchief too, in telling a man's name than the initials of it; as a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier perſon may be involved in the moſt diſgraceful ſuſpicions by ſuch a dangerous ambiguity.</p>
            <p>IT is not uncommon for the envious, after having attempted to deface the faireſt character ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that they are afraid you will begin to detect their malice, to endeavour to remove your ſuſpicions effectually, by aſſuring you, that what they have juſt related is only the popular opinion; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can never believe things are ſo bad as they are ſaid to be; for their part it is a rule with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to hope the beſt. It is their way never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or report ill of any one. They will, however, mention the ſtory in all companies, that they may do their friend the ſervices of proteſting their diſbelief of it. More reputations are thus hinted away by falſe friends, than are openly deſtroyed by public enemies. An <hi>if,</hi> or a <hi>but,</hi> or a mortified look, or a languid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or an ambiguous ſhake of the head, or a haſty word affectedly recalled, will demoliſh a character more effectually, than the whole artillery of malice when openly levelled againſt it.</p>
            <p>IT is not that envy never praiſes—No, that would be making a public profeſſion of itſelf, and advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own malignity; whereas the greateſt ſucceſs of its efforts depends on the concealment of their end. When envy intends to ſtrike a ſtroke of Machiaveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an policy, it ſometimes affects the language of the moſt exaggerated applauſe; though it generally takes care, that the ſubject of its panegyric ſhall be a very
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019810_0034_0FACB42970DFF680"/>
indifferent and common character, ſo that it is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware none of its praiſes will ſtick.</p>
            <p>IT is the unhappy nature of envy not to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with poſitive miſery, but to be continually aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating its own torments, by comparing them with the felicities of others. The eyes of envy are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fixed on the object which diſturbs it, nor can it avert them from it, though to procure itſelf the relief of a temporary forgetfulneſs.

            <p>AS this enormous ſin chiefly inſtigated the revolt, and brought on the ruin of the angelic ſpirits, ſo it is not improbable, that it will be a principal inſtrument of miſery in a future world, for the envious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their deſperate condition with the happineſs of the children of God; and to heighten their actual wretchedneſs by reflecting on what they have loſt.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS envy, like lying and ingratitude, is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with more frequency, becauſe it is practiſed with impunity; but there being no human laws againſt theſe crimes, is ſo far from an inducement to commit them, that this very conſideration would be ſufficient to deter the wiſe and good, if all others were ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; for of how heinous a nature muſt thoſe ſins be, which are judged above the reach of human puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are reſerved for the final juſtice of God himſelf!</p>

            <p>THE preſent age may be termed, by way of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Age of Sentiment, a word which, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication it now bears, was unknown to our plain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Sentiment is the varniſh of virtue to conceal the deformity of vice; and it is not uncommon for the ſame perſons to make a jeſt of religion, to break through the moſt ſolemn ties and engagements, to practiſe every art of latent fraud and open ſeduction, and yet to value themſelves on ſpeaking and writing <hi>ſentimentally.</hi>

            <p>ERROR is never likely to do ſo much miſchief as when it diſguiſes its real tendency, and puts on an engaging and attractive appearance. Many a young woman, who would be ſhocked at the imputation of an intrigue, is extremely flattered at the idea of a ſentimental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, though perhaps with a dangerous and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, who, by putting on this maſk of plauſibility and virtue, diſarms her of her prudence, lays her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions aſleep, and involves her in miſery; miſery the more inevitable becauſe unſuſpected. For ſhe who apprehends no danger, will not think it neceſſary to be always upon her guard; but will rather invite than avoid the ruin which comes under ſo ſpecious and ſo fair a form.</p>
            <p>SUCH an engagement will be infinitely dearer to her vanity than an avowed and authoriſed attachment; for one of theſe ſentimental lovers will not ſcruple very ſeriouſly to aſſure a credulous girl, that her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled merit entitles her to the adoration of the whole, world, and that the univerſal homage of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is nothing more than the unavoidable tribute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by her charms. No wonder then ſhe ſhould be ſo eaſily prevailed on to believe, that an individual is captivated by perfections which might enſlave a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. But ſhe ſhould remember, that he who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to intoxicate her with adulation, intends one day moſt effectually to humble her. For an artful man has always a ſecret deſign to pay himſelf in future for every preſent ſacrifice. And this prodigality of praiſe, which he now appears to laviſh with ſuch thoughtleſs profuſion, is, in fact, a ſum oeconomically laid out to ſupply his future neceſſities: of this ſum he keeps an exact eſtimate, and at ſome diſtant day promiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt exorbitant intereſt for it. If he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019810_0037_0FACB42B8FA3D860"/>
and conduct, and the object of his purſuit much vanity, and ſome ſenſibility, he ſeldom fails of ſucceſs; for ſo powerful will be his aſcendancy over her mind, that ſhe will ſoon adopt his notions and opinions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is more than probable ſhe poſſeſſed moſt of them before, having gradually acquired them in her i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>THE lover, deeply verſed in all the obliquities of fraud, and ſkilled to wind himſelf into every avenue of the heart which indiſcretion has left unguarded, ſoon diſcovers on which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>de it is moſt acceſſible. He avails himſelf of this weakneſs by addreſſing her in a language exactly conſonant to her own ideas. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks her with her own weapons, and oppoſes rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody to ſentiment.—He profeſſes ſo ſovereign a contempt for the paltry concerns of money, that ſhe thinks it her duty to reward him for ſo generous a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation. Every plea he artfully advances of his own unworthineſs, is conſidered by her as a freſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which her gratitude muſt anſwer. And ſhe makes it a point of honour to ſacrifice to him that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which he is too noble to regard. Theſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of humility are the common artifice of the vain; and theſe proteſtations of generoſity the refuge of the rapacious. And among its many ſmooth miſchiefs, it is one of the ſure and ſucceſsful frauds of ſentiment, to affect the frigid indifference to thoſe external and pecuniary advantages, which it is its great and real object to obtain.</p>
            <p>A SENTIMENTAL girl very rarely entertains any doubt of her perſonal beauty; for ſhe has been daily accuſtomed to contempl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it from others. She will not therefore be very ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the confirmation of a truth ſo ſelf-evident; but ſhe ſuſpects, that her pretenſions to underſtanding are more likely to be diſputed, and, for that reaſon greedily devours every compliment offered to thoſe perfections, which are leſs obvious and more refined. She is perſuaded that men need only open their eyes to decide on her beauty, while it will be the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of the taſte, ſenſe, and elegance of her admirer, that he can diſcern and flatter thoſe qualities in her. A man of the character here ſuppoſed, will eaſily inſinuate himſelf into her affections, by means of this latent but leading foible, which may be called the guiding clue to a ſentimental heart. He will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to overlook that beauty which attracts common eyes, and enſnares common hearts, while he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the moſt delicate praiſes on the beauties of her mind, and finiſh the climax of adulation, by hinting that ſhe is ſuperior to it.</p>

            <p>BUT nothing, in general, can end leſs delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than theſe ſublime attachments, even where no acts of ſeduction were ever practiſed, but they are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like mere ſublunary connexions, to terminate in the vulgar cataſtrophe of marriage. That wealth, which lately ſeemed to be looked on with ineffable contempt by the lover, now appears to be the principal attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the eyes of the huſband; and he, who but a few ſhort weeks before, in a tranſport of ſentimental generoſity, wiſhed her to have been a village maid, with no portion but her crook and her beauty, and that they might ſpend their days in paſtoral love and innocence, has now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

ON the other hand, ſhe who was lately
<q>An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,</q>
is ſhocked to find herſelf at once ſtripped of all her ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial attributes. This late divinity, who ſcarcely yielded to her ſiſters of the ſky, now finds hereſelf of leſs importance in the eſteem of the man ſhe has choſen, than any other mere mortal woman. No longer is ſhe gratified with the tear of counterfeited paſſion, the ſigh of diſſembled rapture, or the language of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated adoration. No longer is the altar of her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity loaded with the oblations of fictitious fondneſs, the incenſe of falſehood, or the ſacrifice of flattery.—Her apotheoſis is ended!—She feels herſelf degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dignities and privileges of a goddeſs, to all the imperfections, vanities, and weakneſſes of a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woman, and a neglected wife. Her faults which were ſo lately overlooked, or miſtaken for virtues, are now, as Caſſius ſays, ſet in a note-book. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was vowed eternal, laſted only a few ſhort weeks; and the indifference, which was ſo far from being included in the bargain, that it was not ſo much as ſuſpected, follows them through the whole tireſome journey of their inſipid, vacant, joyleſs exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>THUS much for the <hi>completion</hi> of the ſentimental hiſtory. If we trace it back to its beginning, we ſhall find that a damſel of this caſt had her head ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally turned by pernicious reading, and her inſanity confirmed by imprudent friendſhips. She never fails to ſelect a beloved <hi>confidante</hi> of her own turn and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, though, if ſhe can help it, not quite ſo handſome as herſelf. A violent intimacy enſues, or, to ſpeak the language of ſentiment, an intimate union of ſouls immediately takes place, which is wrought to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019810_0040_0FACB431752A07F8"/>
though they live in the ſame ſtreet, or perhaps in the ſame houſe. This is the fuel which principally feeds and ſupplies the dangerous flame of ſentiment. In this correſpondence the two friends encourage each other in the falſeſt notions imaginable They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent romantic love as the great important buſineſs of human life, and deſcribe all the other concerns of it as too low and paltry to merit the attention of ſuch elevated beings, and fit only to employ the daughters of the plodding vulgar. In theſe letters, family affairs are miſrepreſented, family ſecrets divulged, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly misfortunes aggravated. They are filled with vows of eternal amity, and proteſtations of never-ending love. But interjections and quotations are the principal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments of theſe very ſublime epiſtles. Every pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric contained in them is extravagant and hyperbolical, every cenſure exaggerated and exceſſive. In a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, every frailty is heightened into a perfection, and in a foe, degraded into a crime. The dramatic poets, eſpecially the moſt tender and romantic, are quoted in almoſt every line, and every pompous or pathetic thought is forced to give up its natural and obvious meaning, and with all the violence of miſapplication, is compelled to ſuit ſome circumſtance of imaginary woe of the fair tranſcriber. Alicia is not too mad for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild for her ſoft emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>FATHERS <hi>have flinty hearts,</hi> is an expreſſion worth an empire, and is always uſed with peculiar emphaſis and enthuſiaſm. For a favourite topic of theſe epiſtles is the groveling ſpirit and ſordid temper of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who will be ſure to find no quarter at the hands of their daughters, ſhould they preſume to be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as to direct their courſe of reading, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere in their choice of friends, or interrupt their very important correſpondence. But as theſe young ladies
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019810_0041_0FACB4319460EF28"/>
are fertile in expedients, and as their genius is never more agreeably exerciſed than in finding reſources, they are not without their ſecret exultation, in caſe either of the above intereſting events ſhould happen, as they carry with them a certain air of tyranny and perſecution which is very delightful. For a prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed correſpondence is one of the great incidents of a ſentimental life, and a letter clandeſtinely received, the ſupreme felicity of a ſentimental lady.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can equal the aſtoniſhment of theſe ſoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits, when their plain friends or prudent rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſume to remonſtrate with them on any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in their conduct. But if theſe worthy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happen to be ſomewhat advanced in life, their contempt is then a little ſoftened by pity, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that ſuch very antiquated poor creatures ſhould pretend to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies of their great refinement, ſenſe, and reading. They conſider them as wretches utterly ignorant of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime pleaſures of a delicate and exalted paſſion; as tyrants whoſe authority is to be contemned, and as ſpies whoſe vigilance is to be eluded. The prudence of theſe worthy friends they term ſuſpicion, and their experience dotage. For they are perſuaded, that the face of things has ſo totally changed ſince their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were young, that though they might then judge tolerably for themſelves, yet they are now (with all their advantages of knowledge and obſervation) by no means qualified to direct their more enlightened daughters; who, if they have made a great progreſs in the ſentimental walk, will be no more influenced by the advice of their mother, than they would go abroad in her laced pinner, or her brocade ſuit.</p>
            <p>BUT young people never ſhew their folly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance more conſpicuouſly, than by this over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own judgment, and this haughty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of the opinion of thoſe who have known more

days. Youth has a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which it is very apt to miſtake for an acuteneſs of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But youth, like cunning, though very conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is very ſhort-ſighted, and never more ſo than when it diſregards the inſtructions of the wiſe, and the admonitions of the aged. The ſame vices and follies influenced the human heart in their day, which influence it now, and nearly in the ſame manner. One who well knew the world and its various vanities, has ſaid, <q>The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the ſun.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is alſo a part of the ſentimental character, to imagine that none but the young and the beautiful have any right to the pleaſures of ſociety, or even to the common benefits and bleſſings of life. Ladies of this turn alſo affect the moſt lofty diſregard for uſeful qualities and domeſtic virtues; and this is a natural conſequence: for as this ſort of ſentiment is only a word for idleneſs, ſhe who is conſtantly and uſefully employed, has neither leiſure nor propenſity to cultivate it.</p>
            <p>A SENTIMENTAL lady principally values herſelf on the enlargement of her notions, and her liberal way of thinking. This ſuperiority of ſoul chiefly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts itſelf in the contempt of theſe minute delicacies and little decorums, which, trifling as they may be thought, tend at once to dignify the character, and to reſtrain the levity of the younger part of the ſex.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS the error here complained of, originates in miſtaking <hi>ſentiment</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> for each other. Now I conceive them to be extremely different. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent is the virtue of <hi>ideas,</hi> and principle the virtue of <hi>action.</hi> Sentiment has its ſeat in the head, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the heart. Sentiment ſuggeſts fine harrangues and ſubtile diſtinctions; principle conceives juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and performs good actions in conſequence of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019810_0043_0FACB43315A152B0"/>
them. Sentiment refines away the ſimplicity of truth and the plainneſs of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<note n="*" place="bottom">See Voltaire's Prophecy concerning Roſſcau.</note> has remarked of his no leſs celebrated cotemporary, gives us virtue in words and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be called the Athenian who <hi>knew</hi> what was right, and principle the Lacedemonian who <hi>practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe qualities will be better exemplified by an attentive conſideration of two admirably drawn charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Milton, which are beautifully, delicately, and diſtinctly marked. Theſe are, Belial, who may not improperly be called the <hi>Demon of Sentiment;</hi> and Abdiel, who may be termed the <hi>Angel of Principle.</hi>

            <p>BUT notwithſtanding I have ſpoken with ſome aſperity againſt ſentiment as oppoſed to principle, yet I am convinced, that true genuine ſentiment, (not the ſort I have been deſcribing) may be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with principle, as to beſtow on it its brighteſt luſtre, and its moſt captivating graces. And enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm is ſo far from being diſagreeable, that a portion of it is perhaps indiſpenſably neceſſary in an engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman. But it muſt be the enthuſiaſm of the heart, not of the ſenſes. It muſt be the enthuſiaſm which grows up with a feeling mind, and is cheriſhed by a virtuous education; not that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of irregular paſſions, and artificially refined by books of unnatural fiction and improbable adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I will even go ſo far as to aſſert, that a young woman cannot have any real greatneſs of ſoul, or true elevation of principle if ſhe has not a tincture of what the vulgar would call Romance, but which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a certain way of thinking will diſcern to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from thoſe fine feelings, and that charming ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, without which, though a woman may be worthy, yet ſhe can never be amiable.</p>
            <p>BUT this dangerous merit cannot be too rigidly watched, as it is very apt to lead thoſe who poſſeſs it into inconveniences from which leſs intereſting cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are happily exempt. Young women of ſtrong
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019810_0046_0FACB4357B2E0E10"/>
ſenſibility may be carried by the very amiableneſs of this temper, into the moſt alarming extremes. Their taſtes are paſſions. They love and hate with all their hearts, and ſcarcely ſuffer themſelves to feel a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preference before it ſtrengthens into a violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment.</p>
            <p>WHEN an innocent girl of this open truſting, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart, happens to meet with one of her own ſex and age, whoſe addreſs and manners are engaging, ſhe is inſtantly ſeized with an ardent deſire to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a friendſhip with her. She feels the moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impatience at the reſtraints of company, and the decorums of ceremony. She longs to be alone with her, longs to aſſure her of the warmth of her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and generouſly aſcribes to the fair ſtranger all the good qualities ſhe feels in her own heart, or rather all thoſe which ſhe has met with in her reading, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in a variety of heroines. She is perſuaded, that her new friend unites them all in herſelf, becauſe ſhe carries in her prepoſſeſſing countenance the promiſe of them all. How cruel and how cenſorious would this inexperienced girl think her mother was, who ſhould venture to hint, that the agreeable unknown had defects in her temper, or exceptions in her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. She would miſtake theſe hints of diſcretion for the inſinuations of an uncharitable diſpoſition. At firſt ſhe would perhaps liſten to them with a generous impatience, and afterwards with a cold and ſilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. She would deſpiſe them as the effect of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, miſrepreſentation, or ignorance. The more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the cenſure, the more vehemently would ſhe proteſt in ſecret, that her friendſhip for this dear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured creature (who is raiſed much higher in her eſteem by ſuch injurious ſuſpicions) ſhall know no bounds, as ſhe is aſſured it can know no end.</p>
            <p>YET this truſting confidence, this honeſt indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, at this early period of life, as amiable as it is
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019810_0047_0FACB43627801B38"/>
natural; and will, if wiſely cultivated, produce, at its proper ſeaſon, fruits infinitely more valuable than all the guarded circumſpection of premature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore artificial prudence. Men, I believe, are ſeldom ſtruck with theſe ſudden prepoſſeſſions in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour of each other. They are not ſo unſuſpecting, nor ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily led away by the predominance of fancy. They engage more warily, and paſs through the ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of acquaintance, intimacy, and confidence, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lower gradations; but women, if they are ſometimes deceived in the choice of a friend, enjoy even then an higher degree of ſatisfaction than if they never truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For to be always clad in the burdenſome armour of ſuſpicion, is more painful and inconvenient, than to run the hazard of ſuffering now and then a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent injury.</p>
            <p>BUT the above obſervations only extend to the young and the inexperienced; for I am very certain, that women are capable of as faithful and as durable friendſhip as any of the other ſex. They can enter not only into all the enthuſiaſtic tenderneſs, but into all ſolid fidelity of attachment. And if we cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe inſtances of equal weight with thoſe of Ny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <head>ON TRUE AND FALSE MEEKNESS.</head>
            <p>A LOW voice and ſoft addreſs are the common indications of a well-bred woman, and ſhould ſeem to be the natural effects of a meek and quiet ſpirit; but they are only the outward and viſible ſigns of it: for they are no more meekneſs itſelf, than a red coat is courage, or a black one devotion.</p>
            <p>YET nothing is more common than to miſtake the ſign for the thing itſelf; nor is any practice more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than that of endeavouring to acquire the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior mark, without once thinking to labour after the interior grace. Surely this is beginning at the wrong end, like attacking the ſymptom and neglecting the diſeaſe. To regulate the features, while the ſoul is in tumults, or to command the voice while the paſſions are without reſtraint, is as idle as throwing odours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtream when the ſource is polluted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſapient king,</hi> who knew better than any man the nature and the power of beauty, has aſſured us, that the temper of the mind has a ſtrong influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the features: "Wiſdom maketh the face to ſhine," ſays that exquiſite judge; and ſurely no part of wiſdom is more likely to produce this amiable effect, than a placid ſerenity of ſoul.</p>
            <p>IT will not be difficult to diſtinguiſh the true from
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019810_0048_0FACB436D39F2D98"/>
the artificial meekneſs. The former is univerſal and habitual; the latter, local and temporary. Every young female may keep this rule by her, to enable her to form a juſt judgment of her own temper: if ſhe is not as gentle to her chambermaid as ſhe is to her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, ſhe may reſt ſatisfied that the ſpirit of gentleneſs is not in her.</p>
            <p>WHO would not be ſhocked and diſappointed to behold a well-bred young lady, ſoft and engaging as the doves of Venus, diſplaying a thouſand graces and attractions to win the hearts of a large company, and the inſtant they are gone, to ſee her look mad as the Pythian maid, and all the frightened graces driven from her furious countenance, only becauſe her gown was brought home a quarter of an hour later than ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or her ribbon ſent half a ſhade lighter or dark-than ſhe orderd?</p>
            <p>ALL men's characters are ſaid to proceed from their ſervants; and this is more particularly true of ladies: for as their ſituations are more domeſtic, they lie more open to the inſpection of their families, to whom their real characters are eaſily and perfectly known; for they ſeldom think it worth while to practiſe any diſguiſe before thoſe, whoſe good opinion they do not value, and who are obliged to ſubmit to their moſt inſupportable humours, becauſe they are paid for it.</p>
            <p>AMONGST women of breeding, the exterior of gentleneſs is ſo uniformly aſſumed, and the whole manner is ſo perfectly level and <hi>uni,</hi> that it is next to impoſſible for a ſtranger to know any thing of their true diſpoſitions by converſing with them, and even the very features are ſo exactly regulated, that phyſiognomy, which may ſometimes be truſted among the vulgar, is, with the polite, a moſt lying ſcience.</p>
            <p>A VERY termagant woman, if ſhe happens alſo to be a very artful one, will be conſcious ſhe has ſo much to conceal, that the dread of betraying her real temper
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:019810_0050_0FACB43871F14F10"/>
will make her put on an over-acted ſoftneſs, which, from its very exceſs, may be diſtinguiſhed from the natural by a penetrating eye. That gentleneſs is ever liable to be ſuſpected for the counterfeited, which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive as to deprive people of the proper uſe of ſpeech and motion, or which, as Hamlet ſays, makes them liſp and amble, and nick-name God's creatures.</p>
            <p>THE countenance and manners of ſome very faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons may be compared to the inſcriptions on their monuments, which ſpeak nothing but good of what is within; but he who knows any thing of the world, or of the human heart, will no more truſt to the courteſy, than he will depend on the epitaph.</p>
            <p>AMONG the various artifices of factitious meekneſs, one of the moſt frequent and moſt plauſible, is that of affecting to be always equally delighted with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and all characters. The ſociety of theſe languid beings is without confidence, their friendſhip without attachment, and their love without affection, or even preference. This inſipid mode of conduct may be ſafe, but I cannot think it has either taſte, ſenſe, or principle in it.</p>
            <p>THESE uniformly ſmiling and approving ladies, who have neither the noble courage to reprehend vice, nor the generous warmth to bear their honeſt teſtimony in the cauſe of virtue, conclude every one to be ill-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who has any penetration, and look upon a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing judgment as want of tenderneſs. But they ſhould learn, that this diſcernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but from that long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, which lead theſe who have it to ſcrutinize into the conduct and diſpoſition of men, before they truſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to thoſe fair appearances, which ſometimes veil the moſt inſidious purpoſes.</p>
            <p>WE are perpetually miſtaking the qualities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of our own hearts. We elevate our failings
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019810_0051_0FACB439213DCFB8"/>
into virtues, and qualify our vices into weakneſſes and hence ariſe ſo many falſe judgments reſpecting meekneſs. Self-ignorance is at the root of all this miſchief. Many ladies complain that, for their part, their ſpirit is ſo meek they can bear nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if they ſpoke truth, they would ſay, their ſpirit is ſo high and unbroken that they can bear nothing. Strange! to plead their meekneſs as a reaſon why they cannot endure to be croſſed, and to produce their impatience of contradiction as a proof of their gentleneſs!</p>
            <p>MEEKNESS, like moſt other virtues, has certain limits, which it no ſooner exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility of ſpirit is not gentleneſs but weakneſs, and if allowed, under the ſpecious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances it ſometimes puts on, will lead to the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous compliances. She who hears innocence malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without vindicating it, falſehood aſſerted without contradicting it, or religion prophaned without reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is not gentle but wicked.</p>
            <p>TO give up the cauſe of an innocent, injured friend, if the popular cry happens to be againſt him, is the moſt diſgraceful weakneſs. This was the caſe of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

She loved the character and admired the talents of Racine; ſhe careſſed him while he had no enemies, but wanted the greatneſs of mind, or rather the common juſtice, to protect him againſt their reſentment when he had; and her favourite was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to the ſuſpicious jealouſy of the king, when a prudent remonſtrance might have preſerved him.—But her tameneſs, if not abſolute connivance in the great maſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>red, is a far more guilty inſtance of her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; an inſtance which, in ſpite of all her devotional zeal and incomparable prudence, will diſqualify her from ſhining in the annals of good women, however ſhe may be entitled to figure among the great and

fortunate. Compare her conduct with that of her undaunted and pious countryman and cotemporary, Bougi, who, when Louis would have prevailed on him to renounce his religion for a commiſſion or a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nobly replied, "If I could be perſuaded to "betray my God for a marſhal's ſtaff, I might betray my king for a bribe of much leſs conſequence."</p>
            <p>MEEKNESS is imperfect, if it be not both active and paſſive; if it will not enable us to ſubdue our own paſſions and reſentments, as well as qualify us to bear patiently the paſſions and reſentments of others.</p>
            <p>BEFORE we give way to any violent emotion of anger, it would perhaps be worth while to conſider the value of the object which excites, it, and to reflect for a moment, whither the thing we ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or ſo vehemently reſent, be really of as much importance to us, as that delightful tranquillity of ſoul, which we renounce in purſuit of it.

               </gap> a fair calculation, we find we are not likely to get as much as we are ſure to loſe, then, putting all religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations out of the queſtion, common ſenſe and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man policy will tell us, we have made a fooliſh and unprofitable exchange. Inward quiet is a part of one's ſelf; the object of our reſentment may be only a matter of opinion; and certainly, what makes a portion of our actual happineſs ought to be too dear to us, to be ſacrified for a trifling, foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</p>
            <p>THE moſt pointed ſatire I remember to have read, on a mind enſlaved by anger, is an obſervation of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca's. "Alexander (ſaid he) had two friends, Clitus and Lyſimachus; the one he expoſed to a lion, the other to himſelf: he who was turned looſe to the beaſt eſcaped, but Clitus was murdered, for he was turned looſe to an angry man."</p>
            <p>A PASSIONATE woman's happineſs is never in her own keeping: it is the ſport of accident, and the

ſlave of events. It is in the power of her acquaintance, her ſervants, but chiefly of her enemies; and all her comforts lie at the mercy of others. So far from being willing to learn of him who was meek and lowly, ſhe conſiders meekneſs as the want of a becoming ſpirit, and lowlineſs as a deſpicable and vulgar mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And an imperious woman will ſo little covet the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, that it is almoſt the only ornament ſhe will not be ſolicitous to wear. But reſentment is a very expenſive vice. How dearly has it coſt its vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF it were only for more human reaſons, it would turn to a better account to be patient; nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats the malice of an enemy like a ſpirit of forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the return of rage for rage cannot be ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually provoking. True gentleneſs, like an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable armour repels the moſt pointed ſhafts of malice: they cannot pierce through this invulnerable ſhield, but either fall hurtleſs to the ground, or return to wound the hand that ſhot them.</p>
            <p>A MEEK ſpirit will not look out of itſelf for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, becauſe it finds a conſtant banquet at home; yet, by a ſort of divine alchymy, it will convert all external events to its own profit, and be able to deduce ſome good, even from the moſt unpromiſing; it will extract comfort and ſatisfaction from the moſt barren circumſtances: <q>It will ſuck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the ſupreme excellence of this complacent quality is, that it naturally diſpoſes the mind where it reſides to the practice of every other that is amiable. Meekneſs may be called the pioneer of all the other virtues, which levels every obſtruction, and ſmooths every difficulty that might impede their entrance, or retard their progreſs.</p>

THE peculiar importance and value of this amiable virtue may be farther ſeen in its permanency. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities are tranſient, beauty and riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb. Would not the truly wiſe, therefore, wiſh to have ſome one poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they might call their own in the ſevereſt exigencies? But this wiſh can only be accompliſhed by acquiring and maintaining that calm and abſolute ſelf-poſſeſſion, which, as the world had no hand in giving, ſo it cannot, by the moſt malicious exertion of its power, take away.</p>

            <p>I HAVE not the fooliſh preſumption to imagine, that I can offer any thing new on a ſubject, which has been ſo ſucceſsfully treated by many learned and able writers, I would only, with all poſſible deference, beg leave to hazard a few ſhort remarks on that part of the ſubject of education, which I would call the <hi>education of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lly and forcibly diſcuſſed than the reſt, though I cannot, at the ſame time, help remarking, that it does not appear to have been ſo much adopted into common practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:019810_0056_0FACB43D0D7E6C08"/>
IT appears then, that notwithſtanding the great and real improvements, which have been made in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of female education, and notwithſtanding the more enlarged and generous views of it, which prevail in the preſent day, that there is ſtill a very material defect, which it is not, in general, enough the object of attention to remove. This defect ſeems to conſiſt in this, that too little regard is paid to the diſpoſition of the <hi>mind,</hi> that the indications of the <hi>temper</hi> are not properly cheriſhed, nor the affections of the <hi>heart</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently regulated.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt education of girls, as far as the cuſtoms which faſhion eſtabliſhes are right, they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be followed. Let the exterior be made a conſiderable object of attention, but let it not be the principal, let it not be the only one.—Let the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be induſtriouſly cultivated, but let them not be cultivated at the expence of the virtues.—Let the arms, the head, the whole perſon be carefully poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but let not the heart be the only portion of the human anatomy, which ſhall be totally overlooked.</p>
            <p>THE neglect of this cultivation ſeems to proceed as much from a bad taſte, as from a falſe principle. The generality of people form their judgment of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſlight and ſudden appearances, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a wrong way of determining. Muſic, dancing, and languages, gratify thoſe who teach them, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible and almoſt immedate effects; and when there happens to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the maſter, every ſuperficial obſerver can, in ſome meaſure, judge of the progreſs.—The effects of moſt of theſe accompliſhments addreſs themſelves to the ſenſes; and there are more who can ſee and hear, than there are who can judge and reflect.</p>
            <p>PERSONAL perfection is not only more obvious, it is alſo more rapid; and even in very accompliſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, elegance uſually precedes principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:019810_0057_0FACB43DC8D57598"/>
BUT the heart, that natural ſeat of evil propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that little troubleſome empire of the paſſions, is led to what is right by ſlow motions and imperceptible degrees. It muſt be admoniſhed by reproof, and allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by kindneſs. Its livelieſt advances are frequently impeded by the obſtinacy of prejudice, and its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt promiſes often obſcured by the tempeſts of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It is ſlow in its acquiſition of virtue, and reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in its approaches to piety.</p>
            <p>THERE is another reaſon, which proves this mental cultivation to be more important, as well as more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, than any other part of education. In the uſual faſhionable accompliſhments, the buſineſs of acquiring them is almoſt always getting forwards, and one diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is conquered before another is ſuffered to ſhew itſelf; for a prudent teacher will level the road his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil is to paſs, and ſmooth the inequalities which might retard her progreſs</p>
            <p>BUT in morals, (which ſhould be the great object conſtantly kept in view) the taſk is far more difficult. The unruly and turbulent deſires of the heart are not ſo obedient; one paſſion will ſtart up before another is ſuppreſſed. The ſubduing Hercules cannot cut off the heads ſo often as the prolific Hydra can produce them, nor fell the ſtubborn Antaeus ſo faſt as he can recruit his ſtrength, and riſe in vigorous and repeated oppoſition.</p>
            <p>IF all the accompliſhments could be bought at the price of a ſingle virtue, the purchaſe would be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dear! And, however ſtartling it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound, I think it is, notwithſtanding, true, that the labours of a good and wiſe mother, who is anxious for her daughter's moſt important intereſts, will ſeem to be at variance with thoſe of her inſtructors. She will doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at her progreſs in any polite art, but ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with trembling:—humility and piety form the ſolid and durable baſis, on which ſhe wiſhes to raiſe
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:019810_0058_0FACB43EDD7CDFB8"/>
the ſuperſtructure of the accompliſhments, while the accompliſhments themſelves are frequently of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady nature, that if the foundation is not ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in proportion as the building is enlarged, it will be overloaded and deſtroyed by thoſe very ornaments, which were intended to embelliſh, what they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ruin.</p>

               </gap>tenſible qualifications ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regulated, or they will be in danger of putting to ſlight the modeſt train of retreating virtues, which cannot ſafely ſubſiſt before the bold eye of public ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or bear the bolder tongue of impudent and audacious flattery. A tender mother cannot but feel an honeſt triumph, in contemplating thoſe excellencies in her daughter which deſerve applauſe, but ſhe will alſo ſhudder at the vanity which that applauſe may excite, and at thoſe hitherto unknown ideas which it may awaken.</p>
            <p>THE maſter, it his his intereſt, and perhaps his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will naturally teach a girl to ſet her improvements in the moſt conſpicuous point of light. <hi>Se faire va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loir</hi> is the great principle induſtriouſly inculcated into her young heart, and ſeems to be conſidered as a kind of fundamental maxim in education. It is however the certain and effectual ſeed, from which a thouſand yet unborn vanities will ſpring. This dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine (which yet is not without its uſes) will be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by the prudent mother, not in ſo many words, but by a watchful and ſcarcely perceptible dexterity. Such an one will be more careful to have the talents of her daughter <hi>cultivated</hi> than <hi>exhibited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ONE would be led to imagine, by the common mode of female education, that life conſiſted of one univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal holiday, and that the only conteſt was, who ſhould be beſt enabled to excel in the ſports and games that were to be celebrated on it. Merely ornamental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments will but indifferently qualify a woman
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019810_0059_0FACB440EDF51360"/>
to perform the <hi>duties</hi> of life, though it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhe ſhould poſſeſs them, in order to furniſh the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements</hi> of it. But is it right to ſpend ſo large a portion of life without ſome preparation for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of living? A lady may ſpeak a little French and Italian, repeat a few paſſages in a theatrical tone, play and ſing, have her dreſſing-room hung with her own drawings, and her perſon covered with her own tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour work, and may notwithſtanding, have been very <hi>badly educated.</hi> Yet I am far from attempting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the value of theſe qualifications: they are moſt of them not only highly becoming, but often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary, and a polite education cannot be perfected without them. But as the world ſeems to be very well appriſed of their importance, there is the leſs occaſion to inſiſt on their utility. Yet, though well-bred young women ſhould learn to dance, ſing, recite, and draw, the end of a good education is not that they may become dancers, ſingers, players or painters: its real object is to make them good daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, good wives, good miſtreſſes, good members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and good chriſtians. The above qualifications therefore are intended to <hi>adorn</hi> their <hi>leiſure,</hi> not to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy</hi> their <hi>lives;</hi> for an amiable and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BUT I am afraid parents themſelves ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the error of which I am complaining. Do they not often ſet a higher value on thoſe acquiſitions which are calculated to attract obſervation, and catch the eye of the multitude, than on thoſe which are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, permanent, and internal? Are they not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more ſolicitous about the opinion of others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their children, than about the real advantage and happineſs of the children themſelves?

It will be underſtood and admired by the man, whoſe happineſs ſhe is one day to make, whoſe family ſhe is to govern, and whoſe children ſhe is to educate. He will not ſeek for her in the haunts of diſſipation, for he knows he ſhall not find her there; but he will ſeek for her in the boſom of retirement, in the practice of every domeſtic virtue, in the exertion of every amiable accompliſhment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in the ſhade, to enliven retirement, to heighten the endearing pleaſures of ſocial intercourſe, and to embelliſh the narrow circle of family delights. To this amiable purpoſe, a truly good and well educated young lady will dedicate more elegant accompliſhments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exhibiting them to attract admiration, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inferiority.</p>
            <p>YOUNG girls, who have more vivacity than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will often make a ſprightly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But this agreeable talent for entertaining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is frequently dangerous to themſelves, nor is it by any means to be deſired or encouraged very early in life.

are often very remote: they are to be diſcovered in future ſcenes, and exhibited in untried connexions. Every event of life will be putting the heart into freſh ſituations, and making demands on its prudence, its firmneſs, its integrity, or its piety. Thoſe whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is to form it, can foreſee none of theſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: yet, as far as human wiſdom will allow, they muſt enable it to provide for them all, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependance on the divine aſſiſtance. A well diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined ſoldier muſt learn and practiſe all his evolutions, though he does not know on what ſervice his leader may command him, by what foe he ſhall be attacked, nor what mode of combat the enemy may uſe.</p>
            <p>ONE great art of education conſiſts in not ſuffering the feelings to become too accute by unneceſſary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, nor too obtuſe by the want of exertion. The former renders them the ſource of calamity, and totally ruins the temper: while the latter blunts and debaſes them, and produces a dull, cold, and ſelfiſh ſpirit. For the mind is an inſtrument, which, if wound too high, will loſe its ſweetneſs, and if not enough ſtrained, will abate of its vigour.</p>
            <p>HOW cruel is it to extinguiſh by neglect or unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the precious ſenſibility of an open temper, to chill the amiable glow of an ingenious ſoul, and to quench the bright flame of a noble and generous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit! Theſe are of higher worth than all the documents of learning, of dearer price than all the advantages, which can be derived from the moſt refined and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial mode of education.</p>
            <p>BUT ſenſibility and delicacy, and an ingenious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, make no part of education, exclaims the peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue—they are reducible to no claſs—they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no article of inſtruction—they belong neither to languages nor to muſic. What an error! They are a part of education, and of infinitely more value
<q>Than all their pedant diſcipline e'er knew.</q>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:019810_0062_0FACB442D1519800"/>
It is true, they are ranged under no claſs, but they are ſuperior to all; they are of more eſteem than langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or muſic, for they are the language of the heart, and the muſic of the according paſſions. Yet this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is, in many inſtances, ſo far from being culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, that it is not uncommon to ſee thoſe who affect more than uſual ſagacity, caſt a ſmile of ſupercilious pity, at any indication of a warm, generous, or enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic temper in the lively and the young; as much as to ſay, <q>they will know better, and will have more diſcretion when they are older.</q> But every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of amiable ſimplicity, or of honeſt ſhame, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's haſty conſcience,</hi> will be dear to ſenſible hearts; they will carefully cheriſh every ſuch indication in a young female; for they will perceive that it is this temper wiſely cultivated, which will one day make her enamoured of the lovelineſs of virtue, and the beauty of holineſs: from which ſhe will acquire a taſte for the doctrines of religion, and a ſpirit to perform the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it. And thoſe who wiſh to make her aſhamed of this charmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g temper, and ſeek to diſpoſſeſs her of it, will, it is to be feared, give her nothing better in exchange. But whoever reflects at all, will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how carefully this enthuſiaſm is to be directed, and how judiciouſly its redundances are to be lopped away.</p>
            <p>PRUDENCE is not natural to children; they can how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſubſtitute art in its ſtead. But is it not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a girl ſhould diſcover the faults incident to her age, than conceal them under this dark and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable veil? I could almoſt venture to aſſert, that there is ſomething more becoming in the very errors of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where they are undiſguiſed, than in the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of virtue itſelf, where the reality is wanting. And I am ſo far from being an admirer of prodigies, that I am extremely apt to ſuſpect them; and am always infinitely better pleaſed with Nature in her more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

modes of operation. The preciſe and premature wiſdom, which ſome girls have cunning enough to aſſume, is of a more dangerous tendency than any of their natural failings can be, as it effectually covers thoſe ſecret bad diſpoſitions, which, if they diſplayed themſelves, might be rectified. The hypocriſy of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming virtues which are not inherent in the heart, prevents the growth and diſcloſure of thoſe real ones, which it is the great end of education to cultivate.</p>
            <p>BUT if the natural indications of the temper are to be ſuppreſſed and ſtifled, where are the diagnoſtics, by which the ſtate of the mind is to be known? The wiſe author of all things, who did nothing in vain, doubtleſs intended them as ſymptoms, by which to judge of the diſeaſes of the heart; and it is impoſſible diſeaſes ſhould be cured before they are known. If the ſtream be ſo cut off as to prevent communication, or ſo choked up as to defeat diſcovery, how ſhall we ever reach the ſource, out of which are the iſſues of life?</p>
            <p>THIS cunning, which, of all the different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions girls diſcover, is moſt to be dreaded, is increaſed by nothing ſo much as by fear. If thoſe about them expreſs violent and unreaſonable anger at every trivial offence, it will always promote this temper, and will very frequently create it, where there was a natural tendency to frankneſs. The indiſcreet tranſports of rage, which many betray on every ſlight occaſion, and the little diſtinction they make between venial errors and premeditated crimes, naturally diſpoſe a child to conceal, what ſhe does not however care to ſuppreſs. Anger in one will not remedy the faults of another; for how can an inſtrument of ſin cure ſin? If a girl is kept in a ſtate of perpetual and ſlaviſh terror, ſhe will perhaps have artifice enough to conceal thoſe propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities which ſhe knows are wrong, or thoſe actions which ſhe thinks are moſt obnoxious to puniſhment.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:019810_0064_0FACB44454B7BDD0"/>
But, nevertheleſs, ſhe will not ceaſe to indulge thoſe propenſities, and to commit thoſe actions, when ſhe can do it with impunity.</p>

The natural caſt of character, and the moral diſtinctions between the ſexes, ſhould not be diſregarded even in childhood. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Girls ſhould be taught to give up their opinions betimes, and not pertinaciouſly to carry on a diſpute, even if they ſhould know themſelves to be in the right. I do not mean, that they ſhould be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of the liberty of private judgment, but that they ſhould by no means be encouraged to contract a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious or contradictory turn. It is of the greateſt importance to their future happineſs, that they ſhould acquire a ſubmiſſive temper, and a forbearing ſpirit; for it is a leſſon which the world will not fail to make them frequently practiſe, when they come abroad into it, and they will not practiſe it the worſe for having learnt it the ſooner. Theſe early reſtraints, in the limitation here meant, are ſo far from being an effect of cruelty, that they are the moſt undubitable marks of affection, and are the more meritorious, as they are ſevere trials of tenderneſs. But all the beneficial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and not habitually, and if it ever appears to be uſed to gratify caprice, ill-humour, or reſentment.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have children to educate ought to be extremely patient: it is indeed a labour of love. They ſhould reflect, that extraordinary talents are neither eſſential to the well-being of ſociety, nor to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of individuals. If that had been the caſe, the beneficent Father of the univerſe would not have made them ſo rare. For it is as eaſy for an Almighty Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to produce a Newton, as an ordinary man; and he could have made thoſe powers common which we now conſider as wonderful, without any miraculous exertion of his omnipotence, if the exiſtence of many Newtons had been neceſſary to the perfection of his wiſe and gracious plan.</p>
            <p>SURELY, therefore, there is more piety, as well as more ſenſe, in labouring to improve the talents which children actually have, than in lamenting that they do not poſſeſs ſupernatural endowments or angelic perfections. A paſſage of Lord Bacon's furniſhes an admirable incitement for endeavouring to carry the amiable and chriſtian grace of charity to its fartheſt extent, inſtead of indulging an over-anxious care for more brilliant but leſs important acquiſitions. <q>The deſire of power in exceſs (ſays he) cauſed the angels to fall; the deſire of knowledge in exceſs cauſed man to fall; but in charity is no exceſs, neither can men nor angels come into danger by it.</q>

IT is as injudicious for parents to ſet out with too ſanguine a dependence on the merit of their children, as it for them to be diſcouraged at every repulſe. When their wiſhes are defeated in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance, where they had treaſured up ſome dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling expectation, this is ſo far from being a reaſon for relaxing their attention, that it ought to be an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional motive for redoubling it. Thoſe who hope to do a great deal, muſt not expect to do every thing. If they know any thing of the malignity of ſin, the blindneſs of prejudice, or the corruption of the human heart, they will alſo know, that that heart will always remain, after the very beſt poſſible education, full of infirmity and imperfection. Extraordinary allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, therefore, muſt be made for the weakneſs of nature in this its weakeſt ſtate. After much is done, much will remain to do, and much, very much, will ſtill be left undone. For this regulation of the paſſions and affections cannot be the work of education alone, without the concurrence of divine grace operating on the heart. Why then ſhould parents repine, if their efforts are not always crowned with immediate ſucceſs? They ſhould conſider, that they are not educating cherubims and ſeraphims, but men and women; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who at their beſt eſtate are altogether vanity: how little th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have dwelt on this part of the ſubject the longer, becauſe I am certain that many, who have ſet out with a warm and active zeal, have cooled on the very firſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have afterwards almoſt totally remitted their vigilance, through a criminal kind of deſpair.</p>
            <p>GREAT allowances muſt be made for a profuſion of gaiety, loquacity, and even indiſcretion in children, that there may be animation enough left to ſupply an active and uſeful character, when the firſt fermentation of the youthful paſſions is over, and the redundant ſpirits ſhall come to ſubſide.</p>

IF it be true, as a conſummate judge of human nature has obſerved,
<q>That not a vanity is given in vain,</q>
it is alſo true, that there is ſcarcely a ſingle paſſion, which may not be turned to ſome good account, if prudently rectified, and ſkillfully turned into the road of ſome neighbouring virtue. It cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally forced towards an object of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally oppoſite nature, but may be gradually inclined towards a correſpondent but ſuperior affection. Anger, hatred, reſentment, and ambition, the moſt reſtleſs and turbulent paſſions which ſhake and diſtract the human ſoul, may be led to become the moſt active oppoſers of ſin, after having been its moſt ſucceſsful inſtruments. Our anger, for inſtance, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be totally ſubdued, may be made to turn againſt ourſelves, for our weak and imperfect obedience—our hatred, againſt every ſpecies of vice—our ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will not be diſcarded, may be ennobled: it will not change its name, but its object; it will deſpiſe what it lately valued, nor be contented to graſp at leſs than immortality.</p>
            <p>THUS the joys, fears, hopes, deſires, all the paſſions and affections, which ſeparate in various currents from the ſoul, will, if directed into their proper channels, after having fertiliſed wherever they have flowed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to ſwell and enrich the parent ſource.</p>
            <p>THAT the very paſſions which appear the moſt uncontroulable and unpromiſing, may be intended, in the great ſcheme of Providence, to anſwer ſome important purpoſe, is remarkably evidenced in the character and hiſtory of Saint Paul. A remark on this ſubject by an ingenious old Spaniſh writer, which I will here take the liberty to tranſlate, will better illuſtrate my meaning.</p>

               <q>TO convert the bittereſt enemy into the moſt zealous advocate, is the work of God for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of man. Plutarch has obſerved, that the medical ſcience would be brought to the utmoſt perfection, when poiſon ſhould be converted into phyſic. Thus, in the mortal diſeaſe of Judaiſm and idolatry, our bleſſed Lord converted the adder's venom of Saul the perſecutor, into that cement which made Paul the choſen veſſel. That manly activity, that reſtleſs ardor, that burning zeal for the law of his fathers, that ardent thirſt for the blood of Chriſtians, did the Son of God find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the man who was one day to become the defender of his ſuffering people<note n="*" place="bottom">Obras de Quevedo, vida de San Pablo Apoſtol.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO win the paſſions, therefore, over to the cauſe of virtue, anſwers a much nobler end than their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction would poſſibly do, even if that could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. But it is their nature never to obſerve a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality; they are either rebels or auxiliaries, and an enemy ſubdued is an ally obtained. If I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to change the alluſion ſo ſoon, I would ſay, that the paſſions alſo reſemble fires, which are friendly and beneficial when under proper direction, but if ſuffered to blaze without reſtraint, they carry deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation along with them, and, if totally extinguiſhed, leave the benighted mind in a ſtate of cold and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs inanity.</p>
            <p>BUT in ſpeaking of the uſefulneſs of the paſſions, as inſtruments of virtue, <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> muſt always be excepted: theſe I am perſuaded, muſt either go on in ſtill progreſſive miſchief, or elſe be radically cured, before any good can be expected from the heart which has been infected with them.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:019810_0069_0FACB448CEC6E9C8"/>
or lying improved into an agreeable turn for innocent invention. Almoſt all the other paſſions may be made to take an amiable hue; but theſe two muſt either be totally extirpated, or be always contented to preſerve their original deformity, and to wear their native black.</p>

BUT in the great and univerſal concern of religion, both ſexes, and all ranks, are equally intereſted. The truly catholic ſpirit of chriſtianity accomodates itſelf, with an aſtoniſhing condeſcenſion, to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the whole human race. It rejects none on account of their pecuinary wants, their perſonal infirmities, or their intellectual deficiencies. No ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of parts is the leaſt recommendation, nor is any depreſſion of fortune the ſmalleſt objection. None are too wiſe to be excuſed from performing the duties of religion, nor are any too poor to be excluded from the conſolations of its promiſes.</p>
            <p>If we admire the wiſdom of God, in having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed different degrees of intelligence, ſo exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their different deſtinations, and in having fitted every part of his ſtupendous work, not only to ſerve its own immediate purpoſe, but alſo to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the beauty and perfection of the whole: how much more ought we to adore that goodneſs, which has perfected the divine plan, by appointing one wide, comprehenſive, and univerſal means of ſalvation: a ſalvation, which all are invited to partake; by a means which all are capable of uſing; which nothing but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary blindneſs can prevent our comprehending, and nothing but wilful error can hinder us from embracing.</p>
            <p>THE Muſes are coy, and will only be wooed and won by ſome highly-favoured ſuitors.

            <p>IT is preſumed, that theſe remarks cannot poſſibly be ſo miſunderſtood, as to be conſtrued into the leaſt diſreſpect to literature, or a want of the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for a learned education, the baſis of all elegant knowledge: they are only intended, with all proper deference, to point out to young women, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inferior their advantages of acquiring a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the belles-lettres are to thoſe of the other ſex; yet it depends on themſelves not to be ſurpaſſed in this moſt important of all ſtudies, for which their abilities are equal, and their opportunities, perhaps, greater.</p>

Nothing is more unamiable than the narrow ſpirit of party-zeal, nor more diſguſting than to hear a woman deal out judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and denounce vengeance againſt any one, who happens to differ from her in ſome opinion, perhaps of no real importance, and which, it is probable, ſhe
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:019810_0076_0FACB44D46DAE5E8"/>
may be juſt as wrong in rejecting, as the object of her cenſure is in embracing. A furious and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful female bigot wanders as far beyond the limits preſcribed to her ſex, as a Thaleſtris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent debate has made as few converts as the ſword, and both theſe inſtruments are particularly unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when wielded by a female hand.</p>
            <p>But though no one will be frightened out of their opinions, yet they may be perſuaded out of them: they may be touched by the affecting earneſtneſs of ſerious converſation, and allured by the attractive beauty of a conſiſtently ſerious life. And while a young woman ought to dread the name of a wrangling polemic, it is her duty to aſpire after the honourable character of a ſincere Chriſtian. But this dignified character ſhe can by no means deſerve, if ſhe is ever afraid to avow her principles, or aſhamed to defend them. A profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who makes it a point to ridicule every thing which comes under the appearance of formal inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be diſconcerted at the ſpirited yet modeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of a pious young woman. But there is as much efficacy in the manner of reproving prophaneneſs, as in the words. If ſhe corrects it with moroſeneſs, ſhe defeats the effect of her remedy, by her unſkilful manner of adminiſtring it. If, on the other hand, ſhe affects to defend the inſulted cauſe of God, in a faint tone of voice, and ſtudied ambiguity of phraſe, or with an air of levity, and a certain expreſſion of pleaſure in her eyes, which proves ſhe is ſecretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with what ſhe pretends to cenſure, ſhe injures religion much more than he did who publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned it; for ſhe plainly indicates, either that ſhe does not believe, or reſpect what ſhe profeſſes. The other attacked it as an open foe; ſhe betrays it as a falſe friend. No one pays any regard to the opinion of an avowed enemy; but the deſertion or treachery of a profeſſed friend, is dangerous indeed!</p>

IT is a ſtrange notion which prevails in the world, that religion only belongs to the old and the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that it is not worth while to pay the leaſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, while we are capable of attending to any thing elſe. They allow it to be proper enough for cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, whoſe buſineſs it is, and for the aged, who have not ſpirits for any buſineſs at all. But till they can prove, that none except the clergy and aged <hi>die,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed that this is moſt wretched reaſoning.</p>
            <p>GREAT injury is done to the intereſts of religion, by placing it in a gloomy and unamiable light. It is ſometimes ſpoken of, as if it would actually make a handſome woman ugly, or a young one wrinkled. But can any thing be more abſurd than to repreſent the beauty of holineſs as the ſource of deformity?</p>
            <p>THERE are few, perhaps, ſo entirely plunged in buſineſs, or abſorbed in pleaſure, as not to intend, at ſome future time, to ſet about a religious life in good earneſt. But then they conſider it as a kind of <hi>dernier reſſort,</hi> and think it prudent to defer fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this diſagreeable refuge, till they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh left for any thing elſe. Do they forget, that to perform this great buſineſs well, requires all the ſtrength of their youth, and all the vigour of their unimpaired capacities? To confirm this aſſertion, they may obſerve how much the ſlighteſt indiſpoſition, even in the moſt active ſeaſon of life, diſorders every faculty, and diſqualifies them for attending to the moſt ordinary affairs; and then let them reflect how little able they will be to tranſact the moſt important of all buſineſs, in the moment of excruciating pain, or in the day of univerſal debility.</p>
            <p>WHEN the ſenſes are palled with exceſſive gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when the eye is tired with ſeeing, and the ear with hearing; when the ſpirits are ſo-ſunk, that the <hi>graſshopper is become a burthen,</hi> how ſhall the blunted apprehenſion be capable of underſtanding a new ſcience,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019810_0078_0FACB44EC77ABFC8"/>
or the worn-out heart be able to reliſh a new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>To put off religion till we have loſt all taſte for amuſement; to refuſe liſtening to the "voice of the charmer," till our enfeebled organs can no longer liſten to the voice of "ſinging men and ſinging wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men," and not to devote our days to heaven till we have "no pleaſure in them" ourſelves, is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious offering. And it is a wretched ſacrifice to the God of heaven, to preſent him with the remnants of decayed appetites, and the leavings of extinguiſhed paſſions.</p>

GOOD ſenſe is ſo far from deſerving the appellation of <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> by which it is frequently called, that it is perhaps one of the rareſt qualities of the human mind. If, indeed, this name is given it in reſpect to its peculiar ſuitableneſs to the purpoſes of common life, there is great propriety in it. Good ſenſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to differ from taſte in this, that taſte is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous deciſion of the mind, a ſudden reliſh of what is beautiful, or diſguſt at what is defective, in an object, without waiting for the ſlower confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the judgment. Good ſenſe is perhaps that confirmation, which eſtabliſhes a ſuddenly conceived idea, or feeling, by the powers of comparing and reflecting. They differ alſo in this, that taſte ſeems to have a more immediate reference to arts, to litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to almoſt every object of the ſenſes; while good ſenſe riſes to moral excellence, and exerts its influence on life and manners. Taſte is fitted to the perception and enjoyment of whatever is beautiful in art or nature: Good ſenſe, to the improvement of the conduct, and the regulation of the heart.</p>
            <p>YET the term good ſenſe, is uſed indiſcriminately to expreſs either a finiſhed taſte for letters, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable prudence in the affairs of life. It is ſometimes applied to the moſt moderate abilities, in which caſe, the expreſſion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is the peculiar property of genius to ſtrike out great or beautiful things: it is the felicity of good ſenſe not to do abſurd ones.

               <l>The poet's eye in a fine frenzy rolling,</l>
               <l>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</l>

               <l>A local habitation and a name.</l>

            <p>THIS is perhaps the fineſt picture of human genius that ever was drawn by a human pencil. It preſents a living image of a creative imagination, or a power of inventing things which have no actual exiſtence.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuperficial judges, who, it muſt be confeſſed, make up the greater part of the maſs of mankind, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents are only liked or underſtood to a certain degree. Lofty ideas are above the reach of ordinary appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions: the vulgar allow thoſe who poſſeſs them to be in a ſomewhat higher ſtate of mind than themſelves; but of the vaſt gulf which ſeparates them, they have not the leaſt conception. They acknowledge a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, but of its extent they neither know the value, nor can conceive the reality. It is true, the mind, as well as the eye, can take in objects larger than it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but this is only true of great minds: for a man of low capacity, who conſiders a conſummate genius, reſembles one, who ſeeing a column for the firſt time, and ſtanding at too great a diſtance to take in the

whole of it, concludes it to be flat. Or, like one unacquainted with the firſt principles of philoſophy, who, finding the ſenſible horizon appear a plain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, can form no idea of the ſpherical form of the whole, which he does not ſee, and laughs at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of antipodes, which he cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER is excellent is alſo rare; what is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is more common. How many thouſands are born qualified for the coarſe employments of life, for one who is capable of excelling in the fine arts! yet ſo it ought to be, becauſe our natural wants are more numerous, and more importunate, than the intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
            <p>WHENEVER it happens that a man of diſtinguiſhed talents has been drawn by miſtake, or precipitated by paſſion, into any dangerous indiſcretion; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for thoſe whoſe coldneſs of temper has ſupplied the place, and uſurped the name of prudence, to boaſt of their own ſteadier virtue, and triumph in their own ſuperior caution; only becauſe they have never been aſſailed by a temptation ſtrong enough to ſurpriſe them into error.

THE elegant Biographer of Collins, in his affecting apology for that unfortunate genius, remarks, <q>That the gifts of imagination bring the heavieſt taſk on the vigilance of reaſon; and to bear thoſe faculties with unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of firmneſs, and of cool attention, which does not always attend the higher gifts of the mind; yet difficult as Nature herſelf ſeems to have rendered the taſk of regularity to genius, it is the ſupreme conſolation of dullneſs, and of folly to point with gothic triumph to thoſe exceſſes which are the overflowing of faculties they never enjoyed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT the greater part of the world mean by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, will be generally found, on a cloſer enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be art, fraud, or ſelfiſhneſs! That ſort of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prudence which makes men extremely attentive to their own ſafety, or profit; diligent in the purſuit of their own pleaſures or intereſts; and perfectly at their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHEN we ſee ſo many accompliſhed wits of the preſent age, as remarkable for the decorum of their lives, as for the brilliancy of their writings, we may believe, that, next to principle, it is owing to their <hi>good ſenſe,</hi> which regulates and chaſtiſes their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. The vaſt conceptions which enable a true genius to aſcend the ſublimeſt heights, may be ſo connected with the ſtronger paſſions, as to give it a natural tendency to fly off from the ſtrait line of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; till good ſenſe, acting on the fancy, makes it gravitate powerfully towards that virtue which is its proper centre.</p>

ADD to this, when it is conſidered with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection the Divine Wiſdom has thought fit to ſtamp every thing human, it will be found, that excellence and infirmity are ſo inſeparably wound up in each other, that a man derives the ſoreneſs of temper, and irritability of nerve, which make him uneaſy to others, and unhappy in himſelf, from thoſe exquiſite feelings, and that elevated pitch of thought, by which, as the apoſtle expreſſes it on a more ſerious occaſion, he is, as it were, out of the body.</p>
            <p>IT is not aſtoniſhing, therefore, when the ſpirit is carried away by the magnificence of its own ideas,
<q>Not touch'd but rapt, not weaken'd but inſpir'd,</q>
that the frail body, which is the natural victim of pain, diſeaſe, and death, ſhould not always be able to follow the mind in its aſpiring flights, but ſhould be as imperfect as if it belonged only to an ordinary ſoul.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, might not Providence intend to humble human pride, by preſenting to our eyes ſo mortifying a view of the weakneſs and infirmity of even his beſt work? Perhaps man, who is already but a little lower than the angels, might, like the revolted ſpirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally have ſhaken off obedience and ſubmiſſion to his Creator, had not God wiſely tempered human excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with a certain conſciouſneſs of its own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But though this inevitable alloy of weakneſs may frequently be found in the beſt characters, yet how can that be the ſource of triumph and exaltation to any, which, if properly weighed, muſt be the deepeſt motive of humiliation to all? A good-natured man will be ſo far from rejoicing, that he will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly troubled, whenever he reads that the greateſt Roman moraliſt was tainted with avarice, and the greateſt Britiſh philoſopher with venality.</p>

IT is remarked by Pope, in his Eſſay on Criticiſm, that,
<q>Ten cenſure wrong for one that writes amiſs.</q>
But I apprehend it does not therefore follow that to judge, is more difficult than to write. If this were the caſe, the critic would be ſuperior to the poet, whereas it appears to be directly the contrary. "The critic, (ſays the great champion of Shakeſpeare) but faſhions the body of a work, the poet muſt add the ſoul, which gives force and direction to its actions and geſtures." It ſhould ſeem that the reaſon why ſo many more judge wrong, than write ill, is becauſe the number of readers is beyond all proportion greater than the number of writers. Every man who reads, is in ſome meaſure a critic, and, with very common abilities, may point out real faults and material errors in a very well written book; but it by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he is able to write any thing comparable to the work which he is capable of cenſuring. And unleſs the numbers of thoſe who write, and of thoſe who judge, were more equal, the calculation ſeems not to be quite fair.</p>

            <p>YET it has been objected that ſtudy is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to originality; but even if this were true, it would perhaps be as well that an author ſhould give us the ideas of ſtill better writers, mixed and aſſimilated with the matter in his own mind, as thoſe crude and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted thoughts which he values under the notion that they are original. The ſweeteſt honey neither taſtes of the roſe, the honey-ſuckle, nor the carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it is compounded of the very eſſence of them all.</p>
            <p>IF in the other fine arts this accumulation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary, it is indiſpenſably ſo in poetry. It is a fatal raſhneſs for any one to truſt too much to their own ſtock of ideas. He muſt invigorate them by exerciſe, poliſh them by converſation, and increaſe them by every ſpecies of elegant and virtuous know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the mind will not fail to reproduce with intereſt thoſe ſeeds, which are ſown in it by ſtudy and obſervation. Above all, let every one guard againſt the dangerous opinion that he knows enough: an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that will weaken the energy and reduce the powers of the mind, which, though once perhaps vigorous and effectual, will be ſunk to a ſtate of literary imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, by cheriſhing vain and preſumptuous ideas of its own independence.</p>

He is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to trace Nature in all her nice and varied ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, with the minute accuracy of a Boyle, or the laborious inveſtigation of a Newton; but his <hi>good ſenſe</hi> will point out to him that no inconſiderable portion

of philoſophical knowledge is requiſite to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of his literary character. The ſciences are more independent, and require little or no aſſiſtance from the graces of poetry; but poetry, if ſhe would charm and inſtruct, muſt not be ſo haughty; ſhe muſt be contented to borrow of the ſciences, many of her choiceſt alluſions, and many of her moſt graceful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhments; and does it not magnify the character of true poeſy, that ſhe includes within herſelf all the ſcattered graces of every ſeparate art?</p>
            <p>THE rules of the great maſters in criticiſm may not be ſo neceſſary to the forming a good taſte, as the examination of thoſe original mines from whence they drew their treaſures of knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE three celebrated Eſſays on the Art of Poetry do not teach ſo much by their laws as by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the dead letter of their rules is leſs inſtructive than the living ſpirit of their verſe. Yet theſe rules are to a young poet, what the ſtudy of logarithms is to a young mathematician; they do not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to form his judgment, as afford him the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of convincing him that he is right. They do not preclude the difficulty of the operation; but at the concluſion of it, furniſh him with a fuller demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that he has proceeded on proper principles. When he has well ſtudied the maſters in whoſe ſchools the firſt critics formed themſelves, and fancies he has caught a ſpark of their divine flame, it may be a good method to try his own compoſitions by the teſt of the critic rules, ſo far indeed as the mechaniſm of poetry goes. If the examination be fair and candid, this trial, like the touch of It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>GOOD taſte always ſuits the meaſure of its admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the merit of the compoſition it examines. It accommodates its praiſes, or its cenſure, to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:019810_0088_0FACB457DC901E58"/>
of a work, and appropriates it to the nature of it. General applauſe, or indiſcriminate abuſe, is the ſign of a vulgar underſtanding. There are certain blemiſhes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he judicious and good-natured reader will candidly overlook. But the falſe ſublime, the tumour which is intended for greatneſs, the diſtorted figure, the puerile conceit, and the incongruous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, theſe are defects for which ſcarcely any other kind of merit can atone. And yet there may be more hope of a writer (eſpecially if he be a young one), who is now and then guilty of ſome of theſe faults, than of one who avoids them all, not through judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but feebleneſs, and who, inſtead of deviating into error is continually falling ſhort of excellence. The mere abſence of error implies that moderate and inferior degree of merit with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic taſte will be better ſatisfied than with the magnificent irregularities of exalted ſpirits. It ſtretches ſome minds to an uneaſy extenſion to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to attend to compoſitions ſuperlatively excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and it contracts liberal ſouls to a painful nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs to deſcend to books of inferior merit. A work of capital genius, to a man of an ordinary mind, is the bed of Procruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es to one of a ſhort ſtature, the man is too little to fill up the ſpace aſſigned him, and undergoes the torture in attempting it: and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or low production to a man of bright talents, is the puniſhment inflicted by Mez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntius; the living ſpirit has too much animation to endure patiently to be in contact with a dead body.</p>
            <p>TASTE ſeems to be a ſentiment of the ſoul, which gives the bias to opinion, for we feel before we reflect. Without this ſentiment, all knowledge, learning and opinion, would be cold, inert materials, whereas they become active principles when ſtirred, kindled, and inflamed by this animating quality.</p>

THERE is another feeling which is called Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm. The enthuſiaſm of ſenſible hearts is ſo ſtrong, that it only yields to the impulſe with which ſtriking objects act on it, but ſuch hearts help on the effect by their own ſenſibility. In a ſcene where Shakeſpeare and Garrick give perfection to each other, the feeling heart does not merely accede to the delirium they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: it does more, it is enamoured of it, it ſolicits the deluſion, it ſues to be deceived, and grudgingly cheriſhes the ſacred treaſure of its feelings. The poet and performer concur in carrying us
<q>Beyond this viſible diurnal ſphere.</q>
they bear us aloft in their airy courſe with unreſiſted rapidity, if they meet not with any obſtruction from the coldneſs of our own feelings. Perhaps only a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine ſpirits can enter into the detail of their writing and acting; but the multitude do not enjoy leſs acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are not able philoſophically to analyſe the ſources of their joy or ſorrow. If the others have the advantage of judging, theſe have at leaſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of feeling: and it is not from complaiſance to a few leading judges, that they burſt into peals of laughter, or melt into delightful agony; their hearts decide, and that is a deciſion from which there lies no appeal. It muſt however be confeſſed, that the nicer ſeparations of character, and the lighter and almoſt imperceptible ſhades which ſometimes diſtinguiſh them, will not be intimately reliſhed, unleſs there be a conſonancy of taſte as well as feeling in the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; though where the paſſions are principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the prophane vulgar come in for a larger por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the univerſal delight, than critics and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs are willing to allow them.</p>
            <p>YET enthuſiaſm, though the natural concomitant of genius, is no more genius itſelf, than drunkenneſs is
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019810_0090_0FACB459AC1C1188"/>
cheeerfulneſs; and that enthuſiaſm which diſcovers itſelf on occaſions not worthy to excite it, is the mark of a wretched judgment and a falſe taſte.</p>
            <p>NATURE produces innumerable objects: to imitate them, is the province of Genius; to direct thoſe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is the property of Judgment; to decide on their effects, is the buſineſs of Taſte. For Taſte, who ſits as ſupreme judge on the productions of Genius, is not ſatisfied when ſhe merely imitates Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſhe muſt alſo, ſays an ingenious French writer, imitate <hi>beautiful</hi> Nature. It requires no leſs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reject than to chooſe, and Genius might imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what is vulgar, under pretence that it was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, if Taſte did not carefully point out thoſe objects which are moſt proper for imitation. It alſo requires a very nice diſcernment to diſtinguiſh veriſimilitude from truth; for there is a truth in Taſte nearly as concluſive as demonſtration in mathematics.</p>
            <p>GENIUS, when in full impetuoſity of its career, often touches on the very brink of error; and is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, never ſo near the verge of the precipice, as when indulging its ſublimeſt ſlights. It is in thoſe great, but dangerous moments, that the curb of vigilant judgment is moſt wanting: while ſafe and ſober Dulneſs obſerves one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edions and inſipid round of tireſome uniformity, and ſteers equally clear of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricity and of beauty. Dulneſs has few redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies to retrench, few luxuriancies to prune, and few irregularities to ſmooth. Theſe, though errors, are the errors of Genius, for there is rarely redundancy without plenitude, or irregularity without greatneſs. The exceſſes of Genius may eaſily be retrenched, but the deficiencies of Dulneſs can never be ſupplied.</p>
            <p>THOSE who copy from others will doubtleſs be leſs excellent than thoſe who copy from Nature. To imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate imitators, is the way to depart too far from the great original herſelf. The latter copies of an engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019810_0091_0FACB45A0FA17ED0"/>
retain fainter and fainter traces of the ſubject, to which the earlier impreſſions bore ſo ſtrong a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems very extraordinary, that it ſhould be the moſt difficult thing in the world to be natural; and that it ſhould be harder to hit off the manners of real life, and to delineate ſuch characters as we converſe with every day, than to imagine ſuch as do not exiſt. But caricature is much eaſier than an exact outline, and the colouring of fancy leſs difficult than that of truth.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE do not always know what taſte they have, till it is awakened by ſome correſponding object; nay, genius itſelf is a fire, which in many minds would never blaze, if not kindled by ſome external cauſe.</p>
            <p>NATURE, that munificent mother, when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows the power of judging, accompanies it with the capacity of enjoying. The judgment, which is clear ſighted, points out ſuch objects as are calculated to inſpire love, and the heart inſtantaneouſly attaches it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to whatſoever is lovely.</p>
            <p>IN regard to literary reputation, a great deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the ſtate of learning in the particular age or nation, in which an author lives. In a dark and ignorant period, moderate knowledge will entitle its poſſeſſor to a conſiderable ſhare of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame; whereas, to be diſtinguiſhed in a polite and lettered age, requires ſtriking parts and deep erudition.</p>
            <p>WHEN a nation begins to emerge from a ſtate of mental darkneſs, and to ſtrike out the firſt rudiments of improvement, it chalks out a few ſtrong but incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſketches, gives the rude out-lines of general art, and leaves the filling up to the leiſure of happier days, and the refinement of more enlightened times. Their drawing is a rude <hi>Sbozzo,</hi> and their poetry wild minſtrelſy.</p>
            <p>PERFECTION of taſte is a point which a nation no
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019810_0092_0FACB45AE3C8A500"/>
ſooner reaches, than it overſhoots; and it is more difficult to return to it, after having paſſed it, than it was to attain when they fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hort of it. Where the arts begin to languiſh after having flouriſhed, they ſeldom indeed fall back to their original barbariſm, but a certain feebleneſs of exertion takes place, and it is more difficult to recover them from this dying lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to their proper ſtrength, than it was to poliſh them from their former rudeneſs; for it is a leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable undertaking to refine barbarity, than to ſtop decay; the firſt may be laboured into elegance, but the latter will rarely be ſtrengthened into vigour.</p>
            <p>TAST<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> exerts itſelf at firſt but feebly and imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it is repreſſed and kept back by a croud of the moſt diſcouraging prejudices: like an infant prince, who, though born to reign, yet holds an idle ſceptre, which he has not power to uſe, but is obliged to ſee with the eyes, and hear through the ears of other men.</p>
            <p>A WRITER of correct taſte will hardly ever go out of his way, even in ſearch of embelliſhment: he will ſtudy to attain the beſt end by the moſt natural means; for he knows that what is not natural cannot be beautiful, and that nothing can be beautiful out of its own place; for an improper ſituation will convert the moſt ſtriking beauty into a glaring defect. When by a well-connected chain of ideas, or a judicious ſucceſſion of events, the reader is ſnatched to "Thebes or Athens," what can be more impertinent than for the poet to obſtruct the operation of the paſſion he has juſt been kindling, by introducing a conceit which contradicts his purpoſe, and interrupts his buſineſs! Indeed, we cannot be tranſported, even in idea, to thoſe places, if the poet does not manage ſo adroitly as not to make us ſenſible of the journey: the inſtant we feel we are travelling, the writer's art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A WRITER of real taſte will take great pains in the perfection of his ſtyle, to make the reader believe that he took none at all. The writing which appears to be moſt eaſy, will be generally found to be leaſt imitable. The moſt elegant verſes are the moſt eaſily retained, they faſten themſelves on the memory, without its making any effort to preſerve them, and we are apt to imagine, that what is remembered with caſe, was written without difficulty.</p>
            <p>To conclude; Genius is a rare and precious gem, of which few know the worth; it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itter for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of the connoiſſeur, than for the commerce of mankind. Good ſenſe is a bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable at all times, and current in all places. It knows the value of ſmall things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that an aggregate of them makes up the ſum of human affairs. It elevates common concerns into
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:019810_0094_0FACB45C49056AF0"/>
matters of importance, by performing them in the beſt manner, and at the moſt ſuitable ſeaſon. Good ſenſe carries with it the idea of equality, while Genius is always ſuſpected of a deſign to impoſe the burden of ſuperiority; and reſpect is paid to it with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance which always attends other impoſts, the lower orders of mankind generally repining moſt at demands, by which they are leaſt liable to be affected.</p>
            <p>AS it is the character of Genius to penetrate with a lynx's beam into unfathomable abyſſes and uncreated worlds, and to ſee what is <hi>not,</hi> ſo it is the property of good ſenſe to diſtinguiſh perfectly, and judge accurately what really <hi>is.</hi> Good ſenſe has not ſo piercing an eye, but it has as clear a ſight: it does not penetrate ſo deeply, but as far as it <hi>does</hi> ſee, it diſcerns diſtinctly.
