            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Belief of a GOD and a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, certainly lies at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion; and as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was deſigned, by our all-wiſe Creator, to be the main Buſineſs of human Life, there is accordingly no Truth capable of more ſtrict Demonſtration than this; that there is a ſupream Spirit, who is the grand Superintendant of the Univerſe, &amp; over-rules in every Event. This Propoſition, therefore, I ſhall take for granted, in the preſent Diſcourſe; as I hope there is no Perſon in this Aſſembly, who doubts it.</p>
            <p>Wherever we turn our Eyes, we behold evident Traces of Infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, the Perfections of the Deity ſhining in his Works; and there are, frequently, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous interpoſitions of Divine Providence;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008560_0004_102F82A3F4347C98"/>
which, it would be, in the higheſt Degree, ſtupid in us, not to perceive; &amp; ungrateful, not to acknowledge. All of us, who have lived any conſiderable Time upon Earth, muſt needs recollect many critical Seaſons of their Lives, when they have been preſerved in moſt imminent Dangers, by the immediate Hand of GOD; and plucked as Brands out of the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And, no doubt, the wonderful Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of another Day, will point us to many more ſuch ſurpriſing Inſtances of unbounded Grace, which we are not now conſcious to. I cannot but imagine that there are many Things of this Nature, which we know not now, but ſhall know hereafter; and that this conſtitutes one principal Part of the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glorified Spirits above; to review theſe critical Seaſons, in all their Circumſtances; and adore their Almighty Guardian, with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous Thankſgivings.—Seaſons, in which, if Matters had not happened exactly as they did, by a myſterious Concurrence of ſecond Cauſes, influenced by Him who conſtantly guides and animates the whole; (by him alone, without any Forethought, or Aſſiſtance of theirs; nay, in ſome Inſtances, contrary to their Wiſhes and Expectations) they muſt inevitably have been miſerable through all their Pilgrimage upon Earth, and perhaps to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>But if the Finger of GOD is thus viſible in all the minute Incidents of human Life; if he
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008560_0005_102F82A88FD69890"/>
graciouſly conſults the Happineſs of every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, determines the Times before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Bounds of his Habitation; if the Hairs of our Head are all accurately numbred, and not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without our heavenly Father; certainly he is not an idle Spectator of the more important Tranſactions of the Globe, the Tumults of the People, the Revolution of States &amp; Kingdoms. No;—He does his Sovereign Pleaſure among the Armies of Heaven above, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth beneath; and it becomes us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Work of the LORD, and to conſider the Operation of his Hands. The Kingdom is the LORDS, and He is the Governor among the Nations. He blows the Trumpet, and they are rouſed to univerſal Battle: He waves the Olive Branch, and they are lulled in profound Peace.</p>
            <p>When he pleaſes, he elevates the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable of Mankind to the Pinnacle of human Glory; the Diſgrace of their Species, and the Scourge of their unhappy Subjects. When he pleaſes, he diſappoints the haughty Tyrant, in the midſt of his ambitious Enterpriſes; depoſes him from his exalted Station; and daſhes him to Pieces, as a Potter's Veſſel. When he pleaſes, he places upon the Throne a Man of an excellent Spirit; gives Wiſdom to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and vigor to his Arms; preſerves his inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Life, prevents him with the Bleſſings of Goodneſs, and ſets a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head; makes him the Terror of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008560_0006_102F82AA236EF410"/>
and the Protector of his People. The proud <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the amiable <hi>Cyrus,</hi> are equally his Servants, and ſubject to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; and, when he pleaſes, the abandoned <hi>Saul</hi> muſt fall a Sacrifice to his juſt Vengeance; that the devout <hi>David,</hi> the Man after his own Heart, may take the Charge of his diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſway the Scepter in Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>He overules in all the various Revolutions of an Earthly Court; manages the minute Springs, which actuate the Wheels of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and influences the unſearchable Heart of Kings. Sometimes, for wiſe and holy Ends, He permits a corrupt Miniſter to obtain the Favour of his Sovereign, preſide in the Cabinet, and ſit at the Helm of Government; permits him to abuſe the Confidence, and betray the Intereſts of his Royal Maſter; to embezzle the public Revenue, and prey upon the Bowels of the Conſtitution; to maintain a clandeſtine Correſpondence with the open Enemies of his Country; to receive Bribes and Penſions from a foreign Court; and to triumph, perhaps, for a long Courſe of Years, in the Succeſs of his treacherous and arbitrary Schemes; while the contemptible Tools of his Power grow rich with Rapine and Oppreſſion, the wicked walk on every ſide, and the vileſt of Men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. When he pleaſes he raiſes up an honeſt Patriot, inſpired with Sentiments of Virtue, who acts perpetually from the nobleſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, deſpiſes the Gain of Oppreſſion, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008560_0007_102F82ABB7ACE630"/>
his Hands from Holding of Bribes; animates him with a public Spirit, and a warm Affection to his bleeding Country; furniſhes him with an extenſive Capacity, and what is ſtill more valuable, an uncorrupted Heart; enlarges his Influence, and ſucceeds his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; makes him, at once, the Darling of his Prince, and the Favourite of a flouriſhing Nation; while his Eyes are upon the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Land, that they may dwell with him, and he is ſerved by ſuch as walk in a perfect Way. So the infamous <hi>Haman</hi> was bruſhed from the Preſence of King <hi>Abaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and received the juſt Demerit of his Crimes; that the upright <hi>Mordecai</hi> might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, accepted of the Multitude of his Brethren, ſeeking the Wealth of his People, and ſpeaking Peace to all his Seed.</p>
            <p>But let us leave the Confinement of the Court, extend our Views, and take a Survey of the Warlike Field; covered with regular Encampments, furrowed with Trenches, or glittering with hoſtile Arms. There we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the reſolute Troops in their intrepid March; the gallant Commanders levelling the deſtructive Inſtruments of Death; and the gilded Banners, unfurled, and waving in the Wind. Suddenly, the gay Scene vaniſhes from our Eyes; all is enveloped in Smoke, and Flame, and Sulphur. Hark! how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Din of the Battle, the Thunder of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008560_0008_102F82AF70F50CF0"/>
the Captains, and the Shouting; while the Groans of the Vanquiſhed, and the Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Conqueror, and all the horrid Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of War, rore thro' the Valley, and are echoed from the neighbouring Hills! Anon, the Noiſe abates, the Smoke diſſipates, and what a ghaſtly Spectacle is exhibited to our View! the moſt vigorous and athletick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with their brawney Limbs, once the Terror of the Mighty in the Land of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but now, pale, bloody, and ſcattered promiſcuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thouſands and ten Thouſands, Heaps upon Heaps, cover the Plain, and compleat the Carnage. And is not the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Hand ſtill conſpicuous? ſhould we not acknowledge and adore it? 'Tis He alone who can give the Victory, and determine the dubious Conteſt, when the Fate of an Empire hangs in Suſpence, and waits for the Deciſion of an Hour. When he pleaſes he can ſcatter a Panick thro' the braveſt Troops, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate an Army of the moſt experienced Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. 'Tis He who directs the military Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſteels the Heart of the ſucceſsful General. Every deſcending Sword is guided by Him, and every random Shot executes his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>He can level the proudeſt Cities, demoliſh their lofty Bulwarks, and lay low the Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the Terrible. At his ſovereign Nod,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008560_0009_102F82B272F5D660"/>
the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> muſt fall down proſtrate, and pave a Path for the conquering <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis He alſo who reigns LORD of the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean, holds the Winds in His Graſp, and comprehends the Waters in the Hollow of His Hand. Fleets and Navies, protected by Him, ride in Triumph upon the Face of the Deep. He ſteers them in their trackleſs Courſe, ſwells their proſperous Sails, and wafts them to the whiſh'd-for Haven. When He pleaſes, he ſcatters them in His Wrath, and diſperſes them with the Breath of His Mouth. The Clouds gather and blacken, the Tempeſt rages, the loud Surges fome, and the foundering Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſink like Lead in the fathomleſs Profound, only broken upon the Shore in ſhattered Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He commands, "Peace, be Still;" the Winds and the Waters obey Him; — not a Breath of diſobedient Air ruffles the ſerene Surface of the Flood.</p>
            <p>'Tis He over-rules, when contending Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons diſpute the Sovereignty of the Seas, and denounce Vengeance from the Mouth of their Cannon. He ſits the irreſiſtible Umpire, weighs their different Pretenſions in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Ballance: He frowns and they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated; and Victory attends His Smile.</p>
            <p>Thus we have taken an imperfect Survey of the Infinite GOD, as He manages the Wheels of Providence, and determines the Fate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; one Foot being upon the Sea, and the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008560_0010_102F82B41502A598"/>
other upon the dry Land. Should we not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge His Supreme Authority; and fall proſtrate at His Footſtool, in humble Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when, like the Prophet, in captured Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we behold this Appearance of the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Glory of the LORD? Should we not unite in the ſublime Aſcription of the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt? Pſal. lxxxvi.8.— 10.
<q>Among the Gods there is none like unto Thee, O LORD; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there any Works like unto thy Works. All Nations whom Thou haſt made, ſhall come and worſhip before Thee, O LORD; and ſhall glorify thy Name. For Thou art Great, and doſt wondrous Things: Thou art GOD alone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Were our Nation, at this Day, in calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Circumſtances, would it not be incumbent upon us, to humble ourſelves under the mighty Hand of GOD, to deprecate the Divine Wrath, and implore the Smiles of His Countenance? And while we are bleſt with ſo remarkable a Series of Proſperity and Succeſs, while the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſo wonderfully aſſerts our Cauſe, and our Enemies flee before us; while every Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that arrives from our Frontiers, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pacquet that croſſes the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> adds a new Article to the joyful Tidings, and a freſh Laurel to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Brows; it is equally our Duty to adore the Supream Benefactor, and comply with the Injunction of the Text;
<q>Give unto the LORD, O ye Kindreds of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008560_0011_102F82B831530B70"/>
People, give unto the LORD Glory and Strength. Give unto the LORD the Glory due unto His Name; bring an Offering, and come into his Courts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Honor and the Happineſs of this much-favoured Nation, that we have a devout Monarch upon the Throne, who enjoins this Practice upon us by his Authority, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it by his royal Example: and it is at his Call, by an expreſs Order from the Throne, that we now aſſembled together at this ſolemn Feſtival.</p>
            <p>And now, what a Scene of Wonder opens to our View! Good GOD! what an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scene of Wonders! Methinks, a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tranſport animates every Countenance, &amp; ſparkles in every Eye. Who can recount the innumerable Favours, beſtowed upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and it's Allies, in the Year paſt; that Year much to be remembred; that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Year in the Annals of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>? Who is equal to the boundleſs Taſk? What Tongue but falters, while the big Ideas crowd upon the Mind, and labor for Utterance? A few, out of the immenſe Multitude, the Time will ſuffer me but juſt to hint at.</p>
            <p>The LORD of Hoſts has wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Vindication of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe, even our Enemies themſelves being Judges. He has ſupported our illuſtrious Ally, the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>; a Name ever dear to thoſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008560_0012_102F82BBF275A9E0"/>
who have the Cauſe of Religion and Liberty at Heart;— ſupported him againſt one of the moſt dangerous Confederacies, that could be formed by the Powers of Antichriſt; while the Arms of the <hi>Empire</hi> have been levelled againſt him, the turbulent Court of <hi>France</hi> have conſpired his Ruin, and the barbarous Troops of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> have thirſted for his Blood. Expoſed as he frequently has been, amidſt all the Tumult and Horrors of Battle; Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands falling at his Side and Ten Thouſands at his right Hand; GOD has ever protected him, and for the moſt Part, has crowned him with Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>The Preſervation of his Majeſty's <hi>German</hi> Dominions; the Expulſion of the <hi>French</hi> from the Electorate of <hi>Hanover</hi>; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Succeſſes which have attended the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> call alſo this Day for our Gratitude and Praiſe.</p>
            <p>When we leave theſe foreign Proſpects, and take a ſhort Survey of thoſe which ſtill more nearly concern us; When we behold one of the beſt of Kings placed upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, who has ever approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the benevolent Father of his People; who juſtly ſuppoſes his own Honor to conſiſt in the Freedom of his Subjects, and places his higheſt Happineſs in their Proſperity; who deſpiſes the abject Submiſſion of Slaves, while he poſſeſſes all th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008560_0014_102F82CA8D330740"/>In vain has the proud Monarch of <hi>France</hi> endeavoured to retrieve his Glory, by a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Invaſion of <hi>Great-Britain:</hi> his vaſt milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Preparations, and empty Gaſconades, have only ſerved to ſink the <hi>Royal Bankrupt</hi> ſo much the deeper in Diſtreſs, and render him more compleatly contemptible and ridiculous. For the moſt Part, his inſignificant Squadrons have thought it prudent to anchor quietly in Port, guarded by a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet: or if, at any Time, they have ventured to parade upon the Ocean; they have had ſufficient Reaſon to repent of their Raſhneſs. Their Supplies have been cut off, and Numbers of their Capital Ships have been demoliſhed. Nay, one of their principal Harbours has been actually entred: the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Standard has floated triumphant upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of <hi>France</hi>; while their Stores and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magazines have blazed as a Bonfire, upon the joyful Occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> we behold <hi>Guadaloupe</hi> and its Dependencies, ſurrendring to a ſmall naval Force, and a handful of gallant Troops; —one of the moſt valuable and important of the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands.</p>
            <p>When we turn our Eyes to <hi>this</hi> Continent, we have opened a new Theatre of marvelous Events; we are ſurrounded with a freſh Series of ſurpriſing Mercies.</p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs for us to recollect, upon this Occaſion, that it is but a little while, ſince

our Affairs wore a moſt melancholly Aſpect; and a univerſal Conſternation appeared in every Countenance. You may remember the diſmal Seaſon, when, Year after Year, the ALMIGHTY frowned upon our Enterpriſes and Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and an inſulting Enemy ravaged our Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Our Fortreſſes were taken and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; our Troops intimidated and deſtroyed, or carried Captive to a foreign Land: or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they were overwhelmed with a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Panic; perhaps, they ſaw the Shadow of the Mountains as if they were Men, and miſtook Rocks for an Encampment;—the Sound of a ſhaken Leaf terrified them, and they fled when none purſued! Perhaps,
<q>the mighty Men of <hi>Babylon</hi> were affrighted, they had forborn to fight, they remained in their Holds, their Might failed, and they became as Women!</q>
—Be that as it will, for it is not my Buſineſs to charge the Fault any where; certain it is, that one Year of Diſappointments rolled away after another: The Harveſt was paſt, the Summer was ended, and ſtill we were not ſaved. The howling Inhabitants of the Wilderneſs triumphed upon our Frontiers, were decorated with our Spoils, and glutted with the Blood of our deareſt Friends.—
<q>O! that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep, Day and Night, for the Slain of the Daughter of my People!</q>
—Then it was, that we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008560_0016_102F82CC6FF06A48"/>
poured out our Complaint in the Bitterneſs of our Souls: we wept between the Porch and the Altar,
<q>Spare thy People, O LORD, give not Thine Heritage to Reproach, ſuffer not the Heathen to triumph over us!</q>
—At length GOD has heard our Prayer, and avenged the Cauſe of his ſuffering Servants.</p>
            <p>And now, my Brethren, what a ſtriking Contraſt! How is the Scene reverſed! GOD has proſpered us in every Attempt, and cauſed our Enemies to flee before us.—Let us pauſe a little, and enumerate our Conqueſts.—We are poſſeſſed of the important Paſs and Fort of <hi>Niagara</hi>; &amp; have defeated a large Body of the Enemy, which were marching to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.—<hi>Fort du Queſne,</hi> (a Diſpute concerning which, if you remember, was one principal Occaſion of the preſent War,) has now changed its Name to <hi>Pittſburgh</hi>; in Honor of that Immortal Patriot, who needs no ſuch feeble Monument to perpetuate his Memory. —The formidable Li<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:008560_0017_102F82CE0E956218"/>We may juſtly, upon this Occaſion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud the Bravery of our Troops, and the wiſe Conduct of our experienced General. This is but equitable: It is rendring Honor to whom Honor is due. But ſtill we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this is the LORD's Doing, and it is marvelous in our Eyes!
<q>Give unto the LORD o ye Kindreds of the People, give unto the LORD Glory and Strength. Give unto the LORD the Glory due unto His Name; bring an Offering, and come into His Courts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, theſe were but ſmall Things in Thine Eyes, O our GOD; for we have ſtill a <hi>new Song</hi> to ſing, and the moſt glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Succeſs is yet unrelated. <q>Shout, said <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
for the LORD hath given you the CITY!</q>
The proud City of QUEBECK compleats our Conqueſts, and adds new Luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to the Important Year.

to our Arms! When we conſider how many fruitleſs Attempts have been made by us &amp; our Fathers, for the Reduction of this important Place; how immenſe the Blood and Treaſure which have been expended, to no Purpoſe, in former Armaments; and the inconſiderable Number of Troops by which it was at laſt accompliſhed; it ſhould aggrandiſe our Ideas of this glorious Action, as it will conſecrate the memorable Name of WOLFE, to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all our Rejoycing this Day, that gallant General demands a Tear, to be dropt upon his Funeral Urn;—that gallant General who, in the Bloom of Years, diſplayed ſuch conſummate military Skill; and expired ſo bravely, in the Arms of Conqueſt;
<q>Great while he liv'd, but greater when he died.</q>
But, my Brethren, we ſhould realiſe the Voice of GOD in this Event.
<q>Ceaſe ye from Man, whoſe Breath is in his Noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</q>
We ſhould look beyond ſecond Cauſes; and acknowledge that
<q>there is <hi>none</hi> like unto the GOD of <hi>Jeſurun,</hi> who has ridden in the Heaven, for our Help; and in His Excellency upon the Skies.</q>

            </p>
            <p>And indeed, the Hand of GOD is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in every Article of this Expedition. It was He who guided our Fleet thro' the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Navigation of <hi>St. Lawrence</hi>; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them in a violent Tempeſt, to which they were expoſed ſoon after their Arrival. It was He who enabled our Forces to make their Encampment, with ſcarce the Loſs of a Man; who plentifully furniſhed them with the Neceſſaries of Life; who was the Health of their Countenance, and their GOD; and who preſerved their ſcattered Parties from the lurking Savages of the Wilderneſs. It was He who ſupported them thro' all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of a dangerous Campaign, and guarded them from the fatal Meſſengers of Death. It was He who infatuated the unhappy <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm,</hi> to forſake the Advantages of his Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and riſk a deciſive Engagement. It was He who, in the Day of Battle, inſpired our Army with irreſiſtible Reſolution, and gave them the Victory over ſuch ſuperior Numbers. It was He who intimidated the vanquiſhed Enemy, and opened the Gates of the devoted City.</p>
