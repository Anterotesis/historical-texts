            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of the enſuing Sections is not to amuſe the fancy, or gratify the curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of any; nor are they ſent out into the world with any expectation that the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will procure to the author the applauſe of mankind. If they may prove ſubſervient to awaken the conſciences of thoſe who have any love to the bleeding cauſe of Zion, and in this way, become effectual to revive the true ſpirit of diſcipline and brotherly watchfulneſs in the churches, the author will eſteem himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded a thouſand fold; and all the contempt that may be caſt upon him, to be infinitely overbalanced.</p>
            <p>I had fully intended to have reduced the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments &amp; illuſtrations under the ſeveral heads to a form much more conciſe than that in which they now appear: but conſidering the piece as being intended for all capacities, and that it is of importance that the force &amp; weight of every ſentiment be fully underſtood, I had rather ſuffer the impeachment from the learned &amp; judicious of being ſomewhat too repetitious, than to have any ſentiment paſs without being fully underſtood by thoſe of more vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:044516_0003_101E0E296E3B1D10"/>If any ſhould be convinced, that what is aimed at and enforced in the enſuing Sections is indeed according to that order which the great King and head of the church ever meant ſhould take place amongſt the people called by his name, this conviction muſt ſurely bind him to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to reduce things to ſuch order in the houſe of God, at every hazard, &amp; at the riſque of every conſequence; and to refrain purſuing ſuch an object under the influence of any motive whatever, muſt ſurely expoſe him to be condemned out of his own mouth, that ſome beloved object lies nearer his heart than the honour of that Redeemer whom he has profeſſed to love more than father or mother, wife or children, houſes or lands, or his own life.</p>
            <p>Our ruin is certainly near, even at the door, if the Lord do not interpoſe to recover us. To his bleſſing, therefore, the enſuing Sections are devoutly recommended.</p>

               <hi>SECTION I.</hi> The words explained.</head>
            <p>THERE is no doubtful interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe words: and ſhould they be applied to the relation that ſubſiſts between a temporal prince &amp; his ſubjects, they would be readily underſtood, and the meaning of them would be obvious to the meaneſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Should the prince expoſtulate with his ſubjects by ſuch an interrogation, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs them in this manner, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately underſtand him as meaning to upbraid them with paying no regard to the laws of his kingdom, whilſt they profeſſed to own him for their king; and that he eſteemed it no honour at all, but rather an inſult upon his dignity, for them to profeſs to own him for their king, &amp; at the ſame time pay no regard to the laws of his kingdom. Should a people have recourſe to a round of fulſome compliment and empty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044516_0005_101E0E3306B27658"/>
flattery with a view to pleaſe their prince, and expect that he would look upon himſelf as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honoured by them, whilſt at the ſame time they trampled his laws under foot in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, they muſt be fully confident, that their prince was void of the underſtanding of a child, and knew not his right hand from his left. For any to attempt to treat a temporal prince in this manner, we readily know would be at the peril of their lives; and that if the prince meant to maintain the dignity of his kingdom, he would very quickly teach them, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt tokens of his diſpleaſure, the horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and daring preſumption of ſuch conduct.</p>
            <p>This would be the light in which a temporal prince would be underſtood by one and all, upon his expoſtulating with his ſubjects in this manner, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? And the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words is as plain in reference to that ſubjection we owe to him whom we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to own for our Lord and maſter. Every one is ſenſible of the abſurdity of a people's profeſſing to own a temporal prince for their king, and at the ſame time pay no regard to the laws of his kingdom: and they fully ſee, at firſt view, the horrid inſult this people would be guilty of, ſhould they profeſs a high vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for their king, and at the ſame time trample on the laws of his kingdom in his preſence. And they would, <hi>on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:044516_0006_101E0E348912AD78"/>
ſee things in this point of light in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the relation between Chriſt and the profeſſed ſubjects of his kingdom, were it not ſo that they love darkneſs rather than light.</p>

               <q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</q> 
               <hi>SECTION II.</hi> The words further explained.</head>
            <p>THE interrogation contained in theſe words is to be underſtood as being addreſſed to the ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom at large, in every age of the world. And when applied to thoſe bodies who are incorporated together by ſolemn covenant, we may have a clear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their meaning by having recourſe to the light in which they would be underſtood when made uſe of by a temporal prince in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his people at large. If an earthly prince ſhould call upon his ſubjects at large to <hi>do the things which he had ſaid,</hi> they would readily underſtand him to mean that every one, in his proper ſtation, ſhould take heed, not only to govern his own <hi>perſonal</hi> conduct by a regard to what was enjoined in the laws of his kingdom; but alſo that they ſee to it that his authority was reverenced, and his laws regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one and all incorporated together under his protection and dominion. Nothing is more eſſential to the honour of a prince, than the faithful execution of the laws of his kingdom;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:044516_0007_101E0E360DF038D8"/>
and nothing will bring contempt on the dignity of his government ſo ſpeedily and effectually, as to diſpenſe with the execution of his laws, by ſuffering them to be treated with defiance and neglect. If the laws of a prince are not put into execution, they are not treated <hi>as laws,</hi> but only <hi>as empty declarations</hi> that have no force. The penalty annexed to a law, is the whole of that which gives force and energy to the law, and renders it of the nature of a law. Take away this, and it ceaſes to be a law, and nothing remains but a meer empty declaration, by which a people are under no bonds to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and regulate their conduct. And if the penalties annexed to the laws of a prince are not exacted, and the laws of his kingdom are not put into execution by thoſe appointed for this purpoſe, the force and authority of his laws are as effectually made void as if no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties were annexed to them. Nay more, for a temporal prince to ſuffer things to go on at ſuch a rate among the ſubjects of his kingdom, would be a more effectual way to teach them to treat him with contempt, than if he had never made any law for the regulation of their conduct, but had thrown the reins upon the necks of one and all, and gave unlimited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to do as they pleaſe. The honour of a temporal prince is <hi>too ſacred</hi> to be trifled with in this manner. If thoſe whom he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to put his laws into execution ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044516_0008_101E0E3AB38F7298"/>
be convicted before him of having been inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the duties of their office, and of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his laws to be trampled under foot by others, it would be in vain for them to plead that they had ever took heed to govern their own <hi>perſonal</hi> conduct by a regard to the laws of their prince. There is no one but would be aſhamed to offer ſuch a trifling plea to a governor; for they would know he would not accept it. Nothing is more plain to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of every perſon, than theſe things, when applied to that relation which ſubſiſts between a temporal prince and his ſubjects. And why theſe things are not as plain, <hi>on the ſame principles,</hi> and as eaſy to be underſtood, in reference to that relation that ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the profeſſed ſubjects of his viſible kingdom, can be accounted for in no other way than this, that mankind do <hi>hate the light, neither will they come unto it, leſt their deeds ſhould be made manifeſt and reproved.</hi>

               <hi>SECTION III.</hi> The words explained in another point of view.</head>
            <p>WE readily underſtand, that if a temporal prince ſhould require it of his ſubjects <hi>to do the things which he has ſaid,</hi> his meaning would be, that the laws of his kingdom were to be the <hi>only</hi> rule of their civil conduct. They
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:044516_0009_101E0E3F5CE15750"/>
would never dream that their prince would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them in ſubſtituting <hi>any other</hi> ſyſtem of laws for the regulation of their civil conduct, in the room of thoſe which he had enacted for this purpoſe. For any of his ſubjects, when arraigned before their prince for the violation of any of the laws of <hi>his</hi> kingdom, to plead that their conduct was agreeable to what was allowed by the laws of <hi>ſome other kingdom,</hi> would be the higheſt affront they could offer to their prince; and would amount to an open declaration that they meant to caſt off their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to their prince, and be ſubject to the authority of ſome other king. Mankind dare not offer ſuch pleas to their earthly governors; for they fully underſtand, that a temporal prince does ever expect that <hi>the laws of his kingdom,</hi> and <hi>no other laws,</hi> are regarded by his ſubjects as the only rule of their civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct And if mankind had not their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings darkened by a deep-rooted, invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, perverſe reliſh for wicked things, they would as readily view theſe things in the ſame point of light in reference to the relation that ſubſiſts between Chriſt and the profeſſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his viſible kingdom. <hi>What he has ſaid,</hi> and the laws of his kingdom, would be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as the <hi>only</hi> rule of their conduct: and they would no more think of having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>any other ſtandard</hi> to meaſure their conduct by, than the ſubjects of a temporal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044516_0010_101E0E426C68BA88"/>
prince would think of pleading in arreſt of judgment, that their conduct was agreeable to what was allowed by the laws of ſome other kingdom.</p>

               <hi>SECTION IV.</hi> That profeſſing chriſtians in general have no claim to the character which they have aſſumed.</head>
            <p>THERE is no corporation of chriſtians but what do profeſs to own Chriſt for their Lord; and there is nothing which they do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue themſelves by more highly, than the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their being the ſubjects of Chriſt. Their fondneſs for this is ſo eager and ſtrong, that it is impoſſible to fire the indignation of a man to a higher degree, than by charging it upon him that he is deſtitute of religion. But if it ſhall appear, that profeſſing chriſtians in general are not governed in the tenor of their viſible conduct by a regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word, there will need nothing more to prove that they are not his viſible ſubjects. For ſurely it is impoſſible to conceive, that any can be the viſible <hi>ſubjects</hi> of Chriſt, unleſs they are in a viſible <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him. So far as any do appear to be in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt, ſo far do they appear to be his ſubjects; and neither ſcripture nor common ſenſe will admit of any other rule to judge by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044516_0011_101E0E43EF3D0868"/>
in this matter. And what is it that we mean by a viſible ſubjection to Chriſt? The anſwer is plain; and it is obvious to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a child. So far as a perſon appears to be governed in the <hi>prevailing</hi> tenor of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by a ſacred regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word, ſo far is he in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubjection to Chriſt, and no farther. And this being the <hi>ſole criterion</hi> whereby to meaſure the viſible ſubjection of profeſſing chriſtians to Chriſt as their Lord, and King, the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of it is ſurely ſufficient to flaſh convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every breaſt, that there is no viſible ſubjection to Chriſt amongſt thoſe in general who profeſs to own him for their Lord. If any are diſpoſed to think that this is too bold and uncharitable an aſſertion concerning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing chriſtians, I would only remind them, that whilſt they tax the author with the charge of uncharitableneſs in aſſerting ſuch a thing concerning profeſſing chriſtians in general, they are aſſerting the ſame thing concerning one another, and concerning profeſſing chriſtians in general, every day of their lives. If a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould openly declare that he could put no confidence in his chriſtian brethren, it would be the very ſame thing as if he ſhould declare that he does not look upon it that they mean to be in ſubjection to Chriſt. And if profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtians <hi>conduct</hi> towards one another in ſuch a manner as to demonſtrate that they can
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:044516_0012_101E0E4600963520"/>
put no confidence in each other, it is ſurely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to their openly declaring in the plaineſt manner, and in the loudeſt accents of language, that they have this perſuaſion concerning each other, that they do not mean or intend to be governed by a regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word. For it is impoſſible to withhold their confidence towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on any other principle than ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and perſuaſion concerning each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And by chriſtians putting confidence in each other, I would be underſtood to mean that confidence only which is agreeable to their profeſſion. We put confidence in gentlemen as gentlemen; in men of honor as men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. That is, there are certain rules which gentlemen mean ever to obſerve in the manner of their treating others; and when we have found out what their rules are, we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent what treatment we ſhall receive from a man who wears the character of a gentleman. There are certain principles which men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor profeſs ever to act from in their dealings with others; and when we have found what theſe principles are, we are confident how they will deal with us upon every occaſion. But if we put confidence in a profeſſing chriſtian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an apprehenſion or on the warrant of his being a gentleman or a man of honor, we don't put confidence in him as a chriſtian; and the exerciſe of ſuch confidence is no mark at all of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:044516_0013_101E0E4DB1C9A6B8"/>
any charity towards him. If the confidence of profeſſing chriſtians one towards another is not founded upon a mutual apprehenſion that each other is governed by a ſacred regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word, there is no chriſtian confidence, and conſequently no chriſtian charity amongſt them. And ſurely there is no need of any labor to prove that there is nothing of <hi>this</hi> mutual confidence to be ſeen in the conduct of profeſſing chriſtans in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one towards another. We know it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition, in the ſame manner as we know we ſee the light of the ſun at noon day, whilſt we are ſurrounded and covered with its rays. And we furthermore know, that it is abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for profeſſing chriſtians to have <hi>this</hi> mutual confidence towards each other, whilſt they evidently ſee that they are ſo commonly diſpoſed to bite and devour one another, by ſeeking to get the advantage of each other in their commerce and dealings; or to ſlander, backbite, and reproach one another; or to be unfaithful in fulfilling their promiſes and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual engagements to each other; or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the wants and diſtreſſes of each other. Where theſe things are to be ſeen, as being manifeſtly allowed and indulged, in the open conduct of profeſſing chriſtians, it is as abhorrent to every dictate of common ſenſe to believe concerning them that they mean or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do as the word of God enjoins, as it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044516_0014_101E0E4F32F9D5D0"/>
would be to think that they are employed, every day of their lives, in working miracles after the example of Chriſt and his apoſtles. And whilſt it is impoſſible, on ſuch a principle as this, for profeſſing chriſtians to put mutual confidence in each other, nothing more is needful to prove out this point, that there is no viſibility of ſubjection to Chriſt amongſt thoſe in general who profeſs to own him for their Lord. They are ſwift witneſſes againſt themſelves &amp; againſt one another, that their practice does, every day, give their profeſſion the lie; and that it is the whole buſineſs of their lives to mock &amp; inſult the Redeemer, whilſt they call him Lord, Lord, &amp; do not the things which he has ſaid.</p>

            <p>THAT profeſſing chriſtians in general have no claim to the character which they have aſſumed, is ſo evident as to be generally, if not univerſally, acknowledged &amp; aſſented to. They are ſo generally and univerſally ſenſible, when they make a ſolemn profeſſion, that they have no meaning at all to their covenant vows, that they dare not put confidence in one another on the warrant of thoſe bonds which theſe vows do lay them under. In exerciſing confidence in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they dare not venture any further than they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044516_0015_101DC0A688AF86A8"/>
are under bonds, &amp; are holden to each other by the laws, uſages, &amp; cuſtoms of the ſtate where they dwell. And when theſe laws, uſages, and cuſtoms are the ſole foundation of that mutual confidence which profeſſing chriſtians do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in each other, <hi>what do they more than others?</hi> They might as well exerciſe <hi>this</hi> confidence in one another, if they had never made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the chriſtian religion at all: for it is the <hi>ſame kind</hi> of mutual confidence, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſame warrant, as the civilized hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, yea, and the very barbarians through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, do univerſally exerciſe one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another. Nothing is more evident than that <hi>this kind</hi> of mutual confidence has not the leaſt degree of chriſtian charity in it; and let it be exerciſed to ever ſo high a degree, it gives not the leaſt evidence that profeſſing chriſtians do believe that each other have any meaning at all to their ſolemn covenant vows. Nay, whilſt they exerciſe a mutual confidence in each other on the warrant of thoſe bonds they are under by the laws, uſages, and cuſtoms of the ſtate where they live; whilſt theſe laws, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and cuſtoms are the ſole foundation of their mutual confidence in each other, and the ſole rule and meaſure of that confidence which they exerciſe in each other, and they dare not truſt one another but only in ſuch a way as <hi>theſe bonds</hi> will hold them; it is certainly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that they have no idea or expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:044516_0016_101E0E5247084B00"/>
that profeſſing chriſtians do mean to be held by <hi>any other kind of bonds</hi> than what they are under by the laws, uſages and cuſtoms of the ſtate where they live; and conſequently that they have no meaning at all to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant vows. For ſurely ſo far forth as there is any meaning to thoſe ſolemn covenant vows that chriſtians are under, <hi>theſe</hi> would hold them moſt ſacredly to the faithful diſcharge of every duty and engagement that they owe to each other, without the intervention of any other kind of bonds whatever. And if it is <hi>any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bonds</hi> that hold them to be faithful to each other in any inſtance; and if they will not be faithful to each other, <hi>without being holden by other bonds;</hi> it is not the authority of Chriſt that governs them; neither do they do any thing at all in his name; but they are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole of their conduct by a regard to the authority of the laws, uſages and cuſtoms of the world; and this authority is ſupreme in their views, and they exalt it into the throne of God, whilſt it is not only the <hi>higheſt,</hi> but the <hi>only</hi> authority which, in their practice, they bow down before, and to which they yield ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. It is impoſſible that profeſsing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians can be in ſubjection to Chriſt, whilſt this is the tenor of their conduct; for <hi>to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you are to whom you obey;</hi> and he is your Lord to whoſe authority you are in ſubjection.</p>

               <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> That the neglect of executing the laws of Chriſt's kingdom is the ſource of that viſible hypocriſy which is ſo evident in the conduct of profeſſing chriſtians.</head>
            <p>ENOUGH has been ſaid to prove out this point, that profeſſing chriſtians in general do not mean or intend to have their viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct governed by a regard to what Chriſt has ſaid and enjoined in his word. They are ſwift witneſſes againſt themſelves, and againſt one another, that they have no meaning at all to their covenant vows, whilſt they dare not put confidence in one another but only as they are holden by bonds of an entirely different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind from thoſe which their covenant vows do lay them under. There is no ſtate or kingdom on earth, either among the civilized heathens, or the rudeſt barbarians, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which is treated with ſuch inſolence and contempt as the authority of Chriſt is treated by thoſe who are incorporated together as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his viſible kingdom. When thoſe who dwell together in any certain ſtate or kingdom come under obligations to each other accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of the ſtate or kingdom they are under, the authority of <hi>theſe</hi> laws is too ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to ſuffer ſuch obligations to be trifled with or violated. And if you can find out what are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:044516_0018_101E0E5B97D45F50"/>
the laws, uſages and cuſtoms of the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unpoliſhed barbarians, you are at once convinced how far you may put confidence in them. Only take heed that the confidence you put in them is founded upon the laws, uſages and cuſtoms by which they are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you are entirely ſafe: for the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe laws, uſages and cuſtoms, will bind them to a faithful diſcharge of thoſe obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they come under to you. On this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it is always ſafe for mankind, in every age of the world, and amongſt all nations, to put confidence in one another, only provided their confidence is founded upon the authority of thoſe laws by which they are governed. So ſacred is the authority of the kingdoms of this world, that mankind dare not trifle in matters where <hi>this</hi> authority binds them. But is it ſo, in any degree of compariſon, where men are under bonds to each other by the authority of Chriſt? When a man has ſworn allegiance to Chriſt, and has ſolemnly profeſſed himſelf a member of his viſible kingdom; have we, in a general way, any more warrant to expect that he means to govern his conduct by a regard to the true ſpirit &amp; plain meaning of his covenant vows, than we have to expect that we ſhall find his conduct according to the precepts of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met's alcoran? And ſurely there is ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful reaſon why things ſhould be ſo infinitely different in Chriſt's kingdom from what they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:044516_0019_101E0E5D19D799C0"/>
are in any other kingdom upon earth; why the authority of Chriſt in his viſible kingdom ſhould be contemned and deſpiſed, whilſt the authority of earthly kingdoms is revered.</p>
            <p>What can be the reaſon that we can readily put confidence in a man on the warrant of thoſe bonds he is under by the laws of the land, and can put no confidence in him on the warrant of thoſe bonds he is under by the laws of Chriſt? Why are the laws of an earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the authority of theſe laws, ſo much more powerful to bind men to the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe bonds which theſe laws lay them under, than the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and the authority of his laws, are to bind men to the faithful diſcharge of thoſe duties which his laws do enjoin? <hi>It is becauſe the laws of one kingdom are faithfully executed, and the laws of the other are ſuffered to be treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and defiance.</hi> If the laws of any earthly kingdom ſhould not be executed, but one and all ſhould be ſuffered to trample upon them as they pleaſe, ſuch a ſyſtem of laws would ſoon loſe all their energy, and that people would be in a ſtate of more abſolute anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than if they had no law amongſt them. The faithful execution of the laws of any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is the whole of that which gives force &amp; energy to the laws of that kingdom; and in proportion as the laws of any kingdom are faithfully executed, will theſe laws be revered
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:044516_0020_101E0E5ED61D7BD8"/>
and obeyed by the ſubjects of that kingdom; <hi>and there is nothing elſe, there is no other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> whereby it is poſſible to bring a people into a viſible ſubjection to the laws of any kingdom whatever, and to form their conduct and manners according to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of the laws of that kingdom. The viſible temper, conduct, and manners of a people, will be according to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of what is pointed out and enjoined in the laws of the kingdom to which they are ſubject, in proportion to the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which the laws of that kingdom are executed. It is impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for this being the order and practice of a kingdom, thoſe who ſhould remain openly and viſibly diſobedient to what the laws of the kingdom did enjoin, the operation of the laws would of courſe ſpue them out of the limits of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>This one obſervation does certainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and nothing more is needed to prove, that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in his houſe; and that this is the capital and higheſt reaſon why the viſible conduct of profeſſing chriſtians is not according to what is pointed out and enjoined in the laws of this kingdom: for ſurely, were it ſo that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom were faithfully executed, there would ever be as much of a foundation for chriſtians to put confidence in one another
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:044516_0021_101E0E6211351338"/>
on the warrant of thoſe bonds they are under by the authority of Chriſt, as there now is amongſt the members of any civil kingdom to put confidence in each other on the warrant of thoſe bonds which the laws of the kingdom do lay them under. The execution of the laws of Chriſt's kingdom would ſurely render theſe laws as powerful to govern the viſible conduct of profeſſing chriſtians, as the execution of the laws of any earthly kingdom does ever render the laws of that kingdom powerful to govern the civil conduct of its ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The only reaſon why one man can have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in another on the warrant of his being under bonds by the laws of the land, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, that if he refuſes to anſwer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, that law will be executed upon him which will oblige him to a punctual fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his covenant. And had we the like warrant for our confidence, that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom would be put into execution againſt every one that ſhould turn his back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the path of his duty, there would ever be the ſame foundation for confidence that the members of his viſible kingdom would walk according to their high and holy calling: and the capital reaſon why it is not ſo, and profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtians in general are ſo entirely conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world in their viſible conduct, that we can diſcern no difference between them and the reſt of the world, is, becauſe the laws of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:044516_0022_101E0E6849D0F080"/>
Chriſt's kingdom are not put into execution amongſt them. And ſurely, whilſt they ſuffer the laws of Chriſt's kingdom to be openly trampled under foot by thoſe who are called by his name, their very profeſſion is an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inſult upon him, and they are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provoking him to his face in the moſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring manner, whilſt they call him Lord, Lord, and do not the things which he has ſaid.</p>

            <p>THERE is no corporation amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind but what are ready to perſuade themſelves, and would have it tho't by others, that it is their meaning to be governed by the laws of their corporation, and to put theſe laws into execution. To profeſs otherwiſe, and openly declare that they did not mean to be governed by the laws of their corporation, and that they did not mean to put theſe laws into execution, would be the ſame thing as to declare that they did not belong to the corporation, and had no intereſt or concern in it. On this principle thoſe who are incorporated together by ſolemn covenant, as members of Chriſt's viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, would fain perſuade themſelves, and have
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:044516_0023_101E0E6B581CB6D8"/>
others think, that it is their meaning to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in the whole of their conduct, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and to put theſe laws into execution. To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that this is not their meaning, &amp; that they have no ſuch intent or deſign;—that after they have made a ſolemn profeſſion, and have bound their ſouls by all the ties that are ſolemn and ſacred, to be wholly devoted to the fear of God, and to walk together in a univerſal obedience to what he has enjoined in his word, they meant to live as much at looſe ends, and to ſuffer one another to live as much at looſe ends, as if they were under none of theſe bonds;— for them to <hi>acknowledge</hi> that theſe are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they act upon in the ſolemn profeſſion they make, would be ſuch barefaced impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as to ſurpaſs the hypocriſy of devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.</p>
            <p>And hence we may be ſure, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that has been ſaid to prove that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are not executed in his houſe, profeſſing chriſtians in general will labor moſt eagerly to perſuade themſelves, and have others believe, that it <hi>is</hi> their meaning to govern themſelves by a regard to the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and to do what in them lies to put theſe laws into execution. And on this principle many will feel a ſurprize that any one ſhould aſſert that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are not executed in the churches that profeſs to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:044516_0024_101E0E6E64122950"/>
own him for their Lord; and will be confident that ſuch an aſſertion does favour of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table arrogance, and unwarrantable boldneſs; and that the churches in general are unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abuſed by ſuch an aſſertion. Surely if the author had taken pains to acquaint himſelf with the practice of churches in general, he might have known that they do not mean to allow of any groſs tranſgreſſions in the conduct of their members, ſuch as open profaneneſs, ſtealing, lying, &amp;c. It is not the deſign of the author to diſpute or call in queſtion the truth of ſuch an aſſertion. Let it be granted that churches do keep up a careful watch over the conduct of their members to keep them from ſuch groſs tranſgreſſions; if they mean to go no further in exerciſing the diſcipline of God's houſe than to ſuppreſs the out-breakings of ſuch kinds of open wickedneſs in the conduct of their members; this is ſo far from being an evidence that they have it in view to put the laws of Chriſt into execution, that it is a full demonſtration to the contrary. For whilſt they will diſcipline their members for ſuch groſs tranſgreſſions, and yet at the ſame time, indulge and paſs over that conduct in them which the word of God does as abſolutely abhor, and as ſolemnly condemn, as it does any of thoſe groſs tranſgreſſions, the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are not the rule of their conduct, and they have no reference at all, either to the will or the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:044516_0025_101E0E6FE6D4D778"/>
of Chriſt in dealing with and diſciplining their members. Upon what principle can it be that churches will deal with their members for ſtealing, and yet at the ſame time will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and paſs over that conduct in them which is as direct and daring a violation of that rule of equity, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye the ſame unto them, as ſtealing it of the eighth command?</hi> For it is evident to the underſtanding of a child, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of every perſon, that profeſſors are indulged in ſuch conduct whilſt it is a common thing among them to bite and devour, to grind and oppreſs, to backbite and defame one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And now is it that churches apprehend that the eighth command is more ſacred in the eye of the Redeemer than the great rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that they will deal with their members for the open violation of the one, and paſs over that conduct in them which is as daring a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the other? They dare not pretend this. And hence there is no other reaſon can be aſſigned for this conduct in churches in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the groſs violations of the eighth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and paſſing over the open violations of the great rule of equity, but this, <hi>That the world condemns the one and not the other.</hi> The groſs violations of the eighth command are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally condemned by the laws, uſages and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the world; and if churches ſhould not condemn <hi>ſuch</hi> conduct in their members, <hi>the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:044516_0026_101E0E73033814D8"/>
world would condemn them.</hi> And whilſt the churches have their eye upon ſuch a ſtandard as this for their rule, and mean to condemn <hi>that only</hi> in the conduct of their members which is contrary to what is reputable and honorable in the eyes of the world, it is evident that the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are entirely out of their ſight; and in the whole of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they are conformed to the world. If the laws of Chriſt's kingdom were the <hi>rule of their conduct</hi> in their proceedings, they would ſurely be ready to condemn <hi>every</hi> thing in the open conduct of their members, which the laws of this kingdom do condemn. And whilſt they continue to indulge and paſs over thoſe things in the viſible conduct of their members which they know are glaringly oppoſite to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of what is ſacredly enjoined in the laws of this kingdom, it is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hypocriſy in them to pretend that they have it in view to be governed by a regard to what Chriſt has ſaid in his word. Whilſt a perſon may retain the character of a viſible chriſtian, and his ſtanding in church fellowſhip, in the open practice of thoſe things which the word of God does as ſolemnly abhor, and as ſacredly forbid, as it does the moſt atrocious tranſgreſſions; it is an inſult upon the common underſtanding of mankind to pretend that ſuch a church is governed by a regard to the laws of Chriſt's kingdom. Let them be ever ſo
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:044516_0027_101E0E7617237640"/>
careful in watching over their members, and dealing with them for ſuch groſs tranſgreſſions which the world condemns; it is entirely ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſyſtem of laws than thoſe of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that they are governed by; and they can have no other account, in the end, to give to their Lord, but this, that although they have not been governed by a regard to the laws of <hi>his</hi> kingdom, yet they have been governed by a regard to the laws of <hi>ſome other</hi> kingdom. If they have not put the laws of <hi>his</hi> kingdom into execution, yet they have put the laws of <hi>ſome other</hi> kingdom into execution If they have not condemned what his <hi>word</hi> condemned, yet they have condemned what the <hi>world</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That is, they have caſt us word behind them, and have ſubſtituted another rule in its ſtead; and have reverenced the authority of the world, and have treated the authority of Chriſt and his word with defiance. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if this be the reigning character of profeſſing chriſtians, it will ſtrike them into confuſion, and ſhock them into convulſions, to have this ſolemn interrogation addreſſed unto them from the mouth of their judge, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</p>

And if thoſe who are appointed to put the laws of any kingdom into execution, ſtead of having their eye upon this as their governing object, ſhould only aim at forming the conduct of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this kingdom according to what is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and enjoined by the laws of <hi>ſome other kingdom;</hi> there is no way in which they could caſt contempt upon the dignity &amp; authority of that kingdom as by ſuch a line of conduct. And the matter is moſt plain in reference to the point under conſideration. The laws of Chriſt's
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:044516_0029_101E0E7C31DAE0E0"/>
kingdom do require <hi>a certain and particular kind of conduct</hi> in all the viſible ſubjects of this kingdom: and if a church do mean to put the laws of this kingdom into execution, they are ſurely to require <hi>the ſame particular kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> in its members which the laws of this kingdom do require. And there is no way in which they can poſſibly treat the authority of Chriſt with contempt as by indulging ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conduct in their members which they <hi>know</hi> the word of God does abſolutely condemn, and to paſs it over on ſuch a principle as this, <hi>That ſuch conduct is allowed of in general, and is agreeable to what is cuſtomary and reputable in the world.</hi> What is this but a ſetting up the cuſtoms of the world above the authority of Chriſt, and a ſubſtituting theſe in the room of what he has enjoined in his word?</p>
            <p>The world is our God, if its cuſtoms are the rule of our conduct. If our eye is upon theſe cuſtoms as the rule we mean to walk by, we are guilty of <hi>open</hi> idolatry as evidently as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reboam ever was in ſetting up his golden calves in Bethel and Dan: and all the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our conduct and that of Jereboam, is this, that we don't worſhip the <hi>ſame idol</hi> as he worſhiped —inſtead of worſhiping his golden calves, we have ſet up the world in their ſtead: and nothing can be more evident, than that the cuſtoms of the world are the higheſt and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate rule that profeſſing chriſtians do mean to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:044516_0030_101E0E7F43425DA8"/>
regulate their conduct by, whilſt they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and paſs over that viſible conduct in one another, which the word of God does abſolutely condemn, merely or mainly becauſe ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is agreeable to what is cuſtomary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable in the world. And there is no need of any labour to prove, that there <hi>is</hi> that viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conduct in profeſſing chriſtians in general, which the word of God does abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn; and conſequently, that ſuch conduct is openly allowed of and tolerated in the churches that profeſs to be in ſubjection to Chriſt, as their Lord: for if there <hi>is</hi> ſuch open &amp; viſible conduct amongſt profeſſing chriſtians, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tolerated and allowed of: for if it were not tolerated and allowed of, it could not take place. And for any one to aſk, whether the viſible conduct of thoſe in general who make a profeſſion of religion, is agreeable to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of what the word of God enjoins, would be an inquiry moſt palpably ridiculous, even in the mouth of a child. The contrary is ſo evident, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known, that profeſſors themſelves dare not put confidence in one another on the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe bonds they are under to each other by virtue of the oath of their allegiance to Chriſt. The utmoſt that we can expect concerning the viſible conduct of profeſſing chriſtians in general, is, that we <hi>may hope</hi> to find it agreeable to what is reputable in the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:044516_0031_101E0E83DBA86220"/>
eyes of the world. And they are ſo attached to this as the higheſt &amp; ultimate rule to which they mean to conform, that they would be aſhamed, even to have it thought that they meant to regulate their conduct by any other rule, or that the authority of Chriſt, after they had ſworn allegiance to him, was to have any binding influence upon them, or was to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt them in condemning any line of viſible conduct which the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, unleſs the cuſtoms of the world do alſo condemn the ſame line of conduct.</p>
            <p>In what light will the viſible conduct of profeſſing chriſtians appear to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, when they come to ſee things as they really are? In what light will the churches of Chriſt appear, when their King ſhall call upon them to give an account of their ſtewardſhip; and ſhall ſolemnly reckon with them for treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws of his kingdom with ſuch awful contempt?—They will certainly be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and will have no power to return any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that ſolemn interrogation, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, &amp; do not the things which I ſay?</p>

               <hi>SECTION IX.</hi> That profeſſors are not conformed to what the word of God enjoins, any further than they are go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verned by the great law of love.</head>
            <p>IF theſe corporations who call themſelves churches of Chriſt, do mean to have the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conduct of their members according to what Chriſt has enjoined in his word; if they mean to require that in each other which the word of God requires, and to condemn that in each other which the word of God condemns; it is evident, at firſt view, that they are ever to require that <hi>particular line of conduct</hi> in one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which is pointed out and enjoined by the great law of love. Chriſt declares that this law is his <hi>commandment:</hi> evidently intimating that there is no other particular law of his kingdom that he accounts <hi>ſo ſacred and dear,</hi> and which he meant to lay <hi>ſo much weight upon,</hi> as this. And this muſt evidently appear to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we conſider the view which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired apoſtle gives of the ſame matter, where he obſerves, that <hi>love is the fulfilling of the law.</hi> And on the ſame principle, our Saviour lays down, that a conformity to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of what is enjoined by the great law of love in the viſible conduct of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of his religion, is not only the <hi>higheſt,</hi> but the <hi>only,</hi> evidence that they are his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:044516_0033_101E0E8A6159FAA8"/>
when he obſerves, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> Now if it is <hi>by this</hi> that profeſſors are to be known as belonging to Chriſt; then ſurely there is no ſcripture warrant to look upon any one as belonging to Chriſt, <hi>any further</hi> than his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conduct is agreeable to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of the great law of love. For if we might have a <hi>ſcripture warrant</hi> to look upon any one as belonging to Chriſt, where there is no viſibility of ſuch a temper, acted out in his open conduct; then certainly it would not be <hi>hereby,</hi> but <hi>by ſomething elſe,</hi> that profeſſors were to be known as belonging to Chriſt. But if a man were poſſeſſed of all other endowments that can be conceived of, and ſhould he arrive to ſuch attainments as to <hi>ſpeak with the tongue of men, and of angels;</hi> or ſhould he be poſſeſſed of ſo much natural ſympathy, and human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as <hi>to give all his goods to feed the poor;</hi> and ſhould he make ſuch a ſhew of zeal for God and his cauſe as <hi>to give his body to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and yet not be governed by, or act out <hi>this temper,</hi> in theſe tranſactions, he would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſight of God. In this view of the matter we need be at no loſs at all to know, what is that <hi>particular line of conduct</hi> which is pointed out and enjoined by the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and which is abſolutely eſſential for thoſe who mean to be in a viſible ſubjection to him as their Lord and King. It is ſuch a line
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:044516_0034_101E0E8D6D0A9038"/>
of conduct as is agreeable to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of the great law of love. If thoſe who are incorporated together by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bonds of God's covenant, do not mean to regulate their viſible conduct according to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of what is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and enjoined by this law of love, and to require this of one another; there is nothing in that corporation, or amongſt them, that is any evidence, or that gives us any <hi>ſcripture warrant</hi> to look upon them as belonging to Chriſt, any more than that they belong to Baal-peor. If ſuch a corporation do mean to tolerate <hi>any</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in its members which <hi>they know</hi> the great law of love does abhor; and if they do not mean to condemn <hi>every</hi> thing in the open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their members, which <hi>they know</hi> the great law of love condemns (and this, whether the laws of men, and the cuſtoms of the world condemn it or not) it is as manifeſt an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as can be conceived of, that they care no more about the authority of Chriſt, and the honor of his name, than they do for the dirt under their feet.</p>
            <p>Churches in general appear to have ſome apprehenſion that they are under ſacred bonds to deal with their members for open profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if any amongſt them appear to be noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly guilty of ſuch a tranſgreſſion. And it is generally conceived and granted that a church would incur very great guilt upon
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:044516_0035_101E0E8EEFDB82B8"/>
themſelves, if they ſhould tolerate their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in <hi>ſuch kind</hi> of tranſgreſſions. Any one that had any tenderneſs of conſcience, and who deſired ſpiritual edification, would eſteem it no privilege at all to join in fellowſhip with ſuch a church: but in proportion as his conſcience was awakened, he would feel himſelf overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with amazement to ſee how they ſuffered the authority of Chriſt to be treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and the laws of his kingdom to be trampled under foot; and under the energy of this aſtoniſhment, he would be ready to ſay, <hi>O my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret, and to their aſſembly, mine honor be not thou united.</hi> But why are we ſhocked at beholding open profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tolerated in a church, <hi>any more</hi> than we are at beholding that viſible conduct paſſed over and indulged which <hi>we know</hi> is as glaringly contrary to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of the great law of love, as open profaneneſs is to the third command? Wherein does the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of open profaneneſs conſiſt? Moſt ſurely in nothing but this, that it is a treating the third command with defiance and contempt; and the evil of this tranſgreſſion is heinous in proportion as the third command is ſacred. But ſurely if the great law of love is as ſacred in the eye of the Redeemer, as the third command, can any mortal point out a reaſon why that viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which is <hi>manifeſtly</hi> contrary to what the great law of love enjoins, ſhould not be as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:044516_0036_101E0E908C8CCC90"/>
in his ſight as open profaneneſs? Every tranſgreſſion is heinous in proportion to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of the law which is violated. And ſurely, in this view of the matter, there is no line of conduct that God does more ſolemnly abhor than that which is openly abreaſt of what is enjoined by the great law of love. And if that corporation, who call themſelves a church of Chriſt, do not mean to have <hi>this law</hi> in force among them, (and it cannot be in force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it is put into execution) there is not the leaſt degree of any viſible ſubjection to Chriſt in that corporation; and they have <hi>no more</hi> of any claim to the character of a chriſtian church, than if they ſhould tolerate open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, and every kind of evil amongſt them.</p>

every member that pertains to their body—it is evident that they have no intention at all, to <hi>do the things which Chriſt has ſaid.</hi> They may, it is true, be very careful to inſiſt upon ſuch a line of conduct in one another, as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what is reputable in the eyes of the world; and may be very ready, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to frown upon and condemn every line of conduct in their members which may render them obnoxious to the civil part of the world. But if this is the object which they have in view, and in reference to which they are governed in dealing with their members, the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are abſolutely out of their ſight, and they are continually trampling the authority of theſe laws under foot, and treating them with contempt and defiance. If they can but keep their members to ſuch a line of conduct as is agreeable to the civilized part of the world, it is generally apprehended &amp; taken for granted, that ſuch a church is in a very good ſtate, and in excellent order. And if thoſe rules which the civilized part of the world have adopted, will admit of ſuch a line of conduct as the great law of love does abhor, it alters not the caſe in the leaſt: profeſſing chriſtians are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in their confidence that a viſible confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to theſe rules is the whole of what ought, in reaſon, to be expected of them, and the whole of what is to be regarded by them, and by others, as an evidence that they belong to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:044516_0038_101E0E99BA03BEE0"/>
Chriſt. It is needful to repeat it again, for it cannot be too ſolemnly remembered, that whilſt profeſſing chriſtians have their eye upon this as their rule, and mean to inſiſt upon <hi>that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conduct only</hi> in their members, which is agreeable to <hi>this rule,</hi> they have exalted the world into the midſt of God's throne; and it is the idol which they worſhip, and the god which they adore: for <hi>know ye not that to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you yield yourſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants you are to whom you obey?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this evident principle there can be no warrant for a church to look upon themſelves as being the ſubjects of Chriſt, any further than they mean to be governed; and that every member that pertains to them, ſhall be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the whole of their viſible conduct, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſpirit and plain meaning of the great law of love.

And how great ſoever their reputation may be, in the view of the world, and how much ſoever their order may be admired, whilſt they have thus carefully kept one another to ſuch a line of conduct as was reputable in the eyes of the world, they will be juſt as unable as the moſt careleſs and profane to return any anſwer to

            <p>UPON the principle, that what has been already held up to view is agreeable to God's word, there is no corporation that means to be called a church of Chriſt, but will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves ſacredly bound to be governed, in the whole of their viſible conduct, by a regard to the great law of love; and that they are under the moſt ſacred bonds to ſee to it that each and every member that pertains to their body, is governed, in the whole of his conduct, according to the plain meaning of what is pointed out by the ſame law. Every one will readily give in to it, that unleſs their eye is upon this as the ſole rule and meaſure of their viſible conduct, they have no claim at all to the character of chriſtians; and that they do not mean or intend to do the things which Chriſt has ſaid. And yet, after all, when they are called upon to put theſe plain and evident principles into practice, there is nothing they will urge more vehemently, and they will be
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:044516_0040_101E0E9E7332DB78"/>
as loath to give it up as to part with the breath of life, that we <hi>muſt</hi> paſs over many things in the viſible conduct of profeſſing chriſtians, which, we know, are evidently contrary to the great law of love. They will readily grant, that the conduct of every profeſſor <hi>ought</hi> to be according to what is pointed out and enjoined by the great law of love; but then, upon the whole, <hi>it will do,</hi> if they don't conduct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, and if the church don't inſiſt that their conduct be according to it. Which is the ſame thing as to ſay, it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that a church <hi>ought</hi> to be in a viſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt; but then, upon the whole, <hi>it will do,</hi> if they are not ſo. When it is urged that we muſt hold thoſe in charity whoſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conduct is manifeſtly contrary to the great law of love; it is the ſame thing as to urge, that we muſt have charity for thoſe <hi>that walk not charitably.</hi> To urge that we muſt hold them as chriſtians in whoſe conduct there is no viſible conformity to the great law of love, is the ſame thing as to urge that we muſt hold them as chriſtians in whoſe conduct there is nothing that gives us any <hi>ſcripture warrant</hi> to look upon them as chriſtians. There is no contradiction more glaring, than to call ſuch a corporation <hi>a church of Chriſt</hi> who <hi>knowingly</hi> tolerate their members in that line of viſible conduct which the great law of love condemns. Surely a church is not founded <hi>upon</hi> the word of God,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:044516_0041_101E0EA30D480258"/>
unleſs it is governed <hi>by</hi> the word of God: and it is abſurd to pretend that it is governed <hi>by</hi> the word of God, if they allow that conduct in their members which <hi>they know</hi> the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns. Every one muſt grant that we can have no ſcripture warrant to look upon a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon</hi> as belonging to Chriſt, in whoſe viſible conduct there is no conformity to the great law of love; and only purſue the ſame way of reaſoning, and it will be equally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>on the ſame principle,</hi> that we can have no ſcripture warrant to look upon a <hi>corporation</hi> as being <hi>a church of Chriſt</hi> who <hi>knowingly</hi> tolerate that open conduct among them which the great law of love condemns. If it is neceſſary for a <hi>particular perſon</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> the laws of Chriſt, in order to have any claim to the character of a chriſtian; it is equally neceſſary, <hi>on the ſame principle,</hi> for a <hi>corporation</hi> to <hi>execute</hi> the laws of Chriſt in order to have any claim to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a church of Chriſt. <hi>Obedience</hi> to the laws of Chriſt is the <hi>only thing</hi> that gives a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> a claim to the character of a chriſtian; and the <hi>execution</hi> of the laws of Chriſt is, <hi>on the ſame principle the only thing</hi> that gives a <hi>corporation</hi> a claim to the character of a church of Chriſt. <hi>Obedience</hi> to the laws of Chriſt, is the <hi>only way</hi> that a <hi>perſon</hi> can manifeſt a viſible ſubjection to Chriſt; and the <hi>execution</hi> of the laws of Chriſt is, <hi>on the ſame principle, the only way</hi> in which a church can manifeſt <hi>their</hi> viſible ſubjection to

Chriſt. There is ſurely <hi>no other way</hi> in which incorporate bodies, as ſuch, can manifeſt their ſubjection to their prince, but by putting the laws of his kingdom into execution. If they ſhould ſuffer the laws of his kingdom to be treated with contempt by one and another, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many individuals in that corporation ſhould take heed to govern their own perſonal conduct according to the laws of their prince; yet that corporation would be looked upon and treated by their prince as being in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. And for the like realon, on the other hand, if the laws of his kingdom were faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, the corporation would be looked upon and treated by their prince as being in a loyal ſubjection to him, though many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in that corporation ſhould prove at laſt, to have been violently attached to ſome other lord. In this point of view it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that thoſe corporations who call themſelves churches of Chriſt, if they continue to indulge and paſs over that viſible conduct in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which is <hi>manifeſtly</hi> contrary to the great law of love, they are only ſtruggling to cheat their own conſciences; and they will be found by their Redeemer at laſt, to have been in a ſtate of rebellion, ſo ſure as there is any meaning to thoſe awful words, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</p>

            <p>THERE is nothing more certain than this, that profeſſing chriſtians will <hi>yet</hi> continue to flatter themſelves that it is their meaning to do the things which Chriſt has ſaid, ſo far as it is in the power of their hands. And if they fail in keeping one another to that line of viſible conduct which is according to the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great law of love, and do paſs over many things in the open conduct of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the great law of love abhors; it is not becauſe they have no reverence for this royal law, which is the ſum of every thing that Chriſt has ſaid; but it is owing to this, that they cannot <hi>know</hi> when one another walks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, and when they depart from it. They are very incompetent judges whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one another <hi>mean</hi> to walk according to the great law of love, becauſe they cannot look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of each other: and therefore it is the ſafeſt way, upon the whole, to indulge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to do as they pleaſe, and put on that charity that will induce them to <hi>hope</hi> that one and all do <hi>mean</hi> to walk according to the great law of love, though nothing appears in the tenor of their conduct that would give a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:044516_0044_101E0EA941D43F18"/>
any reaſon to think, that they had ever read or heard of a precept, enjoining upon them, <hi>to do unto others as they would that others ſhould do unto them.</hi> Were it not ſo that mankind had learnt the art of trifling with matters of a ſacred nature, and were they not determined, at all hazards, to have recourſe to every evaſion in their power to cheat their own conſciences, they never could argue in this manner, or act upon ſuch principles as theſe. Theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are pregnant with the higheſt and moſt barefaced folly, hypocriſy, and impudence, when applied to temporal matters. No one ever argues, that we have reaſon to <hi>hope</hi> that there is any real love between parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, huſbands and wives, where there is no love acted out and manifeſted in their conduct one towards another. <hi>This kind</hi> of love is ſo plainly ſeen, as to be obvious to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of all, and children themſelves are competent judges of it. And whilſt we have that confidence which is founded upon the cleareſt evidence, that there is, in a general way, the moſt tender, fervent, and endearing love between parents and children, huſbands and wives, our charity is <hi>wholly</hi> grounded on what is viſible in their conduct one towards another: and nothing would be more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than for any one to pretend that he had any warrant to think, that there was any real love between a man and his wife, whoſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of each other was manifeſtly contrary to the ſpirit &amp; operation of that love, which they profeſſed to bear to each other. And we may be very ſure, if that love, which chriſtians profeſs to exerciſe one towards another, were acted out to as high a degree as parental or conjugal love is acted out; it would be as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, and as clearly diſcerned; and we ſhould be no more at a loſs to diſtinguiſh chriſtians from the reſt of the world by this mark, <hi>that they love one another,</hi> than we now are to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh who are parents and children, and who are huſbands and wives, by the viſible appearance of parental and conjugal love. It is certain, when our Saviour enjoined it upon his followers to love one another, he meant that they ſhould act out this love one towards another in ſuch a manner that it might be <hi>ſeen</hi> by one and all that ſhould be acquainted with them; elſe he never would have laid down this mark to diſtinguiſh his followers from the reſt of the world, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> It is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible that we ſhould know that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing chriſtians do love one another by any other evidence than their open conduct. So far as this love is acted out in their open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſo far we can <hi>ſee</hi> it, and no further. And <hi>if our eye was ſingle,</hi> we ſhould be no more at a loſs to form a judgment of any line of conduct that is inconſiſtent with chriſtian love, than we

now are to form a judgment of that line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct between parents and children, huſbands and wives, that is inconſiſtent with parental or conjugal love. And the only reaſon why pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing chriſtians will pretend that it is not in the power of their hands to prevent that viſible conduct in one another, which the great law of love abhors; and that they are not competent judges of that conduct which is inconſiſtent with the plain meaning of this law, is, becauſe they love darkneſs rather than light; and mean, after all, to be treated by the Redeemer, as his ſervants and friends, whilſt they have treated him with a continual round of fulſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and empty flattery, whilſt they have called him Lord, Lord, and not done the things which he has ſaid.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:044516_0047_101E0EB3EFBE59E0"/>
of the ſouls of each other is the primary object of that love which chriſtians are to exerciſe one towards another. In the ſame degree as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon loves his own ſoul, he will ever be concerned for its welfare; and, <hi>on the ſame principle,</hi> in proportion as he loves the ſouls of others, he will be concerned for <hi>their</hi> welfare. There is no way in which a perſon can manifeſt a real love for his own ſoul, but by a concern for its welfare; and there is no other way in which he can manifeſt a real love for the ſouls of others, but by a concern for their welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if a perſon does truly mean to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt any concern for the welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own ſoul, he will ſurely manifeſt it by a continual ſacred care to ſtand at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt diſtance from evil, and the appearance of evil: and there is no way for chriſtians to manifeſt and act out a mutual love and concern for the welfare of the ſouls of each other, as by ſetting their faces againſt evil, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil, in each other. If a parent ſhould ſuffer his child to walk upon the edge of a dangerous precipice, without a moſt watchful care to prevent him, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing all his authority to reclaim him from that dangerous ſituation, we ſhould moſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge that ſuch a parent was an unnatural monſter, void of natural affection, and that the life of his child was of no great account with him. And if profeſſing chriſtians can
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:044516_0048_101E0EB8B2C22BD0"/>
ſuffer evil, or the appearance of evil, in each other, it is equally evident, that they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute of any genuine love or concern for the welfare of the ſouls of each other. In this view of the matter, it manifeſtly appears, that for chriſtians to ſuffer evil, &amp; the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, upon each other, is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that line of conduct which the great law of love requires and enjoins. No one can call it in queſtion, that he who can ſuffer evil, or the appearance of evil, upon himſelf, does evidently conduct as if he <hi>hated his own ſoul,</hi> and was entirely unconcerned about its welfare and ſafety: and, <hi>on the ſame principle,</hi> it is equally evident, that if profeſſing chriſtians can knowingly ſuffer evil, and the appearance of evil, in each other, they conduct as if they had no concern at all for the welfare and ſafety of the ſouls of each other. When any one beholds that conduct in another, which, <hi>in his view,</hi> the word of God condemns, however agreeable it may be to the modes &amp; cuſtoms of the world, he is bound moſt ſacredly, by the great law of love, and <hi>the whole weight</hi> of his covenant vows lies upon him, to reclaim him to a ſenſe of his evil, and to recover him to the path of his duty. And where one ſees only the appearance of evil in another, the vows of God, and the great law of love, do unite to bind him moſt ſacredly to admoniſh and warn him of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and if he neglects, his guilt becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:044516_0049_101E0EBBCC459A00"/>
greater than the guilt of him upon whom he ſaw the appearance of evil; for <hi>this neglect</hi> is an <hi>open ſcandal,</hi> it being a deliberate violation of his covenant vows.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more manifeſt, than that this mutual concern for the welfare of the ſouls of each other amongſt profeſſing chriſtians, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the genuine operation of the great law of love. And herein, <hi>that kind of love,</hi> which is enjoined upon chriſtians, ſtands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from every other kind of love amongſt mankind. We oftentimes ſee that, which we are ready to <hi>call</hi> love, amongſt thoſe who are diſpoſed to run to the ſame exceſs of riot, whilſt they will rejoice together, &amp; ſhow a ready diſpoſition to gratify one another. But that which we <hi>call</hi> love in theſe, is, in reality, the moſt virulent hatred they can poſſibly act out towards one another; and the devil is full of <hi>this</hi> affection towards thoſe whom he means to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that deſerves the name of love, or that does, in any meaſure, partake of the nature of it, but that diſpoſition which aims at the mutual welfare and ſafety of the ſouls of each other, by a conſtant endeavour to guard one another from evil, and from the appearance of evil. In this way our Saviour manifeſted the tendereſt love to mankind in the days of his abode upon earth. He was an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable enemy to evil, and the appearance
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:044516_0050_101E0EBD4FFF7198"/>
of evil, and ſet his face like a flint, and bore the moſt ſolemn teſtimony againſt it, how much ſoever it might expoſe him to the rage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of thoſe who were diſpoſed to cavil at the truth. In this way it was manifeſt that the law of kindneſs was on his tongue, and this was the conſtant operation of the great law of love through the whole tenor of his conduct. And this, ſurely, is that line of conduct, which the great law of love does enjoin upon his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and if thoſe who call themſelves his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, can ſuffer evil, and the appearance of evil, in one another, they may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are induced to paſs over ſuch conduct in one another, out of mutual tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and leſt they ſhould diſturb the peace of each other, and bring on tumults and diviſions in the church; and their meaning is, to put on charity for each other, tho' they frequently behold evil, and the appearance of evil, in one another: and they may be as confident, that this is the way, in which, upon the whole, it is beſt for them to walk, as king Saul was, that he was in the right when he ſpared the beſt of the ſheep &amp; of the oxen, amongſt the Amelekites, to ſacrifice unto the Lord. But their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will aſſuredly be confounded, as his was, when their Lord ſhall demand of them, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</p>

               <hi>SECTION XIV.</hi> A further illuſtration of the ſame point.</head>
            <p>IF it be the real meaning of profeſſing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to do the things which Chriſt has ſaid, by walking together in love, and to manifeſt a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concern for the welfare and ſtate of the ſouls of each other, by letting their faces againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; if this be the ſpirit of thoſe bonds by which they are united together, it is evident, at firſt view, that they will countenance one another in <hi>every</hi> inſtance wherein any one ſets himſelf to the diſcharge of ſuch a ſolemn covenant duty. If they mean to walk together in the ſpirit of this temper, it will be impoſſible for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach any one for being grieved with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of another under a notion that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is <hi>a little thing,</hi> and ought not to be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or treated as a matter of grievance. For let it be as it will in the view of others, if it be what the word of God abhors and condemns, in the view of the perſon who is grieved with it, he is ſacredly bound to treat it as a matter of grievance. If every one who has named the name of Chriſt, is under covenant bonds to ſet his face againſt evil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; it is manifeſt that every one muſt judge for himſelf, what is evil, and what wears the appearance of evil, in the viſible conduct of
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:044516_0052_101E0EC523A6B198"/>
thoſe he is in covenant with. Without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this judgment, it is utterly impoſſible for individuals, as ſuch, to quit themſelves of the oath of God by diſcharging thoſe ſolemn co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant duties they owe to each other. If any one comes under blame for attempting to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that which he looks upon, and profeſſes to be a ſolemn covenant duty; if he is reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſo doing by thoſe with whom he is in covenant; and it is repreſented by one another, that <hi>ſuch a little thing</hi> ought not to be noticed; they are doing what in them lies to caſt a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block and an occaſion to fall in their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's way. Such a body of profeſſing chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are trying to their utmoſt to diſcourage &amp; diſhearten one another from diſcharging their ſolemn covenant duty. For if this be once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed that no one muſt treat a matter as a matter of grievance until he is certain that it will appear to others in the ſame light it does to him; if he muſt refrain from bearing teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt that which <hi>he</hi> looks upon to be evil, or to wear the appearance of evil, until he is confident that <hi>others</hi> will not look upon it to be <hi>a little thing;</hi> that moment that things are come to ſuch a paſs in a church, there is no rule for individuals to go by in the diſcharge of thoſe ſolemn covenant duties they owe to each other. When a profeſſing chriſtian ſees that conduct in another which <hi>he</hi> looks upon to be evil, and he muſt wait till he knows how thoſe in general
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:044516_0053_101E0EC8370E0A38"/>
with whom he is in covenant, will view it, or by <hi>what name</hi> they will call it, before he will venture to recover his brother to the path of his duty; <hi>this motive</hi> will be a bar in his way, and if he is <hi>governed</hi> by it, will incapacitate him from diſcharging thoſe ſolemn covenant duties which the vows of God do bind him to. If profeſſing chriſtians do mean to walk together under the governing influence of that temper which the great law of love does enjoin; nothing is more manifeſt than that they will have a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> care to avoid, not only what <hi>they themſelves</hi> look upon to be evil, or to wear the appearance of evil; but alſo what they know is viewed &amp; eſteemed ſo by any brother in the covenant with them. And if the eyes of profeſſing chriſtians are not upon this as an <hi>eſſential</hi> object which they mean ever to have in view, it is manifeſt that the great law of love has become contemptible among them: for <hi>if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably.</hi> If you mean to plead up for, and allow of, that which, you know, is a grief to your brother, and <hi>he views</hi> as being ſinful; the great law of love abhors your conduct. When therefore profeſſing chriſtians will reproach one another, on their attempting to diſcharge a ſolemn co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant duty, and will urge that we muſt bear with one another in <hi>things indifferent,</hi> and not take offence at ſuch trifles; there is no way more effectual to throw down the hedge and the wall
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:044516_0054_101E0EC9C010EC08"/>
around the church, and to turn <hi>the houſe of God into a den of thieves.</hi> How confident ſoever ſuch may be, who conduct on <hi>ſuch</hi> principles, that they are ſeeking the peace of the church; and how much ſoever they may now flatter their hearts that they are doing God ſervice; they will certainly find, in the end, <hi>for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it,</hi> that <hi>it were better for them that a millſtone were hanged about their necks, and they caſt into the ſea, than to have offended thoſe little ones that believed on Chriſt,</hi> &amp; who would have readily diſcharged their ſolemn covenant vows, had it not been that theſe ſtumbling blocks, and occaſions to fall, had been thrown in their way.</p>

            <p>IF there is any meaning at all to thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vows by which profeſſing chriſtians have covenanted with God, and one another,—if they mean to walk together in the ſpirit of that love to the ſouls of each other, which is according to the tenor of their ſolemn covenant; they will moſt ſurely be ready, not only to ſet their faces againſt evil, and the appearance of evil, in each other; but there will alſo be a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>receive</hi> the admonitions of one another, without reſentment or envy. If the law of love
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:044516_0055_101E0ECD0D448BA0"/>
does but govern amongſt them, they will be ready to join iſſue with David, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me</hi> when I go aſtray: and this will be eſteemed, as indeed it is, one of the greateſt external privileges on this ſide heaven. There is no one point of more ſacred importance, in reference to the order of God's houſe, than for a church to keep their members to that viſible conduct, which is according to ſuch a temper. If profeſſing chriſtians are indulged in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reproof—if they may raiſe a clamour againſt a perſon, for attempting to diſcharge a ſolemn covenant duty—if any one may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſuggeſt and inſinuate, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is actuated by prejudice againſt him, tho' at the ſame time his viſible conduct is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what the word of God warrants—if theſe things are indulged, and openly tolerated in a church; it is very certain, that there can be nothing amongſt them but confuſion, and every evil work. For a church to indulge ſuch a line of conduct in their members, is to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them in the moſt direct violation of their covenant vows; for if there is any meaning at all to thoſe ſolemn vows by which profeſſing chriſtians are bound to one another, they do <hi>certainly</hi> hold them under ſacred bonds to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the reproofs, and to receive the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each other, on every occaſion, with all thankfulneſs and readineſs of mind. For one to reject an admonition given him by another,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:044516_0056_101E0ED1A6D07A48"/>
under a pretence that the thing for which he is admoniſhed, is <hi>ſo little and trifling</hi> as not to be worthy of reproof, is <hi>a deſpiſing his brother, and ſetting at nought his brother</hi> for attempting to quit himſelf of the oath of God that is upon him. For one to reject the admonition of a brother, or to reſent an attempt to recover him to the path of his duty, under a pretence that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is over-rated, and that he is dealt with too ſeverely, is the ſame thing as ſetting himſelf up for a judge in his own caſe; and is as much as if he ſhould ſay, When I go aſtray, <hi>let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſmite me,</hi> but only let him take heed to ſmite juſt ſo hard as I order him, and no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: which would be the higheſt kind of trifling that can be conceived of. When a brother is ſet at nought and deſpiſed for attempting to quit himſelf of the oath of God that is upon him;—when a church will ſuffer a clamor to be raiſed againſt him on this account; they are openly countenancing a ſpirit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for righteouſneſs ſake, and whenever this leaven gits into a church, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dangerous than for one to attempt the diſcharge of his covenant duty; and <hi>he that,</hi> in this way, <hi>departeth from evil, will make himſelf a prey.</hi> Every profeſſor is as ſacredly bound to <hi>receive</hi> as his brother is to <hi>give</hi> an admonition or reproof. He is as ſacredly bound <hi>to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be dealt with,</hi> as his brother is <hi>to deal with him. The ſame bonds</hi> that bind a profeſſor to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:044516_0057_101E0ED4C016C420"/>
               <hi>deal with another,</hi> do bind that other to <hi>be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be dealt with.</hi> Theſe bonds are always mutual, and are as ſacred on the <hi>one</hi> hand as they are on the <hi>other.</hi> As therefore we ſhould very juſtly look upon the perſon as having no meaning at all to his covenant vows, who <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſin upon his neighbour,</hi> and never ſets his face againſt evil, or the appearance of evil in others; ſo we may be ſure that there is no way in which a perſon can treat his covenant vows with a more direct and daring defiance than by <hi>deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brother, and ſetting at nought his brother,</hi> by caſting contempt upon him for attempting to deal with him for that which <hi>he</hi> viewed to be evil. And where ſuch a ſpirit is allowed to operate, and profeſſors are tolerated in treating one another in this manner; there is no other law of love that governs amongſt them but that which is according to the prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that works in the children of diſobedience.</p>

            <p>IF profeſſing chriſtians do mean to do the things which Chriſt has ſaid, by manifeſting a tender love to the welfare &amp; ſafety of the ſouls of each other, there will ſurely be a vigilant
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:044516_0058_101E0ED642D12930"/>
care amongſt them, to ſet their faces againſt <hi>every</hi> thing, in the open conduct of one another, which the word of God abhors and condemns. There is no other way, in which they can aim at the welfare of the ſouls of each other, but by keeping their eye upon this as the <hi>only</hi> rule of their conduct, in the manner of their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another: and if they ſhould once learn to keep their eye upon this, as the <hi>ſole rule and meaſure,</hi> whereby they meant to form an eſtimate of that which is evil, or wears the appearance of evil, in the open conduct of one another; they never could preſume to call any matter <hi>a little thing,</hi> unleſs the word of God alſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame matter <hi>a little thing.</hi> They would immediately learn to call <hi>every thing</hi> by the ſame name that the word of God called it; &amp; to view <hi>every thing</hi> in the ſame point of light as the word of God viewed it. And in this point of view, it is manifeſt, that when one chriſtian brother ſhould admoniſh another, for what the world calls <hi>ſo little a thing</hi> as vain jeſting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not dare to call it <hi>a little thing,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he could prove that the apoſtle was in jeſt, when he ſolemnly warned his chriſtian brethren againſt this practice.</p>
            <p>There are many things which the civilized part of the world call <hi>little,</hi> becauſe they have become common, and are generally tolerated &amp; allowed of; which, at the ſame time, the word of God, in the <hi>plain ſenſe</hi> of it, does as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:044516_0059_101E0ED807C39450"/>
abhor, and as ſolemnly condemn, and which are as inconſiſtent with the character of a chriſtian, as thoſe groſs tranſgreſſions which the world condemns. And for chriſtians to indulge one another in theſe things, &amp; to treat them as <hi>little things,</hi> becauſe the <hi>world</hi> calls them ſo, is as inconſiſtent with the leading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their being covenanted together, as if they ſhould turn the whole of their brotherly watchfulneſs into this channel, to help one another to get as much of the world as they could. Whatever is agreeable to the ſpirit and reliſh of the world, will become common among them, and will be tolerated and allowed of: and how evident ſoever it be, that it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what the word of God enjoins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; yet when it has <hi>once</hi> become common and cuſtomary, it will be viewed by the world as being <hi>a little thing,</hi> unworthy of notice; and that for any one to be grieved with it, or bear teſtimony againſt it, is a mark of ſuperſtition and ſilly weakneſs. It is agreeable to the ſpirit of the world, to practiſe openly many things which the great law of love does as abſolutely condemn, as the third command condemns curſing and ſwearing. And on this principle it has become faſhionable and cuſtomary, even amongſt thoſe who call themſelves chriſtians, to bite and devour one another; and they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally as fond as the reſt of the world are, to make what is commonly called <hi>good bargains,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:044516_0060_101E0EDCB41B6E88"/>
in their dealings with one another; and they will hear a chriſtian brother ſpeak evil of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without bearing their teſtimony againſt ſuch conduct. They have learnt to violate their engagements to each other, and to pay no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the mutual promiſes whereby they have bound themſelves to each other, but only ſo far forth as the authority of the civil law will bind them to a fulfilment of their bonds: and if they can avail themſelves of any ſlip in the law, to get rid of their engagements, it is not <hi>much</hi> out of character for them to do it. And whilſt profeſſing chriſtians have learnt to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe after this manner, I am ſure they have learnt it not from the precepts of Chriſt, but from the example of the world. Theſe things are agreeable to the reliſh &amp; ſpirit of the world, and have therefore become common and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary among them; and they are <hi>little things,</hi> not worthy of notice; and it would be a pity for profeſſing chriſtians to be ſo <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> as to condemn <hi>ſuch</hi> conduct in one another, or to be grieved when there is nothing more to be ſeen than ſuch <hi>little things</hi> as theſe. But if the great law of love did operate in churches, and were this the rule that churches meant to be governed by, <hi>theſe things</hi> would no ſooner be allowed of, or tolerated among them, than <hi>murder and robbery</hi> would be allowed of or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by the civil community: for the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of murder and robbery is not a whit

more inconſiſtent with the whole deſign of the civil law, than the indulgence of ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices is inconſiſtent with the plain meaning of the great law of love. And hence, if churches did <hi>only</hi> mean to purſue ſuch a line of conduct as the great law of love does enjoin, &amp; to hold each of their members to ſuch a line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; they would ſet their faces againſt, and frown upon, <hi>every kind and degree</hi> of the out-breakings of raſh anger, of evil ſpeaking, of clamouring and reproaching, of over-reaching and defrauding, and of every inſtance of that treatment that ſhould give a brother <hi>juſt</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to think hard of another. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly that conduct which the great law of love does enjoin; and if churches do mean to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that treatment of each other which the great law of love does abhor, and will treat ſuch conduct in their members as being but <hi>little things,</hi> becauſe they are agreeable to the ſpirit of the world, and have become common and cuſtomary; it is manifeſt that they mean to be conformed to the world; <hi>they are of the world, they ſpeak of the world, and the world heareth them.</hi> Let <hi>theſe little things</hi> be ever ſo faſhionable and cuſtomary amongſt the <hi>civil</hi> or the <hi>religious</hi> world, if they are only ſuch things as the great law of love does abhor, they are as inconſiſtent with the real character of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as open profaneneſs.

               <q>And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</q> 
               <hi>SECTION XVII.</hi> That the profeſſion of chriſtians in general, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than an open inſult upon Chriſt.</head>
            <p>I come now to aſk, what it can ſignify for profeſſing chriſtians to call Chriſt Lord, Lord, &amp; do not the things which he has ſaid? What it can ſignify for churches to call themſelves the ſubjects of Chriſt, when they are not in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him? What it can ſignify to call him their King, when they are not governed by a regard to the laws of his kingdom, but will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate and indulge thoſe things in the conduct of their members which <hi>they know</hi> the laws of this kingdom do abſolutely condemn? They are ſurely inſulting the Lord that bought them, in the moſt high-handed and daring manner, by treating him with ſuch a round of empty compliment and flattery. If one man ſhould abuſe another, and under pretence of being ſorry for his conduct, ſhould aſk his forgiveneſs, and immediately upon it ſhould repeat the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, he muſt expect the perſon to be more than a fool to give any heed to his profeſſion of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or to think he had any deſign but to add inſult to cruelty. Like to this is that conduct
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:044516_0063_101E0EE773B4D4E8"/>
which is evidently to be ſeen in profeſſing chriſtians towards Chriſt, whilſt they profeſs to own him for their Lord, and at the ſame time turn their backs upon the authority of his word, and ſuffer the laws of his kingdom to be tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under foot. Such conduct as this, <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and perſiſted in,</hi> does certainly incapacitate a church ſo much as to aſk for the returns of God's preſence, or to make any other prayer but what is pregnant with the moſt daring hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy. For whilſt they profeſs to lament that abuſe with which they have treated their king, and to acknowledge, with ſhame, that they have juſtly provoked him to anger by treating the laws of his kingdom with contempt; and at the ſame time mean to repeat over the <hi>ſame abuſe,</hi> and to perſiſt in treating the laws of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the <hi>ſame contempt;</hi> is there any thing in <hi>ſuch prayers</hi> but the moſt daring inſult, and open hypocriſy? Whilſt they can treat the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in ſuch a manner as this, and have any hope or expectation that he will be pleaſed with them, or look upon it that there is any ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their moſt ſolemn addreſſes to him; they muſt ſurely conceive of him, not only as being <hi>altogether ſuch a one as themſelves,</hi> but that it is a much eaſier matter to impoſe upon him, and to make a fool of him, than it is to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of their fellow mortals. Let ſuch a people be ever ſo devout in attending to the external duties of religion, and let them go up
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:044516_0064_101E0EE8F6909508"/>
together to the houſe of God ever ſo frequently, and there <hi>bow down the head like a bullruſh, and ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under them;</hi> if theſe inceſſant devotions are accompanied with a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſregard to the laws of Chriſt's kingdom in their practice, and they ſuffer one another to turn their backs upon the authority of his word; it is manifeſt that there is nothing but hypocriſy in every prayer they addreſs to the Almighty; and it cannot be otherwiſe than that God ſhould reject ſuch prayers as theſe with the moſt ſolemn abhorrence; as he forewarned his people of old, whoſe conduct was, in like manner, in direct oppoſition to the many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they made, and for which reaſon God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly told them, <hi>And when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</hi> No language can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or paint out that degree of inſult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with which a profeſſing people are daily treating the Lord that bought them, whilſt they attempt to pray for his preſence, and yet at the ſame time turn their backs upon him, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the laws of his kingdom to be trampled under foot: and no heart can conceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation into which they will be thrown when they come to ſee things as they really are, and hear their Lord ſay unto them, And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</p>

               <hi>SECTION XVIII.</hi> That profeſſors walking contrary to the truth counteracts &amp; prevents the operation of the truth on the minds of others.</head>
            <p>AND without putting into practice thoſe things which Chriſt has ſaid, to what purpoſe can it be for the miniſters of Chriſt to hold up the truth, and to urge the importance of it by all the arguments that are weighty and ſolemn, with any view or expectation that it will produce any effectual conviction in the minds of periſhing ſinners? It caſts off the proſpect of this, not only as it provokes God to withhold his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; but alſo as the direct tendency of it is to prevent any light from entering into their minds from the moſt plain, pungent, and powerful preaching. Let the truth be held up in the cleareſt light and let the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it be urged by every conſideration that is weighty and ſolemn; yet if the truth is contradicted by the open and viſible practice of thoſe who profeſs to be of the truth, and they ſuffer one another to go right abreaſt of the whole ſpirit and evident meaning of their covenant vows; this will effectually put out &amp; prevent all the light that would otherwiſe ariſe in the minds of ſinners from the diſpenſation of the truth. Mankind will always form their apprehenſions of the nature and importance of religion by what they ſee in the lives of its profeſſors. If they ſee that thoſe who make a profeſſion, do treat the things of religion in their daily practice, and the ſolemn truths which they hear from ſabbath to ſabbath, as being of the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred importance, and are governed in their daily walk, by a ſacred regard to them; this ſight will force upon them a conviction which they can hardly reſiſt, that the truth which they have heard, is as important as it was pretended to be. And if on the other hand, they ſee thoſe who make a profeſſion, trifling with the moſt ſolemn truths in their daily practice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:044516_0066_101E0EF0AF64D3E8"/>
as though they believed not the things which they have heard, but in their practice they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the ſpirit and manners of the world, and they ſuffer one another to go directly abreaſt of the whole tenor of their covenant vows; there is nothing in the univerſe that can be more fatal to put out all the light that the truth would otherwiſe convey to their minds; and there is nothing that can, with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, make faſt the bonds of death upon them. It is the moſt effectual way to <hi>ſhut up the kingdom of heaven againſt men.</hi> For whilſt the laws of Chriſt's kingdom are ſuffered to be trampled under foot by thoſe who are called by his name, when ſinners are warned of their danger, a view of their danger is effectually hid from their ſight. They are called upon to believe that which <hi>they know</hi> that thoſe who profeſs to be of the truth, do not believe; and <hi>on this account</hi> they can hardly be perſuaded to think that they are called upon <hi>in earneſt,</hi> to attend to the things which belong to their peace; but whilſt they ſee that profeſſors are ſuffered to trifle with the truth in their daily practice, it muſt, and it cannot but appear to them that they are trifled with when they are called upon to attend to the truth. Let the truth be proved out by arguments that are ever ſo clear and weighty, yet whilſt it is trifled with, and treated at this rate by thoſe who profeſs to be of the truth, the clearneſs of argument will have no tendency to produce conviction, but the contrary. For the more clearly the truth is held up to view, if at the ſame time, it is trifled with by thoſe who profeſs to be of the truth, the more will it be deſpiſed and diſguſted by thoſe who are called upon to attend to it: and there is nothing that can have ſuch a tendency to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the minds and harden the hearts of mankind againſt the truth, as on the one hand, to hold it up to view as being of the moſt ſacred and weighty impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and on the other hand, to trifle with it in our daily practice. This one obſervation is ſufficient to
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:044516_0067_101E0EF24FD4EEC8"/>
account for that flood of deiſm and infidelity that ſo awfully threatens to deluge the land. It is in vain for profeſſing chriſtians to call upon mankind to believe that which it is evident, by their daily practice, they themſelves do not believe. The cleareſt arguments, under ſuch circumſtances, will have no effect, but to diſguſt and harden them againſt the truth. It will ever be in vain to hold up the truth, and to urge the importance of it by the moſt weighty arguments, with any expectation that it will have any tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effectual conviction, unleſs, at the ſame time, thoſe who profeſs to be of the truth, will carry the truth into execution. And under this view of the matter, it is evident that thoſe corporations who call themſelves churches of Chriſt, whilſt they refuſe to put the laws of Chriſt's kingdom into execution, and will ſuffer them to be trampled under foot, are more awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of the blood of ſouls than every other ſet of men under heaven; and there is no where to be found ſuch inſult, prevarication &amp; hypocriſy, as has run thro' the whole of their conduct, whilſt they have called Chriſt Lord, Lord, and not done the things which he has ſaid.</p>

               <hi>SECTION XIX.</hi> That unleſs the laws of Chriſt are executed in a church, to join in fellowſhip with it, muſt prove a dangerous temptation.</head>
            <p>IF thoſe corporations who call themſelves churches of Chriſt, do not mean or intend to put the laws of Chriſt's kingdom into execution, it is evident that they are combined together for no other purpoſe but to make faſt the bonds of death upon one another; and nothing can be more dangerous to the ſoul of any perſon than to join in fellowſhip with ſuch a church. Whoever joins himſelf in fellowſhip with any church, muſt have
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:044516_0068_101E0EF3D242AAD8"/>
it in view to be under ſome better advantages to be prepared for heaven, than he ſhould otherwiſe be. But no one can be under better advantages for this but in proportion as he is under advantages to walk in the light, to be guarded from every falſe way, and directed and led in <hi>that</hi> way, and that <hi>only</hi> which the word of God directs; whatever gives him any advantage for this, is of the nature of the higheſt privilege on this ſide heaven; and whatever is of the nature of a temptation to lead him aſtray from the path of his duty, is moſt awfully dangerous, and there is nothing which can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove him more ſacredly to avoid. And whatever has a tendency, in its operation, to hide the path of duty, is ſurely the moſt effectual temptation to lead him aſtray from this path. And ſurely it is hard to conceive how a perſon can be in a ſituation where he is more likely to have the path of his duty entirely hid from his eyes, than to be in fellowſhip with a church who do not mean or intend to put the laws of Chriſt's kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. When they will ſuffer one another to go directly contrary to the true ſpirit and plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their covenant vows, and will plead up for and countenance thoſe things in the conduct of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which the word of God does abſolutely abhor, &amp; ſolemnly condemn; they not only put out all the light that would otherwiſe be for the conviction of ſinners, but it is their whole buſineſs to hide the path of duty from the ſight of each other. If any one is under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages to be prepared for heaven in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his joining in fellowſhip with a church, than he ſhould otherwiſe be, it muſt be becauſe he is under ſome better advantages to learn where the path of his duty is; but he can't be under better advantages to know this any further than he is taught it; &amp; he can't be taught it in a church with whom he is in fellowſhip but only in <hi>that ſenſe</hi> in which they underſtand it; &amp; it is manifeſt, that after all their profeſſion, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and teach the truth to others in <hi>that ſenſe,</hi> and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:044516_0069_101E0EF8740206A0"/>
that <hi>only</hi> in which they practiſe it. And hence if their practice be in oppoſiton to the true ſenſe and plain meaning of the truth, it is the very ſame thing as if they ſhould openly tell thoſe who are in fellowſhip with them, that <hi>this</hi> is the path which the word of God marks out for them to walk in; and ſo far as any one gives heed to them as being of the truth, ſo far muſt he be in the moſt awful danger of being perverted from the right ways of the Lord, and of being turned aſide by a deceived heart. Nothing can be more dangerous to any ſoul, than to come into the ſecret, and be united to the aſſembly of ſuch a corporation; for <hi>if the ſalt hath,</hi> in this way, <hi>loſt its ſavour,</hi> it is not only altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs, but it has become much worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dung<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hill; but men caſt it out</hi> into ſome ſink, that it may not poiſon the land, and render it barren.</p>

               <hi>SECTION XX.</hi> That the continued neglect of executing the laws of Chriſt, will inevitably iſſue in the ruin of churches.</head>
            <p>IF we believe the declarations of God's word, we muſt give in to it, that unleſs the tokens of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence do accompany the adminiſtration of his word &amp; ordinances, our attending upon the external duties of religion, will ſerve to no other purpoſe but to prepare us for more aggravated ruin than if we had never heard the goſpel, or known our Maſter's will. If <hi>the excellency of the power,</hi> in the converſion of ſinners by the goſpel, <hi>is of God,</hi> then certainly ſo far forth as <hi>this power</hi> is withheld, the goſpel will be <hi>a ſavour of death unto death</hi> unto thoſe who hear it. The ancient rule of God's dealings with his people was this, <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> And if theſe words are now as true as they were at the time they were ſpoken; &amp;
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:044516_0070_101E0EFD1DA5F740"/>
if they were left upon record for our learning, &amp; have the ſame reference to the viſible people of God as they had to the houſe of Eli; or, in other words, if God does equally abhor the ſame thing at one time as he does at another time, and in one people as he does in another people; and if we may expect that he will teſtify his diſpleaſure againſt his people at one time, for any particular treatment of him, in the ſame way that he has teſtified his diſpleaſure againſt them at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time for the ſame treatment of him; that is, if God be <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever</hi>—theſe words do certainly point out the reaſon why the tokens of God's preſence are ſo awfully withheld from the adminiſtration of his word and ordinances. Whilſt God withholds the tokens of his preſence from his viſible people, he treats them as if he did but <hi>lightly eſteem them.</hi> When he continues to withhold the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his preſence from the people that are called by his name, and there is no apparent effect from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his word and ordinances; but on the contrary, in reference to the fruits of that temper which the goſpel enjoins, they are as barren as <hi>the heath in the deſert,</hi> and evidently appear to be left to the infatuation and folly of their own hearts, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſpirit of oppoſition, mutual jealouſies, &amp; evil ſurmiſings &amp; perverſe diſputings; or a fatal union &amp; peace on worldly principles; theſe things are the higheſt evidence that can be conceived of that ſuch a people are treated by God as being <hi>lightly eſteemed</hi> by him. And the reaſon why he treats them ſo is, becauſe they have deſpiſed him. And if they aſk, <hi>Wherein have we deſpiſed him?</hi> It is manifeſt, that there is no way in which they can deſpiſe him in ſuch an awful manner, as by caſting contempt upon his authority; and that they always caſt contempt upon his authority in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as they deſpiſe the laws of his kingdom; and that there is no way in which it can be conceived that they can openly deſpiſe the laws of his kingdom, but
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:044516_0071_101E0EFEB6E442E8"/>
by refuſing to put them into execution. If they don't mean to put theſe laws into execution, it is certain they don't mean that the authority of theſe laws ſhould govern them; for it is impoſſible that any laws ſhould govern the conduct of a people, or have any binding authority in them for ſuch a purpoſe, unleſs they are put into execution. And hence it moſt evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that for a people to refuſe putting the laws of Chriſt into execution, and to ſuffer one another to go directly abreaſt of the plain meaning of their covenant vows; it is fully and clearly as much as if they ſhould ſay, in open language, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> And under this view of the matter, we need not wonder that churches are ſo awfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, and left to the infatuation &amp; folly of their own hearts: and we may be ſure, that they are in the high road to final ruin, by being ſpewed out of the mouth of the Redeemer, and given over to their own hearts luſts, &amp; left to walk in their own counſels.</p>
            <p>But, O merciful Redeemer, ſince thou haſt loved thy church, and given thyſelf for it—and ſince thou art yet waiting upon the people that are called by thy name; do thou <hi>lighten their eyes, left they ſleep the ſleep of death.</hi> Bring thy church up out of the wilderneſs, and have mercy on the vine which thou haſt planted. Reconcile the hearts of thy people to the laws of thy kingdom, that they may no longer reſemble that ſalt which hath loſt its ſavor; but may be like lights in the world. Vain is the help of man—let thy power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be diſplayed for this bleſſed purpoſe, &amp; triumph over all the efforts &amp; ſtruggles of the <hi>ſtrong man armed</hi> —and our glory ſhall yet be great in thy ſalvation, and in thy ſalvation will we rejoice.</p>
