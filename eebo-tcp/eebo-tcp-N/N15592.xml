            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PERMIT me to dedicate to you theſe <hi>primitiae</hi> or firſt fruits of the eloquence of a commonwealth which your foſtering hand has happily conducted from childhood to maturity.</p>
            <p>Theſe debates afford a pleaſing proſpect that Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania will, in proceſs of time, behold her ſenate adorned with orators not inferior, perhaps, to thoſe boaſts of antiquity—Demoſthenes, Iſocrates, Cicero, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your celebrity as a philoſopher—a ſtateſman—and (a higher title than either) a citizen of the world, would receive no addition from the moſt elaborate eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logium I could write. I ſhall forbear, therefore, to tread the beaten track of dedicators; and ſhall reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with uniting my ſincere wiſhes with thoſe of your admiring and grateful countrymen, that every felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which heaven beſtows upon the moſt favoured of the human race, may await you while you abide in this terreſtrial habitation—and that your memory may be revered and cheriſhed by the friends of ſcience—of liberty—and benevolence, till time ſhall ceaſe to be.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the following debates, the ſame arguments frequently occur twice, and, in ſome few inſtances, perhaps a third or fourth time. The editor anticipates a queſtion which will, doubtleſs, be aſked by moſt of the readers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>Why, in thoſe caſes, he has not reſted ſatisfied with the firſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and omitted the others?</q> To this he anſwers, that when introduced again in the manner above mentioned, they are moſtly conſidered in a different point of view, and ſome new lights thrown upon them. Moreover, the importance of the ſubject inſpired him with a deſire of laying the debates before the public in as ample a manner as poſſible. Still fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If he had ſuppreſſed any part of the member's ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he would have ſubjected himſelf to the charge of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which he has ſtudiouſly endeavoured to avoid.</p>
            <p>It will be remarked, that the anſwers to ſome of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, ſtate them differently from what they appear in the original ſpeeches. This has ſometimes ariſen from one member miſtaking the meaning of another: ſometimes, the fault lies with the editor.</p>
            <p>As to omiſſions, he muſt be chargeable with them in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places. He does not underſtand ſhort hand, without which it is utterly impoſſible to keep pace with a ſpeaker, unleſs he delivers himſelf very leiſurely. However, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf that very few of the material arguments on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, have eſcaped him.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the defects or imperfections of the pamphlet, they will, he truſts, be readily excuſed, when it is conſidered that his chief object has been to contribute to the information of the public, on a ſubject of as great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, perhaps, as any agitated in this ſtate ſince the revolution.</p>

               <p>A memorial ſigned by 624 inhabitants of the city and liberties of Philadelphia, was preſented to the chair, and read as follows:</p>
               <p>To the honourable the repreſentatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of Pennſylvania, in general aſſembly met,</p>
               <p>IMPRESSED with a juſt ſenſe of the ineſtimable bleſſing of freedom, and conſidering, as we ought, that an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial adminiſtration of juſtice is the fundamental principle of the conſtitution, and that the ſecurity of property, be it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or much, or to whoever it may belong, is one of the chief ends of government: we conceive it to be our bounden duty to watch over the conduct of thoſe, whom our free ſuffrages, as a free people, have entruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of public affairs, ſo as at all times to guard againſt a remiſſneſs of duty, or a wanton or incautious exerciſe of power on their part.</p>
               <p>Impreſſed, we ſay, with theſe ideas and principles, we are led to ſtate to this honourable houſe, a matter, in which, as it appears on the printed minutes of the late houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, there has not been that proper and impartial attention paid, which the principles of the conſtitution and the true end of government require.</p>
               <p>The caſe we refer to is as follows:</p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of March laſt, petitions from ſundry inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Cheſter county were preſented to the houſe and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:019884_0005_0FAD40E88CE5FC98"/>
read. Thoſe petitions began by ſtating a number of charges and allegations againſt the bank of North America, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making or offering proof or evidence of their being true; and praying that the charter of ſaid bank may be repealed.</p>
               <p>On the 23d in the morning, two other petitions to the ſame purport were preſented and read for the firſt time, and read again for the ſecond time on the ſame day: whereupon, on motion made and ſeconded, they were referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to enquire and report thereon.</p>
               <p>We conceive it to be an indiſpenſible principle, whenever the property of any of the citizens of this commonwealth is to be affected by the charges and allegations of any man or number of men, that the charges and allegations ſhall be proved, and that the party ſo charged and accuſed ſhall be heard in its defence; and that it is a departure from the principles of the conſtitution, for the repreſentatives of the people to take any ſuch charges and allegation as matters of truth, without proof or evidence of their being ſo; and that for any houſe of aſſembly to proceed thereon, to the injury of the property of any of our fellow-citizens, without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had, and defence heard, is unconſtitutional, and that no law ſo obtained or paſſed can be operative, becauſe it is repugnant to the principles of juſtice and the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts are deeply concerned to have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obſerve, (and as citizens are deeply intereſted in the obſervation) that it does not appear, either from the report of the committee to whom the ſaid petitions, charges, and allegations were committed, or from any other proceedings of the late houſe of aſſembly, that any enquiry was made, or any proof or evidence had or produced of the ſaid charges and allegations being true: yet the ſaid houſe proceeded to bring in a bill, which has in it the nature of a <hi>ſentence,</hi> on the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> truth of the ſaid charges and allegations, inſtead of enquiring into and aſcertaining them by proof and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—the title of which bill is, <hi>An act to repeal an act of aſſembly, entitled,</hi> 
                  <q>An act to incorporate the ſubſcribers to the bank of North America, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts are further concerned to obſerve, that when the perſons whoſe property was immediately to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the paſſing this bill into a law, applied by petition to be heard in their defence, and, of conſequence, againſt the ſaid charges and allegations, on the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> truth of which, the aforeſaid bill was ſounded: the ſaid houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019884_0006_0FAD40E9555FC958"/>
to hear them, thereby denying them that right which every citizen of this commonwealth is entitled to.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts find by the printed minutes of the late houſe, April 4th, that when the ſaid bill was called up for a ſecond reading, a motion was made by mr. Pettit, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by mr. Willing, that the memorial of the preſident, directors, and company of the bank of North America, praying to be heard, be read; and on the queſtion that the prayer of the ſaid memorial be granted, it was nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived. See April 4th, page 284.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts think it right to remark, that thoſe proceedings of the late houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of their committee, afford a ſtrong preſumption to many good citizens, that the charges and allegations againſt the bank are ill founded, and not true; and that other cauſes than thoſe which have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, are to be looked for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the true cauſes for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement attack on the bank.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts further find by the ſaid printed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes (April 4th, p. 284) that immediately after the ſaid prayer, "to be heard," was rejected, the houſe went into the ſecond reading of the ſaid bill, without any enquiry into the truth of the charges and allegations aforeſaid; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed the ſaid ſecond reading, the bill, as is uſual, was ordered to be publiſhed for public conſideration.</p>
               <p>On this part of the proceedings, your memorialiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it their duty, as well as their right as citizens, to remark—</p>
               <p>That the publiſhing the bill for the public to conſider upon, without (the houſe) having firſt inveſtigated the charges and allegations againſt the bank, which were the moving cauſes of the proceedings of the houſe, and on the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> truth of which the ſaid bill was founded, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the defence of the parties ſo charged and alleged againſt, was bringing the bill before the public in a very partial and incomplete manner; becauſe it was leaving the public in the dark as to the truth or exiſtence of the matters on which their conſideration was to be exerciſed; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding from them the knowledge on which their judgment was to be formed. It was impoſſible the public could, by any conſideration of theirs, determine or know, whether the matters charged on the bank were true or falſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration has no proper object to go upon, when applied to charges without evidence, and ſtill leſs ſo when applied to a ſentence, without having both the evidence and the defence.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019884_0007_0FAD40EA19342218"/>
The bill, then ordered to be publiſhed, had in it the nature of a ſentence, and nothing can appear to us more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent than the publiſhing a ſentence for the conſideration of the public, and for the purpoſe of obtaining the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or opinion of the public thereon, and ſuppreſſing the matters on which that ſentence is founded.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts are much concerned to find ſuch devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations from, if not direct violations of, the conſtitution; and that within ſo ſhort a time after the late convention had pointed out defects of a ſimilar nature in the conduct of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts are further induced to obſerve—that on the queſtion itſelf, reſpecting the repealing the charter of the bank, they feel themſelves under ſome uneaſy ſenſations and apprehenſions. At any rate, it is breaking the word and promiſe of the ſtate, publicly pledged but a ſhort time before—a meaſure, which at firſt view holds out to the world a faithleſs diſpoſition in Pennſylvania, and puts all kind of credit, public and private, on a precarious footing—a meaſure, of which the power to do it may be litigated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be made a queſtion, whether any law can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the doing an unlawful thing. Therefore the repealing a charter, being a ſtep of the utmoſt delicacy and danger, requires to be gone into with the niceſt care, and the moſt cautious and ſcrupulous inveſtigation. If any cauſes can juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify ſuch proceeding, thoſe cauſes ought to be made viſible to the world, or our credit with the world is wounded, if not ended. For, who will truſt a government that aſſumes the power of breaking its word, or will truſt the individuals of a country that live under ſuch a government? The paper money of one houſe may be voted down by the next; and the engagements of one aſſembly be ſuperceded by its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. It will be of little uſe to us afterwards, to ſay, that any number or party of the aſſembly, were the perſons who did it. Thoſe perſons may be returned to the rank of private citizens, or departed the ſtate, when the miſchiefs they ſhall have occaſioned, ſhall take place.</p>
               <p>But your memorialiſts are diſtreſſed to obſerve, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of caution and inveſtigation, inſtead of preciſion and deliberation, they find the buſineſs taken up on the ſlighteſt grounds, and conducted with a ſpirit of haſte and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy extremely ill-ſuited to the nature and importance of the ſubject.</p>

Your memorialiſts find by the printed minutes of the late houſe, that the petitions againſt the bank were read twice in the ſame day, referred to a committee to enquire and report thereon, and the report of that committee delivered in, not the very next day, but the day after,—That report read a firſt and ſecond time, debated and reſolved upon, and a ſecond committee appointed to bring in a bill, and that bill brought in and read, and all this within the ſpace of ſix days, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the 23d to the 29th of March; for the truth of which we refer to the printed minutes of the houſe.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the extenſive nature of the caſe, the variety of knowledge neceſſary to collect, to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon, and the probable danger of ſuch a proceeding to public and private credit, we muſt declare upon our own knowledge and opinion of the nature of the ſubject, that neither the time, nor the attention beſtowed, was equal to the importance of it.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts find, that the late houſe of aſſembly hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected to enquire into the truth of the charges and allegations againſt the bank, and yet taken up theſe charges and allegations as true, refuſing at the ſame time to grant the prayer of the proprietors of the bank to be heard in their defence, publiſhed the aforeſaid bill, for, what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, public conſideration, and adjourned ſoon after to the 23d of Auguſt following.</p>
               <p>As the ſaid bill, during the receſs of the houſe, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the public in the imperfect ſtate we have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, it was impoſſible for the public to form any judgment upon it, becauſe the facts and matters on which they were to judge, were withheld from them, and therefore the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it could not anſwer the purpoſes intended by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: But if any judgment is to be formed from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral elections which took place ſoon after the paſſing this bill, we may conclude it met with great diſapprobation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo many of the members who voted for it, have been diſplaced by their conſtituents; and we cannot doubt that as this darkſome buſineſs comes to be better known, and more illuminated, and the true intereſt of Pennſylvania fuller un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that a more extenſive reprobation will take place; for it is natural that a free people ſhould abhor the reproach of being a faithleſs one, and impoſſible they ſhould counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a meaſure which has the appearance of deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts find, that on the meeting of the late houſe for their laſt ſitting, on the 23d of Auguſt, the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, directors and company of the bank of North-America,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019884_0009_0FAD40EB88C44EF8"/>
renewed their application to the houſe for a hearing; and that a petition from eight perſons, (ſigners to the petitions for repealing the charter of the bank) <abbr>viz.</abbr> James Pearſon, Robert Smith, William Graham, John Barker, John Kling, George Leib, Levi Budd, and Frederick Heimberger, was likewiſe preſented to the houſe, praying to be heard in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their petitions, both which requeſts were complied with.</p>
               <p>Your memorialiſts find by the minutes of the late houſe, page 356, that on the fifth of September, the day appointed by the houſe for a hearing, the preſident of the bank pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf perſonally at the bar of the houſe, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by counſel; but it does not appear from the ſaid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, that any of the perſons who had ſigned the petitions, charges and allegations againſt the bank, appeared perſonally to ſupport and prove them; neither does it appear that they produced ſo much as a ſingle evidence to prove what they had ſigned to, or attempted to prove it.</p>
               <p>If therefore they have ſigned to charges and allegations which are not true, and the houſe have acted on thoſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and allegations as if they were true, there is a manifeſt injury committed; and as reparation is due to the injured, as well as to the injured honor of the ſtate, your memorial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts confide that this hon. houſe will take ſuch meaſures as may make the neceſſary reparation.</p>
               <p>The charges and allegations on the part of the petitioners againſt the bank, not being attempted to be proved, the bank could only deny them; and we find by the minutes of the houſe, that the matter ended in a verbal litigation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a counſel on each ſide, inſtead of going into an inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation and proof of the charges advanced, on the ſuppoſed truth of which the houſe had acted.</p>
               <p>On this part of the buſineſs, your memorialiſts think it neceſſary to obſerve, that the refuſing the bank a hearing in the firſt ſtage of the buſineſs, before the bill was publiſhed for public conſideration, and admitting the bank to a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the very latter part of the ſeſſion, was precluding the judgment of the public upon the caſe, becauſe the publication of the bill, and the time for public conſideration, was paſſed; and no new matter which any hearing at that time might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, could have time or opportunity to be publicly known.</p>
               <p>Had the hearing been before the ſecond reading of the bill, and conſequently before it was to be publiſhed for public conſideration, which was the requeſt the bank made, the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019884_0010_0FAD40EE089C9AE8"/>
public would then have known, that the petitioners againſt the bank had not proved their charges and allegations; and this would have been matter for the public to have exerciſed their conſideration and judgment upon: but of this they were precluded by their repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>That the charges and allegations againſt the bank are ill-grounded and not true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is naturally to be inferred from their not being proved nor attempted to be proved—And that the prayer of the petitioners againſt the bank is founded on very ill and dangerous principles, ſubverſive of the good of ſociety, and of the fundamentals of the conſtitution, and of all true government, is beſt inferred from the prayer itſelf, which we here ſubjoin:</p>
               <p>"Therefore," ſay the petitioners, <q>in order to reſtore public confidence and private ſecurity, we pray, that a bill may be brought in, and paſſed into a law, for repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law for incorporating the bank.</q>—On which we remark, that nothing can be more dangerous in principle and practice, and more abſurd and monſtrous, than to pray that the government may break its word, in order to be the better believed and truſted, and violate the confidence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready placed in it, in order that the people may place more: yet ſuch is the exact prayer of their petition, for the truth of which we appeal to the printed minutes of the houſe, and likewiſe to the petition itſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ſubject matters which your memorialiſts have to lay before your honorable houſe; they are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there ſhould be any occaſion to do it, and ſtill more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned there ſhould be ſo much. The watching over the conduct of the repreſentatives is the proper duty of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of a free country, and in preſenting this memorial we diſcharge the duty incumbent on us.</p>
               <p>We therefore pray your honorable houſe, that theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be taken into your moſt ſerious conſideration, and that either the repealing law may be repealed, or a bill be brought in, to ſuſpend the operation of it, until your hon. houſe can obtain full information on the ſubject.</p>

               <p>Mr. Clymer, as Chairman of the above Committee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the ſpeaker the following report:</p>
               <p>The Committee to whom were referred the memorials of the citizens of Philadelphia and other parts, ſetting forth the irregular and partial conduct of the late houſe of Aſſembly, in repealing the Charter of the bank of North-America, and praying for a reſtoration thereof, or a ſuſpenſion of the repealing act,—report,</p>
               <p>THAT the ſaid memorials containing a ſtatement of proceedings, adduced by the memorialiſts in ſupport of their charges againſt the late houſe—your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> firſt had recourſe to the printed minutes, and found the ſtatement had been truly made.</p>
               <p>That conceiving it more their duty to ſtate facts than opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, your committee, in order to obtain information as to the reality of the complaints alleged againſt the bank in certain petitions preſented to the late houſe, applied to Mr. Whitehill and Mr. Smilie, members of a committee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that houſe to <hi>enquire</hi> therein, and on whoſe report a bill was brought in to repeal the ſaid charter; and requeſted to know what were the enquiries they had made in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: but thoſe gentlemen in anſwer to a queſtion put to them, ſaid, they had not called at the bank to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acquainted with the nature of the tranſactions there: and your committee inferred generally from their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that neither they, the ſaid Mr. Whitehill and Mr. Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, nor any of their colleagues, had made any ſpecial or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional enquiry whatever concerning the bank.</p>
               <p>The memorials mentioning the names of eight perſons who had ſtood forth as ſupporters of the petitions againſt the bank, four of them, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Meſſieurs James Pearſon, Robert Smith, William Graham, and Frederick Heimberger, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your committee in purſuance of notifications ſent to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019884_0012_0FAD40F07000F0C0"/>
them, they the ſaid four perſons were queſtioned as to facts relating to the bank conſiſtent with their own knowledge: but they declined ſatisfying your committee further than that they had not been at the bank to gain information.</p>
               <p>The preſident and ſome of the directors of the bank alſo attending at the requeſt of your committee, they affirmed that none of the members of the committee of the late houſe, or any of all the petitioners, had ever aſked information at the bank concerning the conduct of that inſtitution, or the nature of its tranſactions, though they the ſaid preſident and directors had at all times been ready to give ſuch informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had invited free enquiry.</p>
               <p>It will follow from this relation, that the report made to the late houſe, was grounded in general notions preconceived, or on the current popular opinions and ſpeculations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much conſideration being beſtowed on the ſpecial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and the ſame may at leaſt be ſaid of the petitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented againſt the bank.</p>
               <p>It will follow alſo that the houſe did not derive from either members of that committee, or the ſaid petitioners, thoſe clear lights which would have been neceſſary to their deliberations on ſo difficult and intereſting a ſubject, and which from the inſtructions to their committee, they ſeem to have deſired.</p>
               <p>Your committee on examining further into the conduct of the late houſe, in this tranſaction, could not but diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in ſome inſtances, a ſpirit little ſuited to the tranſient and accountable repreſentatives of a free people. In an early ſtage of the buſineſs, and when only it could have had its uſe, the bank was denied a hearing: and when at a later ſtage, it was yielded to the repeated inſtances of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and directors, the permiſſion was qualified with this remark, <q>that it muſt be conſidered as a matter of <hi>favour</hi> and not of right.</q> But the favour became nugatory through the application of a rule of order, which, obliging the council for the bank to ſpeak before the council for the petitioners, left him to combat in the dark againſt poſſible charges and conjectural imputations. True it is, he was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to make a reply to the adverſe counſel, but within a time ſo limited by the houſe, as could ſcarcely be ſufficient for preparation in any petty cauſe in the ordinary courts.</p>
               <p>Thus confining themſelves to facts and to reflections na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſing from them, your committee conceive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the late houſe, in the inſtance of the bank, to be of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019884_0013_0FAD40F0D2C413C0"/>
moſt dangerous example. In their precipitancy, they broke through the procraſtinating forms of proceeding, which were fixed as fences againſt the ſudden violences of power. And in their partiality they appear to have manifeſted a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination to condemn.</p>
               <p>Your committee beg leave to remark on ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending the memorials preſented to this houſe, which ought to have conſiderable weight in their preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations. The ſubſcribers to theſe memorials are ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as to beſpeak the general ſenſe of the community. In them are included the moſt reſpectable characters amongſt us; men who, from their intercourſe and condition in life, muſt be ſuppoſed beſt experienced in the effects, good or bad, produced by the operations of the bank, and from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge moſt intelligent in the nature of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
               <p>As the proceedings of the late houſe in the caſe of the bank, thus appear with all the marks of precipitancy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and partiality, the annulling act has its foundation deeply laid in injuſtice, and remains a reproach both to the government and to the people. But your committee truſting in the wiſdom and probity of the preſent houſe, to reſtore to the ſtate its loſt honour, ſubmit the following reſolution:</p>
               <p>That a ſpecial committee be appointed to prepare and bring in a bill to repeal an act, entitled, <q>An act to repeal an act of aſſembly, entitled, An act to incorporate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers to the bank of North America, alſo one other act, entitled, An act for preventing and puniſhing the counterfeiting of the common ſeal, bank bills and bank notes of the preſident, directors, and company of the bank of North America, and for other purpoſes therein mentioned.</q>

               <p>AGREEABLY to the order of the day, took up for a ſecond reading, the report of the committee to whom were referred the memorials praying a repeal or ſuſpenſion of the law for annulling the charter of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris having enquired the number of ſigners to the petitions preſented to the late houſe of aſſembly relative to the bank, and to the memorials in favour of the bank, preſented to the preſent houſe, they appeared as follow:</p>
               <p>Petitions againſt the bank preſented to the late houſe, ſigned by 1199 perſons.</p>
               <p>Petitions in favour of the bank, preſented to the late houſe ſigned by 608 perſons, of whom 516 were of the city of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Memorials in favour of the bank preſented to the preſent houſe, ſigned by 2947 perſons.</p>
               <p>The report being read,</p>
               <p>Mr. Robinſon addreſſed himſelf to the ſpeaker as follows: In diſcuſſing the preſent queſtion, two principal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſe: firſt, by what authority a legiſlature can diſſolve a charter ſolemnly granted to any inſtitution: and ſecondly, the utility or the bad conſequences of the particular inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall not go into both. As a member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee who have made the report before the houſe, I ſhall explain the ground of their proceeding, and ſhall conſider but one of thoſe points; the power to diſſolve a charter. The committee formed their concluſions from a conviction that the legiſlature has not that power. To decide this, two queſtions ariſe. In what capacity the legiſlature acts in granting charters of incorporation? And in what capacity in taking them away? In granting charters the legiſlature acts in a miniſterial capacity. In this propoſition I am ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the conſtitution. The ninth ſection of the frame of government ſtates—that the aſſembly <q>ſhall ſit on their own adjournments; prepare bills and enact them into laws; judge of the elections and qualifications of their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: they may expel a member, but not a ſecond time for the ſame cauſe; they may adminiſter oaths or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the examinations of witneſſes; redreſs grievances; impeach ſtate criminals; grant charters of incorporation; conſtitute towns, boroughs, and counties.</q> All theſe, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019884_0015_0FAD40F24E9E10C0"/>
in themſelves, are acts of the legiſlature. Some are for preparing general regulations, which extend to all the ſtate; theſe are laws. They judge of the qualifications of their own members. Their ſentence is not a law.—Their granting charters is an act of agency—in which they have a power to act for the community, whoſe agents they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. This is totally diſtinct from the power of making laws, and it is a novel doctrine in Pennſylvania that they can abrogate thoſe charters ſo ſolemnly granted. There is this grand diſtinction between laws and charters of incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion granted by the legiſlature.—The firſt are general rules, which extend to the whole community—the ſecond beſtow particular privileges upon a certain number of people. It is unneceſſary to dwell long upon this matter, as I propoſe merely to trace the ground of the proceedings of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. The ſecond queſtion which offers itſelf to us, is, in what capacity the legiſlature acts in taking away a charter? In this they act judicially. They hear the cauſe, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on its merits. Now this exceeds their powers. They are not authoriſed by the conſtitution to act in a judicial ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but ſo far as regards the qualifications of their own members—and in ſome few other matters, ſo as to preſerve themſelves from inſult—ſuch as in caſe of diſturbances in the houſe; for they could not ſecure themſelves from inſult, if they could not take cognizance of the matter immediately. Theſe are their only judicial powers. They are not competent to deciſions in caſes of property. Charters are a ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. When they are obtained, they are of value. Their forfeiture belongs ſolely to the courts of juſtice. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſays, <q>that in controverſies reſpecting property, the party ſhall have a trial by jury.</q> But the late houſe ſtepped between the preſident and directors of the bank, and their rights, and deprived them of the legal mode of trial. In this an eſſential injury has been done them. The houſe preſumed upon its own power, and that it muſt be obeyed—and upon the weakneſs of the other party. Let no man ſay, that tyranny cannot exiſt in a large aſſembly. It may become a many-headed hydra, as fond of power as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. It is not the nature of mankind to give up what power they poſſeſs. They are fond of keeping, and even ſometimes of exceeding it. With even the beſt intentions, a legiſlature may go beyond the proper bounds, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into an opinion of poſſeſſing powers they never were veſted with. In a free government like ours, it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019884_0016_0FAD40F34F19D840"/>
incumbent on us to prevent the attempts of an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant power. The conſtitution has ſet bounds to the power of the legiſlature, and ſaid, <q>thus far ſhalt thou go, and no farther.</q> Unleſs they break the original and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principles of the conſtitution, they cannot pretend to a power of taking away charters. Perhaps it will be ſaid, with Blackſtone, that charters of incorporation may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by an act of parliament or of aſſembly. He holds the power of an act of parliament to be unbounded. But though this might be his opinion, it does not follow that it is juſt: far otherwiſe. The more eaſy it is to make it obeyed, the more caution is neceſſary to avoid injuſtice. Moſt common law writers before Blackſtone appear of a different opinion, by their ſilence reſpecting this method. And even he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to imply, it was power not right that did it. The only modes, therefore, by which charters can be vacated, are: 1ſt. by death of the members of the corporation—2dly, by reſignation of right—and 3dly, by forfeiture in the courts of juſtice. As to the firſt, nothing is neceſſary to be ſaid. The ſecond is voluntary, and a ſpecies of legal ſuicide. And the third is the only legal mode in which charters can be taken away in this country. The principles of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are materially different from thoſe of the Britiſh conſtitution.—Here they are clearly defined. In Great Britain, an act of parliament has all the force of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. In this country, the different ſpecies of power are diſtributed to different bodies. If the original principles be broken, by one branch of government paſſing beyond the bounds which ſeparate it from the other, liberty cannot long exiſt.</p>
               <p>What is the manner of enquiry on trials, in the courts of juſtice? The evidences are brought, and the parties are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to examine them. Has this been the caſe with the bank? Had the parties intereſted in that inſtitution, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to examine the evidence againſt them? No. Charges were brought, but no evidence to ſupport them. The charges might be true, or might not. But as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary forms were not obſerved, it follows that there was a ſentence given without any proof being made. The ninth ſection of the bill of rights declares, that a man charged with any crime, ſhall be heard by himſelf and counſel. Yet when the preſident and directors of the bank requeſted to be heard by counſel, in an early ſtage of the bill, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: and when at length it was granted, it was declared a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019884_0017_0FAD40F3CE7EBD38"/>
matter of favour—not of right. True, if the houſe, when it acts in a legiſlative capacity, hears counſel, it may be ſaid to be a matter of favour. But when it aſſumed the power of acting in a judicial capacity, it was a matter of indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble right that the parties ſhould be heard. The act of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly relative to the bank, carries with it all the conſequences of an act of attainder—and awards a ſentence, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether the charter was forfeited or not. From all theſe conſiderations, it fully appears that the houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had not ſuch judicial powers as would be competent to decide on the caſe of the bank: and even if they had, their proceedings were not conducted with the regularity or order requiſite. Theſe were the inducements on which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee framed their report—and theſe inducements will, I hope, be ſufficient to make the houſe agree to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lollar ſaid, when the gentleman roſe, he expected he meant, as one of the committee, to explain to the houſe their reaſons for making ſuch a report. But he had not done it to his ſatisfaction, and therefore he ſhould make a few obſervations: one in particular on the report. Had the committee confined themſelves to the memorials, without caſting any reflections on the late aſſembly, they would have acted much better than they had done. But their report as it ſtood, was a declaration of war againſt the late houſe, and daring to the combat all ſuch of its members as were in the preſent. If he had gone about to caſt reflections, it ſhould have been on the aſſembly that granted the charter, not on the aſſembly that took it away. It was not founded in juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. But the houſe which granted it, entertained no idea of its being for a perpetuity, or of its being out of the power of the aſſembly to alter or new model it, as they might ſee fit. In ſupport of this, mr. Lollar quoted the minutes of that houſe, where it appeared that a clauſe had been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a rider to the bill, for the purpoſe of empowering the aſſembly that ſhould ſit in 1789, to alter or amend the charter, as might be neceſſary. This was rejected by 27 to 24, and the expreſs reaſon aſſigned for the rejection, was, that the charter of the bank muſt neceſſarily be always within the power of the houſe. Mr. Lollar then ſaid, that a law whereby the corporation had an unlimited ſucceſſion, was unjuſt—and the annulling it highly proper. Thus matters were brought on the broad bottom of equality. The Charter was moreover unjuſt, as the ſtate had got no equivalent for the advantages it had beſtowed: and civilians held that in all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019884_0018_0FAD40F4EDDC5370"/>
contracts, unleſs there was an equivalent received for what was given, the bargain or agreement was void in itſelf, and incomplete. The only conſideration received from the bank, was, that it facilitated commerce. This in the preſent ſituation of the affairs of the ſtate, was againſt it: as it was an engine of trade that enabled the merchants to import more goods than were neceſſary, or than there was money to pay for. This was clearly diſadvantageous. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſel who had pleaded the cauſe of the bank, before the late aſſembly, had candidly and ingenuouſly admitted, that when the balance of trade was againſt a country, a bank was injurious. Mr. Lollar then quoted the petitions preſented to the late houſe againſt the bank, in theſe words: <q>the directors of the bank are enabled to give ſuch prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in trade, by advances of money to their particular favourites, when moſt needed, as to deſtroy that equality which ought to take place in a commercial country.</q> He ſaid theſe words were ſo plain, it was not neceſſary to ſay any more on that part of the ill conſequences reſulting from the bank. He did not mean to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of the preſent directors—any others in their ſituation, he believed, would do as they did. He begged the attention of the houſe to another matter: under the old government, when there were people in the management of affairs as wiſe or perhaps wiſer than thoſe ſince, no idea had been ever entertained of a bank. Now if it would be a means of keeping the caſh in the country, as had been ſtated, it was ſtrange it had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their obſervation. But the beſt way of promoting the good of this country, that had ever yet been found out, was by paper money, emitted through the medium of a loan of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Of this governor Pownal had ſpoken in the following terms: <q>I will venture to ſay, that there never was a wiſer or a better meaſure, never one better calculated to ſerve the uſes of an increaſing country; that there never was a meaſure more ſteadily purſued, or more faithfully execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for forty years together, than the Loan-office in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, formed and adminiſtered by the aſſembly of that province.</q> After all expedients ſhould be tried, that would be found the only effectual one. He ſaid, that by means of a bank the European merchants were enabled to procure and carry off money for their goods: and to fix the payment thereof upon the purchaſers in that haſty manner which the rules of the bank required, the baneful effects of which had been ſeen and felt in and about the city.—Whereas if it were
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019884_0019_0FAD40F56079E378"/>
not in exiſtence, they would be obliged to take produce in exchange for them. He hoped the report would be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As a free citizen, he felt himſelf intereſted in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He ſhould, in his opinion, betray the truſt repoſed in him, and act againſt the dictates of his conſcience, if he vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clymer ſaid, if the gentleman had conſidered the matter properly, he would not have thought an explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requiſite of the reaſons of the committee, further than was given in the report. He would find that there was a cloſe connection between the beginning and end of it. In the firſt part, it was ſtated, that the memorials had ſet forth the mode of proceeding adopted by the late houſe; it was further ſtated, that the committee having made the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary enquiries, had found that the mode of proceeding ſo ſet forth, was confirmed by the minutes of the late houſe. There was, therefore, no neceſſity for the committee to go into a recapitulation of what was ſo fully ſtated in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, which were the ground of their proceedings. The report was ſufficiently long already.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons. I was not a member of the committee who made the report now before the houſe, and eſteem my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no further bound to advocate it, than as it coincides with my own ſentiments. I am of opinion, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee not only made a proper report, but paid a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the truſt repoſed in them by this houſe. They made enquiries into the ſtatement given in the memorials—and the deductions naturally ariſing from the reſult of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, they laid before the houſe. As this queſtion is of the utmoſt importance, not only to the intereſts of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Pennſylvania, but to the union in general, I could have wiſhed it confined to a narrow ground, that it might be perfectly underſtood.—The memorials complain that the former houſe did not proceed with the deliberation neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only in a caſe of ſuch conſequence as the preſent muſt be acknowledged, but in any caſe whatever. Whether the bank is beneficial or injurious, is not the queſtion: but whether the former houſe had ſufficient evidence to warrant their proceedings. What may be the opinion of other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, I do not know. Mine is, that they had not. This is the ground which I think we ought to confine our debates to. But it has already been deviated from. To prove that the former houſe had not the neceſſary evidence, we have only to recur to their minutes. By thoſe, it appears that the attack on the bank originated by a petition from Cheſter
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019884_0020_0FAD40F680B0F4C8"/>
county. This petition ſtated what the petitioners thought injurious in the inſtitution of the bank. Afterwards, other petitions of the ſame tendency were preſented. The houſe, as in duty bound, referred thoſe petitions to a committee, with directions to enquire into the allegations they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in the following words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Reſolved, That the ſaid petitions be referred to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and that the committee be inſtructed to enquire whether the bank eſtabliſhed at Philadelphia, be compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the public ſafety, and that equality which ought ever to prevail between the individuals of a republic, and to report thereon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So far the houſe did their duty. What was the further progreſs of this buſineſs? The committee ſo appointed made report. But did they in that report ſtate that they had made the enquiry they were directed to make? Did they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the circumſtances that occurred in their enquiry, to the houſe? No, they did not. They therefore made themſelves reſponſible for the conſequences: and I wiſh their reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility could be ſeparated from that of the houſe. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port contained no information for the houſe to deliberate upon: it contained merely opinions—and, if we may judge from circumſtances, even thoſe opinions were taken up on truſt; for the report is drawn up in the hand-writing of a perſon not of that committee: and, ſo far as we can decide from ſimilarity of hand-writing, by the ſame perſon who framed the petition from Cheſter county. This is the ground of the proceeding of the preſent houſe. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it appears that the former houſe have tried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the preſident and directors of the bank unheard, it is incumbent on the preſent houſe to abrogate their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and do juſtice to the injured. And that they did ſo, is now in proof before us.</p>
               <p>As to the juſtice of the act, if it be introduced in the courſe of the debate, I ſhall endeavour to give my opinion on it. It is a ſerious thing for a legiſlature to deprive a body of people of their rights in any inſtance; but very ſerious, indeed, to deprive them unheard and untried. For the circumſtances of this procedure we need only recur to the memorials—From them it will appear that the former houſe conducted itſelf with an informality, not only inconſiſtent with the principles of this government, but with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of any government that pretends to freedom.</p>
               <p>This is not the firſt charter which has been taken away in this ſtate. The charter of the college was taken away at
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019884_0021_0FAD40F6CA204130"/>
a former period. But in that caſe, it was pretended that the charter had been forfeited. Even this was not thought neceſſary with reſpect to the bank. If ſuch be the progreſs of injuſtice, there is no telling where it will end. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has ſaid the ſtatement of the committee is a declaration of war againſt members of the late houſe who have ſeats in the preſent. But if ſpeaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the truth be a declaration of war, I hope we ſhall ever have men in this houſe poſſeſſed of ſpirit ſufficient to declare war in caſe of neceſſity. Had the committee been guilty of miſ-ſtating the facts, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong inferences from them, that would have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to criminate them: but this is not aſſerted.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary to go into an enquiry whether or no the charter was granted improperly. That is not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the repealing act. If the former houſe had thought that good ground, they would have taken it; as they did not, their advocates now cannot avail themſelves of it.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid that the charter is an eſtate entailed: this is not the fact. The property is conſtantly transferring: and I believe there has been no day ſince the eſtabliſhment of the bank, but the gentlemen who have hazarded this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might have purchaſed ſhares in the ſtock.</p>
               <p>A gentleman who has ſpoken againſt the report, has told us, that the counſel who pleaded in favour of the bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late houſe, conceded that a bank was unfavourable to a nation when the balance of trade was againſt her. If the counſel made that conceſſion, I will venture to aſſert, he was not warranted in ſo doing by his clients: and it will only ſerve to prove, that a gentleman may be not only emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his profeſſion, but have great general knowledge, without being able to decide on all queſtions: for I, who have no pretenſions to that gentleman's knowledge or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only deny the fact, but undertake to prove that it is not well founded. The report of the committee of the late houſe carries a contradiction to this conceſſion on the very face of it. It ſays the bank has a tendency to accumulate the wealth of the country in the hands of the ſtock-holders. I do not mean in this ſtage of the buſineſs to detain the houſe, by going into all the arguments that have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for and againſt the bank. As I ſet out upon a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ground, I ſhall ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>My view in riſing was to endeavour to confine the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the report of the committee: but as I preſume it will not be adhered to, I reſerve to myſelf the right of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019884_0022_0FAD40F8F09B38D8"/>
what may be offered in debate by the gentleman op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the reſolution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. I find myſelf on this occaſion called upon, not only to defend my country, but to account for my own conduct. And here I beg it may be conſidered, that the gentlemen on the other ſide of this queſtion, feel intereſted in it perſonally. Thoſe gentlemen are to plead for themſelves, and to defend their own cauſe: whereas we on this ſide have no private intereſt to ſerve on the occaſion. In judging of our conduct, I hope reſpect will be had to that conſideration.</p>
               <p>I ſhall firſt make ſome remarks on the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, which is now the ſubject of our diſcuſſion. It is in this report ſtated, that I told the committee, (when aſked a queſtion relative to the information procured by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the late houſe) that <q>I had not been at the bank to procure information.</q> This I totally deny. I call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gentlemen of the committee for proofs of their aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clymer. I riſe to affirm the truth of the aſſertion. Mr. Whitehill, when called upon, anſwered with much candour. Mr. Smilie was at firſt very coy and reſtiff. He declared he eſteemed himſelf not bound to anſwer any of our queſtions, and ſhould be prepared to give ſatisfaction to the houſe. But having aſked him was he at the bank for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? he, upon my honour, anſwered, "No." Mr. Fitzſimons was preſent. I call upon that gentleman to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what he heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons. I am ſorry the time of the houſe ſhould be taken up on ſo important an occaſion, by ſo trifling a buſineſs. But ſince I find myſelf called upon, I muſt inform the houſe, that I was in the committee room on the day the preſident and directors of the bank were requeſted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by the committee. And mr. Smilie being alſo there, was aſked ſeveral queſtions. He ſaid he could eaſily anſwer, but he did not eſteem himſelf bound: he ſhould be prepared to anſwer at a proper time. However, being at length aſked, had he been at the bank for information, he declared, No.</p>
               <p>Here mr. Smilie called upon meſſrs. Rittenhouſe and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, two members of the committee, who had been preſent at the time alluded to, to declare what had paſſed. They both ſaid, that he [mr. Smilie] would not anſwer any queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:019884_0023_0FAD40FA1A4B3B50"/>
Mr. Clymer called upon mr. Lilly, another member of the committee, whoſe declaration was ſimilar to that of mr. Fitzſimons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. This matter cannot be accounted for but on the ground of different parties. Mr. Rittenhouſe and mr. Edgar refuſed to ſign the report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clymer. It was read to thoſe gentlemen: and it was their duty, as members of the committee, to point out wherein it was erroneous: but this they did not attempt to do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. Setting aſide this point, I ſhall now proceed to the conſideration of the report. One paragraph of it is in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your committee, in examining further into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the late houſe in this tranſaction, could not but diſcover, in ſome inſtances, a ſpirit little ſuited to the tranſient and accountable repreſentatives of a free people. In an early ſtage of the buſineſs, and when only it could have had its uſe, the bank was denied a hearing: and when, at a later ſtage, it was yielded to the repeated inſtances of its preſident and directors, the permiſſion was qualified with this remark, <hi>That it muſt be conſidered as a matter of favour, and not of right.</hi> But the favour became nugatory, through the application of a rule of order, which, obliging the counſel for the bank to ſpeak before the counſel for the petitioners, left him to combat in the dark, againſt poſſible charges and conjectural imputations. True it is, he was ſuffered to make a reply to the adverſe counſel, but within a time ſo limited by the houſe, as could ſcarcely be ſufficient for preparation in any petty cauſe in the ordinary courts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is one of the moſt groundleſs complaints I ever heard, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the preſident and directors were not heard in the firſt inſtance. It was certainly in the diſcretion of the houſe whether to hear them on the report of the committee, or on the bill. And I believe it is the practice in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, never to hear petitions till after the ſecond reading of bills; as, until then, it is not known what they may prove to be. This bill, of which we hear ſo much complaint made, was read the ſecond time in the winter ſeſſions, and then lay over till the fall, a period of nearly five months—was not that a ſufficient time for the public to conſider on it? Was not counſel then heard againſt it? Why then is it aſſerted that it had not a fair diſcuſſion? Some remarks have been made on the hearing having been granted not as a matter
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019884_0024_0FAD40FA92773BE0"/>
of right: but it will not be ſaid that the conſtitution gives any ſuch right to be heard before the houſe of aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The report goes on to ſay: <q>Your committee beg leave to remark on ſome circumſtances attending the memorials preſented to this houſe, which ought to have conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weight in their preſent deliberations. The ſubſcribers to theſe memorials are ſo numerous as to beſpeak the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe of the community. In them are included the moſt reſpectable characters amongſt us; men, who, from their intercourſes and condition in life, muſt be ſuppoſed beſt experienced in the effects, good or bad, produced by the operations of the bank, and from general knowledge, moſt intelligent in the nature of ſuch inſtitutions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is this great number of ſubſcribers? Two thouſand nine hundred and forty-ſeven. Can this number be ſaid to ſpeak the general ſenſe of the community? The inſtitution of the bank is advantageous to many of the ſubſcribers—and their power and influence, and I believe the influence and terrors of the bank, have been exerted to procure ſubſcribers to thoſe memorials. They were fabricated in this city, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, printed, and ſent down to the country. It is well known how eaſy a matter it is to procure ſigners in the country. We had, a few days ſince, petitions from Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, Bucks, and Cumberland counties, againſt the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the market-houſe, procured by the influence of the perſons intereſted againſt the meaſure in this city: this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently accounts for the number of memorialiſts. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that no ſuch means were uſed, it cannot be ſaid that they ſpeak the general ſenſe of the community. It is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion not founded in fact. The committee, indeed, ſaw the numbers were not ſufficient, and they tried to make up the deficiency another way. They inform us, that <q>in them are included the moſt reſpectable characters amongſt us.</q> This is holding out an ariſtocratical idea. <q>An honeſt man's the nobleſt work of God.</q> A democratical government like ours, admits of no ſuperiority. A virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, be his ſituation what it may, is reſpectable. If we enquire what conſtitutes the reſpectability meant in the report, we ſhall very probably find it riches. They have more money than their neighbours, and are therefore more reſpectable.</p>
               <p>The report continues: <q>As the proceedings of the late houſe, in the caſe of the bank, thus appear with all the marks of precipitancy, prejudice and partiality, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019884_0025_0FAD40FB50F36E88"/>
act has its foundation deeply laid in injuſtice, and remains a reproach both to the government and to the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us examine whether this act has its foundation laid in injuſtice. For this purpoſe, it is neceſſary to conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the ſubject of charters. I would obſerve, by the bye, that my worthy friend over the way, (Mr. Robinſon) has been puzzling himſelf with Blackſtone, which muſt ever be the caſe with any perſon who takes the negative ſide of the queſtion. And here I will make this conceſſion, that there are charters ſo ſacred, that they cannot be revoked. But there is a material diſtinction between charters—and the opinions of many have been very wrong on that head. When once an error is taken up, men go on a long time in deluſion. There are many things which we now conſider as abſurd, which were formerly venerated, for want of being properly conſidered.—The doctrine of hereditary right, which is now held odious, was once deemed ſacred. There is a ſtrong reaſon, why perſons from Europe are ſo highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in favour of charters. In the 12th and 13th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, Europe was in the loweſt ſtate of vaſſalage—the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in ſome meaſure rooted to the ſoil, and ſold with it. While affairs were in that ſituation, the kings and powerful barons granted charters of incorporation, to towns and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thereby exempting them from the common vaſſalage of the ſtate, and beſtowing on them particular immunities; thus giving them political exiſtence. Theſe charters were ſacred, becauſe they ſecured to the perſons on whom they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, their natural rights and privileges. But there are, ſir, charters of a very different nature. And here it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to fix the point of diſtinction. Charters are rendered ſacred, not becauſe they are given by the aſſembly, or by the parliament—but by the objects for which they are given. If a charter is given in a favour of a monopoly, whereby the natural and legal rights of mankind are invaded, to benefit certain individuals, it would be a dangerous doctrine to hold that it could not be annulled. All the natural rights of the people, as far as is conſiſtent with the welfare of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are ſecured by the conſtitution. All charters grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluſive rights, are a monopoly on the great charter of mankind. The happineſs of the people is the firſt law.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that the charges againſt the bank have not been properly proved. But thoſe who recur to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the committee of the late houſe, will ſee that proofs were not wanting. A very ſlight reading of the report may
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019884_0026_0FAD40FC0F9C5E50"/>
convince gentlemen that the committee were not appointed to ſee whether the preſident and directors had done their duty. The matter was taken up on a higher ground. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee were directed to enquire whether or no the bank was compatible with the ſafety and welfare of the ſtate. This, the houſe, as guardians of the rights and liberties of the people, had a right to examine into. Let us ſuppoſe for a moment the committee had not made the enquiry—was not the houſe at liberty to conſider their report, and as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in opinion with it, to paſs the act recommended in that report? If the houſe had not that right, dreadful would be our ſituation indeed. Let us ſuppoſe a houſe of aſſembly ſo loſt to all ſenſe of their duty, and ſo corrupt, as to give a charter of monopoly to five men, of all our Eaſt India trade—to five others, of our trade to Europe—and to five more, of our trade to the Weſt Indies—I grant that it is not likely that this will ever happen—but that is nothing to the point.—If one houſe, I ſay, is guilty of this miſchief, and that the next that meets, beholding this monſter in the face of the conſtitution, has not power to give redreſs, to what purpoſe are annual elections? Corrupt chartered boroughs in Great Britain have eaten up the ſpirit of the conſtitution. If the houſe cannot afford a remedy, the people muſt have recourſe to the means God and nature have given them for redreſs. No good man can wiſh this to happen. I hope it never will. The right of the houſe to repeal charters was debated in the council of cenſors—and a member of that body, now in this houſe, and in favour of the bank, conceded the point of right in the legiſlature to revoke them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall mention a caſe, which will ſhew that we are not the only people afraid of banks. In Ireland, in the year 1721, a bank was about to be eſtabliſhed. It was held to be a ſurpriſing fine thing—But after the houſe of commons had maturely conſidered of the matter, they came to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution: <q>Reſolved, that if any member of this houſe, or commoner of Ireland, ſhall preſume to ſolicit, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure any grant, or to get the great ſeal put to any charter, for erecting a bank in this kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the declared ſenſe and reſolution of this houſe, he ſhall incur their higheſt diſpleaſure, and be deemed to act in contempt of the authority of this houſe, and an enemy to his country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>[Here Mr. Smilie read an extract from the journals of the Iriſh houſe of commons, containing their proceedings on the above buſineſs, from its firſt introduction to its final rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He then proceeded as follows:]</p>

If a bank was regarded ſo dangerous in a country, where there was a counterbalance to its influence, how much more ſo muſt it be here, where there is no ſuch counterbalance?</p>
               <p>The charter of the bank was not taken away for what the preſident and directors had done—they, I believe, acted as innocently as any others would have done in the ſame ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—But it was taken away from a conviction of its dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tendency. We lately had a propoſal to mortgage the revenues of the ſtate to the bank—thus to get the ſtate into its tramels.</p>
               <p>A word or two with reſpect to paper money. The paper money of the ſtate cannot exiſt with the bank. And the queſtion is not—whether or no we ſhall have paper money—but who ſhall emit it—the bank or the ſtate? If the bank emits it, it muſt have the profits. State paper money has been found of the utmoſt utility, in former times and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Had it not been for the laſt emiſſion of it, the ſtate could not have paid the public creditors. There were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means; and a number of valuable citizens muſt have been unpaid their juſt demands. Conſidering the difficulties of government, no heſitation can remain in any man's mind, reſpecting the propriety of emitting paper. If the ſtate is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to borrow, ſhe muſt neceſſarily pay 6 per cent.—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if ſhe emits on loan, ſhe gains 6 per cent, in her favour. All theſe advantages we muſt give up, if we reſtore that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>It is hardly neceſſary to mention the endeavours uſed to prevent the emiſſion of paper money by the committee of merchants. Theſe gentlemen muſt not take it amiſs if we ſtyle them bankers—as I believe all of them are ſuch. This was at a time of the greateſt diſtreſs, when the cries of the public creditors were heard by every ear.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid in the courſe of this debate, that the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſel in favour of the bank, conceded, that when the balance of trade is againſt a nation, a bank is injurious to it. A gentleman from the city has undertaken to deny that this is the caſe. But I believe that he will find it difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. His aſſertion controverts the general ſenſe of mankind.</p>
               <p>The operations of the bank are prejudicial in a point of view in which I have not yet conſidered them. They are a diſcouragement to agriculture, and to improvements in the city. From the eſtabliſhment of the bank, intereſt roſe from ſix per cent. to the enormous degree at which we ſee it at
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019884_0028_0FAD40FDD7CE2590"/>
preſent. Uſury has been coeval with the bank. It was not known here before.</p>
               <p>A man finds it much more to his advantage to lodge his caſh in the bank, than to purchaſe with it lots, lands, or houſes. The perſon who has thoſe, finds it impoſſible to procure money at legal intereſt to improve them, and is therefore inclined to ſell them—the ſame reaſon that inclines him to ſell, deters others from purchaſing—thus the value of lands, houſes, &amp;c. is depreciated.</p>
               <p>The former houſe, conſidering all theſe things—conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the bank ſtood in the way of paper money—conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that a loan-office and it could not exiſt together—conſidering that it was a bar to the improvement of the country, and to agriculture, thought themſelves fully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in taking away the charter. And it is equally our duty to leave matters in their preſent ſituation. The bank has not ſuffered. The ſtock-holders have gained enough—In one year they cleared ſixteen and a half per cent. Why ſhould we injure our country in favour of an inſtitution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the public welfare? I therefore hope the houſe will agree to let the bank reſt where it is, and ſupport the paper money of the ſtate, from which ſo many advantages are derived.</p>
               <p>On motion, ordered that the further conſideration of the report be poſtponed.</p>

               <p>RESUMED the conſideration of the report of the committee to whom were referred the memorials pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repeal or ſuſpenſion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clymer. As I had the honour, mr. Speaker, to be a member of the committee who made the report now under the conſideration of the houſe, I think myſelf bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from ſome important charges made againſt it. A gentleman [mr. Smilie] has given us to underſtand, that the committee proceeded a wrong way, when they ſtated that the committee of the late houſe ſhould have made enquiries, which they did not. He ſeems to ſay, that the aſſembly, in the plenitude of their power, might paſs the repealing act without any enquiries—but this is directly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the principles laid down by the late aſſembly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019884_0029_0FAD40FE8D764A00"/>
themſelves. They expreſsly directed the committee to make enquiry, whether the bank was compatible with the welfare of the ſtate. Have this inqueſt and preſentment been held? No. The act, therefore, in the very preamble of it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a falſehood. What then becomes of the apologiſt of the proceedings of the late houſe? He aſcribes to them greater powers than they pretend to. They ſaid an enquiry was neceſſary. He ſays not. The committee having traced out that no enquiry had been made, and having found the proceedings of the late houſe, as well as of their committee, exceptionable, had a right, as freemen, to paſs their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them. I hope we ſhall always have men of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſpirit, to ſpeak their ſentiments freely of the higheſt authority in the ſtate. For my own part, I have ever ſet my face againſt a tyrannical abuſe of power; and in a proteſt in 1779, againſt the proceedings in the college buſineſs, I ſpoke my ſentiments of the then houſe, of which I was a member, as freely as I have done in the report before you, of the late houſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall examine ſome of the principles whereon is founded the report of laſt year. Among the reſt, is this, that the balance of trade is againſt us, and that therefore the bank muſt be injurious. This balance is the metaphyſics of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which few underſtand, and which ſerve no other purpoſe than to diſturb the imagination. In England, Gee and Child wrote much on that ſubject. They pretended to demonſtrate that the nation would be ruined by certain branches of trade. But as the nation grew richer and richer by them, nothing but experience could prove the fallacy of their arguments. It is a point, which from being ſo little underſtood, I cannot ſuppoſe made any impreſſion on the committee themſelves; though it had its uſe in the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it ſwelled the evils attendant on the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>There are two other principles of more ſolidity laid down in the report: one is, that the bank may have a pernicious influence—Banks are the neceſſary appendages of a certain degree of commerce. Let us ſee what are the intereſts of commerce, and we ſhall then know how its influence, where it has any, will be pointed. It has, then, an evident inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the general proſperity—in the ſecurity of property—and in the toleration of every man to purſue his own benefit in his own way, provided it be not incompatible with the public good. Theſe are the objects which commerce and its banks would endeavour to accompliſh, and they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019884_0030_0FAD410158822B80"/>
not pernicious. The early immunities and privileges beſtowed on traders in modern Europe, after the extinction of the Roman empire, were the firſt ſeeds of any national liberty which followed. But a gentleman has produced the example of an entire nation oppoſed to the influence of banks—he has, however, greatly blundered at the application of this example. The Iriſh nation, in 1721, and many years after, was greatly dependent on England, both in its liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and trade. In this ſituation, the eſtabliſhment of a bank muſt have been attempted either by the Engliſh miniſtry, further to diſtreſs the trade of the country—and there fore oppoſed by the Iriſh patriots;—or attempted by thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, to relieve their trade from Engliſh oppreſſion, and therefore oppoſed by the miniſtry. But the gentleman, when he told us this ſtory, ſhould have recollected the oath put to witneſſes in the courts of juſtice—not only to tell the truth—but the whole truth. He ſhould, therefore, have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little further, and informed us, that the Iriſh nation having, by a ſucceſsful ſtruggle about the year 1780, in which they were favoured by the American war, thrown off the yoke of Britiſh tyranny, and aſſumed a ſituation equal to that of England, they turned their firſt thoughts to the eſtabliſhment of a public bank, as congenial with their then ſituation. Whether or no they have eſtabliſhed it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay poſitively, having the ſtory only from a newſpaper writer, of the gentleman's own ſide. But this much is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that while Ireland was in a ſtate of ſubjection, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the idea of a bank—but when in our ſituation, ſhe regarded it as advantageous. Thus this inſtance, on which the gentleman has dwelt with a great air of triumph, proves nothing in his favour.</p>
               <p>Another principle laid down in the report of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the late houſe, is the incompatibility of the bank and the paper money of government. On this occaſion we have had an eulogium on paper money, from governor Pownal. But let it be conſidered that paper money is the offspring of credit and confidence, which this ſtate was poſſeſſed of before the revolution. Under ſuch circumſtances, he ſpoke highly of its uſes: but Pownal would have been both a knave and a madman to contend for it, when both credit and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were wanting. An argument has been here made uſe of, that we have emitted paper money with ſucceſs. It is true we have made an experiment, and it has not failed. But let us ſtop here. I am confident that to attempt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019884_0031_0FAD41026C299E48"/>
emiſſion would deſtroy that already in circulation: and I would remark that it has owed ſome of its credit to the falſe calculations made upon the extent of our revenue. I hope it will maintain the degree of credit it poſſeſſes. There always have been, and always will be numbers of people in want of money: but if we go on making it, till every body cries hold, we ſhall reduce it from being equal to gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not to be equal to lead. Several ſtates which have been wife enough to prohibit paper money among them, have by that means encreaſed their ſpecie in a great degree.</p>
               <p>To conclude: Banks are in general encouraged in all the commercial nations of Europe. And the more republican a country is—or at leaſt the greater degree of liberty it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes—the greater is the ſucceſs of its banks. Why then ſhall our puny politicians pretend to oppoſe their ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the experience of Europe for ages? A public bank affords many advantages. It on occaſion gives aid to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—and ſecurity and convenience to individuals. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a certain degree of commerce renders a bank ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, that if this public bank be deſtroyed, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate banks will ariſe out of its ruins, 'till the demands of trade are ſatisfied. Theſe will not be of ſuch governmental utility, nor afford ſuch private ſecurity. If the laſt houſe had this in contemplation, where was their wiſdom?—if not, where was their foreſight?</p>
               <p>Mr. Woods ſpoke in favour of the report.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons ſaid, he wiſhed the debate had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the report of the committee: not that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive a general diſcuſſion would operate againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution recommended in the report: but he wiſhed to take the ſtatement as made by the committee, and examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was founded or not. The gentlemen in oppoſition to it, did not chooſe to fight the battle upon that ground.</p>
               <p>Here the Speaker declared, that having conſidered the queſtion as of the greateſt importance, he had been willing to allow the utmoſt latitude to gentlemen in the debate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie was ſorry the ſpeaker's conduct was called in queſtion. There had been no juſt cauſe of complaint. It would have been extremely improper to confine the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the report. The queſtion ſhould be taken up on the broadeſt ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons declared he had no idea of arraigning the conduct of the ſpeaker; nor did he mean to control any member in his manner of managing his arguments on the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019884_0032_0FAD41039A776400"/>
preſent queſtion. He had only expreſſed his own wiſh that the debate had been confined within a narrower compaſs. He then proceeded thus:</p>
               <p>I advocate the reſolution recommended in the report, and ſhall continue ſo to do, on this principle, that the late houſe of aſſembly had not thoſe lights, nor that information that could warrant their proceedings. This is the proper ſubject of debate: but the gentlemen on the other ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, know that it is not their ſtrong ground. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abandon it. Neither a corporation nor a citizen can be deprived of any rights without being heard: this is the ground of the reſolution now under conſideration. But ſince the gentlemen have wandered away from this point, I ſhall endeavour to follow them on the ground they have taken.</p>
               <p>One gentleman ſet out with requeſting the houſe to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the members on this ſide of the queſtion are pleading their own cauſe: and that they are intereſted in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bank. I believe I am the only member in this houſe, who have a ſeat in the direction of the bank. But I ſubmit to the houſe whether or no this obſervation is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. I hope our votes and our conduct in this houſe will not be influenced by any partial intereſts which we may have in the inſtitution, but by what, in our opinion and judgment, will have a tendency to promote the general good. I have had the honour to be one of the directors of the bank from the firſt inſtitution of it—and I take upon me to ſay, that in no other ſituation whatever, could I have been ſo uſeful to my fellow-citizens.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the charge made againſt the late houſe, of their not hearing the preſident and directors of the bank on the firſt application, a gentleman has told us it was in their diſcretion whether to hear them or not. The diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe is not eaſily defined. But I believe it will be admitted that it ſhould be bounded by reaſon. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not conſiſtent with reaſon or juſtice to condemn peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unheard. I contend that the late aſſembly acted without either reaſon or juſtice.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of this debate, many aſſertions have been ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, without proofs being brought in ſupport of them. Among the number, is that reſpecting the terrors and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the bank having been exerted to procure ſigners to the memorials preſented to this houſe in favor of that inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. If I were to affirm the contrary, the gentleman who made the aſſertion, would find it extremely difficult to bring
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019884_0033_0FAD41044BAE9DA8"/>
any confirmation of it. I think I have good authority for ſaying that no ſuch terror or influence was uſed. The ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in general are perſons above influence or terror—of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent fortunes and ſituations.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Fayette county made a conceſſion, which, I think, will operate much againſt him. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the charter of the bank was not repealed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injury received from that inſtitution—but from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what might ariſe from it. If this be a ſufficient ground to warrant the proceedings of the late houſe, I do not know what we may in time proceed to. The gentleman has argued much againſt granting monopolies. But how did he learn that the charter of the bank was a monopoly? He has hereby ſhewn his ignorance, or ſomething worſe.—The charter of that inſtitution did not preclude any other perſons from the eſtabliſhment of another bank. There was therefore no monopoly.</p>
               <p>Sufficient notice has already been taken of the gentleman's extract from the journals of the Iriſh houſe of commons. I ſhall, however, juſt remark, that there are in Ireland, many banks—ſome ſimilar to that in this city—banks of diſcount, and banks of depoſit. The little trade that country poſſeſſes, could not be carried on without banks.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the charges brought againſt the bank, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal made by a member of this houſe to mortgage certain revenues of the ſtate to that corporation. But as this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was made without the knowledge of the preſident and directors, no charge can juſtly lie againſt them on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I muſt confeſs I do not wiſh to ſee government at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to that inſtitution. It is better to keep it for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and promotion of trade and commerce.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen who have ſpoken againſt the report, ſeem to think it neceſſary to introduce a popular topic, however little connection it has with the ſubject under debate. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money is ſpoken of largely. We are told that the paper money of the ſtate cannot exiſt with the bank. Before they made this very bold aſſertion, they ſhould have known the extent of the emiſſion of bank paper: but I dare affirm they could not even form a gueſs at its circulation that would not expoſe them. I would hazard the proof of this. So much eaſier is it to make aſſertions, than to produce proofs.</p>
               <p>Among the charges againſt the bank, in the report of laſt year, is the interference and threats to reprobate the paper money of the ſtate. This charge is founded on the memorial
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019884_0034_0FAD41050C53A7A8"/>
of the committee of merchants, preſented to the houſe while the bill for emitting the paper money was pending. A gentleman has told us that he believes this committee to be all bankers. To what extent this may be founded in fact, I cannot immediately determine. But ſuppoſing it true, if, becauſe they hold ſtock in the bank, they are to be preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from giving their opinions on public meaſures, we are in a ſtrange ſituation indeed. The crown of Great-Britain ſometimes diſmiſſes placemen, when they vote contrary to the court. But I did not expect to ſee a tyranny of this kind eſtabliſhed in Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>Another argument I have heard alleged, is, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the bank were buſy at the late election. If being connected in the bank, were to deprive a perſon of the right of canvaſſing for his friends, I believe no man would wiſh to hold a ſhare. No principle can be more deſtructive to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than this.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Fayette county, has expreſſed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe that I ſhould differ in opinion, with reſpect to the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of trade, from the learned counſel, who pleaded in favor of the bank before the late houſe. I do not make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a very extenſive knowledge—but in matters of trade and commerce, I have had ſome experience, and do not uſually commit myſelf without knowing the ground I ſtand upon. I ſhould be glad to be informed how the bank can poſſibly facilitate the exportation of ſpecie. It lends out money at ſhort periods, at the end of which it muſt be repaid, or the borrower forfeits his credit. Sometimes, through tenderneſs, the credit is prolonged.—But how this can be ſaid to facilitate a drain of ſpecie, is a myſtery to me. What muſt be the ſituation of the bank, if that were the conſequence of the inſtitution? It muſt eventually be drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if there were not money in the vaults, there muſt be an end of the bank, and a deſtruction of the charter, and of all perſons concerned. But I aſſert, that it does not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the export of ſpecie.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Montgomery county (mr. Lollar) has made a curious obſervation—and many ſuch have been made in the diſcuſſion of this buſineſs: he has ſaid that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant abroad would not ſo eaſily procure caſh for his goods, were it not for the bank. That the bank enables a man to pay his juſt debts, is a charge I never expected to hear brought againſt it in a legiſlative aſſembly. It can never be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the ſtate, that her credit ſhould be loſt. The ſupport
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019884_0035_0FAD41065DE7FD98"/>
of it tends to promote the advantage of every perſon in the country. Pennſylvania is at preſent, and has been ſince its ſettlement, indebted to Europe: and that very circumſtance, ſingular as it may appear, has been highly beneficial. The capitals truſted by the Europeans to people here, have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to build houſes, and to improve the country. Can it then be proper to deſtroy that credit? Surely the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will never ſanction ſuch a meaſure.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here mention a circumſtance, which would have come in with more propriety in another part of my diſcourſe. When gentlemen complain of the ſcarcity of money, and charge the bank with baniſhing the ſpecie, they do not know or conſider, that, of the ſtock of the bank, 360,000 dollars belong to inhabitants of others of the united ſtates, or of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and have been brought here merely by means of the bank. So that it clearly appears, that this inſtitution, which has been ſo frequently and ſo unjuſtly charged with facilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a drain of ſpecie, has produced an effect directly the contrary.</p>
               <p>The dangerous influence of the bank, is a topic much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on. This is a mere matter of ſpeculation, which it is very difficult to reaſon upon. The ſtock-holders are about three hundred in number: they have different views and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and are of different parties in politics—it is not likely, therefore, they can ever join in any ſingle meaſure. How, then, this ſo-much-dreaded influence can operate, it is not eaſy to conceive. I have already ſaid that I am the only perſon in the direction of the bank, who have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to fill a ſeat in this houſe: and I ſhould hope that if there were no ſuch inſtitution, my election might be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accounted for.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. After what has been offered by my col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues againſt the report made by the committee laſt year, I expected the gentlemen of that committee would have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, to vindicate it. But I find the conteſt is, who ſhall have the laſt word. I ſhall therefore alter the plan I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to follow in this debate, and endeavour to anſwer the objections which have been raiſed againſt the bank, before I proceed to the conſideration of that report.</p>
               <p>The firſt obſervation made by the gentleman from Fayette country, was, that we on this ſide the queſtion, are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of our own intereſt. This I conſider as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the feelings of the members, and a kind of ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pay little regard to what falls from us, as being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019884_0036_0FAD4106D7527968"/>
intereſted in the deciſion. This is neither fair nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did. Every member ſhould have been left to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how far intereſt might influence our ſentiments. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge myſelf intereſted in the bank as a ſtockholder. But I have no more ſhare in the management, than that gentleman himſelf, unleſs when the ſtockholders are called together. I feel myſelf intereſted in the fate of the bank, from another cauſe. I had ſome hand in forming the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or brat, as it has been called by ſome of its oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents out of doors—now, ſo far as I had a hand in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this brat, I eſteem myſelf bound in honour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. I am induced alſo to ſupport the report now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe, becauſe I have a perfect and thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that the inſtitution, in its operation, far from being injurious to the ſtate, is of ſervice to every individual in it. It promotes the grandeur of the ſtate—increaſes its wealth—and adds to its dignity.</p>
               <p>If the argument of our being intereſted in this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were allowed the force it was meant to have, the ſame argument would apply on every queſtion. As a citizen and a freeman, entitled to all the privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities which the laws and the conſtitution afford, I am, more or leſs, intereſted in the deciſion of every queſtion that comes before this houſe. This argument would in effect apply againſt every member in the houſe. But I ſhall quit this ground. As a member of this houſe, I aſk and claim attention. If the arguments I ſhall make uſe of, appear to ariſe from ſelf-intereſt, they will of courſe have but little weight: but, if founded on juſt and equitable principles, I truſt the members will be influenced by them as they deſerve—and I hope there is no man in this houſe ſo determined againſt the bank, but that he will alter his opinions, if ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground appears to warrant the alteration.</p>
               <p>In the opening of this buſineſs, I objected to reading the memorial from the preſident and directors of the bank. It was preſented during the laſt ſeſſion, at a time when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties intereſted in that inſtitution were ſolicitous to have the matter brought before this houſe. But during the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there was a meeting of the ſtockholders, at which it was determined to appeal to the judicial powers—and bring to an iſſue at law, this queſtion—whether a charter once giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, can be annulled, without a forfeiture being proved? This being their reſolution, it appeared improper to preſs the buſineſs forward in this houſe on their part: and it was
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019884_0037_0FAD4107F2CC8FF8"/>
agreed that it ſhould not be reſumed here at their inſtance. However, in the mean time, their fellow-citizens took the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up; and by their numerous memorials, have put it in the power of the houſe, to retrieve the dignity of the legiſlature, by repealing the late act. I, for my part, ſhould have no heſitation to riſque the queſtion in the courts of juſtice. For though ſome of the judges, in their individual capacity, may have been oppoſed to the bank, yet I have too much faith both in their integrity and in their regard for their law characters, to believe that they would hazard an unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Our judges, as judges, are, I truſt, upright.</p>
               <p>In anſwering the arguments alleged by the members op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the adoption of the report now before the houſe, I ſhall endeavour to follow them as well as I can. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from Montgomery county has told us, he regards the terms of the report, as a declaration of war, and a challenge to all the members of the late houſe, who have ſeats in the preſent. On this point I muſt beg leave to differ from him. The committee of the former houſe had been inſtructed to perform certain duties: the committee of the preſent houſe diſcovered and aſcertained that they did not perform thoſe duties, and charged them accordingly with the failure. One of the members of the committee of the late houſe has, in a great meaſure, conceded the point, by acknowledging that they did not make the enquiries enjoined; and in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication he tells us, that the houſe had a right to judge for itſelf. How then can a cenſure levelled at the committee for non performance of duty, be conſtrued to extend to thoſe members of that houſe, who voted in conformity with their report, believing they had performed what had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined them? I ſhould think that thoſe members of the former houſe, who have ſeats in the preſent, by joining in the repeal of the law for taking away the charter of the bank, if they were led to vote for it by a report not founded in fact, would act more honourably and conſiſtently, than by perſiſting in a defence of that law. If they be convinced that deception has been uſed, there can be no diſhonour in changing their opinions. It was therefore wrong to ſtyle the report a declaration of war.</p>
               <p>The gentleman went further. He ſaid, if he were to paſs reflections on the ſubject, it ſhould be on that houſe which granted the charter—not on that which repealed it. I have not examined the minutes of the houſe which granted it, and therefore cannot tell whether or no he was a member. But
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019884_0038_0FAD41080E89F838"/>
I venture to pronounce, that if he had been, he would have joined in granting it. The neceſſities of the country loudly demanded that grant. I preſume he would not paſs his cenſures, but with reſpect to the term of the charter—as he appears to think its objectionable part, is the want of limitation as to time, and the great extent of capital the corporation is allowed to poſſeſs. As to the limitation of time, he tells us, it was not underſtood by that houſe which gave the charter, that it was to be for a perpetuity. To confirm this, he produces a clauſe propoſed as a rider, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced for the expreſs purpoſe of limiting its duration, or to put it in the power of a future houſe to do ſo. He adds, that the argument adduced in ſupport of the rejection of that rider, was, that the charter muſt neceſſarily always be within the power of the houſe. But what is all this to us? Are we to regulate our conduct by the private opinions of the members of a former houſe of aſſembly? On this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſhall further obſerve, that they ſeem to have changed ſides, on this queſtion: for the gentlemen oppoſed to the bank at that period, were convinced that the houſe could not attempt a repeal or alteration of the charter, unleſs an expreſs clauſe was inſerted for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Among other objections to the charter of the bank, brought by this gentleman, he alleged that the ſtate had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no conſideration for it. But this is an aſſertion which cannot be ſupported. The ſtate received a very ample con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. However this is totally out of the queſtion. Are we to make ſale of our charters? Is there any conſideration received for the numerous charters which this houſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually granting, and which employ a great proportion of our time? If any is received, I ſhould be glad to know who gets the money. But we are not to ſet up for ſale, characters which the conſtitution authoriſes us to grant for the good of our country.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman further tells us, he has a ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the bank, becauſe it facilitates commerce. From this I preſume he is an enemy to all commerce, and thinks we would be better without it. I wiſh the gentleman had favoured us with an explanation of what he meant by facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating commerce. From what he has ſaid, I imagine, that explanation would be, that the bank enables people to bring more goods into this country than they otherwiſe could do, which is diſadvantageous. As to the theory of commerce, I do not pretend to be deeply verſed in it: but I have had ſome
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019884_0039_0FAD41668A26F020"/>
experience in the practical part, and therefore I ſhall go into a ſhort inveſtigation of the ſtate of our trade, ſince the peace concluded in 1783. At that period, the people of Europe, whoſe attention had been drawn towards us by the arduous ſtruggle we had been engaged in, conceived the moſt flattering golden dreams, with reſpect to this country. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long a war, they imagined we could have no manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that we were in want of every thing. He that could ſend here quickeſt, it was thought, would the moſt effectually reap the golden harveſt. This occaſioned the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe importation of goods which were poured into this country, from all quarters. Goods ſo imported have been ſold at ſuch a great loſs, that the trade has undergone a change and regulation from its own nature: and we ſhall have no more of thoſe wild adventurers coming amongſt us. How the bank facilitated thoſe gentlemen in the management of their buſineſs, I cannot aſcertain. When they ſold their goods, they received for them either money or produce. If they received money, they could certainly ſhip it off without the aſſiſtance of the bank: and if they received produce, they could have no recourſe whatever to the bank. Perhaps the gentleman means, that if the bank had not afforded the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of procuring caſh for exportation, they would have been glad to take produce. But admitting this for argument ſake, it would make no difference, unleſs he can ſhew that any of our produce has periſhed for want of being taken off our hands.</p>
               <p>Another charge made againſt the bank is giving preference to favourites. This is an extraordinary kind of accuſation to be made here. If the ſtockholders, indeed, had cauſe, and were to bring that charge, there might be ſome proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it. The money in the bank is the property of the ſtockholders and depoſitors, who have confided the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to the directors, with a power to truſt whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall ſee fit: and the directors are accountable for their conduct to the ſtockholders and depoſitors only. But ſetting this aſide, I maintain that the aſſertion is falſe. When it was made, it ſhould have been proved. I now call upon the gentlemen oppoſed to the bank, to prove the charge of partiality or favoritiſm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lollar ſaid the directors were able to give thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſtated in the report of laſt year. He had not meant to charge them with having done ſo—but to ſtate how much was in their power in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:019884_0040_0FAD41675A91BA30"/>
Mr. R. Morris. Inſinuations are one mode of making charges; and the worſt mode: becauſe it is a very difficult matter to diſprove them. But I call on any man for proof, and I do not heſitate to affirm that none can be brought, I have ſo much confidence in the fidelity of the directors.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Montgomery county, has told us that under the old government, when there were men in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs as wiſe as any ſince, they had no idea of a bank—and that they ſubſiſted without it. The old go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had no idea of an alliance with France: but this obſervation affords no argument againſt either the one or the other. However, though the old government had no idea of a bank, the commercial men of the province had: and I, as a merchant, laid the foundation of one; and eſtabliſhed a credit in Europe for the purpoſe. From the execution of this deſign, I was prevented only by the revolution. This aſſertion, therefore, like many others, is unfounded.</p>
               <p>Againſt the bank, governor Pownal's eulogium on paper money and a loan office is quoted. I agree that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a loan office, faithfully and properly conducted, is a wiſe meaſure. But are a loan office and a bank incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible? No, they are not. A loan office, eſtabliſhed on proper principles, and on a good foundation, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and encourage the landed intereſt, and operates as much in its favour, as a bank does in favour of commerce. The landed and commercial intereſt are as nearly allied here as in any country whatſoever. If the country gentlemen are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I will freely join in the creation of a capital in hard caſh, for the eſtabliſhment of a loan office. The intereſts of the bank can never interfere with theirs.</p>
               <p>But with reſpect to a loan office, it ſeems to be by many aſſumed as a principle, that it cannot be advantageous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paper money. True it is, it was formerly eſtabliſhed by means of a paper emiſſion. But then the government was in full poſſeſſion of the confidence of the people: and paper money is the child of confidence—and of confidence alone. That confidence has been deſtroyed—and it will require that during a number of years, the ſovereign authority be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered with the moſt rigid juſtice, and the moſt punctual compliance with all its engagements, before it can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained.</p>
               <p>It has been aſſerted that this confidence has been regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and in ſupport of the aſſertion, we are told that the late emiſſion of paper has been ſucceſsful. But I pledge myſelf,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019884_0041_0FAD4168713A99A0"/>
that if one hundred pounds in ſpecie be ſent out of this houſe, there may be procured for it, in leſs than an hour, 105, but in order to be within bounds, I will ſay 102½, or 103 pounds, in the paper money of the late emiſſion. This I know to be a fact. Can that, therefore, be ſaid to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which is an article of purchaſe and ſpeculation?</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall make one obſervation, tho' it ſeems foreign to my ſubject: but it has been ſuggeſted by the idea of a loan office. I have ſome ſhare in the landed intereſt—and hold a large quantity of lands within this ſtate—I am willing to ſubmit to a tax to be paid in hard money, to eſtabliſh a fund for the purpoſe of lending ſums to farmers for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lands. A farthing an acre on all the lands in the ſtate, would ſoon accumulate into a ſolid capital fully adequate.</p>
               <p>The member from Fayette county, has made an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which involves a kind of contradiction in it. He aſks with a triumphant air, can the 2947 memorialiſts in favour of the bank, be ſaid to ſpeak the ſenſe of Pennſylvania? This is very different from the language held forth laſt year, when 1199 petitioners againſt the bank, though oppoſed by 608 in its favour, were ſaid to ſpeak the ſenſe of the ſtate. Now, if 1199, oppoſed by 608, can at one time convey the ſenſe of the community, 2947, without one perſon oppoſed, may, by as fair a conſtruction, be ſaid to convey it at another. I wiſh the gentleman had amuſed himſelf in looking over the names of the ſigners; he would have ſeen, that to ſtyle them reſpectable, as is done in the report, was not an error. He has ſaid, this is holding out an ariſtocratical idea, and that there is no diſtinction of characters in Pennſylvania. What! is it inſiſted that there is no diſtinction of character? The reſpectability of thoſe ſigners is not, as he has hinted, confined to property.—Surely perſons poſſeſſed of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, judgment, information, integrity, and having exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive connections, are not to be claſſed with perſons void of reputation or character—with criminals who infringe the laws, &amp;c. &amp;c.: for ſuch we have amongſt us: and if any one doubts it, he has only to caſt his eyes to the other ſide of the ſtate houſe yard, towards the priſon, and his doubts will be removed.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman has given it as his opinion, that the number of ſigners to the memorials, were procured by the influence and terrors of the bank. But this is not founded.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019884_0042_0FAD4168F1B572D8"/>
In no inſtance was a buſineſs of this kind more fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. The greater number of the memorials are conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one ſtyle and form—every member of this houſe muſt know that they were publiſhed by thoſe who formed the deſign, in the different newſpapers in the city: ſo that every man was able to judge of the contents before he was requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſign. Does this ſavour of undue influence or terror? But what are thoſe terrors? When money is ſcarce, and people much in want of it, it is a favour to obtain diſcounts. The directors have never refuſed an enemy of the bank, merely as ſuch. Where, then, are thoſe terrors? Is it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing diſcounts to thoſe who would not ſign, that thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are to be excited. Look at the memorials, and ſee who has not ſigned them. Few entitled to diſcounts are not there. This charge of influence and terror, is not warranted by fact.</p>
               <p>The gentleman went into a hiſtory of charters in the 13th and 14th centuries; and told us that ſome charters were ſacred, becauſe they ſecured the natural rights of mankind: others were not, as being in favour of monopolies. By this, I ſuppoſe he meant to inſinuate that the charter of the bank was a monopoly. I wiſh, that inſtead of confining himſelf to make this charge, he had endeavoured to ſhew how it is a monopoly. If ever there was any room for the charge of monopoly, it was during the war: becauſe it was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by congreſs, that no other bank ſhould be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, the excluſive operations of this being eſſentially neceſſary to the united ſtates.</p>
               <p>Whatever weight there might have been in this, during the war, was entirely done away at the peace. But what is this monopoly? A right in the ſtockholders to lend their own money to whom they pleaſe. Does this hinder any other body of men from doing the ſame? If the rights of property are not of the nature of thoſe we receive from our creator, yet the ſecurity of them is amongſt the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of civil ſociety: and if in a government formed for protection of property, after the bank has been endowed with certain rights, privileges and immunities, theſe are not to be ſacredly ſecured, the very end of government is violated. If there is the difference between charters, ſtated by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who is to be the judge which are to be held ſacred, and which not? The conſtitution has given no ſuch power to the legiſlature: It has, indeed, authoriſed it to grant them: but not to take them away. Charters in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are granted by the authority of the king, who cannot
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:019884_0043_0FAD416B85139368"/>
again reſume them at pleaſure. It reſts with the courts to determine whether or no they have been forfeited.</p>
               <p>In order to juſtify the conduct of the late houſe, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has ſuppoſed that the legiſlature were to grant a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly to five men, of our trade to Europe—to five others, of our trade to the Eaſt Indies—and to a third five, of our Weſt India trade. But I aſk, how can he have recourſe to ſuch a vague and idle ſuppoſition, or build any argument on it? If any legiſlature dare violate the moſt undeniable rights of the community in ſo flagrant a manner, their acts would be nugatory in themſelves. But what rights were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by giving the charter of incorporation to the bank? Any ſet of men might apply for an act of incorporation for the ſame purpoſe to the legiſlature, whoſe hands were not tied up by the one they had already granted. When a ſet of gentlemen, oppoſed to the preſent bank, and who thought to deſtroy it, lately applied to the houſe for a charter for another, the preſident and corporation of the bank in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, petitioned againſt their requeſt. And very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did. If any ſet of men were to apply to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a charter, which I thought injurious to my private intereſt, I ſhould, if I had arguments of ſufficient weight to offer againſt it, make an appeal to the repreſentative body.</p>
               <p>The gentleman has aſked, to what purpoſe are our annual elections, if a ſucceeding houſe has not power to correct the errors and miſdoings of a former one? It cannot be denied that they undertake to alter and change the acts of their predeceſſors—and in conſequence, we have had more doing and undoing ſince the revolution, than ever was known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This is much to be lamented. It ſerves to deſtroy the confidence of the people in the government. The late aſſembly had no neceſſity—nor will they ever be juſtified, for paſſing the repealing law.—This houſe, I truſt, is diſpoſed to render juſtice to the injured, by annulling that law. Our conſtituents have ſhewn their ſenſe of the late repealing law, by the number of thoſe in favour of it, who have not been re-elected. Wherever a re-election took place, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it aroſe from miſrepreſentations, by which the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were deceived: and I venture to pronounce, that, as the utility of the bank comes to be more generally known, and the ſubject better underſtood, every member who voted againſt it, will be diſcarded by his conſtituents.</p>
               <p>The gentleman frequently gives us little ſcraps from hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and I give him credit for his reading, which I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:019884_0044_0FAD416C9F6F0328"/>
ready to hear, and pay proper attention to, when it bears any analogy to, or runs parallel with the ſubject in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. He has brought us an extract from the journals of the Iriſh houſe of commons to prove that another people had ſtrong objections to the eſtabliſhment of a bank. I wiſh I were deeper read—perhaps had there been no revolution, I ſhould have been ſo. I have read ſome hiſtory—but I will not truſt my memory: On this occaſion, however, I ſhall obſerve, that in 1721, the period in which the queſtion of a bank was agitated in Ireland, the people of that country were in a ſituation very different from that of the people of Pennſylvania at preſent. They were under the government of Great Britain, which held their commerce in trammels. They could hardly pretend to the enjoyment of liberty. This was, moreover, at a time when the public mind was agitated by bubbles of government, which were brought forth, and burſt in different parts of Europe. The people, therefore, were afraid of every new ſcheme. But if the Iriſh could have eſtabliſhed a bank, and had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it themſelves, they would have had no objection. After their late ſucceſsful ſtruggles for the recovery of their freedom, I am ſure they either have already, or will ſoon eſtabliſh a bank among them. But Ireland is a country which does not boaſt of its wealth or commerce. It is a very good country for importing people, linen, and potatoes from—but I ſhould not have looked to Ireland to import from thence commercial eſtabliſhments or precedents.</p>
               <p>The propoſal to mortgage the revenues to the bank, has been held up in a very alarming point of view. But what was the amount of this propoſal? Merely that certain reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſhould be appropriated to the payment of the intereſt of debts due by the united ſtates to citizens of this ſtate, and that the revenues devoted to that object ſhould be mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the bank. What were the terms of that mortgage? That ſo long as government continued it, the bank ſhould pay the intereſt punctually when due<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is this, then, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible propoſition, ſo fraught with danger to the ſtate? It is, indeed, as ſtrange a conſtruction as ever I heard. And who was this propoſition made by? By me, not by direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the bank—for I had none: not as a ſtockholder, for I have no authority in their councils: but as a member of the committee of ways and means; in which ſituation it was not only my right, but my duty, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a propoſition which I eſteemed ſo highly advantageous to the ſtate. In that view
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019884_0045_0FAD416DC334C918"/>
I made it—its fate every body knows—I am apprehenſive that ſome will have cauſe to lament it. But I hope not. From what I have ſaid on this matter, it will clearly appear, that the propoſition was made by an individual, not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed for the purpoſe, and therefore ſhould not injure the bank.</p>
               <p>We are told, that the bank and the paper money of the ſtate cannot exiſt together. But they do exiſt together. The bank exiſts in full credit, although deprived of the countenance of the legiſlature: and the gentlemen inſiſt that the paper money is alſo in full credit: This aſſertion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is controverted by fact.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Fayette county, appears to be of opinion, that as we have found the paper money profitable, we ſhould continue to emit it; and aſks, how we could have paid the public creditors laſt year without the late emiſſion? I anſwer they would have been better paid, if the paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had not been emitted. It began to iſſue from the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury in July laſt, by payments to the public creditors: and during the laſt ſeſſion of aſſembly, in October, or Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nearly the whole of it had found its way back again. The public creditors received it in payment of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands—they paid their debts with it, or bought what they had occaſion for: and it was brought into the treaſury—not, I preſume, as a pledge or preſent—but in payment of taxes and impoſts, which, had they been paid in proper time, would have lodged the ſame amount there in hard money, at leaſt as early as the paper was emitted, for payment of the public creditors; and would have prevented the neceſſity of an anticipation of thoſe public revenues, which were at the time actually due. The paper money was emitted at a very great expence.—The public creditor received it, and was obliged to paſs it at a leſs rate than its value—while the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant was thereby enabled to pay off his impoſts, and the taxable perſon his arrears, with leſs than their amount. How long ſhall we go on robbing one part of the community to benefit the other?</p>
               <p>The gentleman has ſpoken of the circulation of the late emiſſion of paper money. This wants ſome explanation. The ſum emitted was but ſmall—and has been paid into the treaſury nearly as faſt as delivered out. The revenues of the ſtate are ſufficient to enſure the circulation of ſuch a ſum. But what ſecurity have we that the next houſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly will not iſſue another emiſſion, and another? The
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:019884_0046_0FAD416E0A0C6EF8"/>
doubts and fears of this, and of tender laws, deſtroy the confidence of the public. While theſe doubts remain in the minds of the people, the circulation of paper muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be quick, as no one will riſque the keeping it long by him.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid of the oppoſition given by the bank to the late emiſſion of paper money. I acknowledge that I gave it oppoſition—but that was before the law paſſed. I defy any perſon to prove I have given it any ſince. Such has been the line of conduct purſued by my friends. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding it as a meaſure not calculated for the public good, we thought it our duty to oppoſe it, while there were hopes of preventing it. But afterwards, when the bill had paſſed, we dropped our oppoſition: as it is the duty of good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to follow, when they cannot lead.</p>
               <p>It has been argued that the bank is prejudicial to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and improvements; that it has been the cauſe of the high rate of intereſt; and that uſury was unknown before its eſtabliſhment. Theſe are very heavy charges indeed—but they are not founded in fact. By what means can the bank injure agriculture? If diſcounts are injurious to it, then, indeed, the bank may be arraigned. But how are diſcounts injurious to agriculture? I ſay they are uſed on many occaſions, for the expreſs purpoſe of encouraging agriculture, if affording to thoſe that want to purchaſe the produce of the country, the means to make ſuch purchaſes, when they could not otherwiſe accompliſh them, be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. Let us ſuppoſe a ſhip arrives here from the Weſt Indies with a cargo of rum and ſugars, belonging or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſome one of our merchants, who has not an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſpoſe of thoſe articles immediately. It is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to have the veſſel detained—yet though he has value in his ſtores, he cannot procure money to purchaſe flour, to load her. In this ſituation, if there be no bank, there is no redreſs. This is by no means ideal. I have frequently experienced it myſelf. The houſe with which I was connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have often had abundance of goods in their ſtores and magazines, and been unable to procure ſpecie to lade their veſſels. At this criſis, the bank ſteps forward, and if the merchant has evidence of property in his poſſeſſion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures credit—purchaſes produce—and ſends off his veſſel. This is the facility the bank gives to commerce. Without it the farmer and merchant would be equally diſtreſſed: the former would have his waggons waiting in Market-ſtreet,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019884_0047_0FAD416ECEBA0118"/>
and no ſale; while the latter would have abundance of rum, mahogany, logwood, dry goods, &amp;c. in his ſtores, none of which, perhaps, the other would have occaſion for. But by means of the bank, the merchant is enabled to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and the farmer to return home.</p>
               <p>The high rate of intereſt has entirely ariſen from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of perſons in want of money, who either had no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at the bank, or run through what they had. They were then obliged to make application to uſurers, whoſe enormous demands roſe in proportion to the diſtreſſes of their victims. Thus has intereſt mounted from ½ to 2 and 5 per cent per month. But did the bank take this intereſt? No. Did it encourage thoſe who took it? No. As faſt as they became known, they were refuſed diſcounts. Why then charge the inſtitution with what it has a direct tendency to prevent?</p>
               <p>The extraordinary profits of the bank, we are told, not only prevent people from purchaſing houſes, lots and lands, but even induce thoſe who have them, to ſell. But ſurely thoſe extraordinary profits are as much the object of one man as another—and if one wants to ſell on that account, who will be found to buy?—I have, however, authority for ſaying, that the profits of the bank do not exceed, on an average, 7¾ or 8 per cent. per annum, which would never be ſufficient inducement to hold ſtock, if there were no other conſideration.</p>
               <p>"The bank," a gentleman has ſaid, "has not ſuffered by the loſs of its charter. The ſtockholders," added he, "have already gained enough." To this I anſwer, that the bank has ſuffered in the only way in which the aſſembly of the ſtate could injure it. And if this houſe reſtore the charter, they will not reſtore what the late houſe took away. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to poſſeſs, it is true, the confidence of the citizens of Philadelphia—and of the neighbouring ſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but before the late attack made on it, it poſſeſſed the confidence of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied men in Europe. This it has in a great meaſure loſt: and this it will find difficult to regain.</p>
               <p>On motion ordered, that the further conſideration of the report be poſtponed.</p>

               <p>RESUMED the conſideration of the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to whom were referred the memorials praying a repeal or ſuſpenſion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I was in hopes, that after the many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments made uſe of on the part of the bank, ſome of the gentlemen in oppoſition, would have riſen in reply: but I ſee they are determined to reſerve themſelves for the laſt blow. I ſhall therefore try to provoke an anſwer, by offering ſuch further arguments as occur to me, on the ſubject under our conſideration.</p>
               <p>The bill, which was enacted into a law, by the late houſe of aſſembly, repealing the charter of the bank, was brought in, in conſequence of a report made by a committee of that houſe, which had been inſtructed to enquire and aſcertain, whether the charges made by certain petitioners againſt the bank, were true or not. Knowing that this queſtion would come before the houſe, I was prepared to aſk the members of that committee, whether ſuch enquiry had been made? and if it had, when and where it was made, and what had been the reſult? But the committee of the preſent houſe have ſaved me that trouble; they have aſcertained and ſtated in the preamble of their report, that no ſuch enquiry was made. The only member of the committee of the late houſe who has ſpoken in the preſent debate, has told us, that even ſuppoſing the committee had not made the enquiry, the houſe might with propriety take up the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their report: by which he has conceded the point as to any enquiries having been made.—The neceſſary enquiries not having been made, I would aſk, how the committee came by the opinion given in their report, "that the bank is in every view incompatible with the public ſafety?"</p>
               <p>Here mr. Gray called mr. Morris to order. He declared he was uneaſy to hear the conduct not only of the late houſe, but of their committee impeached. It was, in his idea, entirely improper, and not the ſit mode of conducting the buſineſs. He was unintereſted in the queſtion, ſo far as it related to their conduct, having had no hand either in granting or revoking the charter of the bank but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly of opinion, that if one houſe undertook to impeach the conduct of another, it would lead into endleſs difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. There was no other tribunal eſtabliſhed by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with the powers neceſſary for that purpoſe, than the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019884_0049_0FAD4170591BEEC8"/>
council of cenſors. That body would, at a future day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on the conduct of the late houſe of aſſembly. The member was perfectly out of order.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I have been called to order very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and indecently: the queſtion pending before this houſe, is, whether or no an act of the former houſe ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed? How is it poſſible to diſcuſs this queſtion, without ſpeaking of the conduct of that houſe? Several other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who have gone before me, have taken the ſame ground I have proceeded upon, and have arraigned the conduct of the late houſe and of their committee—they were not called to order: why then am I ſingled out? Do I not poſſeſs the ſame rights and privileges as other members? The gentleman has not ſhewn that I was not in order.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie ſaid, the gentleman from Philadelphia county [mr. Gray] was certainly right. The member had been out of order. He added, that he would venture to ſay, ſuch a report as that under debate, had never been produced in any aſſembly. However, he had no objection to a free and full diſcuſſion of the conduct of the late houſe, and of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee—as, ſo far from ſuffering by it—</p>
               <p>Here the Speaker interfered. He ſaid on a queſtion of order, there could not be any debate allowed. If the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had called the member from the city to order, wiſhed to take the ſenſe of the houſe, he would put the queſtion: otherwiſe the member muſt be permitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without interruption.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gray declining to have the ſenſe of the houſe taken,</p>
               <p>Mr. Morris proceeded thus: Had the committee of the late houſe been charged with neglect of duty, with a view of bringing them to trial before this houſe, as the gentleman ſeems to ſuppoſe, he would have been right in giving oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſuch proceeding, and I ſhould have joined him; but that is by no means the caſe. The ſubject before us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an inveſtigation of the conduct of the late houſe, and that of their committee which made the report, whereon was founded the law for annulling the charter of the bank: reſpecting their conduct, and on every part of it, I have a right to ſpeak my ſentiments, provided they are delivered in a manner not inconſiſtent with any privileges of this houſe.</p>
               <p>The report made by the ſaid committee, declares, as I ſaid before, <q>That the bank is in every view incompatible
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019884_0050_0FAD41742EA55C48"/>
with the public ſafety.</q> I aſk was that committee either able or willing to conſider the ſubject in every view? I do not heſitate to pronounce <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Did that committee take a view of the ſervices which the bank had rendered to the united ſtates? I believe they did not; and yet that was one of the points of view in which they ought to have conſidered it: for when chartered rights are to be deſtroyed, the matter ſhould really be conſidered in every point of view. As the committee did not chooſe to make mention of thoſe ſervices, many of which muſt have been known to them, I ſhall, I truſt, be excuſed for giving ſome little account of them.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the year 178<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the money and credit of the united ſtates were at ſo low an ebb, that ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the board of war declared to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they had not the means of ſending an expreſs to the army. I mention this only as one inſtance, to ſhew that diſtreſsful ſtate of our finances, which induced congreſs to make the appointment of a ſuperintendent, which was done in the month of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary in that year: and a ſtill ſtronger proof of our diſtreſs will be ſhewn, by a bare mention, that a motion was, about the time of that appointment, made in congreſs, by an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delegate from the ſtate of Virginia, to authoriſe general Waſhington to ſeize all the proviſions that could be found within a circle of twenty miles round his camp. The motion having been ſubmitted to me, as ſuperintendent elect, I requeſted that it might be withdrawn, and pledged myſelf to procure, upon my private credit, a ſupply of four or five thouſand barrels of flour, in a ſhort time, for the uſe of the army; and I was happy enough to ſucceed in the attempt. The various ſcenes of diſtreſs, and the extreme difficulties which preſented themſelves to my view at that time, were ſufficient to have deterred any man from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of ſuch an appointment; but, however unequal to the ſtation, the attempt was indiſpenſible. I found it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, previous to the acceptance, to make certain ſtipulations, as leading to the only poſſible chance of ſucceſs: amongſt theſe was that of not being liable to make good the previous engagements taken on account of the united ſtates, well knowing that ſuch demands muſt ſoon have run me down—Another ſtipulation was made with the miniſter of France, for a credit upon the king's treaſury, which was granted in a very limited degree. That miniſter did not want inclination to go greater lengths; but I have reaſon to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:019884_0051_0FAD41755B0A39D8"/>
believe, that he was limited by inſtructions, both as to the ſum and terms of the loan; terms which it may be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me to mention here, although they would add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of our then miſerable ſituation.</p>
               <p>This credit, however, and the confidence repoſed in me by the then legiſlature of Pennſylvania, laid the foundation for appreciating the paper money of this ſtate, and enabled me to feed and move the army during the remainder of the year 1781. I was happy enough to find that aſſembly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to give every poſſible aid to thoſe deſigns which were then formed for promoting the public ſervice. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive branch of government was equally well diſpoſed. I have now a gentleman in my eye who then preſided: he knows the applications I was obliged to make; he gave ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance as far as he could, and I feel a pleaſure in bearing this public teſtimony to his exertions at the time.—Under the preſſure of thoſe difficulties I have mentioned, the idea of a public or national bank ſuggeſted itſelf, as a meaſure that might be extremely uſeful in my attempts to regain for the united ſtates, that credit which had been loſt. I made the propoſal for eſtabliſhing it to congreſs, which met their approbation. Every one knows the terms on which it was offered to the public: and yet from the month of May, when the propoſals were publiſhed, until the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember or October following, there were not more ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the whole, than amounted to about ſeventy thouſand dollars. During this time, one of his moſt chriſtian majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's frigates arrived at Boſton, and brought a remittance in ſpecie of about four hundred and ſeventy thouſand dollars. This ſum was brought to Philadelphia, and depoſited in the vaults of the bank. I determined from the moment of its arrival, to ſubſcribe on behalf of the united ſtates, for thoſe ſhares in the bank which remained vacant; but ſuch was the amount of the public expenditures, that, notwithſtanding the utmoſt care and caution to keep this money, nearly one half of the ſum was exhauſted before the inſtitution could be organized. In November 1781, the preſident and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the bank were elected; they obtained a charter of incorporation from congreſs—and opened the bank for tranſacting buſineſs in January 1782. I ſubſcribed the ſum then remaining in the treaſury, being about 254,000 dollars, into the bank ſtock, for account of the united ſtates, which became thereby the principal ſtockholders. And I ſhall now read an extract taken upon this occaſion, from <q>a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:019884_0052_0FAD4175934E2768"/>
of the accounts of the united ſtates of America, during the adminiſtration of the ſuperintendent of finance,</q> which was made out and publiſhed before my reſignation, intended for the information of my fellow-citizens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the treaſury office, under an expectation that the books would have been diſtributed or ſold: why they have been with-held from the public eye, I do not know; I meant them for public inveſtigation; and, as the officer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned feared none that could be made into my conduct. It lies with thoſe who have with-held the books, to account for it.</p>
               <p>This extract ſtates, that on the firſt of April 1782, the united ſtates poſſeſſed ſtock in the bank, to the amount of 252, 918 28-90 dollars; and that they were then indebted for money borrowed of the bank, 300,000 dollars, by which it appears, that if this inſtitution had not taken place, the treaſury would have been 50,000 dollars worſe than nothing.</p>
               <p>The requiſitions of congreſs, for 8,000,000 of dollars, which were paſſed the preceding November, required no payment from the ſtates until May: and it is well known, that long after that time, they produced no effect: at that period, public credit had gone to wreck; and the enemy built their moſt ſanguine hopes of overcoming us, upon this circumſtance; but at that criſis our credit was reſtored by the bank.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of July 1782, the united ſtates held to the amount of 253,000 28-90 dollars in bank ſtock, and were then indebted to the bank 400,000 dollars, which is nearly 150,000 dollars more than the amount of their ſaid ſtock. I am ſenſible that by mentioning theſe tranſactions, I expoſe the preſident and directors of the bank to the only cenſure that can affect them. The then ſtockholders might with ſome appearance of reaſon have complained that they had extended their credit to the united ſtates too far beyond the bounds of diſcretion: but let it be conſidered, that they were told, and truly told, by him that preſided over the finances, that the fate of their country depended very much upon the aſſiſtance required from time to time at their hands. Their deſire to render public ſervice, and their confidence in the aſſurance given repeatedly <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:019884_0053_0FAD417663BB4B08"/>
in the attack upon the bank, I leave to the deciſion of every gentleman preſent. In October 1782, the united ſtates continued, as before, poſſeſſed of bank ſtock for 253,394 58-90 dollars, and indebted 400,000 dollars. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore January 1783, the preſident and directors growing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uneaſy at this heavy loan, and fearing cenſure, they called upon me for relief, and I ſold out ſtock of the united ſtates to the amount of 200,000 dollars, and paid 300,000 dollars in part of the debt: ſo that on the firſt of January 1783, the united ſtates held ſtock for 53,394 58-90 dollars, and owed the bank, 100,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of April following, the ſituation remained the ſame. By the firſt of July, I had ſold the whole of the bank ſtock belonging to the united ſtates, and they remained in debt to the bank, 129,800 dollars. On the firſt of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 1783, this debt was encreaſed to 164,781: but by the firſt of January 1784, the united ſtates were diſcharged of that debt.</p>
               <p>The preſident and directors of the bank had no pledge after the ſale of the ſtock, for the debt of the united ſtates, other than that of the public faith given in proper writings by their officer. During theſe times of diſtreſs and want, the utility of the bank was not confined to the advances made to the ſuperintendent for public ſervice. It was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently beneficial, by extending diſcounts to contractors who ſupplied the army with proviſions, and to others concerned in truſting articles neceſſary for the ſupplies of the various public departments; ſometimes the notes were diſcounted upon public, and ſometimes upon private credit. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been obliged to take the contractors' notes to me for the ſums due to them, and endorſe ſuch notes in my private capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſo that they might obtain diſcounts on thoſe notes to pay themſelves: by theſe, and ſuch other means as could then be deviſed, anticipations were effected, until public monies could be collected to diſcharge the notes. Some members of this houſe know, and can vouch the truth of this relation; one in particular, who contracted with me for feeding the troops and priſoners at Reading, on very moderate terms, who gave great ſatisfaction in the execution, got but little profit, but always appeared well pleaſed with the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being ſo far uſeful to his country. This gentleman muſt remember theſe things well.</p>
               <p>From the aids given by this inſtitution, the united ſtates were enabled to keep up, feed, and clothe an army, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:019884_0054_0FAD41771E1C6B78"/>
of a larger number of men than they had had in the field before, or than they could have maintained without theſe aids. This army was, in every point, on a much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable footing than formerly, and they kept the enemy at bay.</p>
               <p>And ſhall this inſtitution, from which, not only the united ſtates, but this ſtate, as a member of the union, hath derived ſuch ſolid advantages, loſe all its merit and credit, by the report of a committee of the late houſe of aſſembly, ſtating opinions, unſupported by a ſingle fact? Had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee called upon me, I would have given them this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and given it upon oath, if required. Nay, I am even now ready, if neceſſary, to quit my ſeat as a member, and appear at the bar of this houſe, to prove the truths I have advanced.</p>
               <p>I now appeal to that gentleman, who has aſſerted, that this ſtate has received no conſideration for the charter granted to the bank, whether her ſhare of ſervices and credit derived from it, was not an ample conſideration? Every perſon who hears me, will, I doubt not, agree that it was. I will not, however, advocate the cauſe of the bank, merely from paſt ſervices; but will try to ſhew, that it may alſo be uſeful to the public in time to come.</p>
               <p>The report ſays, the bank has a direct tendency to baniſh a great part of the ſpecie from this country. From what information the committee derived this knowledge, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was inſtinctive, I cannot pretend to decide. But I maintain that it has a direct contrary tendency. The money of the ſtockholders and depoſitors is drawn into its vortex, and how is it to be got out of their cellars?—The directors will not certainly give it away—they lend it but for ſhort pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, and few of thoſe borrowers would riſque a ſhipment of money which muſt ſo ſoon be repaid. Formerly, when a ſhip was put up for London, the remitters who wiſhed to ſhip ſpecie, were obliged, if they had not the money, to caſt about for ways and means of obtaining it, either by borrowing or buying of their neighbours and acquaintance, and away it went if they ſucceeded. At preſent, under ſimilar circumſtances, the remitters are obliged to make application to the bank for diſcounts: but the directors being intereſted to obſtruct the ſhipments of money, and knowing thoſe who want diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for that purpoſe, they watch them as cloſely as a cat does a mouſe, and refuſe ſuch diſcounts until the ſhip is
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:019884_0055_0FAD4177DA2CF168"/>
gone. Such refuſals may poſſibly have given riſe, in part, to the charge of partiality. The directors, knowing how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious the exportation of ſpecie is to the operations of the bank, will not lend money for exportation. No conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſums can be ſought after or obtained for this purpoſe, without their being aware of it; the experience and habits they have acquired in the courſe of their management, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to perceive the approaching evil; and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to counteract and obſtruct it, as ſoon as diſcovered. Thus, although they cannot prevent the exportation of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they render it far more difficult than it would otherwiſe be, and conſequently the bank has no tendency to baniſh the ſpecie. The report of laſt year, therefore, ſo far as it is grounded on this charge, is grounded on a falſehood.</p>
               <p>This report proceeds to tell us, that the bank, after ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a great part of the ſpecie of the country, collects nearly the whole of the remainder into the hands of the ſtockholders. How this can come to paſs, it is not eaſy to aſcertain. Every ſix months a dividend is made of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the bank: and if we reflect who are the ſtockholders, we ſhall find it moſt probable that the dividends are devoted to their current expences, for the ſupport of themſelves and families, and by that means circulated again amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. At any rate, the ſtock cannot increaſe by means of the profits, unleſs new ſhares are purchaſed, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be done. And if it were to be done, the number of ſtockholders would increaſe with the number of ſhares ſold: conſequently the charge of accumulating the wealth of the ſtate, into the hands of a few individuals, falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>The report goes on to ſtate, <q>That the accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enormous wealth in the hands of a ſociety who claim perpetual duration, will neceſſarily produce a degree of influence and power, which cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted in the hands of any ſet of men whatſoever, without endangering the public ſafety.</q> How is this accumulation of enormous wealth to take place? If an individual poſſeſſes one ſhare in the bank ſtock, it cannot accumulate: it will always remain one ſhare: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are divided and drawn out half yearly. An increaſe of the number of ſtockholders, increaſes the number of ſhares; and by experience has been found to reduce thoſe profits. What then is meant by this accumulation? this influence?
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:019884_0056_0FAD4178C9C9EBA0"/>
They are mere bugbears, held out to terrify the ignorant and unſuſpecting members of the community.</p>
               <p>If, indeed, it is meant, that by the ſale of more ſhares, the preſident and directors will have the management of more money than while the ſtock is confined and ſmall, I grant it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the conſequence would be, that they could, with a larger capital, be more uſeful. As to influence, it may be depended upon as a fact, that if ever ſuch an inſtitution could create influence, this bank has had the opportunity from January 1782, to the preſent time: and who has ſeen or felt this influence during that period? But ſuppoſing ſuch an influence to exiſt, how far could it go? it could only extend to thoſe who ſhould be under a neceſſity to borrow; and only ſo long as it ſhould be conſidered a favour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain loans. Had this inſtitution been let alone, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it had obtained, would ſoon have procured ſuch an increaſe of ſtockholders and ſtock, as would have turned the tables: and inſtead of its being deemed a favour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain loans at the bank, the directors would have been glad to receive applications for them, from men of proper cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and as the capital increaſed, they would not only have been enabled to accommodate the public more generally, but it might have ſo happened, that they would have had it in their power to lend to farmers for the improvement of their lands.</p>
               <p>Has any of this much-dreaded influence ſhewn itſelf in the legiſlature? I anſwer, no. If any member will ſay yes, let him ſhew when—let him ſhew how—let him produce evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fact. But if ſuch influence did exiſt, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it could extend beyond the bounds of the city? One of my worthy colleagues and myſelf are ſtockholders, and gentlemen affect to ſuppoſe we are under this influence: this is conſidering the matter in the worſt point of view. But for the ſake of argument, if we admit it for a moment, how far does our influence go? We offer our ſentiments on vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occaſions: we urge reaſons and arguments which we, at leaſt, think ought to have weight, and to carry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. But if theſe arguments are offered againſt a certain ſyſtem of meaſures, there are certain gentlemen from the country, who poſſeſs a kind of magic, which produces much greater effect than our reaſoning. We carry very few points againſt this magic charm: and with a vote on the queſtion, our influence is ended.</p>

The report goes further to ſay, <q>That the bank is not dependent on government.</q> I am very glad it is not; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> on government, that moment it is deſtroyed. The confidence of the public is neceſſary to its exiſtence: and that confidence has been acquired by the punctual compliance with its engagements. Were it under the control of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the people would withdraw their confidence; and neither ſtockholders or depoſitors would be found to truſt their money under ſuch control. Gentlemen may ſay what they pleaſe of the credit of government; but the fact is, that ſuch credit is not obtained. Government ought to have credit: and no man wiſhes more than I do, to ſee it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but not through this channel. If government, in the preſent ſtate of things, could control the funds of the bank, and were to apply them to the uſe of the ſtate, how ſhould an individual, whoſe money was taken by ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, obtain ſatisfaction? Should he go to law with the ſtate? No; the government has too much power, and he muſt ſubmit to what it ſhould dictate. But if the preſident and directors of the bank abuſe their truſt, and miſapply his money, the law is ſtronger than they are: and the law will give him relief.</p>
               <p>The report continues, <q>The great profits of the bank, which will daily increaſe as money grows ſcarcer, and which already far exceed the profits of European banks, have tempted foreigners to veſt their money in this bank, thus to draw from us large ſums for intereſt.</q> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee might as well have ſtated, that the profits of a mill increaſe in proportion to the ſcarcity of corn, by which it loſes the toll, as that the profits of the bank will increaſe as money grows ſcarcer: for money is the life and ſoul of a bank, and as neceſſary as plenty of corn is to a mill. The firſt part of this clauſe has, therefore, no foundation in truth: and as to that part relative to foreigners taking away our ſpecie, in payment of the intereſt or dividends which will ariſe on their ſtock, I am glad of the opportunity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the conſideration of it, having heard it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urged by ſenſible men as a grievance, that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould pay dividends to foreigners, which they conſider as a kind of tribute. I ſhall remark, by the way, that when foreigners place money in the bank for the purchaſe of ſtock, it proves that inſtead of facilitating the export of ſpecie, the inſtitution has a tendency to draw it into this country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:019884_0058_0FAD417DD649BFE0"/>
I aſſert, that it is the intereſt of this country to borrow money from abroad, and pay either intereſt, or bank divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends for the uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Did the firſt ſettlers of America bring capitals with them! Some few individuals might: but the generality certainly did not: if they could accompliſh the bringing the neceſſary implements of huſbandry, it was doing a great deal. The ſettlers that have continued to follow the firſt comers, from that time to this, were in the ſame way: very few have brought capitals; and yet nearly all have grown rich. How did this happen? It has happened by the uſe of European capitals. How were theſe obtained for that uſe? Not by borrowing money; for they could not, it is true, obtain ſuch loans: if they could, the country would have grown rich much faſter. But they borrowed goods. America has riſen to opulence by means of the credit ſhe obtained in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The goods ſo borrowed, or, in other words, bought upon credit, were not procured on the ſame eaſy terms, on which money is uſually lent. It would have been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the traders in America, to borrow money at ſix, eight, ten per cent. or at any rate of dividend made by the bank, and to have purchaſed their goods with the ready money ſo borrowed: for with ready money, thoſe purchaſes might have been made, ten, fifteen, twenty, and perhaps in ſome articles, thirty per cent. cheaper than on credit.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the merchants in England uſually ſhipped goods on one year's credit, without charging intereſt for that year. But it has been always ſaid, and in ſome inſtances proved upon trials in the courts of law, that the year's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is amply compenſated by the advances put on the real coſt of the goods, beſides other benefices derived by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh merchant, by means of drawbacks, diſcounts, &amp;c. &amp;c. And if the American importer cannot pay at the expiration of the twelve months, an intereſt account commences, and is continued in ſuch manner, that he pays at the rate of compound intereſt, until the debt is diſcharged. Under theſe diſadvantages, the credit, obtained in Europe, at a rate of intereſt equal to fifteen, twenty, or perhaps thirty per cent. has been the foundation of that proſperity which we behold in America. That credit has been extended by the importer to the country ſhopkeeper; and, through him, to the farmer and mechanic, who being thereby enabled to purſue their labours, have drawn produce from the ſurface and bowels of the earth, which has not only defrayed the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:019884_0059_0FAD417E8F813D00"/>
whole of the coſt and charges, but enriched the induſtrious. Muſt not, then, an inſtitution which draws money from Europe for the uſe of our citizens, at the rate of 7 3 4ths or 8 per cent. be extremely beneficial? Could America by means of ſuch inſtitutions, or by any other means, obtain loans ſufficient to enable her to purchaſe all the goods wanted from Europe, with ready money, ſhe would find a vaſt and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage in it. The plan and utility of a loan office are pretty well underſtood—A farmer borrows at that office at the rate of ſix per cent. per annum intereſt—this enables him to improve his land to the beſt advantage: and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> well directed induſtry, he raiſes annually from that land an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come exceeding the rate of intereſt, which ſoon enables him to diſcharge the debt, and enrich himſelf. In like manner, if we can create a credit in Europe, and borrow at ſix, eight, or ten per cent, ſo long as ſuch loans can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to raiſe an income exceeding the intereſt paid, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich ourſelves by the difference. The eſtabliſhment of the bank had created that credit in ſome degree: and Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, ſo long as her citizens can derive a better income from the capitals of Europeans veſted in our bank ſtock, than thoſe Europeans derive from the dividends, ought to hold out encouragement for an increaſe of ſuch ſtockholders, rather than purſue meaſures for diminiſhing their ſhares.</p>
               <p>The report proceeds—<q>Foreigners will doubtleſs be more and more induced to become ſtockholders, until the time may arrive, when this engine of power may become ſubject to foreign influence. This country may be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with the politics of European courts, and the good people of America reduced once more to a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and dependence upon ſome one or other of the European powers.</q> This conveys a moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary poſition; that foreigners, by depoſiting their money with us, ſhall become our enemies, and ſeek our deſtruction; and that thoſe who place confidence in us, ſhall endeavour to ruin us. I hardly imagine that this can require a ſerious anſwer. The contrary propoſition is ſelf-evident. Had we at every court in Europe, perſons ſo warmly intereſted in our favour as thoſe ſtockholders muſt be, we ſhould have warm ſupporters in caſe any of thoſe courts ſhould form hoſtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt us. Nothing can make ſuch ſtockholders our enemies, but breaking our contracts with them.</p>
               <p>The report adds, "at beſt, if it were even confined to the hands of Americans, it would be totally deſtructive of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019884_0060_0FAD417F4B525890"/>
that equality which ought to prevail in a republic." What equality is here meant? Why did not the committee explain it? Holding more or leſs ſhares in the bank cannot deſtroy it, unleſs they meant equality in the poſſeſſion of property. If that was their view, they ſhould firſt have reported a law, fixing limits to induſtry—and an agrarian law for making an equal diviſion of property. But I believe thoſe meaſures would prove as diſagreeable to the members of that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, as to the ſtockholders of the bank. Each of them, I imagine, poſſeſſes more now than would fall to his ſhare on ſuch a diviſion; and there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe, they would be fond of parting with what they hold: for, on the contrary, they are like their neighbours, trying to get more. I may be told, that this is my caſe—Agreed—I have ſome property; repeated attempts have been made to deprive me of it—I have not only reſiſted ſuch attempts ſucceſsfully, but continue to exert myſelf in the acquiſition of more. Make a diviſion, and that induſtry ceaſes.</p>
               <p>"We have nothing," the report continues, "in our free and equal government, capable of balancing the influence which the bank muſt create."</p>
               <p>On this point, it is only neceſſary to mention the late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt—not to balance—but totally to deſtroy the bank. I ſhall therefore make no other appeal, than to the report it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the refutation of this aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The report proceeds, "We ſee nothing, which, in the courſe of a few years, can prevent the directors of the bank from governing Pennſylvania."</p>
               <p>Therefore there is nothing, for if there had been, ſo wiſe a committee muſt have ſeen it. But did they ſee any thing that was likely to place the government in their hands? I may ſafely anſwer no, for if they had, they would not have failed in that part of their duty—they would have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the ſtrongeſt terms.</p>
               <p>Again the report proceeds, "Already the houſe of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the repreſentatives of the people, have been threatened that the credit of our paper currency will be blaſted by the bank."</p>
               <p>I aſk, who made thoſe threats? Is it in proof that the preſident and directors of the bank have made them? If they have been ſo imprudent, let it be ſhewn, and I agree that they abide the conſequences: if ſuch threats have been made by other perſons, advocates of the bank, can their conduct be urged as a ſerious charge againſt the inſtitution?
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019884_0061_0FAD418011CC1F30"/>
But even ſuppoſing ſuch threats to have been made, let us ſee what has actually been done: The only oppoſition to the meaſure of emitting paper money, was made during the time that meaſure was in agitation: and ſurely that was the proper time for thoſe who diſapproved it, to make their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. They did not continue to oppoſe after the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was adopted: at leaſt the preſident and directors of the bank did not. It was not expected of them that they ſhould give hard money in exchange for the paper emiſſion: they could not, without being guilty of a breach of truſt: but upon the requeſt of ſome friends to the paper money, they agreed to receive it on depoſit, and to anſwer the drafts of the depoſitors, drawn at their own will and pleaſure; this was done at ſome expence, much trouble, and at leaſt ſo far gave countenance and credit, as to induce many to receive it in payment. In fact, they gave the paper every countenance they conſiſtently could, and probably more than they ought to have done.</p>
               <p>"If," concludes the report, "this growing evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, we fear the time is not very diſtant when the bank will be able to dictate to the legiſlature of Pennſylvania, what laws to paſs and what to forbear." I hope the legiſlature of Pennſylvania will always be compoſed of men independent in ſpirit—independent in fortune: whilſt this is the caſe, there is nothing to fear from this bug-a-boo; ſuch men would ſpurn at all attempts to dictate to the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>But I have already ſhewn, that no ſuch danger as is here held out, can poſſibly ariſe from the bank. So long as the electors of the ſtate take care to return for their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, men of ſenſe, integrity, ſpirit, and property, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will derive ſecurity to their lives, liberties, and property. And although it was, ſome time ſince, faſhionable with ſome people to cry out, that men of property ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from any ſhare in the government, yet it will be found, that the public ſafety conſiſts beſt with placing the government in the hands of thoſe who contribute to bear its burdens.</p>
               <p>I have now gone through the report; and have, I think, proved that it is not founded in truth, ſupported by facts, nor warranted by any information given to, or obtained by, the committee who made it. Inſtead of adducing facts, they have ſtated opinions: and what has been done in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? The then houſe of aſſembly, in conſequence of that report, paſſed an act for taking away the charter of the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:019884_0062_0FAD41810F882688"/>
bank. The preamble to that act, ſtates, "That the bank has been found injurious to the ſtate."</p>
               <p>It is then no longer a matter of opinion—as ſtated in the report: but is in the preamble aſſerted as a matter of fact. I maintain that the aſſertion is untrue. Deſirous to treat the former houſe with as much decency as the occaſion will permit, I refrain from uſing other epithets, which might with propriety be applied; but the round aſſertion in the preamble to the act, demands as ſtrong a reply: there was no proof to ſupport that aſſertion: the committee did not even pretend to any. The houſe was deceived by the tenor and plauſibility of the report: and that committee are cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable.</p>
               <p>Will this houſe, then, ſuffer to remain enrolled amongſt the laws of Pennſylvania, an act, paſſed under deception, and founded on mere aſſertion of matter, neither proved or ſupported? I hope they will not. I hope this houſe has too great a regard for the honour of the ſtate, to permit that law to remain unrepealed.</p>

               <p>RESUMED the conſideration of the report of the committee, to whom were referred the memorials pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repeal or ſuſpenſion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill. A great deal has been ſaid on the ſubject now under conſideration of this houſe. I ſtill remain of my former opinion (for I have heard no reaſon adduced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of the contrary) that the charter and inſtitution of the bank were totally incompatible with the intereſt and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Pennſylvania. In that opinion I ſhall remain, until I hear better reaſons offered on the other ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The report before the houſe, conveys a number of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious reflections on the late aſſembly, and on their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee who made the report relative to the bank. In taking a review of it, I think it will appear thoſe reflections are ill-founded, and unwarranted by fact.</p>
               <p>It ſtates, <q>that the report made to the late houſe, was grounded in general notions preconceived, or on the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:019884_0063_0FAD4182311012E8"/>
popular opinions and ſpeculations, without much conſideration being beſtowed on the ſpecial ſubject; and the ſame may at leaſt be ſaid of the petitions preſented againſt the bank:</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <q>that the houſe did not derive from either mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that committee, or the ſaid petitioners, thoſe clear lights, which would have been neceſſary to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, on ſo difficult and intereſting a ſubject, and which, from the inſtructions to their committee, they ſeem to have deſired.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What is to be ſuppoſed the enquiry neceſſary to be made in this caſe? or what the lights neceſſary to the deliberations of the houſe? Are not thoſe popular opinions, the opinions of the people of the ſtate? And can the houſe of aſſembly, the repreſentatives of the people at large, have a ſurer guide to regulate their conduct, than the opinions of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents?</p>
               <p>The charge of not affording the preſident and directors a hearing, is ill founded. Becauſe they were not heard until the third reading of the bill, does it therefore neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they were not heard at all?</p>
               <p>The late houſe is charged with having come to a haſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and broken through the procraſtinating forms of proceeding, which were fixed as fences, againſt the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violences of power. This is a wrong ſtatement, and a very unjuſt inſinuation. The repealing act was paſſed with every uſual formality.</p>
               <p>Not having made any enquiry at the bank, is ſtated as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry criminal in the committee—But that would have been a very improper place to make any enquiry. Would the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and directors have told us of the partiality or favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiſm they might have been guilty of? Would they have told us of any failure in their duty? They would have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us no ſuch information. Would they have told us that the bank was incompatible with the ſafety or welfare of the ſtate? No ſuch thing. A gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] has ſaid that if we had applied to him, he would have given us information—But we might as well apply at the bank as to him—he is deeply intereſted in the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>The committee enquired into the nature of the bank—and its compatibility with the public welfare—and found no ſuch compatibility. It has been aſked, how is the bank dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous—how incompatible with the public welfare? I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how. It advances paper on the credit of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:019884_0064_0FAD4182B30E01E0"/>
the money in its vaults, and its loans are confined to 45 days—a period which can never afford any opportunity for the country people to profit by it: as it is impoſſible they can come down here every 45 days to renew their obligations. It moreover cramps the credit and circulation of the paper money of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>I am againſt the report as propoſing to re-eſtabliſh the bank on its former charter. [Here mr. Whitehill read that clauſe of the charter, which empowered the corporation to have a ſtock not exceeding ten millions of dollars—and that which appointed the preſident and directors: he then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:] This ſtock of ten millions of dollars was too great an eſtate—it afforded too great a liberty to the bank. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and directors were incorporated without the houſe knowing any of their bye laws and regulations. The ſame perſons might be preſident and directors all their lives. There would have been no end of the corporation, but by a repeal of their charter, let them exerciſe their powers how they would.</p>
               <p>The late houſe has been charged with a haſty determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in repealing the charter: But the houſe that granted it, was much more haſty in its proceedings: as I ſhall ſhew. On the 22d of February, 1782, a letter was preſented from the preſident and directors of the bank, praying leave to bring in a bill to incorporate the ſubſcribers thereto. The 25th of the ſame month, the bill was brought in, and read a firſt time: no committee had been appointed to prepare it. The 26th, it was on motion read a ſecond time, and ordered to be tranſcribed and printed for public conſideration. Thus it appears there was not a ſingle day between the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reading. The 25th of March, it was read a third time, and ordered to be engroſſed. The firſt of April it was enacted into a law. All this was in the ſame ſeſſion. In this mode was the charter obtained. Time for conſideration was not allowed to the public, the bill was gone through with ſuch precipitancy. Yet the late houſe is charged with hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke through the procraſtinating forms, although the repealing act lay over from the winter ſeſſions to the fall, a period of four or five months. At the fall ſeſſions, counſel was heard for and againſt it. The committee could not be charged with having deceived the houſe: for after they had made the report, the matter was fairly argued, as well by the members, as by the counſel.—After all this delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—all theſe lights thrown upon the ſubject—it may be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:019884_0065_0FAD418562786AC8"/>
ſafely ſaid, that no buſineſs ever was more fairly argued—Why, then, are we charged with haſty meaſures?</p>
               <p>The bank does not help the farmer—nor promote the agriculture of the ſtate. If the farmer, who is the ſtrength of the country, be cut off from procuring ſupplies of money, to enable him to improve his lands, the ſtate muſt languiſh. A loan office is the only ſure means of encouraging agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and enabling the farmer to bring his produce to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. This cannot be eſtabliſhed by hard money, for that is in the vaults of the bank: and while the ſtockholders can derive 16 per cent from their money, no hopes remain of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing at legal intereſt. The laws have guarded againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion—but theſe laws are evaded by the bank. Shall we ſupport this engine of deſtruction, and enable a few men to take advantage of their wealth, and to ſtop diſcounts when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleaſe, in times of the greateſt diſtreſs?</p>
               <p>The queſtion at preſent is, whether the ſtate ſhall give way to the bank, or the bank give way to the ſtate? For the bank is ſet up as a party in the ſtate—It has created great diſturbance. How often has it been before the houſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, taking up the public time, and occaſioning a waſte of the public money? In 1782—in 1784—in 1785—at our laſt ſeſſions, and now again. What is the deſign in all this? Is it the good of the ſtate? Can we believe, if the bank had a tendency to promote the intereſt of the people, that the ſtate would oppoſe it? If the gentlemen can ſhew that it has ſuch a tendency, I ſhall be happy to join in ſupport of it.</p>
               <p>I am not ſurpriſed the gentlemen are ſo ſolicitous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure another charter for the bank. While it has no char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their private circumſtances are liable to account for any deficiencies: and how do we know whether they can ſettle their accounts, and have money enough to pay off their notes? Cannot it go on as a private bank? How many banks in Europe are carried on in that manner? I hope we will not give a monopoly of banking to thoſe gentlemen. It has been denied to be a monopoly.—But when other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wiſhed to eſtabliſh a ſecond bank, the preſident and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the preſent bank had ſufficient influence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from getting a charter. Indeed one of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen from the city acknowledged that it had been a mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly during the war.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I beg leave to explain. I did not ſay that the bank was a monopoly during the war. I only ſaid that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:019884_0066_0FAD41868BE9F8F8"/>
if the charge of monopoly ever had any appearance of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it was during that period.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill. I believe it will not be denied to be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly, if it has ſufficient influence to make head againſt all attempts at eſtabliſhing a ſimilar inſtitution. The gentleman has ſaid, that if we do not repeal the law taking away the charter of the bank, an appeal will be made to the courts of juſtice. I ſhould have been better pleaſed that this mode had been tried firſt, and that the matter had not been bro't before this houſe.</p>
               <p>One part of the report ſtates, that the memorialiſts may be conſtrued to ſpeak the ſenſe of Pennſylvania. How many are there of them? Two thouſand nine hundred and forty ſeven—of whom 670 are from Lancaſter county: although we may ſafely ſay, it is probable that not 60 are acquainted with the nature of banks, and the various matters contained in thoſe memorials, and the charges they convey againſt the late houſe and committee. There were one thouſand petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners from Lancaſter againſt the erection of the ſhambles in High-ſtreet. This, therefore, as has been already ſtated, only proves the activity of the perſons intereſted in the bank, in procuring ſigners to the memorials. With the ſame acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, I have no doubt, twenty or thirty thouſand petitioners might be procured to expunge the bank. Therefore it is wrong to ſay they ſpeak the ſenſe of the community.</p>
               <p>The preſident and directors of the bank, have not only a ſeparate intereſt from the ſtate—but alſo an oppoſite intereſt. Their advantage lies in depreciating the paper money of the ſtate—for the more of that is ſuppored, the leſs of theirs they can iſſue. Upon every conſideration, therefore, the bank is incompatible with the welfare of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>One gentleman has ſaid that the ſtate has done violence to the bank—and that it has ſuffered more than the houſe can remedy, even by reſtoring the charter. The houſe did not take away any of their property—the charter was not their property. It was a piece of ſealed writing, which the houſe might burn when they pleaſed. Their property is as ſafe as it was.</p>
               <p>The late houſe of aſſembly did not take away the charter of the bank for any crime—nor did they charge the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and directors with having forfeited it. They took up the conſideration of the matter upon general principles—they found it would be impoſſible to eſtabliſh ſtate paper money while the charter remained. Why then ſhould they deſtroy
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:019884_0067_0FAD4186CE2BBB38"/>
the credit of that, which was the only effectual mode that had been diſcovered for relieving the ſuffering creditors? But a gentleman lately propoſed to have all the paper money called in, in order to make way for the bank.</p>
               <p>If charters cannot be repealed, becauſe they are contracts, it affords a great invitation to fraud. A gentleman in enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating the powers of the houſe of aſſembly from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, did not read the whole ſentence—at the concluſion of which it is ſtated that they ſhall poſſeſs all the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary powers of a legiſlature. Charters of public corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when not found agreeable to the welfare of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may be taken away by the legiſlature. Two inſtances of the ſort have occurred in this ſtate. One was the charter of the college of Pennſylvania, and the other the charter of the proprietaries.</p>
               <p>Mr. Finlay. This queſtion, which has ſo long engaged the attention of the houſe, and on the merits of which, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men eminent for diſcernment, have exerciſed ſo much abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is of ſuch importance in itſelf, and involves in it ſuch extenſive conſequences, as to juſtify my requeſting the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe to a few obſervations which I propoſe to offer reſpecting it.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid reſpecting the extraordinary reaſoning in the preamble of the report under debate, which bears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of the manner in which diſappointed avarice chagrins an intereſted mind. I ſhall obſerve, that though the reaſoning in the report of the committee of the late houſe, recommending the paſſing a law to repeal the charter of the bank, were inſufficient or miſtaken, yet if ſufficient reaſons do now exiſt in the nature of the caſe, to ſupport the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof, it ought not to be repealed. This propoſition is ſupported by legiſlative and judicial examples. In appeals from the lower to the higher courts, the queſtion is not—<q>what were the reaſons the lower courts aſſigned for their deciſion?</q> but "whether was the deciſion juſt or not?"—Many examples might be produced, of reports of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and preambles of laws, not expreſſing the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reaſons of the reſpective reſolutions or laws. To try all laws by the reaſons aſſigned in their preambles, would be an endleſs taſk. Therefore, not to dwell on this, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove, that the legiſlature had a power to repeal the charter of the bank; and that ſufficient reaſons did exiſt, to juſtify the expediency of their doing it.</p>
               <p>All governments being inſtituted for the good of the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:019884_0068_0FAD4187891CB7C8"/>
to which they belong, the ſupreme legiſlative power of every community neceſſarily poſſeſſes a power of repealing every law inimical to the public ſafety. But the government of Pennſylvania being a democracy, the bank is inconſiſtent with the bill of rights thereof, which ſays, that government is not inſtituted for the emolument of any man, family, or ſet of men. Therefore, this inſtitution being a monopoly, and having a natural tendency, by affording the means, to promote the ſpirit of monopolizing, is inconſiſtent with not only the frame but the ſpirit of our government. If the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature may mortgage, or, in other words, charter away portions of either the privileges or powers of the ſtate—if they may incorporate bodies for the ſole purpoſes of gain, with the power of making bye-laws, and of enjoying an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument of privilege, profit, influence, or power,—and cannot diſannul their own deed, and reſtore to the citizens their right of equal protection, power, privilege, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,—the conſequence is, that ſome fooliſh and wanton aſſembly may parcel out the commonwealth into little ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracies, and ſo overturn the nature of our government without remedy.</p>
               <p>This inſtitution is inconſiſtent with our laws—our habits—our manners.—Our laws and habits countenance long credits, and afford ſlow methods for recovering debts. They ſubject our real eſtates to alienation, and to be ſold for debts. They divide our eſtates, both real and perſonal, more equally among our heirs, than the laws or habits of any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try I know of. We are too unequal in wealth to render a perfect democracy ſuitable to our circumſtances: yet we are ſo equal in wealth, power, &amp;c. that we have no counterpoiſe ſufficient to check or control an inſtitution of ſuch vaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and magnitude. We have no kingly prerogative—no wealthy companies of merchants incorporated—no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary nobles, with vaſtly great eſtates and numerous depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents—no feudal laws to ſupport family dignity, by keeping landed eſtates undivided. What ſecurity, then, can we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ourſelves againſt the eventual influence of ſuch wealth, conducted under the direction of ſuch a boundleſs charter?</p>
               <p>This charter was for a perpetuity—not ſubject to change—In this it was contrary to our conſtitution, which is liable to change every ſeven years.</p>
               <p>But let us take a more diſtinct view of the nature of this inſtitution, and of human nature itſelf. Enormous wealth,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:019884_0069_0FAD418856F7D648"/>
poſſeſſed by individuals, has always had its influence and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in free ſtates. Thus, even in Rome, where patriotiſm ſeems to have pervaded every mind, and all her meaſures to have been conducted with republican vigour, yet even there, the patricians always had their clients—their dependents—by the aſſiſtance of whom they often convulſed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and diſtracted the operations of the ſtate, and finally overturned the government itſelf. But the Romans had no chartered inſtitutions for the ſole purpoſes of gain. They chartered no banks.</p>
               <p>Wealth in many hands operates as many checks: for in numberleſs inſtances, one wealthy man has a control over another. Every man in the diſpoſal of his own wealth, will act upon his own principles. His virtue, his honour, his ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, and generoſity, will influence his diſpoſals and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and he is in a ſtate of perſonal reſponſibility. But when ſuch an unlimited inſtitution is erected with ſuch a capital, for the ſole purpoſe of increaſing wealth, it muſt operate according to its principle; and being in the hands of many, having only one point in view, and being put in truſt, the perſonal reſponſibility ariſing from the principles of honour, generoſity, &amp;c. can have no place. The ſpecial temper of the inſtitution pervades all its operations: and thus, like a ſnow ball perpetually rolled, it muſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe its dimenſions and influence.</p>
               <p>This inſtitution having no principle but that of avarice, which dries and ſhrivels up all the manly—all the generous feelings of the human ſoul, will never be varied in its object: and, if continued, will accompliſh its end, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to engroſs all the wealth, power, and influence of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The human ſoul is affected by wealth, in almoſt all its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. It is affected by its preſent intereſt, by its expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by its fears. And muſt not, therefore, every thinking man ſee what advantage this inſtitution has on the human feelings, above that of wealth held by many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals? If our wealth is leſs equal than our kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems to require—and if agrarian laws are unjuſt in our preſent ſituation, how abſurd muſt it be for government to lend its ſpecial aid in ſo partial a manner, to wealth, to give it that additional force and ſpring, which it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from an almoſt unlimited charter? Can any gentleman avoid ſeeing this to be eventually and effectually overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our government? Democracy muſt fall before it. Wealth is its foundation, and gain its object and deſign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:019884_0070_0FAD418909162818"/>
Thus it appears that this inſtitution is inconſiſtent with our general laws, cuſtoms, and circumſtances, and even with the nature of our government. The proofs are not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on facts of doubtful credibility. They are drawn from the nature of things: and the principles of nature being juſtly ſtated, this kind of arguments are concluſive. They carry their evidence with them, with a certainty like that of the ſparks flying upwards, or the waters running to the ſea.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſame principles, it is evident that in the preſent ſtate of our commerce, the bank facilitates both public and private ruin. The balance of trade being conſtantly againſt us, commerce with us has contracted a different meaning from what it has in Europe. There it is founded on the produce and manufactures of the reſpective countries, for which the merchant finds a foreign market, and in lieu of which he brings a ſuitable return. From the exceſs of the exports, the nation is enriched. With us it may, with more propriety, be ſtyled importation than commerce: and this importation, carried on to too great a degree before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, is greatly facilitated by the bank.</p>
               <p>A worthy gentleman from the city [mr. Morris] has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it as his opinion, that precedents from Ireland are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, as that country does not boaſt of its commerce or wealth, and is under Engliſh trammels. He ſays it is a good country to import people, linen, and potatoes from—but not commercial precedents. I do not pretend to much commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial knowledge. I have indeed ſome general knowledge; and am of opinion, if we had ſuch linen and cambric ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures as the Iriſh—if we exported ſo much beef, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pork—and manufactured ſo much woollens as they do—we ſhould be poſſeſſed of the immediate means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. But, being under Britiſh trammels, her people, who ought to be employed at home, are obliged to emigrate in abundance. If they are eſteemed an article of commerce, that branch of her trade has been much to our advantage.</p>
               <p>But as for us, though we have the foundations of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, we have not, nor can we ſoon have the means of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it on extenſively to advantage. We export flour, which, through the ſcarcity of labourers, has failed in the quantity. We export flaxſeed, which, through the oldneſs of the lands contiguous to market, and the change of ſeaſons, has alſo failed greatly, ſo as to be ſcarcely worth mentioning. We export lumber, which has failed in like manner, and muſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:019884_0071_0FAD4189EEE825F0"/>
continue to fail, in proportion as our woodland is cleared. Is this a balance for our amazing importations, not only from Europe but both the Indies? From thoſe vaſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, the number of our dealing people was increaſed. The bank gave the means of purchaſing foreign cargoes—the acceſs was eaſy—but the credit ſhort.—The haſty day of payment approached—hence the numerous tribe of brokers aroſe. The involved debtor went from friend to friend for the aſſiſtance of credit—from broker to broker for coſtly ſupplies of caſh—until ruin overwhelmed him with confuſion and woe: and he who was, or appeared to be, a capital deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fell. Like a mighty oak in the woods, he cruſhed many by his fall. Thus of late, the cry of private ruin in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, has not only been heard by our ſiſter ſtates—but by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations. Thus hath the ſtate been drained of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was circulating within it, and the means of ſupporting the revenues and credit thereof been taken away: no doubt there has been a concurrence of other cauſes. The impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the unfortunate is often aſſigned as one cauſe: and no doubt it was: but experience forbids to ſet down the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate always as fools or knaves. Many who had fair and honeſt proſpects, or who aſſiſted with their credit thoſe who had, finding every uſual means of extricating themſelves cut off by the inundation of foreign goods, have, whilſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of honeſt principles and competent ſagacity, ſunk in the common ruin.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid of the merits of the bank in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the money from leaving the country. I know the export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of money is contrary to its intereſt. But the little arts of the directors, to detain it in the country, are contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as an argument, and ineffectual as a means. What are the methods by which they retain it? A gentleman [mr. Morris] has told us, that when a veſſel is up for England, the directors know thoſe who apply for diſcounts, in order to ſend the money away, as readily as a cat knows a mouſe, and that they refuſe them.—Are theſe the mighty means? Is this the boaſted ſecurity?</p>
               <p>I have already proved that the bank facilitates importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: conſequently it facilitates contracting debts abroad: and if the debts are facilitated, why clog the payment? Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the remittances could be made in an air balloon, and the freight ſaved. In Spain where they have the precious metals poured in from their ſettlements, and are manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of money—in order to prevent its being exported, ten
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019884_0072_0FAD418D26CAA618"/>
per cent. (if I am not miſtaken) is charged on the remittances to England: and a higher duty is charged on the remittances from the Havannah and New Orleans. Yet can any man of underſtanding ſay that the Spaniſh dominions are enriched by this? By no means. They are ſcarcer of money, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their uſes, than we are.</p>
               <p>The way for individuals or nations to get rich, is not to have artificial difficulties laid in the way of paying their debts; but to contract few of them. The debts muſt be paid: and the bank collects the money to a point, where it can be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier found in large ſums for exportation, than in any other manner: and thoſe little ſhifts, which depend on perſonal ſagacity or integrity, are fit only for a plauſible colouring for refuſing to ſupply thoſe who are not favourites; and the more effectually diſcover how well it is calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the monopolizing of trade. What ſecurity have we that its aſſiſtance will not be partially exerted for this purpoſe?</p>
               <p>This inſtitution is itſelf a monopoly—being incorporated a great trading company—and having a right to turn ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars into trade, if the preſident and directors pleaſe—or to lay out that amount upon land. So, by taking advantage of a ſcarcity of money, which they have it ſo much in their power to occaſion, they may become ſole lords of the ſoil. If they may monopolize trade—if they may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize the ſoil—why not the government too? Doubtleſs they may.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay whether or no the bank is a monopoly in the ſtrict legal ſenſe of the word. This is not to my purpoſe. But I ſay that it is, in its nature and principles, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon popular ſenſe, a monopoly: and being ſo in its nature, it muſt be ſo in its effects. This is a certain concluſion. I do not charge the directors or ſtock-holders perſonally with ſuch deſigns: but this being the nature of the inſtitution, it becomes the indiſpenſible duty of the directors to conduct it according to its natural principles.</p>
               <p>Great wealth ſeems, even with individuals, to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to monopolizing. It was the ſaying of a wiſe writer, when riches increaſe, they are increaſed that have them—increaſed in their appetite for riches, and in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to procure them.</p>
               <p>This inſtitution I believe to be inimical to the emiſſion and credit of paper money. Let us for a moment compare the ſtate paper with that of the bank, with reſpect to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:019884_0073_0FAD418DBAD2B740"/>
to this country. For this purpoſe, I beg leave to advert a little to the hiſtory of paper money. Its amazing uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Pennſylvania, before the revolution, is well known. But when the neceſſities of congreſs obliged tham to emit paper money, they were obliged to emit it in great quantities, and had not the power or means of appropriating ſufficient funds for its redemption. And to look back, I rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thoſe emiſſions ſerved us ſo well, than otherwiſe. Though the meaſure was then unavoidable, I muſt obſerve there is not ſufficient ſafety in one public body judging of the quantity of money to be emitted—and another, or rather many other public bodies having to judge of and appropriate the means of redeeming it. But there is more ſafety in one body being obliged to judge of the quantity—the uſes—the funds—and the manner of redemption.</p>
               <p>When this ſtate emitted the iſland ſtate money, as it was called, the funds were ſufficient, but not immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive; and there was abundance of paper money in circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Yet it ſtood its ground tolerably, until the vaſt ſum of 500,000l. was emitted upon funds uncertain in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not productive then, nor in a ſufficient degree yet. This ſunk the credit of the other with it; and became a valuable ſpeculation—perhaps to ſome of the planners of the emiſſion. The other reſumed its credit inſtantly, when the funds became productive. But having ſpoken largely on this ſubject in the laſt houſe, I ſhall ſay no further now—but obſerve that the laſt emiſſion has funds much more than ſufficient. Theſe funds are conſtantly productive: and the uſes which keep it in circulation, are abundant. Therefore it cannot fail of holding its credit—and has ſtood its ground againſt a very powerful oppoſition indeed. Though I do not ſay that any direct attack was made upon it by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of the bank—as I do not blame them for not receiving it—yet it was evidently oppoſed through the influence of that inſtitution. In the eighth general aſſembly, the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors wrote to the houſe, diſſuading them from the emiſſion they were about to make, giving their opinion that it would not do, and offering a loan. The prophecying its fate, by thoſe who were ſuppoſed to have the power to blaſt it, had the deſired effect; and the emiſſion was dropped. When the funding bill was going through the late houſe, could thoſe who were intereſted in, or dependent on, the bank, do more than they did, to prevent the emiſſion, and to diſcourage the people, already rendered ſuſpicious by former events?
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:019884_0074_0FAD418E6ECF9CB0"/>
Did not the friends of the bank, in that houſe, predict that it would be three or four for one, as ſoon as emitted? Did not the gentlemen of this houſe who are intereſted in the bank, endeavour at our laſt ſeſſion, to have it all called in? Have they not afterwards complained of its not purchaſing the neceſſaries of life? Did not one gentleman tell us it was from two and a half to five per cent. below par? I muſt anſwer, that inſtances of the kind have not ſtruck my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. I very lately changed a conſiderable ſum, and have ſeen others do the ſame, without aſking or being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any advance. There can be none who would aſk or give any advance, but ſuch as are intereſted in, or indebted to, the bank. At leaſt, in all my dealings in the city, none have heſitated to take it, but thoſe who told me they muſt have money for the bank. Conſidering theſe things, there is nothing wonderful in ſome inſtances of ſuch an advance being given. It is but the price of convenience. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen three pence given in Ireland for getting ſilver for a guinea: but the people there never thought the gold of leſs value on that account. Many ſuch inſtances might be produced.</p>
               <p>A gentleman from the city [mr. Morris] has mentioned the quick circulation of the paper as an argument againſt its credit. He ſays it returns to the treaſury almoſt as faſt as iſſued. I congratulate the ſtate of Pennſylvania upon the news, as a ſatisfactory evidence of returning confidence. It brightens our proſpects of proſperous days. The public creditor has been relieved by it. The moneyleſs farmer has with it paid his taxes, which had accumulated for years paſt. It has brought into circulation the little hard money that remained. Our treaſury is kept buſy receiving it, and as buſy paying it away. Who refuſes the paper money from us? None—for the comptroller general is kept employed almoſt night and day—people hurry him ſo that they may get it. Certainly the gentleman could not mean this as an argument againſt paper money.</p>
               <p>Much might be ſaid on the advantages of the loan office. But the principles of this inſtitution are ſo well underſtood, that I ſhould eſteem it an inſult to the good ſenſe of the houſe to enter on them.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have moſtly confined myſelf to principles, and the reaſon and nature of things: arguments of this kind being juſtly laid, I take to be moſt convincing: for every man knows things will operate according to their nature.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:019884_0075_0FAD41912923A978"/>
But I beg leave now to animadvert on certain arguments made uſe of by ſome of the reaſoners on the other ſide: for hitherto I have only touched on a few of them, in order to illuſtrate my ſubject. I would firſt obſerve that I took no notes at the time of the debate—as I did not then deſign to enter ſo largely on the ſubject. I ſhall therefore remark on but few of the gentlemen's arguments.</p>
               <p>A worthy gentleman from the city [mr. Fitzſimons] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that he is a ſtockholder in, and director of, the bank; and that there are ſeveral ſtockholders members of this houſe.—He juſtly obſerves, that this does not debar them from the conſtitutional right of canvaſſing for offices at elections—and advocating their own cauſe on the floor of this houſe. Doubtleſs the gentleman is right. For though the conſtitution excludes executive officers from ſeats in the legiſlature, leſt they ſhould influence it to make their ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more lucrative, or their duties more eaſy: yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention neglected to guard againſt men, who have procured peculiar privileges by obtaining partial laws in their own favour, for the ſole purpoſe of gain, advocating their own cauſe by the advantage of a ſeat in this houſe. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of the famous laws of Solon, which, though an excellent ſyſtem, neglected to provide any puniſhment for a perſon who ſhould murder his father or mother—doubtleſs not expecting ſuch a crime would ever be committed. And indeed I think the convention guarded ſo well againſt the legiſlature of this ſtate granting any kind of monopolies, or partial prerogatives, as cut off the probability of any ſuch thing happening in this ſtate: yet ſuch is the courſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that advantage has been taken of the embarraſſments and inexperience of the ſtate, and this very thing has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p>As to canvaſſing at elections, I apprehend it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nor honourable to canvaſs for a ſeat in the legiſlature, where the candidate has only in view to ſerve the public. But where he has a cauſe of his own to advocate, intereſt will dictate the propriety of canvaſſing for a ſeat. Indeed the emolument ariſing from it, would induce but few wiſe men to canvaſs for a ſeat in this houſe purely to ſerve the public: for few who know the importance of the ſervice, will think themſelves fit for it. We alſo allow to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that they have a right to advocate their own cauſe, on the floor of this houſe. But they will allow us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is their own cauſe they are advocating; and to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:019884_0076_0FAD41929F14A270"/>
give credit to their opinions, and to think of their votes accordingly. And here I call the attention of the houſe for a moment, to conſider the ſituation of the parties engaged in this argument: If the bank is a common good—diffuſing beneficial influences through the whole ſtate—increaſing the price of lands and produce—if we ſaw it to be uſeful to the commonwealth—would it not be our own intereſt to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it? Can this houſe ſuppoſe us wicked enough to deſtroy our own intereſt or the public's from mere envy? On the other hand, this houſe muſt obſerve, that however hurtful and dangerous it is to the general good, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on the other ſide are intereſted in ſupporting it: and if it were ſafe and beneficial, it would alſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> our intereſt to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>The ſame worthy gentleman has told us, that the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and amount of the bank paper is little underſtood. This I believe is perfectly true. But is this a reaſon that we ſhould grant a charter to the bank? Surely not. Shall the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pennſylvania enact a charter for an inſtitution they do not underſtand? Certainly every honeſt member on this floor, who does not fully underſtand the myſtery of banking, or who has a doubt upon his mind, of the ſafety or utility of ſuch an inſtitution, will vote againſt the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>Another worthy gentleman [mr. Morris] has told us, that it is his opinion, if the queſtion is to come before a court of juſtice, the judges, though their opinions might be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet on account of their characters as law officers, would condemn the repealing law, as a nullity. What! would the judges complement the bank by deciding contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only to their own ſentiments, but to law itſelf? If this be the caſe, it muſt be a very influencing inſtitution, and a very dangerous one indeed.</p>
               <p>The ſame worthy gentleman informs us, that if the bank is not continued, there will not, at ſome ſeaſons, be a ſhip loaded with flour, at the port of Philadelphia. But I aſk, how were they loaded before the war? how were they, or how are they, loaded at Baltimore and other ports? Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more exports more in proportion to its imports than Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia does: and this is worthy of our obſervation. But as I have detained the houſe longer than I deſigned, and as the gentleman who ſpoke laſt, diſcuſſed to advantage many arguments I had in view, I ſhall conclude by offering a few more general obſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:019884_0077_0FAD4193B3DB8340"/>
There is now no chartered bank exiſting: therefore the caſe is before us on original ground. The queſtion is not whether or no we will repeal a charter; but whether or no we will give one. Whether or no the laſt houſe aſſigned proper reaſons for what they did, is not our buſineſs: for we know they did no injuſtice to the bank. They took away none of the property. The holders have their money; therefore it was not like an agrarian law, as the gentleman alleged—They may ſtill keep a private bank. And here I beg leave to remark, that as a private bank is all the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution admits of, ſo it would have the ſame advantages in trade, and more ſecurity to the people than a chartered bank. For, under the charter, the incorporated property was the only ſecurity to the public: therefore the ſtockhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who have the property of it, and draw the dividends from it, might be rolling in wealth, and the bank break and ruin thouſands. The bank might be robbed, or thrown into the Delaware, and the owners who profit by it, be ſafe as to their eſtates. None but men of wealth have money to ſpare to be bankers: and ſhall this houſe give a ſpecial law to enable monied people to increaſe their gain, without having either their perſons or eſtates upon the ſame level of reſponſibility as the other citizens? By no means: this houſe will not do it. If the legiſlature did ſo, it would give a legal ſanction to a ſnare of the greateſt danger.</p>
               <p>This is the only ſtate in the union ſaddled with a bank. Our ſiſter ſtates, ſenſible of the magnitude and danger of ſuch an inſtitution, have, as far as I am informed, refuſed to ſanction it. Maryland and New York, I know, have done ſo. They have ſeen the danger, and learned by our example. Let us for ſome time learn by theirs. Such an inſtitution might in time be formidable to the whole united ſtates.</p>
               <p>I chearfully acknowledge, however, the great merit of the worthy gentleman who has informed us that he laid the plan of the bank, and led it into operations. I acknowledge that the bank has been of great ſervice to the united ſtates—not in our darkeſt times—for theſe were in ſome meaſure over, when Cornwallis was taken—which was before the bank exiſted. But the ſervice was reciprocal. It was part of the French money, to the value of which the united ſtates became ſtockholders, that enabled the bank to open its operations: and if that inſtitution was, for a part of the next ſeaſon, of eſſential ſervice, it was but a ſuitable return: and the financier, for making ſo proper a uſe of it, deſerves
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:019884_0078_0FAD419453721A88"/>
and enjoys great credit. But the public are not indebted to this inſtitution—or, if they are, they will doubtleſs give that debt a preference to debts even much earlier contracted. Congreſs money did us eſſential ſervice in our darkeſt hours: ſhall it, therefore, be continued? No: it, became danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and conſequently ceaſed. The army were no longer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and would have been dangerous; and were therefore diſcontinued. General Waſhington, with all the virtue and glory of his perſevering ſervices, reſigned his honours and authority, when he ceaſed to be neceſſary—though he did not ceaſe to be either uſeful or ſafe. If we muſt be ſaddled with this dangerous inſtitution for ever, becauſe of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer uſefulneſs and conveniency, ſurely Oliver Cromwell ſhould have been rewarded in England by the continuing his heirs to occupy the government, inſtead of being branded as a uſurper, and "damned to everlaſting ſame." By the ſame rule, deſpotic government, which is the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, ought always to be preferred and continued.</p>
               <p>One other obſervation occurs to me, which I have often thought of, and to which I yet requeſt the attention of the houſe. If a bank is ſupported in Philadelphia, it will give another kind of credit, and another kind of circulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to the city and its vicinity, than to the more remote parts of this extended ſtate: and the bank may increaſe the circulating medium to any quantity it pleaſes, which will occaſion an artificial increaſe in the prices of things, and the manner of living. It will gradually affect the intereſts, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and habits, with ſuch diſtinguiſhing peculiarities, as will occaſion ſooner or later a diſſolution or ſeparation of this ſtate. This would be a very undeſirable event: and yet the inſtituting a bank can ſcarcely fail producing it. Perhaps, when this event takes place, this city and a ſmall territory around it, may, like Hamburgh and Dantzick, not only promote monopolies, but have its foundation placed in the principles of monopoly and ariſtocracy. For the common intereſt of Pennſylvania, for the honour and advantage of human nature, I wiſh ſuch events may be at a great diſtance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons. The gentleman has mis-ſtated ſome of the obſervations I made. I did not ſay I had canvaſſed for my own ſeat: that is not the truth. Whether my ſeat is more beneficial to me, than that gentleman's to him, I leave <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Lollar. I beg to detain the houſe a few minutes. A
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019884_0079_0FAD419528F5FE10"/>
gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] has been a little facetious in his remarks on ſome of the arguments I made uſe of on Wedneſday. I confeſs his ſuperior knowledge, and do not pretend to oppoſe mine to his. However, when a matter amounts to a ſelf-evident propoſition, I think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf qualified to form an opinion on it. I ſaid that the bank facilitated commerce—which, in the preſent ſtate of our trade was againſt it, as it enabled the Britiſh creditor to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off caſh for his goods, and ſaddle the merchant here with the payment, in the haſty manner preſcribed by the bank. from this he drew an inference, that I was oppoſed to the payment of our debts—which is by no means the caſe. With reſpect to partiality or favouritiſm, I did not charge the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors with it—I only read part of the petition from Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter county, preſented to the late houſe againſt the bank, to evince how much was in their power. I ſaid that under the old government, they had no idea of a bank. To this the gentleman anſwers, by telling us he, at that time, had one in contemplation. I do not doubt the fertility of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's imagination. He is certainly competent to the forming that or any ſimilar plan: and probably the preſent bank is the very one he had then in view.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to call in queſtion the uſefulneſs of the bank during the war. The officers and ſoldiers of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were likewiſe uſeful during the war: but would we infer from thence that they ſhould be ſtill kept up? The profits of the bank have well paid for its ſervices. Our officers and ſoldiers have been diſmiſſed with a commutation of pay for five years.</p>
               <p>The gentleman tells us, that if the legiſlature were to grant a monopoly of particular branches of our trade to any ſet of men, the laws granting ſuch monopoly, would be void in themſelves; and ſeems to think that the law annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the charter of the bank, is a nullity—If that be the caſe, the incorporating law was equally a nullity.</p>
               <p>Another member from the city tells us, he has had the honour of being a director of the bank ſince its firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. He might have added, that ſo he would remain during life, if the preſent mode of voting according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, continued. In the bank of England, (if I am rightly informed) every perſon poſſeſſed of a ſhare of 500l. has a vote; and thoſe poſſeſſed of a number of ſhares, no more.</p>
               <p>When another bank was attempted to be eſtabliſhed in this city, the preſident and directors, by lowering their
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:019884_0080_0FAD4195D3293660"/>
terms, drew it into their vortex: and thus defeated the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>The bank is not compatible with our conſtitution, which does not admit of granting peculiar privileges to any body of men.</p>
               <p>On motion ordered that the further conſideration of the report be poſtponed.</p>
               <p>Adjourned till three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>RESUMED the conſideration of the report, &amp;c. Mr. R. Morris. The gentlemen from the country, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſhort adjournments, make this a hard ſervice. They ſcarcely allow us time to take a comfortable dinner and glaſs of wine, before we are obliged to return to the charge: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though they are impatient to return home, they ſhould allow us time to conſider and digeſt the arguments uſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this floor. It would be but decent to do ſo. I ſhall now endeavour to follow and diſcuſs the arguments of thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have ſpoken againſt the bank in the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: many of them I conſider as totally unneceſſary; and ſuch I mean to paſs by unnoticed.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Cumberland began his oration by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that he ſtill retained his own opinion; and ſhould continue to do ſo, until he heard better reaſons than thoſe yet offered. I never heard any declaration from that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's lips, which obtained more credit with me than this. I do ſincerely believe, that he does and will retain his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Even were an angel from heaven ſent with proper ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to convince him of his error, it would make no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration with him. I did not—I could not entertain the leaſt expectation that my colleagues or myſelf ſhould be able to produce any effect upon ſo predetermined a mind as his.</p>
               <p>This gentleman went into a diſcuſſion of the report now before us, in which I do not mean to follow him. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee who brought in that report, have juſtified it: and I have already given it all the ſupport which to me appears ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>He has admitted that the committee of the late houſe made no enquiries reſpecting the bank, although they were directed to do ſo: and ſeems to inſiſt that ſuch enquiries were unneceſſary, becauſe the popular opinions, he ſays, were againſt the bank. But where did he collect the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:019884_0081_0FAD419692485028"/>
opinions? How were ſuch opinions communicated? Had he, indeed, ſaid that the opinion of a party was againſt it, he would have ſaid right. But was the popular opinion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by 1199 petitioners, even when oppoſed by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 600 remonſtrants? According to the doctrine of another gentleman on his ſide of the queſtion, near 3000 petitioners (unoppoſed) do not at this time convey the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinion. But even if we ſuppoſe the late houſe to have been poſſeſſed of the popular opinion, I deny that this was proper ground, on which to found legiſlative acts: nor can it warrant or juſtify the proceedings of the late aſſembly with regard to the bank. Popular opinions originate with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals: falſe appearances are frequently given by thoſe who have ſecret deſigns: and men for the moſt part take them on truſt. Specious arguments and groundleſs aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions take place of reaſon; and run away with what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led popular opinions. The conduct of an aſſembly founded upon ſuch opinions, will not ſupport itſelf. If our laws are to be enacted in conformity with popular opinions, they muſt be altered as ſuch opinions change, which generally happens every two or three months: for opinions, taken up haſtily, and propagated for party purpoſes, cannot hold long. If, indeed, a popular opinion appears to have reaſon and juſtice for its baſis, then it is well to make it the ground of our proceedings. But who is to judge? The repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the people: and when popular opinions run counter to reaſon, they ſhould counteract their influence, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be wrong, and not paſs acts in compliance with them.</p>
               <p>The gentleman complains, that the committee of the late houſe have been cenſured for not calling at the bank—laying great ſtreſs upon—"calling at." If that committee thought it inconſiſtent with their dignity to call at the bank, they might have obtained the neceſſary information without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there. The preſident and directors would have waited upon that committee as readily as they have done on the committee of this houſe; and would have anſwered ſuch queſtions as they might have thought proper to put to them. But he aſks, "of what uſe would it have been, to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry at the bank? Would the preſident and directors have made anſwer to criminate themſelves? Would they have told us that the inſtitution was dangerous to the welfare of the ſtate?" To this I anſwer, that had proper queſtions been aſked, proper anſwers might have been obtained: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:019884_0082_0FAD41975D3B17E0"/>
the preſident and directors would not criminate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet we know, that, in the examination of witneſſes, truth is frequently diſcovered, even when endeavours are made to conceal it. But, in this caſe, there could have been no cauſe of concealment.</p>
               <p>I have mentioned in the courſe of this debate, that had the committee called upon me, I ſhould have given them, (and upon oath if required) the ſame information reſpecting the ſervices derived by the united ſtates from the bank, as I have had the honour to relate to this houſe. The gentleman aſks, why apply to me, who would have given the ſame kind of anſwers as the preſident and directors? Let us examine the force of this reaſoning. I am no otherwiſe intereſted in the bank, than as a ſtockholder; and my bank ſtock is more eaſily diſpoſed of, or parted with, than any other of my property, except caſh. Suppoſe, then, that inclination, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or any other circumſtance, ſhould happen to induce me to ſell my ſtock, from that moment I ceaſe to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately or perſonally intereſted in that inſtitution. But this is not the caſe with me as a member of the community. My landed eſtate—my family—and likewiſe the intereſt I hold in common with other citizens—muſt attach me too ſtrongly to the general welfare of the ſtate, to admit of a poſſibility that I ſhould engage in the ſupport of an inſtitution incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the public ſafety. Should I ſell my ſtock, the purchaſer becomes intereſted in the ſupport of the inſtitution, inſtead of my being ſo: and in that caſe, I ſhould be no otherwiſe concerned in its ſupport, than as a citizen believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be of general benefit: and as ſuch I am perſuaded that I ſhould as ſolicitous as I am at preſent. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men oppoſed to the bank conſtantly hold out the idea, that the perſons intereſted in it, are always the ſame—and that it is a monopoly confined to a few. Now it is certain, that on the contrary, the property in bank ſtock is conſtantly changing hands. Where, then, is this permanent intereſt that ſhould induce us to ſacrifice the good of the country to the good of that eſtabliſhment? The market is conſtantly open for the ſale and purchaſe of this bank ſtock: and if the gentlemen in oppoſition ſeriouſly believe in the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they ſay are derived from holding that ſtock, why do they not inveſt ſome part of their property in it—for property they have—and there are always ſhares to be ſold?</p>
               <p>The holders of that ſtock differ as widely, I preſume, in their political principles, views, purſuits and deſires, as the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:019884_0083_0FAD41980A555708"/>
holders of lands, houſes, or other property. Theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may, when they pleaſe, be of the number. How, then, is this cry of monopoly ſupported? My information is not to be truſted, becauſe I am intereſted in the bank: but ſurely I am more deeply intereſted in the ſtate—and that in a way too that it is hardly poſſible for me to detach myſelf from it, were I ſo inclined. But very different is my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reſpect to the bank. I am as deeply concerned to obtain good laws, and to enforce the due execution of them, as any gentleman in this houſe: and I hope, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſinuation made, that it will never be ſuppoſed I would ſacrifice the intereſt and welfare of the ſtate to any intereſt I can poſſibly hold in the bank.</p>
               <p>Such of the members of this houſe, as are diſpoſed to give a fair and candid diſcuſſion to the arguments uſed in this debate, will ſee clearly that the bank is neither danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to, nor incompatible with, the welfare of the ſtate: and theſe were the aſſumed principles upon which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing law was founded. If that aſſumption was taken up lightly and upon falſe grounds, as my reaſoning tends to prove, I hope gentlemen will give that reaſoning its juſt weight: for I cannot ſee why it ſhould loſe its force, on the ſuppoſition of my being intereſted in the event. Let the arguments uſed, be conſidered, not as coming from parties intereſted, but abſtractedly as to their force and ſolidity.</p>
               <p>The gentleman tells us, that the bank iſſues paper on the credit of the money in its vaults—and that its diſcounts being confined to forty-five days, the farmer can derive no benefit from ſuch limited loans. If the ſtate will depoſit hard money in the hands of the treaſurer, for the purpoſe of exchanging it on demand for the paper they may iſſue on the credit of ſuch depoſits, no doubt can be entertained but the ſtate paper, under ſuch circumſtances, will have full credit.</p>
               <p>In the notes which I have taken of the ſpeeches of my opponents, I ſo frequently meet with paper money—paper money—paper money—that it will be impracticable for me to follow them throughout on that topic, and ſpeak to it as often as they have done. I find, however, this is the great ſore; and cannot help expreſſing my aſtoniſhment at this conſtant cry for paper money by the country gentlemen, when it is notorious that they will not ſell the produce of their farms for it. No merchant, with ever ſo much paper money at command, can purchaſe the produce of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:019884_0084_0FAD4198E076A370"/>
for exportation. Therefore I cannot aſcribe this conſtant clamour about paper money to any other cauſe than a deſire to pay debts with leſs than their juſt amount, or to purchaſe lands at leſs than their value. I inſiſt that there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for paper money. No induſtrious man, in his individual capacity, can feel a want of it: and wherever it is emitted, it will be more likely to produce public miſchief than public good. This queſtion of paper money has been agitated in ſeveral of the ſtates; and been rejected by Maſſachuſetts, Rhode Iſland, New Jerſey, and Maryland: it is now pending in New York, where it is ſaid it will alſo be rejected. I think I may ſafely ſay that this cry for paper money is not a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cry, whilſt thoſe who aſk it, refuſe to give it currency, by refuſing to part with their produce for it. Yet theſe ſame patriots are conſtantly reproaching the bank as the cauſe of that want of credit, which themſelves occaſion to the paper money.</p>
               <p>The gentleman complained that the members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the late houſe were called upon to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is true, they ſtand charged with not having done their duty: but they are at liberty to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the charge, if they can, or to let it alone. He ſaid alſo that it is indecent to inveſtigate the proceedings of a former houſe of aſſembly. But if he examines the journals, he will find precedents; and ſee that other houſes have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed the conduct of their predeceſſors, and even that he has himſelf been an active agent therein. He muſt not expect to eſcape ſcrutiny; nor muſt this houſe. Thoſe amongſt us, who may be returned to occupy thoſe ſeats next year, may be called upon to juſtify the conduct of this houſe, or of themſelves: for my part, I hope to retire, and remain a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate citizen, which ſuits both my inclination and affairs much better than to be in public life, for which I do not find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very well qualified; and am, therefore, inclined to leave my place to thoſe that are. But ſo long as I act a part in public life, ſo long I expect my conduct to be examined: and however diſagreeable this may be to ſome gentlemen, there is no remedy but to bear it patiently.</p>
               <p>All the gentlemen who have ſpoken againſt the bank, have plumed themſelves much upon a ſuppoſition that the learned counſel who pleaded the cauſe of that inſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late aſſembly, had conceded this point, that when the balance of trade is againſt a country, a bank is injurious to that country. I am well acquainted with that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:019884_0085_0FAD419989404940"/>
extenſive abilities, and ſhall ever acknowledge them—but with all deference, I ſhall venture to ſay, that if he made ſuch a conceſſion, he was not authoriſed either by his employers, or by the fact. But was ſuch a conceſſion made? examine the whole of his reaſoning on that point, he, I am authoriſed to ſay, conſiders it differently. Such a conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was neither intended nor meant to be made by him. The preſent ſtate of our trade, when the balance is againſt us, may be, and is extremely injurious to the operations of the bank—not the bank injurious to trade or the country: and it is that which the learned counſel had in view, if I am not much miſtaken.</p>
               <p>The balance of trade is much ſpoken of in this debate: but I doubt if it be a ſubject well underſtood. Since the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the war, the balance of trade has been againſt us, and ſtill continues to be ſo. The cauſe I have already ſtated impart, when I mentioned that the ſanguine expectations which foreigners formed of reaping immenſe profits by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to this country, had cauſed ſuch vaſt importations of manufactures, as will require time to enable us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſum for which they were ſold to our citizens.</p>
               <p>The evils conſequent to ſuch immenſe importations, are at an end. The firſt adventurers have paid ſo dearly for their raſh undertakings, and ſo many have been ruined, that this adventurous ſpirit is cured. Our own importers have been involved in the general calamity. Each imported goods agreeably to what he thought the wants of the country: and having ſold them to ſhopkeepers and others, who, from the then ſtate of cultivation of the country, and conſequent deficiency of produce, were unable to pay, they are diſabled from making remittances: and for want of thoſe remittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their credit, if not totally loſt, is greatly injured in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; ſo that it will not ſpeedily be in their power to renew exceſſive importations. This loſs of credit may be conſidered in a two-ſold point of view—either as a misfortune, or as of ſervice to the country in general—which it will prove, is in the womb of time to ſhew: but I am of opinion, that wiſe laws, calculated to eſtabliſh punctuality in our dealings, may turn the preſent loſs of credit to future advantage. The people are falling into their former habits of induſtry and frugality. We may, therefore, reaſonably expect that agriculture will flouriſh, and the ſtate of cultivation in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica ſurpaſs what was its moſt flouriſhing condition previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the revolution. The balance of trade will then be
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:019884_0086_0FAD419C482A2238"/>
turned in our favour: and ſpecie will return as faſt as it has lately been drained away. This ſituation of things is not very diſtant: and there is no occaſion to deſtroy the bank on account of the balance of trade on which it has no influence.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that ſo great an eſtate as that of the bank, in the hands of a few, muſt be dangerous. This is ſuppoſing the capital of ten millions of dollars to be completed; and that in that caſe, it muſt carry all before it: whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent capital does not amount to one million, which belongs to many, and not to a few. And the ſtock cannot be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated, ſo as to be injurious, as the gentlemen aſſert, and ſtill be confined to the hands of a few perſons: for it can only accumulate by increaſing the number of ſtockholders. I ſhould not have touched upon this, but to ſhew the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their arguments.</p>
               <p>The member from Cumberland complains, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly which granted the charter, did not know the bye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws and regulations previous to making the grant. True, they did not: and they muſt have been witches, indeed, to have known them, for I believe they were not then formed: but any thing will ſerve as a charge againſt the bank: and this may do as well as any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>He aſks, <q>how can the farmers derive benefit from the bank? If they cannot obtain loans, they cannot raiſe produce; and they cannot have loans without a loan of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and without produce, we can have no trade; we cannot have a loan office without paper money; and we cannot get hard money to ſupply our neceſſities, for it is in the bank,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. Having already anſwered in the courſe of the debate, thoſe points which are urged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again and again, without regard to what has been ſaid in contradiction or explanation—I ſhall now only obſerve, that ſo long as men are made as they are at preſent, they will cultivate the earth, and raiſe produce: whether this is effected by the mere efforts of induſtry, or with the aid of loans, is immaterial: and while there is produce to ſpare, there will be commerce. Therefore let the landed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſt ſhake hands, for they do and muſt promote each others advantage.</p>
               <p>This member again aſſerts, that there is not hard money ſufficient for the eſtabliſhment of a loan office—it is in the bank. A ſtranger hearing this complaint ſo often repeated, would ſuppoſe that all the hard money in the ſtate was in the bank, and no poſſibility to come at it; that it was locked up
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:019884_0087_0FAD419D64B94A78"/>
there, and the people deprived of all uſe of it. Hundreds here preſent know the contrary. Whoever viſits the bank, will ſee ſome people conſtantly bringing in money, and ſome taking it away:—the bank being, with reſpect to the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſpecie, as the heart to the circulation of blood.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman ſays, that the bank has made ſixteen per cent. by its ſtock, or perhaps more—and that this muſt be done by extortion. He ſhould have been tender of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this charge without being poſſeſſed of proofs to ſupport it. If he can prove it, I ſhall not offer another word in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill. I did not ſay it was by extortion.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I ſhall not inſiſt upon the matter, but ſhall take the gentleman's own explanation. I have already ſaid, and I am warranted in aſſerting it, that the profits of the bank do not exceed 8 per cent. on an average. At the time the high dividends were made, the capital of the bank was ſmall, and the exigencies of the united ſtates required large advances and diſcounts—there were, beſides, numerous private calls for diſcounts which could not be refuſed: and the directors were compelled to diſcount more heavily in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their ſtock than they wiſhed. During that period, the united ſtates ſhared in thoſe dividends of 10 to 16 per cent. per annum, and paid only 6 per cent. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num for what they borrowed. Theſe high profits aroſe from accidental circumſtances, as I have mentioned, and, if need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, can prove—for I know the fact to be ſo.</p>
               <p>In my notes I meet with a jumble of aſſertions made by this member—but no attempt to anſwer the arguments I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered yeſterday. The gentleman aſks, ſhall the ſtate give way to the bank, or the bank to the ſtate? and adds, that the bank ſhould not interfere with the ſtate. By the ſtate I ſuppoſe he means a party in the ſtate. I wiſh the ſtate had not interfered with the bank—and the bank would never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the ſtate.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaks with ſeverity of the trouble the houſe have had with the bank—how frequently it has been before the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies—and the waſte of time and money thereby occaſioned. The buſineſs of a bank was firſt brought before the aſſembly of this ſtate, by recommendation of congreſs. It became a duty of the preſident and directors to apply to that houſe for a charter: they did ſo, and it was obtained. The ſecond time the preſident and directors of the bank applied to the legiſlature, was in oppoſition to an application made by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:019884_0088_0FAD419EEB4D1158"/>
perſons inimical to the exiſting bank, for an act to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh another. This attempt to eſtabliſh another bank, had for its object, the deſtruction of the bank of North America. The motives were neither founded in reaſon nor any deſire to promote the public welfare: and the preſident and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors conceived it a duty due to their conſtituents that they ſhould come before that aſſembly and endeavour to ſhew the pernicious tendency of that meaſure. The third time they appeared, was in oppoſition to certain petitions, praying to have their charter taken away. I ſuppoſe the gentleman thought them troubleſome at that time, as well as now: but their appearance was then unavoidable. The petitioners in this third inſtance, as well as in the ſecond, brought them before the houſe. And how is the bank brought before us now, for the fourth time? The ſtockholders had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to trouble us—they had determined on an appeal to another place: therefore the memorial of the preſident and directors preſented the laſt ſeſſion, is not the foundation of the preſent proceedings. But a large number of our fellow citizens have, by petition and memorial, called upon this houſe to repeal the law paſſed laſt year for annulling the charter of the bank. If the gentleman finds it troubleſome to receive ſuch petitions, let him ſay ſo; and not cry out againſt the preſident and directors as if they cauſed the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he complains of; for it is not ſo.</p>
               <p>The gentleman ſays, this houſe does not know the ſtate of the bank, or whether the preſident and directors are able to pay their notes. To which I anſwer, that this houſe has no right to know the ſtate of the bank. We are not aſked to truſt them, or to take their notes. Thoſe who entruſt their money in the bank, or take its notes, may aſk ſuch queſtions: but I believe they do not think it neceſſary: if they did, I am perſuaded that full and ample ſatisfaction would be given. He ſays, that the memorialiſts in favour of the bank, do not underſtand the nature of it. I believe they know at leaſt as much as the petitioners againſt it. The memorialiſts have pretty generally felt the benefits reſulting from it:—thoſe from the country, by finding a quick ſale and ready money for their produce, and receiving this ready money at the bank, ſaw that the inſtitution was beneficial and convenient: and ſo ſeeing, they can eaſily comprehend that the attempt to ſuppreſs it is injurious to the country.</p>
               <p>As to the number of ſigners to thoſe memorials or peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favor of the bank, this gentleman lays no ſtreſs on
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:019884_0089_0FAD419FAC5092F0"/>
them: for with proper exertions of induſtry, ſays he, twenty or thirty thouſand ſigners might be got to expunge the bank. In ſhort, this gentleman is conſtantly making aſſertions, which he cannot, or does not, ſupport with argument: and therefore I muſt meet him with an aſſertion in this point, which is, that with leſs exertion or induſtry can twenty or thirty thouſand ſigners be obtained in ſupport of the bank.</p>
               <p>Having now done with the member from Cumberland, I proceed to examine the arguments adduced by a gentleman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Finlay.</note> for whoſe underſtanding and abilities I have great reſpect; and who generally ſupports what he undertakes to defend, not only with ſtrength of reaſoning, but manages it with candour. I cannot, however, help obſerving, that he has deviated more from that candid line of conduct in this debate, than I have ever known him to do before.</p>
               <p>He ſays the preſent houſe is not to enquire into what has been done by the late one—but whether ſufficient reaſons now exiſt, to warrant a renewal of the charter; and adds, that in all governments there muſt be a power lodged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, which has a right to give and a right to take away.</p>
               <p>I agree that in all governments, ſupreme power muſt be lodged ſomewhere. In ours, the aſſembly has the ſole right of granting charters—but no right to take them away. The power there goes on a different principle: and ſo it does in all except arbitrary governments. In Great Britain, the ſovereign grants charters, but he cannot take them away: the laws of the land have pointed out another mode of annulling them. As well may it be ſaid that the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this ſtate, having exerciſed their ſovereign authority in the eſtabliſhment of a land office, from whence grants of lands are made to individuals, have a right to exerciſe the ſame ſovereign authority by deſtroying that office, and reſuming the lands again. This would be exerciſing the power to give, and the power to take away: but the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly has no right to ſuch power: if it has, God help us! There are certain forms by which an individual may loſe his lands; but never, I hope, by a wanton act of legiſlative power. A conſiderable part of its time has been ſpent by this houſe in granting charters of incorporation to religious ſocieties, which are aſked for the purpoſe of enabling them to receive donations and legacies, for the ſupport of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and payment of contingent charges, &amp;c. If thoſe charters may be revoked at will, I ſhould not be ſurpriſed to ſee it done a few years hence, on ſome pretence or other.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:019884_0090_0FAD41A070A1B8E8"/>
What then is to become of the capital they may have reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively accumulated by means of the donations and legacies received in the mean time? Probably a certain gentleman, who is fond of eſcheats, may, if then in power, urge that the ſtate ſhould be heir to the corporations which ſuffer political death. What a hopeful ſituation muſt the country be in, under ſuch ſyſtems as theſe! This gentleman ſays, let us examine our government—It is a democracy, and gives to all men equal rights: and agrarian laws may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the ſpirit of it: but we are not yet arrived at the period when ſuch laws would be proper. I truſt this member has better principles than to advocate ſo wicked a meaſure as a general diviſion of property</p>
               <p>Mr. Finlay. I beg leave to explain. What I ſaid, was, that agrarian laws would be unjuſt in our preſent ſituation.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. They are unjuſt in all caſes. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has remarked, "that wealth has a tendency to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract our manners and the principles of our government. Why then ſhould we give ſanction, ſays he, to an inſtitution founded on wealth? The ſtockholders muſt be men of wealth," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If wealth be ſo obnoxious, I aſk this gentleman why is he ſo eager in the purſuit of it? I frequently ſee him viſiting the land office: Thoſe viſits, I preſume, are not for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; although I do not doubt but they are for very proper purpoſes.—</p>
               <p>Mr. Finlay. I never took up a foot of land in my life. What buſineſs I have tranſacted at that office, has been to ſerve others.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I have heard that ſome of the country gentlemen, whilſt they are here attending in aſſembly, take up lands for their neighbours—and receive ſo much per cent. for tranſacting the buſineſs in the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Finlay. I muſt again ſet the gentleman right. I never received a farthing for ſuch buſineſs in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. The gentleman has told us they had no banks in Rome, during the days of the republic. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were a very different ſort of people from the Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanians. They did in their days what they thought right and proper for them to do: but their conduct in this reſpect can never ſerve as a rule for ours.</p>
               <p>"The object of the bank, he ſays, is gain—It is managed by themſelves, that is, by the ſtockholders—and they have it always in view to <hi>lift</hi> their gain—Equality is the darling
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019884_0091_0FAD41A11BA335E8"/>
of our government—and the conſtitution ſays government is inſtituted to preſerve equal privileges, &amp;c.—the bank, he ſays, cannot be common amongſt the citizens, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrary to the conſtitution—and being perpetual, it is contrary to our laws, habits, manners," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The charter of the bank being perpetual, is made uſe of as a ſtrong argument againſt it: but really I do not know why we are told that the conſtitution is liable to change eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeven years; and therefore it is inferred that the bank ſhould not have longer duration: although the charter is perpetual, the ſtockholders are and will be conſtantly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It has been ſaid that the charter is only a piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which the houſe may throw in the fire at pleaſure. I ſay it did not derive its value from its being written on paper, but from having received the ſanction of the legiſlature, which the houſe cannot ſo eaſily get rid of, as of the paper.</p>
               <p>How does it appear that the bank is not common to our citizens? All of them who have money and inclination, may buy ſhares, or depoſit there, at pleaſure. How does it appear that the bank is contrary to our laws, habits, manners and cuſtoms? While the law incorporating the bank had exiſtence, it certainly was conſiſtent with our laws: and continues ſo now, while conducted as a private bank, againſt which there is no law. It conſiſts well with our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and cuſtoms—for we find the people in the daily habit and cuſtom of lodging their money in the bank, and taking it away again at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This gentleman has ſpoken of the low ebb of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and ſays it is almoſt entirely confined to importation: and he has remarked upon what fell from me, relative to Ireland not being a commercial nation. I hope I did not wound the gentleman's feelings, nor thoſe of any other Iriſhman who heard me: it was far from my intention. I have been in Ireland—have experienced the hoſpitality of its inhabitants—and will venture to ſay, there are few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not Iriſh, who entertain greater eſteem for the country and people than I do: many of my intimacies are with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen from that country—ſome of whom are now my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and know the truth of what I ſay. All I meant was, that Ireland was not the moſt proper country in the world, to furniſh us with precedents in commercial matters. I am not now to learn, that ſhe exports large quantities of beef, butter and pork, and ſome manufactures: but ſtill her trade is confined. I hope ſhe has now laid the foundation for an
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:019884_0092_0FAD41A1DEA2E928"/>
enlarged commerce: and none will rejoice more than I ſhall, to ſee it extended to her greateſt advantage.</p>
               <p>The commerce of America is really, as the gentleman ſays, at a low ebb. It was on a much more reſpectable foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the late war, than it is at preſent. We then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported large quantities of wheat, flour, Indian corn, beef, butter, pork, iron, lumber, and other articles, from this port. The neighbouring provinces made the like exports. New-England exported fiſh, oil, whalebone, &amp;c. Maryland and Virginia, tobacco, proviſions, iron, lumber, &amp;c. North Carolina, naval ſtores; South Carolina and Georgia, rice, indigo, peltries, &amp;c. and every part of the continent had ſtaple commodities ſuited to the conſumption of foreign mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, which enabled us to pay for the things we had occaſion to import. Certain it is, that our exports are now much leſs than they were then, which is ſomewhat ſurpriſing, as every article of produce commands a good price, and nothing remains on hand to periſh for want of purchaſers. Whether this decreaſe of exports is the conſequence of leſs culture of the country, or of an increaſed home conſumption, I cannot decide. But this is certain, that the returning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of induſtry, with the daily progreſs of population, muſt give an amazing increaſe of produce for exportation: and I ſhould not be ſurpriſed, were this to happen much ſooner than even the moſt ſanguine expectations point out. If the poſition be true, that we are in a miſerable ſituation ſo long as our imports exceed our exports—I hope it will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſoon be experienced, that the reverſe of that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will place us in a flouriſhing ſtate. But that the bank facilitates thoſe importations, I have already denied; and have in ſome degree proved the contrary: and were it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, further proof might be adduced, although it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to prove a negative.</p>
               <p>The gentleman obſerves that after the eſtabliſhment of the bank, a great number of bankruptcies happened. But what is this to the bank? If he means to charge the bank as the cauſe of them, he ought to have ſhewn it, and to have named the inſtances. But he could do neither the one nor the other. Thoſe bankruptcies were occaſioned by very different circumſtances: particularly many of them were occaſioned by the parties having at the approach of peace, (which they did not foreſee or believe) imported or purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed large quantities of goods, which had coſt the advanced prices of war time, with the high rates of freight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance—ſo
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:019884_0093_0FAD41A292179780"/>
that from the large importations ſubſequent to the concluſion of peace, at a lower coſt, and vaſtly cheaper rates of freight and inſurance, they were diſabled from ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe goods but at an immenſe loſs. The vendues were crouded with them—thoſe who were diſtreſſed, being forced to ſell: and ſeveral who were able to ſtand the ſhock, have of thoſe dear-bought goods, many on hands to this day. Theſe are amongſt the circumſtances that brought on the greater part of thoſe bankruptcies which are alluded to. But is the bank to be charged as acceſſory thereto, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they happened about that time? Surely not: on the contrary, many were ſaved by the ſeaſonable aids which they derived from it.</p>
               <p>He ſays the arts of the directors of the bank, to prevent exportation of ſpecie, are contemptible. One of the charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made againſt the bank, is, that it has a direct tendency to baniſh ſpecie: In defending it againſt this charge, it is firſt ſhewn that the bank is intereſted in preventing the export of ſpecie; and then ſome of the means made uſe of, are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: upon this, the cry is changed: the gentleman loſes ſight of the firſt charge, and exclaims that the arts uſed, are contemptible. Why ſhould we not, ſays he, pay our debts, when we have contracted them? I agree that we ought and muſt pay our debts: and other means failing, the ſpecie muſt go for the purpoſe: and as we agree in this, I hope he will alſo agree to exculpate the bank from the charge of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpecie: for the bank neither encourages, gives aid, or facility to the contracting of thoſe debts: the bank gives neither credit nor ſecurity for debts contracted in Europe: and it is for the payment of thoſe debts that ſpecie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
               <p>Our importations, he ſays, are too extenſive. Agreed: but why bring this in as a charge againſt the bank? Has the bank engaged in commerce? Have the preſident and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors made any importations for the benefit of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? No. They are reſtrained by the charter from engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in commerce.</p>
               <p>The influence of the bank is again brought up. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, that ſuch influence, if it exiſts at all, can never extend beyond the city: and even there, the neceſſity of ſometimes refuſing diſcounts, creates more enemies, than granting them makes friends. Probably, the gentleman may think that I ſtand indebted to this kind of influence for my ſeat in this houſe; but I promiſe him, that if I had
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:019884_0094_0FAD41A3D1B81A30"/>
thought ſo, I would not have accepted it. I am of too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent a ſpirit to accept any ſtation or office that can be offered to me, unleſs I were convinced that the offer was made from public confidence in my being able to render the ſervice expected of me. This influence has never exiſted: neither my colleagues nor myſelf owe any thing to it.</p>
               <p>The gentleman has found a very ingenious argument to prove that our preſent paper money has the confidence of the people—that is, its quick circulation. But I attribute that quickneſs of circulation to a totally different cauſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the want of that confidence. It began to be iſſued in July laſt: and nearly the whole of the emiſſion had returned into the treaſury in October or November. It was puſhed from hand to hand, like the lighted ſtick in the play of "Jack's alive, and alive like to be," each holder fearing that it ſhould die in his hands: and it is laughable to hear this gentleman congratulate the ſtate on the returning confidence and virtue of the people, in receiving and paying this paper ſo quick. I muſt claim my ſhare of this merit: for I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, I have aſſiſted this quick circulation (ſo much admired by the worthy member) by parting with it as ſoon as poſſible after it came to my hands.</p>
               <p>The memorial of the committee of merchants againſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money, is charged as proof againſt the bank on that ſubject: but even ſuppoſing the whole committee of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to be ſtockholders, the ſtock they may reſpectively poſſeſs, does not exceed two, three, four or five ſhares, amounting to 800, 1200, 1600, or 2000 dollars: and is this the great matter that could induce them to oppoſe paper money, if there were no other conſiderations? This inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in bank ſtock is not permanent—but changeable: and their ſhares, if they hold any, could only influence during the time they poſſeſſed them. But in common charity, theſe gentlemen ought to ſuppoſe that ſo reſpectable a ſet of men have ſome other principle of conduct than merely ſelf-intereſt.</p>
               <p>The letter from the preſident of the bank, offering a loan of money to the ſtate, to prevent the neceſſity of iſſuing paper money, is now become a charge alſo, againſt the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution—becauſe it is an evidence of the directors being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to paper money. Now, in my opinion, this letter proves their merit: they thought paper money would be injurious to the ſtate; and therefore they offered to lend what was wanted, rather than it ſhould ſuſtain that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:019884_0095_0FAD41A79EF82960"/>
It may be ſaid they offered to lend what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather than the bank ſhould ſuſtain the injury which paper money would do it. Agreed: the intereſt of the ſtate and of the bank are the ſame in this, as they are in all other inſtances.</p>
               <p>The oppoſers of the bank, we are told, have no private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſerve by their oppoſition. But ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the bank and its ſupporters as one party, and themſelves as another, they are as much intereſted in the queſtion as their opponents. In fact, we have all one common intereſt in the welfare of our country: and although the defenders of the bank may have a ſmall and ſeparate intereſt in that inſtitution, I am confident there is not one of us that would urge the reſtoring of the charter, if we regarded it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the public welfare. The member from Weſtmoreland aſks, can it be ſuppoſed that the gentlemen on his ſide of the queſtion would oppoſe the bank from mere motives of envy? I believe that if they had been left fairly to themſelves, they would not have oppoſed it at all—or at leaſt that they would not now oppoſe it: but there are others at the bottom of this oppoſition—people who feel a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intereſt in the matter, whoſe ſuſpicions have been rouſed, by the dread of phantoms preſented to their imagination through the medium of envy and jealouſy. I could ſpeak plainer—but it is unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>This ſame gentleman draws a curious concluſion, from my having, as he ſtates it, formed an expectation that the jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, however oppoſed individually to the bank, would in the courts decide in its favour. His concluſion is, that I depend on bank influence to obtain ſuch a deciſion. But the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be decided in the courts, is not whether the bank is uſeful or injurious? It is, whether a charter once granted, can be annulled without proof or even pretence of forfeiture? This is a general queſtion, affecting all corporations: and however ſome of the judges might be inclined to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the bank, I ſtill reſt ſatisfied in my opinion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their deciſion, and in my belief that they will be too regardful of their law characters, which become an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for hiſtory, ever to ſubject the judgment ſeat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>In reply to my obſervations reſpecting the difficulty of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inward and purchaſing outward cargoes for ſhipping, he aſks, how were our ſhips loaded before the revolution? I anſwer, and the fact is well known, that delays frequently, I
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:019884_0096_0FAD41A8F53B1340"/>
may ſay conſtantly occurred for want of facilities in raiſing money, and the merchant had it not always in his power to purchaſe the produce brought to market by the farmer. The bank has remedied this inconvenience to both: deſtroy the bank, and I have no doubt the caſe will again become fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the moſt reſpectable traders.</p>
               <p>He has obſerved that this is the only ſtate <hi>ſaddled</hi> with a bank, altho' attempts to eſtabliſh them have not been wanting at Boſton, New York and Baltimore. But this obſervation will not ſerve the gentleman. At Boſton they have an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed bank, countenanced and incorporated by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At New-York they have a bank; a charter has not been obtained—but I have been informed that it was withheld, when applied for, only becauſe the perſons applying for it, were obnoxious to government. The attempt to eſtabliſh a bank at Baltimore, failed for want of ſubſcriptions to a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient amount of capital, and not for want of a charter. However, if the bank in this city be deſtroyed, I venture to pronounce, that banks will ſoon be eſtabliſhed both in New-York and Baltimore: and our meaſures will give great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to thoſe places, which are uſually conſidered as our dangerous rivals.</p>
               <p>I might follow this gentleman's obſervations ſtill further; but not having, on account of his abſence, been much uſed to his voice of late, and from his ſpeaking rather low at times, I found difficulty in taking notes of all he ſaid. I wiſh, however, that he had addreſſed our underſtanding, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to facts—inſtead of appealing to our feelings, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from what he calls the nature of things. In this he has ſhewn more addreſs and judgment than candour.</p>
               <p>Conſidering what has fallen from the member from Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery county [mr. Lollar] this morning, as a kind of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for what he ſaid on the firſt day, I ſhall paſs it over without remark, and proceed to make ſome general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
               <p>The report of the committee of laſt year contains matter of opinion only, and of opinions unſupported by fact. The bank is ſaid to be of no uſe to the farmer: I beg leave to aſk, whether it is not uſeful to the farmer to meet a ready ſale for his produce? If it be, I inſiſt that the bank, in its operations, is uſeful to the farmer. I have heretofore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the inconvenience ariſing from the want of a bank. When produce has been in plenty at market, and I been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly bent on the purchaſe of it, although poſſeſſed of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:019884_0097_0FAD41A94D3C90A8"/>
ſufficient, I could not command money for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and the farmer could not ſell upon credit: thus both have ſuffered diſtreſs, which would have been relieved by a bank. The exports in thoſe days were very conſiderable:—the houſe of which I was then a member, have ſhipped in one year from forty to fifty thouſand barrels of flour, and other articles in proportion. Such purchaſes required large ſums of money: and theſe were extremely difficult to raiſe.</p>
               <p>The quantity of produce for exportation, will now be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed every year: and the demand for money will alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. If the bank be deſtroyed, the merchants of theſe days, will experience the difficulties I have mentioned. The farmers and millers bringing their produce to market, muſt wait for the ſale, until money can be raiſed. They will be frequently compelled to ſell at reduced prices, ſuch as a chance monied man may pleaſe to offer: or they muſt place their goods in the hands of factors, who muſt derive their advantage by way of commiſſion, ſtorage, and charges, all which the farmer muſt pay. Whereas, if a bank is ſuffered to exiſt in full force, the merchant's occaſional neceſſities can be relieved by diſcounts, and the farmer meet with ready ſale for his produce. This I conceive to be the greateſt uſe the farmers can wiſh to derive from the bank.</p>
               <p>The firſt attack on the bank, gave a check to the price of produce, which has continued to be felt ever ſince: and if the bank be deſtroyed, thoſe farmers who raiſe more than they conſume, will become ſenſible of the conſequences.</p>
               <p>The bank, we are told, not only does not lend to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers—but prevents their getting money on loan. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Millers and farmers of reſponſibility, if they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections in the city to indorſe their notes, can procure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts at the bank, as readily as the citizens of Philadelphia. In order to conſider properly the charge that the bank pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents people from lending their money on bond and mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, which they ſay it effects, by the enormous dividends drawn upon bank ſtock, it is neceſſary to ſtate the amount of that ſtock, and to whom it belongs:—</p>
               <p>The ſtock at preſent amounts to 870,400 dollars, which, divided by 400, gives 2176 ſhares, whereof 285 ſhares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to foreigners, of which nine tenths to Holland. None of the money inveſted in theſe ſhares, would, if there was no bank, be lent in this ſtate upon bond and mortgage, we may ſafely conclude. Various have been the applications made by our citizens to borrow money in Europe, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:019884_0098_0FAD41AA0F1A2278"/>
in Holland: and altho' the beſt landed ſecurity which this country affords, has been offered, yet every application has failed; and not a ſingle ſhilling has been obtained that I could ever learn. Six hundred and ſix ſhares belong to inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of New Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jerſey, Delaware, and Virginia: a conſiderable part of theſe ſhares were ſubſcribed during the war, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtimulated thereto by the belief that placing a part of their funds in the bank of North America, would afford a great aid to the cauſe of the united ſtates. Theſe ſhares are divided among many individuals: can it, therefore, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that any part of the money paid for theſe ſhares, would, upon a diſſolution of the bank, be lent upon bond and mortgage to our citizens? If thoſe ſtockholders were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to lend in that manner, it would, doubtleſs, be in their own reſpective ſtates, to their own fellow-citizens, within their own view, and within the protection of thoſe laws under which they live.—Six ſhares are held by inhabitants of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter county, one by an inhabitant of Lancaſter, five by inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Weſtmoreland, twelve by inhabitants of Berks, twelve by inhabitants of Bucks, and fourteen by inhabitants of Philadelphia county. Theſe fifty ſhares were probably ſubſcribed on the ſame patriotic principles: and, if the bank were deſtroyed, it is poſſible that this money, or ſome part of it, might be lent upon bond and mortgage. But the whole amount of fifty ſhares is only 20,000 dollars: and it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether any part of even this pittance would <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> lent out. The remaining ſhares, being 1235, belong to citizens of Philadelphia, and principally to the commercial men, whoſe greateſt inducement to continue ſtockholders, is to ſupport an inſtitution which affords them accommodation and convenience, by means of diſcounts. With a very few exceptions, we may ſay that not one dollar of this money, would ever be lent out on bond and mortgage. There are very few if any of this claſs of ſtockholders who do not ſtand in need of the whole of their money in the courſe of buſineſs: and when in need, they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row occaſionally perhaps the whole amount, or more: It is upon theſe principles, the merchants generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtockholders—when one does not want his money, it is earning his ſhare of the dividend from another: and by thus clubbing a capital together, as it were, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional wants of all are ſupplied. But I am perfectly ſatisfied,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:019884_0099_0FAD3E3F777DFE60"/>
that none of the money paid for theſe ſhares, can be lent on bond and mortgage. Does it not, therefore, appear that this charge is as groundleſs as the others?</p>
               <p>Before the war, monied men were fond of lending upon bond and mortgage: it was a favourite practice; was thought perfectly ſafe; and enabled thoſe who were advanced in years, to receive an income, ſo as to live at eaſe and quiet; and I doubt not this practice might have been revived, had not moſt of thoſe lenders ſuffered ſeverely—ſome in the whole—and others in part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even thoſe who have eſcaped loſs, are deterred from lending again by the dread of paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and tender laws; and ſo long as this dread continues, all hopes muſt be relinquiſhed, of borrowing upon bond and mortgage.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the practice of lending upon bond and mortgage exiſted, there was another practice exiſted with it. The lenders were chiefly citizens; and for the convenience of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the intereſt on the day it fell due, they preferred lending to thoſe citizens of Philadelphia, who wanted to borrow; ſo that the farmers, even in thoſe days, could not obtain loans, until the citizens were ſatisfied; now, ſhould the days of loaning return, the bank will prove uſeful to the country in that reſpect; for by the temporary diſcounts which citizens obtain at the bank, it is probable that moſt of their wants may be ſupplied, and thereby their competitions with the farmers be prevented. I have known many a man formerly obliged to borrow money for twelve months, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he only wanted it for three, four or ſix; but the practice was to lend for twelve; and the capitaliſts thought it too troubleſome to lend for a ſhorter time. A certain rich citizen of Philadelphia, inimical to the bank, now taken and hugged to the boſoms of thoſe gentlemen who ſo warmly advocate the intereſt of the farmers, declares publicly, that he is an enemy to the inſtitution becauſe he could purchaſe flour cheaper, were it deſtroyed, From this declaration, the farmers may form ſome judgment how far the bank is uſeleſs or injurious to them.</p>
               <p>In effect, the utility of the bank is experienced by every man in the ſtate, at ſome period or other. I have ſhewn clearly it is uſeful to the farmer and miller. The mechanic derives alſo his ſhare of benefit and convenience from this inſtitution. Punctuality in paying his workmen is of great advantage to the maſter, and abſolutely neceſſary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſubſiſtence of the journeymen. The employer muſt
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:019884_0100_0FAD3E406A9C3018"/>
have it in his power to make regular payments to the maſter mechanic,—or he, in his turn, cannot be punctual. It has heretofore happened, that thoſe who built houſes, or gave employment to various trades, have not had it in their power to pay punctually, according to their engagements. The like may be expected again. But in all ſuch caſes, on fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſions, relief may be found at the bank. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployer, giving his note to the maſter, their joint credit, if they are entitled to credit, will procure the ſum wanted, by diſcount at the bank. This obſervation muſt ſtrike every mechanic at the firſt glance; and, if he turns his attention to the ſubject, his own thoughts will point out various modes by which he may draw reſources and conveniences from this inſtitution. In ſhort, the ſame reaſoning will apply to every deſcription of men that have any thing to do with money.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible, then, that we ſhall purſue meaſures for the deſtruction of an inſtitution ſo uſeful? One would think that the firſt thing which offers itſelf to our conſideration, on the nature of a bank, would be ſufficient to prevent the purſuit of ſuch a meaſure. It is, that a number of perſons have placed in the care of the preſident and directors of the bank a ſum of money for the expreſs purpoſe of lending to thoſe that want to borrow; and this ſum thoſe perſons (ſtockholders) cannot draw out again; but it muſt remain for that uſe. Beſides this, there is alſo a further ſum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the power of the directors, which enables them to extend their loans beyond the capital or ſtock; and on which part of the profits of the bank ariſe. The integrity, punctuality and prudence of the preſident and directors have obtained ſuch credit with the citizens of Philadelphia, that numbers of them depoſit their money in bank for ſafety and convenience. It is received and paid at their pleaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expence or riſque to the depoſitor. And the ſums ſo collected to a point, being conſiderable, the bank is enabled always to lend a part of the money ſo placed: as it is not in the nature of things that the depoſitors ſhould all call for their money at one and the ſame time—conſequently, a part of the ſum will anſwer the demands of the whole; and by this means, it muſt be ſeen, that ſums of money are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought into circulation and uſe, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lie mouldering in the cheſts of thoſe who would neither lend nor uſe them; and that the bank, by this credit, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to extend its utility amongſt thoſe whoſe neceſſities,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:019884_0101_0FAD3E4107479238"/>
diſappointments, intereſt, or convenience, incline them to borrow.</p>
               <p>I have been frequently told, out of doors, although it has not been mentioned here—indeed it could not with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be mentioned here—that the oppoſition to the bank is in part levelled at me perſonally. If any oppoſe it in that view, and ſuppoſe that my intereſt would ſuffer by the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of the bank, they are groſsly miſtaken. I am not ſtimulated by the conſideration of private intereſt, to ſtand forth in defence of the bank: for be aſſured, ſir, that if this, be deſtroyed, another ſhall ariſe out of its aſhes—one that will be of great advantage to my intereſt, and to the intereſt of thoſe who may join me in the eſtabliſhing it: nay, ſhould I be diſappointed in procuring ſuch aſſociates as I would chooſe in the undertaking, I will eſtabliſh a bank on my own capital, credit, and reſources; and ſo far from doubting its ſucceſs, I do not heſitate to pronounce that even my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (and God knows I ſeem to have enough of them—at leaſt political enemies—for I know of no other cauſe for them being ſo)—will deal with and truſt me; not that I expect they may like me better then than now; but they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in me; and, for the ſake of their own intereſt and convenience, they will deal with me.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Weſtmoreland has acknowledged the utility of the bank during the war; and has drawn a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between it and the continental army. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental army, ſays, he, were uſeful during the war: and yet we diſbanded them. But ſurely they were not diſbanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had been uſeful—but becauſe, when peace was eſtabliſhed, they were no longer neceſſary. He acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that this inſtitution was uſeful; and yet endeavours to aboliſh it—becauſe it has been ſaid that it was injurious.</p>
               <p>He alſo made a compariſon between the bank and general Waſhington. I have ever acknowledged the ſervices and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of that great man. His utility during the war will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be denied: and in his reſignation, he acted conſiſtently with that noble and diſintereſted ſpirit by which he had been actuated during his command. He did what was expected of him: and it will ever be a part of my pride to join in paying him every tribute of praiſe. But this compariſon ought not to have been made; the general's acceptance of command, and the eſtabliſhment of the bank, are very different things; and took place on very different principles. The firſt was the patriotic act of a noble mind, which had not only the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:019884_0102_0FAD3E41D91E82F0"/>
ſervice of his country, but alſo honour and glory in view. The laſt aroſe from neceſſity, having alſo the ſervice of the country for one part of its object, and the intereſt and emolument of thoſe who ſhould engage in it, for the other. The country has received the ſervice: and now endeavours are uſed to requite it with ingratitude. But further ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and benefits may be expected by America from this bank. We are now at war with the Algerines. Every one knows that peace muſt be purchaſed of them with arms or with money. In either caſe, money is neceſſary: and we know that the moſt preſſing requiſitions of congreſs, do not prevail with the ſtates to raiſe it as faſt as they ought: nay, whilſt the ſeveral ſtates are deliberating whether or how they ſhall raiſe money, one part of the citizens of the united ſtates are plundered of their property by the ſeizure of their ſhips and cargoes; and another part of them are condemned to ſlavery. Let us ſuppoſe that the commiſſioners employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe, had ſo far ſucceeded, that the Algerines had agreed to make peace, on the receipt of a ſum of money—where ſhall congreſs get the money? We have not ſo well enabled them to acquit their engagements in Europe, as to afford any reaſonable proſpect that they can borrow more. But upon ſuch an occaſion, this inſtitution—the bank—might again be of eſſential ſervice to the united ſtates. In this ſtate, we are now threatened with internal troubles at Wioming: no perſon can tell what may happen in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: if things go on as they have done, we may be in want of every aid Where are we to find ſudden reſources, or the ſums that may become neceſſary to put an end to thoſe troubles, and extend the protection of government over the boundaries of the ſtate? Various circumſtances tend to ſhew, that upon this and every proper occaſion, the government of Pennſylvania might be ſure to command every aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the bank can give: And ſhall we then, from a mere pretended opinion that this inſtitution has been injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, "rip up the gooſe that lays the golden eggs?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie ſaid the gentleman had aſſumed another ground. The debate had, until that ſtage, been conducted with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency—how far he [mr. Morris] had departed therefrom, he left thoſe preſent to judge. The members oppoſed to the bank were by him charged directly with ſpeculating in the depreciation of the paper money—and indirectly with perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He might be under the neceſſity of recriminating. If he ſhould be obliged to touch upon any circumſtances of that
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:019884_0103_0FAD3E428A24C570"/>
gentleman's private conduct, he hoped he would bear it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently.</p>
               <p>Ordered, that the further conſideration of the report be poſtponed.</p>

               <p>RESUMED the conſideration of the report of the committee, to whom were referred the memorials pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repeal or ſuſpenſion of the law annulling the charter of the bank.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons. After the able diſcuſſion which this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has undergone, little ſeems to be left for me to ſay. My worthy colleague, whoſe knowledge and experience are ſo ſuperior to mine, has gone largely into it: but as appeals have been made by our opponents to the feelings of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the tradeſman—and as he has left ſome points un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched—I muſt pray the attention of the houſe, while I endeavour to make ſome obſervations on them.</p>
               <p>If there appears to have been any attempt at reaſoning, by thoſe who are oppoſed to the reſolution, it has been by the member from Weſtmoreland. That gentleman has the capacity of ſtating clearly, and reaſoning juſtly. If he has failed in either, on the preſent occaſion, it muſt be imputed rather to the badneſs of the cauſe he has undertaken, than to the want of ability in himſelf.</p>
               <p>To his reflections upon government, I ſhall make little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. If our habits and our circumſtances are not well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our frame of government, it is the fault of thoſe who made it: for our habits and our circumſtances were nearly the ſame as they are at preſent, when the conſtitution was formed.</p>
               <p>His obſervations upon trade, being drawn from theory, it would be improper to remark ſeverely on them: but it may not be unuſeful to ſhew they are not well grounded.</p>
               <p>His arguments went to prove, that our imports exceeding our exports to a very great amount, muſt prove injurious—in ſhort, they went to prove, that our trade, as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ought not to be encouraged. But theſe opinions, as well as ſome others that have been advanced in the courſe of this debate, have been taken upon truſt: and though they may correſpond very well with the ſituation of Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land county, and ſome others which are not within reach of
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:019884_0104_0FAD3E43462E4A68"/>
a ſeaport to diſpoſe of their products—it will be difficult to perſuade thoſe farmers who have been accuſtomed to bring the produce of their induſtry to this city, and receive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for it, that trade is injurious. I believe experience has fully proved the contrary; and that the commerce of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania has been eminently uſeful in promoting and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging its agriculture and improvements.</p>
               <p>As to the trade of import, which the gentleman conceives to operate ſo forcibly to our ruin, I do not wonder he ſhould not be well informed reſpecting it: as I find many hold that opinion, who have better means of information. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the peace took place, the importations were very great. The people in Europe ſeem to have conſidered Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia as the emporium of America; and directed their operations to it accordingly: but does that gentleman know what part of thoſe importations was again exported? Does he know that we have uſually imported for the conſumption of Weſt Jerſey, Delaware, the Eaſtern Shore of Maryland—and that almoſt every ſtate in the union derived ſupplies of European goods from us—after thoſe great importations were made—and that this ſtate derived a very conſiderable revenue upon their conſumption? An impoſt of 100,000l. per annum, paid into the treaſury, ought to convince the gentleman, that trade even to him is not unuſeful—he has a ſhare of that revenue.</p>
               <p>Amſterdam imports from all parts of the globe, and to an immenſe amount. Are the United Netherlands, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Holland, ruined by thoſe importations?—or are they not rather the ſource of their wealth? That city pays two-fifths of all the expences of the ſtates; Philadelphia has paid in nearly the ſame proportion, of all the expences of Pennſylvania. Philadelphia was likely to become the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam of America: but the gentlemen from Fayette, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moreland, &amp;c. being ſuch adepts in the ſcience of commerce, have taken effectual meaſures to prevent it.</p>
               <p>In the gentleman's obſervations upon commerce, he had almoſt forgotten our exports—"a little flaxſeed,"—but not worth mentioning.</p>
               <p>There have been ſhipped from this port 14,000 hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of tobacco, in a year, at 3l. per hhd. worth 42,000l. excluſive of freight; 40,000 barrels of flour; 300,000 buſhels of wheat; with a variety of other articles: which are ſurely of ſome value.</p>
               <p>We were not only the importers for other ſtates, but the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:019884_0105_0FAD3E44051A9460"/>
exporters likewiſe. In the year 1784, 12,000 hogſheads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, the produce of Virginia and Maryland, were ſhipped from this port. It appears by the returns from the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, that 1116 ſail of veſſels entered and cleared at it laſt year: the value of the cargoes of ſuch a number, muſt ſurely be of ſome conſequence. But whatever may have been the advantages of this commerce, I repeat it—our own unwiſe reſtrictions will operate to leſſen them.</p>
               <p>That the extent of our importations has been injurious to the ſtate, is become a faſhionable doctrine: it is propagated to ſerve ſome purpoſe, and has obtained credit: but how does this appear? The value of our imports may be pretty accurately known, by the books of the collector: but the proportion of them ſold to the ſtates around us, which go by land, or by inland navigation, cannot be aſcertained. The exportation of ſpecie is the proof principally relied on, and from thence the ruin of the ſtate is predicted. For my own part, I ſee money exported with as little reluctance as I ſee any other merchandize—I conſider it but as a merchandize,—and that if we export it at one time, we ſhall import it at another. I wonder how we obtained this money—Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia has neither gold or ſilver mines—but ſhe has what is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what will purchaſe gold and ſilver at all times. This complaint, however, of the export of ſpecie, does not come well from the advocates of paper money. I think a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aſſertion of theirs, is—that a virtuous people can live without gold or ſilver: and they would all wiſh to be thought virtuous.</p>
               <p>It appears to me a little paradoxical, that an importation of an over proportion of goods can be injurious to a country. It does not follow, that becauſe the merchants import more goods than are neceſſary, that the people ſhould buy more than they want. It may poſſibly oblige the importer (as has been the caſe in many inſtances) to ſell them for leſs than coſt: but ſurely the loſs there muſt be to the ſeller, and not to the buyer: and as the ſellers on thoſe terms, have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally foreigners, the loſs has been theirs, and the gain been ours. It may have been a temptation to unthinking people to buy more than they had occaſion for—and our merchants have ſuffered in the ſale of ſuch goods as they had on hand, which muſt have been cauſed by the low price of the others: but it is a novel complaint, that a choice of goods, to be bought at leſs than their coſt, ſhould be an injury to the purchaſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:019884_0106_0FAD3E4532E9F368"/>
To complain of the want of money, is not peculiar to the preſent times. Such complaints always have, and always will be made. I think the average price of flour, during the laſt year, would be near 50s. for the barrel (1cwt. 3qrs.); of wheat, 9s. per buſhel; of flaxſeed, 15s. per buſhel; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſale, and payment on delivery. This, ſurely, did not argue a want of money. Was there any part of the produce of the country brought to market, that could not be ſold for ready money, and at a very high price? I believe not.</p>
               <p>I am ready, however, to acknowledge that this is not the caſe at preſent. The produce of the country has fallen in price: and, what is worſe, there are not purchaſers for it, at any price. If I were to aſſert that this is owing in part to a ſtoppage of diſcount at the bank, perhaps it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted—I leave thoſe that would controvert it, to account for it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have thought neceſſary to ſay upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of commerce, that the poſitions laid down by the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from Weſtmoreland, might not be taken for granted.</p>
               <p>As he was obliged to acknowledge that the bank was uſeful to commerce, he meant to ſhew that commerce was injurious to the ſtate; and of courſe, that the bank, which gave faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to that commerce, was neceſſarily injurious.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſubject of the bank, I have yet ſaid very little: my worthy colleague has explained its uſefulneſs very fully. From the arguments uſed againſt it, we would be led to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that the money locked up in its vaults, is uſeleſs to the good people of the ſtate; and that if it were not for ſuch an inſtitution, the whole of that money would be lent out on bond or mortgage in the country. Let us examine if this is really the caſe.</p>
               <p>If this money was not in the bank, would it neceſſarily be lent out in the country? Or, being in the bank, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unemployed? It is eaſy to prove that neither of theſe is the caſe.</p>
               <p>Of the preſent ſtock of the bank, 360,000 dollars are the property of perſons who are not inhabitants of, or reſident in Pennſylvania: and I believe it will not be pretended that the owners of that part of the ſtock would ſend it to Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, to be lent out at intereſt. There is yet no inſtance of foreigners lending money in this ſtate on private ſecurity. And ſuch of the ſtockholders as are citizens of the ſiſter ſtates, would not be likely to ſend it here for that purpoſe—becauſe the rate of intereſt is as high, at leaſt, in the other
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:019884_0107_0FAD3E459C5A9B20"/>
ſtates as in Pennſylvania—and there is as good ſecurity there. Of the remaining ſtock, near 500,000 dollars are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of people in and near the city, divided among about two hundred and fifty perſons: moſt of thoſe are in buſineſs, and became ſtockholders to encourage the inſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it operates to their convenience, and becauſe they can borrow not only as much as they own of the ſtock, but much more, according to their credit and circumſtances.—Very few of them, however, could put their money out to intereſt. Few of the merchants of the preſent day, have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beyond their immediate occaſions: if this is the caſe—and I believe it cannot be diſproved—very little, if any of the preſent capital would be lent out in the country at inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, though there had never been a bank.</p>
               <p>But does it follow that the money's being in the bank ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it leſs uſeful to the citizens? Surely it does not. The dividends made to the ſtockholders prove that it is all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: and whatever the dividend exceeds the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of money, proves that more is circulated than its ſtock: of courſe, ſo much is added to the circulation beyond the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſpecie.</p>
               <p>There can be no method by which the circulation is better aſſiſted than by a bank of depoſit and diſcount, ſuch as the bank of North America is. Among trading people, where there are no banks, every merchant or trader muſt at all times have money in his cheſt or in his drawer unemployed: if a man is in the receipt of money, he cannot lay it out again the day he receives it. If he wants to make a purchaſe of any conſiderable value, he collects money for ſome time in order to enable him to make that purchaſe; or, if he has bought on credit, he collects to make good his payment when it becomes due: by this means it muſt happen, that a conſiderable part of the money uſed in that place, muſt every day be abſolutely uſeleſs. But where there is a bank, a trader, when he receives money, ſends it there, for theſe reaſons—that it is kept in ſafety, without any expence; that the more he keeps there, the better credit he has; and that if he occaſionally borrows, his making depoſits of money is an inducement to the directors to lend to him. By keeping the money there, the whole ſum, which would have lain in the hands of the different owners, is collected together: and as all the owners never want their money on the ſame day, the bank is enabled to lend for ſhort periods a certain part of that money; and thereby give that part circulation, which
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:019884_0108_0FAD4039C7EC7140"/>
would otherwiſe be uſeleſs. Thus it appears that collecting money in a bank, increaſes the circulation: and the utmoſt that the country gentlemen can any ways contend for, is—that they, living at a diſtance, and wiſhing to be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with loans of money for long periods, cannot have them at the bank. But is that a reaſon that the inhabitants of the city and its vicinity ſhall not have the privilege of accommodating each other? Though the money is not lent to the farmer, yet, as it facilitates the purchaſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, and the procuring him ready money for them, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives thereby a full ſhare of the advantage.</p>
               <p>Another objection has been artfully made to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the bank, which deſerves notice: <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the aid it gives the merchant, enables him to keep up his goods till he can obtain a better price for them, than if they were to be immediately ſold. This objection is more plauſible than ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. It is in the nature of trade, that when it is free, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is ſoon reduced as low as the trade will admit: it muſt afford ſufficient for the encouragement of thoſe concerned in it, or they will leave it off: if it exceeds that proportion, for any time, ſo many will engage in it, as to reduce the profit.</p>
               <p>If, when a ſhip arrives, the merchant can, by a loan of money from the bank, diſpatch her again immediately, ſhe performs, perhaps, two voyages more in the year, than if he is obliged to detain her till the cargo is ſold: and this will certainly enable him to ſell his goods cheaper, or to give more for the products of the country. A moderate capital, ſuch as ours generally are, turned four times a year, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the merchant to ſell for a leſs profit than if he turns it but twice. So that in every view in which this inſtitution is taken, it will be found advantageous.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the liberality of its management, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are innumerable. When the legiſlature of this ſtate were unable to pay the officers of their army, they granted them certificates; and mortgaged the revenue of the exciſe for payment of the intereſt. When the intereſt became due, the revenue was not collected: and the diſtreſs of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers was great. On that occaſion, without any particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, the bank advanced the money; and took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſement when the revenue was collected.</p>
               <p>At the time when its aid to the united ſtates had put it out of the directors' power to make private diſcounts, they, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:019884_0109_0FAD403BB5AA8680"/>
an application of the legiſlature, advanced 5000l. for the defence of the frontiers.</p>
               <p>I remember when the enemy's row boats took veſſels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our port, and carried them off: and the ſtate had not the means of granting protection againſt ſo inconſiderable, tho' inſulting an enemy. On that occaſion, the bank, by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of about 25,000l. enabled the merchants to ſit out a ſhip, which, within a few days, not only cleared the bay and river, but captured a cruizer of twenty guns, belonging to the Britiſh fleet.</p>
               <p>The inſtances of its ſervices are innumerable. Aſk the managers of the houſe of employment: they will tell you the poor could not be fed without the aſſiſtance of the bank.—Aſk the wardens of the city; and they will tell you that the city could not now be lighted but by means of the loans obtained there. But it is needleſs to repeat the inſtances: for I may ſay there is no ſervice, public or charitable, to which its aſſiſtance has been denied. Perhaps its uſe will be better underſtood when the want of it is ſufficiently felt—and though the preſent attempt to cruſh it may ſucceed for a time, I have no doubt it will be as eagerly called for as it is now decried.</p>
               <p>I cannot help obſerving, that there are gentlemen in this houſe, who ſometimes inſtruct—but oftener inſult us with their reading—One has brought us an extract from the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Iriſh commons, to prove that the people of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were oppoſed to the eſtabliſhment of a bank. Several writers have treated on the ſubject of banking—one, a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in great repute, Mr. Smith, who treated on the wealth of nations, ſtates that the trade of Glaſgow was doubled in 15 years after the eſtabliſhment of a bank there—and that improvements of every kind kept pace with that increaſe. Thus if banks were regarded as injurious in ſome places, they have been found beneficial in others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. This ſubject has been ſo ably handled by the gentlemen who have ſpoken againſt the report under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the houſe, that it is not requiſite to enter deeply into it. It is however neceſſary to take notice of ſome remarks which have fallen from the gentlemen in favour of the report.</p>
               <p>Great ſtreſs is laid on one circumſtance, and a loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour raiſed, becauſe the committee of laſt year did not go to the bank. But I would aſk, what enquiry ſhould we have made at the bank? What information would have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:019884_0110_0FAD403CBB004F20"/>
us there? Would the directors have laid open their books to us? I remember well a queſtion put to the directors by the committee who made the report before us, were they willing to give information to the committee conſiſtent with the ſecrecy of the inſtitution? If the committee of laſt year had called, they would not have laid open their books. And if the committee had enquired how far the preſident and directors had abuſed the truſt repoſed in them, it would have been altogether uſeleſs and unneceſſary. This being the caſe, the committee were perfectly right in not calling at a place where they could not obtain the intelligence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. There was another reaſon: the bank not being under the control of government, the committee could not oblige them to lay before them a ſtate of their accounts, or their books.</p>
               <p>Some of the arguments on this queſtion have been ſo much refined as to be above the comprehenſion of us country people. A gentleman tells us, that the balance of trade is a mere ſpeculation. I muſt confeſs I am not much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with trade—but I know there is ſome ſuch thing as a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of trade—and that it is greatly againſt this country at preſent.</p>
               <p>The queſtion of right in this houſe to take away a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, has been pretty well diſcuſſed, and it now ſeems well underſtood. Two of the members on the other ſide have conceded the point. The others have not—but their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amount to that, when our ſituation is conſidered. As charters are granted by the aſſembly—they can be revoked no other way than by the aſſembly. They cannot be taken away by the courts of juſtice, as they are given by the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that the bank is dangerous to the ſtate, and in ſupport of this, the plan of mortgaging to it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues has been adduced. The gentleman who propoſed this plan, replies, that he was not authoriſed by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to make the propoſal to this houſe. Another member who is one of the bank directors, tells us the ſame thing. But really I can hardly ſtretch my credulity ſo far, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that to be the caſe. If it was, I do not ſcruple to ſay, it was an inſult to this houſe, to propoſe to them the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a meaſure, to which if they had acceded, they would have left it in the power of the directors to laugh at them.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen in favour of the preſent report, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:019884_0111_0FAD403CCA6748C8"/>
a violent degree of reſentment againſt the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of laſt year, who made the report relative to the bank—at the ſame time they ſeem deſirous to keep clear of the late houſe. But if the committee were wicked, the houſe muſt have been no leſs criminal—as they muſt have been either ignorant, or equally wicked. The policy of this proceeding, is eaſily ſeen. There were no hopes of changing the minds of the members of the committee of laſt year, now in this houſe—therefore it was not judged neceſſary to keep any meaſures with them—but the late houſe is treated with more lenity, in hopes that ſome of its members now here, might come over in favour of the bank. One gentleman [mr. Fitzſimons] wiſhes he could ſeparate the committee from the houſe, and make them perſonally reſponſible. Had he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to impeach them, he would have ſhewn a more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, and not a worſe diſpoſition. But the committee as well as the houſe of laſt year, are accountable only to their country, which will judge of their conduct.</p>
               <p>A gentleman from the city, [mr. Morris] has called upon us to ſhew abuſes in the conduct of the directors of the bank. I am in poſſeſſion of one fact—which, however, I ſhall not mention, unleſs I am urged to it.—</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman has aſſerted, that the public creditors would have been better paid, had the paper not been ſtruck—if the impoſt duties had been collected. That they were not collected, was not the fault of the late houſe—it aroſe from the miſconduct of ſome of the officers whoſe duty it was to collect them. But the laſt houſe could not pay the public creditors without the paper money.</p>
               <p>The gentleman mentions the endeavours of the directors of the bank to prevent uſury. But here facts ſtand in our way. Can any gentleman ſay that uſury was not coeval with the bank? The five per cent. per month is too well known, and its effects too ſenſibly felt, to render it neceſſary to do more than barely mention it. All this was unknown before the eſtabliſhment of the bank.</p>
               <p>He ſeems to call in queſtion the underſtanding of the late committee and aſks, were they able or willing to conſider the ſubject of the bank in every point of view? As to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability, I am not diſpoſed to contend with him on that head—I ſhall readily admit him my ſuperior. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then gives us a high encomium on the ſervices of the bank during the late conteſt—and tells us of his having lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4 or 5000 barrels of flour in the camp of general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:019884_0112_0FAD403D9185D700"/>
on its own account. But it is not to him nor to the bank we are indebted for our independence—I ſhould be glad it was aſcertained to whom we owe that event—there are ſo many claimants, that it ſhould be decided on. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain writer, a friend of that gentleman's, lays claim to a great ſhare of it—I wiſh they would ſettle it between them.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen in favour of the report have laboured hard to ſhew the dreadful conſequences of meddling with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. But what right of property has been invaded by the repealing act? If it had, indeed, confiſcated the property of the ſtockholders, and applied it to the uſe of the ſtate, then there might be ſome foundation for ſuch an argument. No ſuch thing has been done or even attempted. The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly only determined that the bank ſhould not be held under their charter. Will any man ſay that property may not be applied to improper uſes? Suppoſe a man had a mind to employ his property in erecting magazines and laying by military ſtores, has not the aſſembly a right to paſs a law to prevent him?</p>
               <p>The gentleman is exceedingly hurt at the repetition of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money—in our ſpeeches. But the bank is as dear to him as the paper money is to us, and as frequently occurs in his ſpeeches. I have lately read a pamphlet on paper money—and all the writer ſays on the ſubject, is, what an old Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told him a long time ago—<abbr>viz.</abbr> That paper was paper—and money was money. But if an unprincipled author, who lets out his pen for hire, had ſo far relaxed in his laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance that his employers would not pay him for it—if he, in want of his food, in paſſing through the market, ſhould find a five ſhilling bill in his pocket, and, going to a tavern, procure for it his dinner, and a pot of beer, he would be apt then to cry out—This paper money, I find, after all, is victuals and drink to me.</p>
               <p>The directors of the bank are choſen by the ſtockholders, who vote in proportion to their property. If we examine this mode, we ſhall find it highly dangerous: as all is done by nine or ten men—ſo that the bank will remain under the preſent directors, during their lives, which is a direct tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they being the repreſentatives of a few men only.</p>
               <p>A gentleman from the city [mr. R. Morris] thanked God that the bank is not under the control of government. At a former day he was of a different opinion—[Here mr. Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie read two articles of the propoſals for forming the bank—ſigned by Mr. Morris—wherein the clauſe ſubjecting the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:019884_0113_0FAD403E60AC3A30"/>
accounts of the bank to the inſpection of the ſuperintendent of finance, is praiſed and ſtyled excellent.]</p>
               <p>It appears by theſe articles that he thought it an excellent part of the plan of the bank that it ſhould be under the control not only of congreſs, but of the ſtate—but it muſt be conſidered that he, as ſuperintendent of finance, was the perſon who had the control of it. So that at different times, he entertains different ſentiments on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The gentleman tells us the ſtate has not credit—that it is too powerful to have it. But if the ſtate has not credit, how can it communicate credit to the bank? And if the bank has credit, why aſk it of this houſe?</p>
               <p>I now refer to one of the notes I took while this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſpeaking yeſterday. He tells us that the members in favour of paper money, ſeek it, for the purpoſe of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off debts at an under value—</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I did not make the charge the gentleman ſays, only againſt the members in favour of paper money, but I meant to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the advocates of it in general. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that my words may be taken in their true ſenſe. This charge has not originated with me—It has been made from one end of the continent to the other—in news papers, in public debates—and in private converſation—ſo that it is no new thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie on this declared himſelf ſatisfied with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation given by mr. Morris—and ſaid he ſhould not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the courſe he had propoſed to himſelf in his diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morris declared it was not his wiſh or deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the member from taking the fulleſt latitude. He had a fair opportunity. Mr. Morris added he had not riſen with a view to hinder it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. The gentleman made ſome obſervations on the members from the country ſpeculating in lands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo much per cent. for what buſineſs they tranſact—</p>
               <p>Mr. Morris ſaid a note had juſt been put into his hand, ſtating that a member then in the houſe would, if called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prove what he ſaid relative to ſome of the members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo much per cent for tranſacting their neighbours bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. What other members may do, I know not—but I have tranſacted a great deal of buſineſs for my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and have never received a copper for it. I do not know that it would be criminal to receive payment—nor do
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:019884_0114_0FAD403F16F774A0"/>
I know who the gentleman means to charge. This informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I regard as addreſſed to the galleries.</p>
               <p>It is denied that the bank facilitates commerce. But I think it is evident that it does. Cargoes of goods have been purchaſed in one day, which could not have been the caſe but for the bank. The bank, making it convenient to get money, facilitates the purchaſe of goods. It will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted that goods are purchaſed quicker by its means, than they poſſibly could without it.</p>
               <p>We are told that the friends of the bank have given ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and countenance to the paper money. I do not pretend to aſſert the contrary. But I have heard it ſtrongly aſſerted. A gentleman ſays that a diſcount on the paper money of from 2½ to 5 per cent may be had. If ſuch depreciation has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, it is occaſioned by the bank; as it does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the paper money: and conſequently perſons indebted to that inſtitution are obliged to procure hard money at all events—ſo that the bank is the cauſe of diſcount being given.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman ſeems to conſider us as mere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines. He ſays, if we were left to ourſelves, we would not be now oppoſed to the bank. I have never been urged to my oppoſition—I have oppoſed the bank from conviction that the charter was incompatible with the welfare of the ſtate—and I concluded it muſt be deſtroyed. What! does he ſuppoſe we are duped, or that we are diſhoneſt? If we were capable of being bought off, it muſt be acknowledged we have not among us perſons capable to purchaſe. If any members of this houſe were corrupt enough to betray for reward the truſt repoſed in them, the gentlemen on the other ſide have the means in their hands to prevail on them.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I ſaid that a perſon poſſeſſed of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wealth, oppoſed to the bank from private views, was hugged in the boſoms of thoſe inimical to that inſtitution from other conſiderations, although there is no other tie or connection between them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. I have never been attempted by any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I have taken up the matter upon higher ground: and as to what the gentleman who ſpoke yeſterday in favour of the bank, ſaid, reſpecting the attack upon that inſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing levelled at him perſonally, I muſt declare that I have been been actuated by no ſuch motive. As a private citizen, I reſpect him—although as a politician, I happen to differ from him in ſentiment.</p>
               <p>To conclude: We have now no bank. The queſtion,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:019884_0115_0FAD403FC71D9C08"/>
therefore, is, whether we ſhall have a bank or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?—not barely whether we ſhall have a bank—but whether we ſhall have ſuch a bank as we had before? for no modification is offered—the report before the houſe propoſes to revive the old charter. Are we prepared to agree to ſuch a report? Are we prepared to give a charter empowering the corporation of the bank to hold ten millions of dollars—and that in what kind of property they pleaſe? When I look round me, and ſee ſo many independent members, I feel a confidence that they will never agree to veſt the powers conſequent to ſuch a property in a board of directors choſen by ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtockholders. Fears and jealouſies were entertained at the time of granting the charter, when the doctrine of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was but little underſtood: and two attempts were made to limit it: they then only looked forward to the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to be apprehended from it. We have ſeen ſome of them: I therefore truſt, that inſtead of reſtoring the charter, in order, as the report ſays, to reſtore the honour of the ſtate, we ſhall ſave it from that inſtrument of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Dr. Logan declared he eſteemed himſelf ſo unqualified for a diſcuſſion of the queſtion under debate, that he had not propoſed to trouble the houſe, by riſing to ſpeak to it. Being entirely diſintereſted in the matter, he had reſolved to give his vote according as he ſhould be convinced; and was ſorry to ſee that the gentlemen oppoſed to the bank, inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the arguments made uſe of on the other ſide, had recourſe to perſonalities. The bank, at its firſt eſtabliſhment, had been conducted on ſuch narrow principles, as to induce numbers of gentlemen to unite in their endeavours to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh another, which had induced the preſident and directors to alter their plan. He had then become a ſubſcriber, when the doors were thrown open—but had ſince that period ſold out.</p>
               <p>Had the members who ſpoke againſt the preſent report, made good their charges againſt the bank, he had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to vote with them, although not convinced of the propriety of the houſe aſſuming judicial powers. But the charges were not made good.</p>
               <p>There were, he ſaid, two modes by which the intereſts of agriculture could be promoted; by a loan office, and by the bank, which latter, furniſhing the merchants with money, procured a ready ſale for produce. As a farmer, he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the good conſequences of it. The other, by ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

the farmer to borrow money for the improvement and cultivation of his lands, greatly advanced his intereſts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill. One of the city members has remarked, that he believes, if an angel from heaven were to endeavour to convince me, it would have no effect: if an angel ſpoke as he has done, I ſhould regard him as a fallen angel.</p>
               <p>He has ſaid, that farmers or millers may be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loans by the bank. But can any farmer in Lancaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Cumberland derive benefit from loans for forty-five days? They cannot come here to renew their obligations.—Facts are ſtubborn things.</p>
               <p>He alſo ſays that notwithſtanding the cry of the country people for paper money, they will not receive it in payment for their produce. I have received it equal to gold or ſilver for produce. Perhaps others are afraid: and indeed when we hear a gentleman of ſuch wealth and influence declare that he puts it away as faſt as he can, for fear of deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is it not enough to ſhake the credit of the paper money?</p>
               <p>The gentleman has ſaid that induſtry is promoted and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures encouraged by the bank: but loans at forty-five days will do neither the one nor the other.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that the bank has not a capital of ten millions of dollars, and that therefore no danger is to be apprehended on that head. But it might have had that capital by the charter: why then ſhould we reſtore it?</p>
               <p>A gentleman has in anſwer to me remarked, that it was impoſſible for the legiſlature which granted the charter, to know the bye-laws of the bank. I aſk, then, was it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to give a charter empowering the corporation to make ſuch bye-laws as they pleaſed?</p>
               <p>The bank, for aught we know, might have become a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding company; and, by ſtopping diſcounts, at particular times, might take advantage of the private merchants—</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzſimons. The corporation is reſtrained from trading by the charter.—</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill demanded—by what charter?</p>
               <p>To this mr. Fitzſimons replied by the charter of congreſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whitehill. This is nugatory. The charter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is of no avail here. Congreſs had no power to grant any charter—and in this inſtance ſtepped out of their line. If that was all the reſtraint on the preſident and directors, they might have become a trading company when they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:019884_0117_0FAD4042D46F9140"/>
The bank, it is hinted, enables the merchant to purchaſe produce—and the farmer conſequently gets a better price. But flour was three dollars per hundred, before the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is not much higher now.</p>
               <p>The whole buſineſs is reduced to this: when the danger of the bank monopolizing trade is urged, the charter of congreſs is pleaded; and we are told that the ſtate is ſafe. But this is a nullity. Let the bank go on, as it ſtands at preſent. The people who deal in it will be ſafer. If the money in the vaults is not ſufficient, the eſtates of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers will be reſponſible. This has been obſerved already—and not a word has been offered in anſwer to it. Is it not better have two or three equal banks, and then the citizens will be courted for their cuſtom, than one which can do as it may ſee fit?</p>
               <p>Mr. Woods ſaid if the gentleman's obſervation, that the charter was but a mere piece of paper, which the houſe might burn at pleaſure, was true, the conſtitution was alſo a piece of paper, and might with equal juſtice be burned; if that was the caſe, God help poor Pennſylvania! Thoſe gentlemen who pretended to be conſtitutionaliſts, thought themſelves exempt from attending to the conſtitution—They made it a noſe of wax, which they twiſted at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. I did not intend to have riſen again on this queſtion: but as ſome new matter has occurred, I think it may not be improper to offer a few additional obſervations.</p>
               <p>A member has remarked upon the manner in which the queſtion was propoſed by the chairman of the committee whoſe report is under debate—<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <q>whether they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give ſuch information as was not inconſiſtent with the ſecrecy of that inſtitution?</q> He has from this drawn an inference that any application from the committee of the late houſe would have been fruitleſs, on account of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy. But herein he is much deceived: this ſecrecy relates to the ſtate of accounts depending between individuals and the bank: and the neceſſity of this ſecrecy every one muſt ſee. I appeal to the feelings of all who hear me, whether they would chooſe the ſtate of their accounts ſhould become known to any but thoſe officers of the bank to whom they are confided? The depoſitors of money there, would no more have their depoſits made public than if the caſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their cheſts: and much leſs would thoſe who ſtand indebted, conſent to have the ſtate of their accounts known to any but thoſe with whom the debt is contracted.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:019884_0118_0FAD4043E17677A0"/>
As ſuperintendent of finance, I was entitled to receive daily a ſtate of the accounts of the bank: but neither the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors nor myſelf ever conſidered this as extending to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of individuals: and I never was made acquainted with any ſuch matter. This is the only kind of ſecrecy, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that could have been meant by the committee, or that could be neceſſary for the preſident and directors to obſerve; for as to the ſtate of their own affairs, that is, the affairs of the bank generally, I take it, they would, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver needful or proper, explain them without heſitation.</p>
               <p>Upon the doctrine of charters, the gentleman inſiſts that they cannot be taken away in the courts of law: in which I agree, that unleſs there be a forfeiture on the part of the corporation, they cannot.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not, however, dwell upon this ſubject—but proceed to the propoſal for mortgaging certain revenues to the bank. That propoſal did not go to the extent gentlemen are pleaſed to mention. One member has remarked that it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſuch a propoſal ſhould have been made without the knowledge of the preſident and directors; and added, that if ſuch was the caſe, it was an inſult to the houſe.</p>
               <p>That propoſal was made by a member of this houſe, who had a right to make it: and if the houſe had agreed to that propoſal, they muſt, as he mentioned at the time, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee to negociate and ſettle the affair with the preſident and directors of the bank. Surely there was nothing like an inſult in this.</p>
               <p>I ſhall paſs over the aſſertions that the impoſt and taxes would not have been ſufficient to pay the public creditors, with obſerving that if they had been duly collected, there would have been in the treaſury a ſum fully adequate.</p>
               <p>It has been inſiſted that uſury has been coeval with the bank. Uſury ſprung up on the deceaſe of the continental money; and if I had expected the charge to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and inſiſted on, I might have brought evidence of the fact. I am ſatisfied that ſome of the brokers' books would ſhew it, and probably thoſe might be obtained without much difficulty.</p>
               <p>The member from Fayette ſeems to charge me with claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merit of bringing about the revolution. In this, however, no part of my conduct will juſtify him. It is not my practice to claim merits which do not belong to me. It is true, in defending myſelf from attacks which have been made, I have been obliged ſometimes to mention ſervices
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:019884_0119_0FAD40445DE3BBC0"/>
performed; and by ſo doing, they are ſubmitted to public inveſtigation, and would be contradicted, if not truly ſtated. When I mentioned the ſupplies of flour ſent to general Waſhington's camp, it was introduced to ſhew the diſtreſſes of the times: however, I did not, as this gentleman was pleaſed to expreſs himſelf, ſay it was ſent at my expence; but that it was obtained upon my credit: neither has my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or folly ever prompted me to pretend that I eſtabliſhed the independence of America. It is my glory to have had a ſhare in it; and I am not aſhamed of the ſhare which has fallen to my lot; I hope it will ever do me honour.</p>
               <p>As to the claims made by the author whom the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mentioned, I know nothing about them. I ſhall not conteſt his claims, nor thoſe of any other perſon. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have deſerved well of their country, or think they have done ſo, ſhall not be diſturbed by me. There are thouſands and thouſands who have been honourably concerned: and I am as ready to give to each his ſhare of merit, as I am to receive even what credit that gentleman himſelf will allow me.</p>
               <p>In this houſe we enjoy the freedom of ſpeech: every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may deliver what ſentiments he pleaſes; and, if he chooſes, he may attack characters without being accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any tribunal, provided he obſerves the decency and decorum due to the houſe: but I cannot refrain from a wiſh that it were laid down as a rule, never to abuſe this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, by attacking thoſe who cannot ſpeak here, and of courſe have it not in their power to defend themſelves. I am led to theſe obſervations, by the gentleman having intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into his ſpeech an author, who, he ſays, is unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, hires out his pen for pay, and who, in walking the market place, without money in his pocket, finds a five ſhilling bill, ſteps into a tavern, procures with it a dinner, &amp;c. and then exclaims, this paper money, after all, if it be not money, is to me victuals and drink. This author, whoever he is, is not on this floor; and conſequently cannot do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſtice here. Whether he is paid or not, I cannot ſay. He is not in my pay: nor do I know any that do pay him: for, if I gueſs right at the perſon, I can pretend to nothing more than common acquaintance, and the intercourſe of common civility which has ariſen in conſequence of his long reſidence here, and which originated in his public ſervices. But I feel for his ſituation, in this inſtance, having been, in the ſame manner, attacked on this floor, when I could not be permitted to repel thoſe attacks, as I had not then a ſeat
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:019884_0120_0FAD40450E92CA08"/>
in aſſembly. I do not reproach the member for uſing the freedom of ſpeech—but I wiſh more delicacy were obſerved. If the author in queſtion has been guilty of any impropriety, there are proper places to bring him to puniſhment, and in which he can be admitted to make his defence.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved in this debate, that the directors of the bank being choſen by the ſtockholders,—and theſe voting according to property,—the directors are elected by ſix or ſeven men, largely concerned in ſtock: and this manner of voting is ſtrongly objected to. I aſk what ſhould give the right of voting in ſuch an inſtitution, but property? Shall thoſe who hold a ſmall number of ſhares, have equal votes with thoſe who hold a great number? You may as well paſs an Agrarian law, and divide the property. Who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt their money in ſuch an inſtitution, if that regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were to take place? Voting according to property is the only proper mode of election, although a deviation has taken place. Shall a man with a fortieth part of the intereſt in bank ſtock which another holds, have an equal voice with him in the election of thoſe who are to manage that intereſt? Surely not. It has been ſaid that the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors exerciſe a tyranny over the ſtockholders. I wiſh it had been ſhewn how: their continuance in office is given as a reaſon: and it is urged that they may remain in office as long as they live, which would be a ſpecies of tyranny. Their continuance in office is a proof that they enjoy the confidence of the ſtockholders—not that they tyrannize over them. However, a change in the direction was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and a number of the ſtockholders went to the late elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with intent to vote-in ſome new hands. But the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the bank ſeeming to render its duration doubtful, they re-elected the ſame gentlemen, in order that if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs were to be cloſed, it might be done by thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, having ſo long conducted it, were beſt acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>The eleventh and thirteenth articles of the propoſals for eſtabliſhing the bank, publiſhed with my name thereto, are brought forward by the member from Fayette, to ſhew that my ſentiments are changed reſpecting the control of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over this inſtitution. The clauſe ſubjecting the ſtate of the bank accounts to the inſpection of the ſuperintendent of finance, was then excellent and highly approved, becauſe I was the ſuperintendent—but now, he remarks, I thank God it is not under the control of government. I am ſtill
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:019884_0121_0FAD4045C955EC50"/>
of opinion that the clauſe was excellent, and that it was uſeful.</p>
               <p>The inſtitution was framed under an expectation that the public monies were to be placed there from time to time—and that it would derive advantage from the public funds paſſing through that channel. It was therefore judged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the bank to ſubmit to ſuch inſpection, and neceſſary to create public confidence—firſt, becauſe the public money being depoſited there, the united ſtates would, by their officer, know that it was ſecure: and ſecondly, individuals having tranſactions with the bank, would think themſelves ſafe, and believe in its ſtability, whilſt it enjoyed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of government, and its proceedings were ſubject to ſuch a check as the inſpection of them by a public officer of high truſt. Theſe are the conſiderations that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced my approbation to thoſe clauſes then. But what is the caſe now? The united ſtates have no longer a ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and although they have a board of treaſury with the ſame powers, they have no funds in the bank: therefore no neceſſity exiſts of any examination into the ſtate of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution on their part: and with reſpect to individuals, it has fully acquired the neceſſary confidence: ſo that in neither caſe is this inſpection any longer neceſſary.</p>
               <p>If, indeed, the ſtate of Pennſylvania had thoughts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiting money in the bank, the government might talk of control; and would have a right to make terms. They might ſtipulate as a condition, that the treaſurer of the ſtate, or ſome other of their officers, ſhould ſo far have inſpection of the bank, as to know, before the treaſurer, the collectors of taxes, of impoſts, of duties, of exciſe, &amp;c. ſhould depoſit public monies there, that ſuch depoſits would be perfectly ſecure: and I am perſuaded that the preſident and directors would have no objection to the appointment of ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, to whom, in ſuch caſe, they would freely communicate a ſtate of the general accounts of the bank. This kind of connection between government and the bank, would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper: but any ſubjection or dependence of the bank on the government, would be inconſiſtent with its nature.—The attempt, then, to prove any inconſiſtency in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions fails—my preſent being perfectly conſiſtent with my former opinions on this point.</p>
               <p>As to what I ſaid reſpecting members receiving per cent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for tranſacting buſineſs in the land-office, I do not know it of my own knowledge—but by information: and I have
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:019884_0122_0FAD4046F51088A0"/>
a paper in my hand, ſtating that a member of this houſe will, if called upon, prove the fact.</p>
               <p>The gentleman ſaid that this information was addreſſed to the gallery. But if the gallery had been cleared, and the doors of this houſe cloſed, I ſhould have gone into the ſame explanation that I have done in the courſe of this buſineſs. It is true, I rejoice that ſo many of my fellow citizens are preſent at theſe debates: as they will probably, from the explanations reſpecting the bank, become better acquainted with the nature of it, than many of them were before; and it only wants to be underſtood, to make it fully and clearly ſeen how much the intereſt of every man in the ſtate may be or is benefitted by it.</p>
               <p>It has in the courſe of this debate been more than once aſſerted, that the paper money of the ſtate, is depreciated by the bank. This I deny totally. The paper money is received on depoſit at the bank, at conſiderable expence and trouble: one or more clerks at handſome ſalaries, are neceſſary for the receiving and paying it, and for keeping accounts with the depoſitors. The preſident and directors of the bank do all this without an iota of profit—being prompted thereto by a deſire of ſupporting the credit of that paper they are charged with depreciating. From the third of June 1785, to the twenty-eighth of February in the preſent year, they received of this paper on depoſit 104,460l. 18s. 4d. From the twenty-eighth of February, to the preſent day, they have received 2819l. 15s. 8d.—making in the whole 107,280l. 14s. And the credit of this account is,—For ſundries paid from the third of June 1785, to the twenty-eighth of February, 97,767l. 15s. 6d. ditto paid from the firſt to the twenty-eighth of March, 3520l. 11s. 6d.—Balance remaining on hand, 5992l. 7s. From this ſtatement it appears, that the whole amount of the emiſſion, that for the loan-office ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, has already paſſed through the bank: for this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts have been opened in bank for ſixty-ſeven perſons.—I hope it will not be aſſerted that all theſe pains are taken in order to deſtroy the credit of the paper money. I have already anſwered the charges againſt myſelf on this ſubject,—although perhaps it might have been as well to paſs them by, as I have done others, in ſilent contempt.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Fayette with much modeſty, declares, he does not pretend to an equal degree of underſtanding with us. We, however, admit that he has it, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between us, is an acknowledgment, on our part, of
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:019884_0123_0FAD40478C9E6478"/>
his poſſeſſing equal abilities: but I hope this modeſty was not aſſumed to extort compliments from us.</p>
               <p>The gentleman ſays, he hopes the members of this houſe are not capable of being corrupted. I hope with him that they are not. I have no ſuſpicions of the kind—nor ever had. But members of aſſembly are liable to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in their conduct, as well as other men. However, whether they are or are not, I have never made an attempt to influence any one of them: nor can any one ſay, that I have ever held a converſation, done, or ſaid a ſingle thing to influence his vote upon any queſtion whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smilie. The worthy member gave the houſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that if it were not for ſome people, we would not now be oppoſed to the bank. On this I remarked, that if we were capable of being corrupted, thoſe on our ſide of the queſtion had not the means of corruption in their hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. R. Morris. As there are perſons out of doors preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the inſtitution, it is natural for them to exert all their influence to injure it. They get hold of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers—and tell them fine ſtories, make ſtrong aſſertions, and by degrees lead them into their ſnares, by means of decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any attempt at corruption: and this is by no means uncommon. It is well known that mankind are ſlaves to prejudices—and to prejudices frequently not their own—but ſuch as are taken up on the credit of others. I thank God our legiſlature is incorruptible. I believe it has always been ſo: and I hope it will ever ſo continue—at leaſt we have one ſecurity for it—I cannot ſee how or for what it would be worth while to corrupt them, were they ſo diſpoſed. If in this or any other part of the debate, when animated with the ſubject, I have not treated the members oppoſed to me with all the decency and decorum they could wiſh, I ſhould be ſorry for it—as being contrary to my intention: but I am not ſenſible that any ſuch thing has eſcaped me. Indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may tend to inflame—but they ſeldom convince.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman ſays, he reſpects my private charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—but muſt differ from me in politics. I wiſh we could agree in our political opinions: it might be of ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the ſtate: but as we cannot, we muſt be content—he to hold his opinions—and I to enjoy mine.</p>
               <p>Some expreſſions which have dropped from this gentleman and from the member from Cumberland, ſeem to imply, that had the report before us, propoſed any modification of the bank charter, it might have met with their approbation—but
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:019884_0124_0FAD4049A454C800"/>
that in its preſent form, it is inadmiſſible. I do not ſee how the committee could have made a report of that kind: they certainly were not authoriſed to do it. It has been fully proved that the repealing law does not reſt on the ſame ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as our other laws: it is not founded in truth and fact—but in the preamble the reverſe is aſſerted: and this is of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſufficient cauſe for repealing that repealing law.</p>
               <p>I am not willing to take up more of the time of this houſe: it would be going over again the ſame beaten track. We are pretty well tired of the ſubject by this time: and I hope the queſtion will ſoon be put. I hope that no doubts remain as to the utility of the bank. I truſt it has been clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it has never been injurious to the ſafety or welfare of the ſtate in any ſhape or way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Finlay. Had my arguments of yeſterday, been ſtated juſtly, and replied to with fairneſs, I would not have thought it neceſſary further to detain this houſe—as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the members is, I conceive, already wearied out. I have, doubtleſs, been unhappy in ſpeaking leſs diſtinctly or leſs audibly than uſual, ſo as to occaſion them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly ſtated. The manner in which I then inveſtigated the caſe, has been made an honourable mention of by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen on the other ſide of the debate; but could I aſcribe the treatment my arguments met with, in ſtating them yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, from a gentleman of eminent diſcernment [mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris] to artifice, it would be a more flattering circumſtance, than any eulogiums the gentleman has been pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. However, candour obliges me to acknowledge that the gentleman who ſpoke firſt this morning [mr. Fitzſimons] replied to ſome of my arguments with ability, ſtated them fairly, and anſwered ſenſibly. And there are, certainly, many good arguments reſpecting the conveniency of the bank, that may apply in its favour: and it is the duty of this houſe to compare the arguments ariſing either from its utility or its miſchief—its ſafety or its danger—and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them due weight, to obſerve how the balance turns.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to mention ſome inſtances of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my arguments met with yeſterday; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſome obſervations which I touched but ſlightly at the firſt—and alſo ſome which I then waved.</p>
               <p>My firſt argument was entirely miſ-ſtated. Knowing that the preamble of the report under debate, contains reaſoning totally improper and diſgraceful, I thought it would have
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:019884_0125_0FAD404A49AC0748"/>
been an inſult to the dignity of the houſe to argue upon it, which I therefore declined, alleging, that though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſigned by the committee of the late houſe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the charter, were inſufficient, yet, if ſufficient reaſons do now exiſt in the nature of the caſe, their deciſion ought not to be repealed. This I illuſtrated by judicial examples; and alluded to legiſlative ones, of which I ſhall now mention one. In the act lately paſſed for opening the road by the Water Gap, the reaſon aſſigned, is, that there is no road there. Surely, this is not the true reaſon, although it is the only one aſſigned by this houſe: for if that were the true and a ſufficient reaſon, it would imply that this houſe ought to make ſpecial laws for opening roads in all places where they are wanted, which is, by ſtanding laws, the buſineſs of the county courts. The true reaſon muſt have been not only the utility of that road, but the broken and uninhabited ſtate of that country. But the gentleman alleged that I applied this argument to the reſolution now before the houſe.</p>
               <p>I mentioned agrarian laws merely on account of the uſe the gentleman had made of them, in alleging that the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bank could not be taken away without admitting agrarian laws. I obſerved that though wealth was not equal enough in this ſtate to the genius of our government, yet to admit thoſe laws was improper; and, under our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would be unjuſt: but that they had nothing to do with the preſent caſe, which was not taking away property—was not touching the caſh of the proprietors of the bank—but ſolely repealing a law which gave an undue and impartial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to one ſet of men. How could the gentleman's fears be alarmed from this? How could he ſay that I alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though agrarian laws were not juſt now proper, that they would be ſo ſome ſhort time hence? It was the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf introduced the term: and I only attempted to reſcue it from the improper uſe he had made of it.</p>
               <p>I mentioned as an argument the unſuitableneſs of ſuch an inſtitution to the government, laws, and habits of this ſtate. The gentleman ſtated that I had ſaid it was contrary to law. Surely, if a diſputant has the power to make his antagoniſt ſay what he pleaſes, he may eaſily reply: ſo the gentleman has done. He ſays it was not contrary to law—becauſe the charter was a law. It was not contrary to habit—for the people had a habit of applying at the bank for diſcounts,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:019884_0126_0FAD404BF3342780"/>
and carrying their money there to depoſit it. I beg now to repeat and enforce ſome of my arguments on that head.</p>
               <p>The frame of government of this ſtate, being the great deed of truſt between thoſe in government and the citizens at large, is a charter of the firſt importance; and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and contains all other charters that can lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt: yet it is a charter for only ſeven years. It is not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to change, as all other governments are, by natural right—but it muſt, by the law of its own exiſtence, be brought to the teſt ſeptennially. And can the legiſlature give charters more ſacred and more permanent than the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment itſelf? No: the very nature of things forbids it. By our laws, all eſtates, real or perſonal, are diviſable; the grand ſource and ſupport of feudal dignity are therefore taken away—ſince by law, every child, with one ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, enjoys an equal ſhare: and our habits with reſpect to teſtaments perhaps correſpond more perfectly with our laws, than thoſe of any other country in the world. Our real eſtates are ſubject to be ſold for debts; and are actually daily ſelling in this manner. In a country, where we have no wealthy incorporated companies of merchants—where we have no nobles with great eſtates, permanent in the family line—where we have no royal prerogative ſupported by an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous civil liſt and numberleſs dependents—I ſay in a country where we have no counterpoiſe to correct its influence or control its enormities by their own—ſhall we grant ſuch an inſtitution? Shall we give ſuch an artificial ſpring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated wealth? By no means. It was in this manner I argued its inconſiſtence with the ſpirit of our laws, &amp;c. and not in the manner ſtated by the gentleman.</p>
               <p>My arguments on the uſefulneſs of the bank—and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples by which I illuſtrated them—were treated in the ſame manner. But this houſe heard my arguments and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the gentleman accommodated them to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: therefore I ſhall not reſcue them; but ſhall juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that I acknowledged freely the uſefulneſs of the bank—I gave it all the credit I thought it deſerved: but did the gentleman acknowledge the uſefulneſs of paper money or a loan office? Did he give paper money one grateful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the good it has at any time done? No—he did not.</p>
               <p>I forbore yeſterday ſaying much about paper money or a loan office—as things ſufficiently underſtood: but I beg leave now to offer a few further obſervations reſpecting them. By the laſt emiſſion we have anticipated our revenue, and ſo
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:019884_0127_0FAD404D07A8F000"/>
made a ſaving to the ſtate; by it we have relieved our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creditors; by it we have brought in our revenues, and filled our treaſury, which had for years groaned with empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. By means of the ſpring it gave to circulation, it brought in more ſpecie than we could have otherwiſe got. By means of it, the gentleman anſwerable to his wiſhes, will get more old debts paid in to him; and, anſwerable to his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he acknowledges he can put it away again immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. By the laſt emiſſion, Pennſylvania has recovered her dignity; and ſhewn herſelf to be poſſeſſed of that wiſdom which pervaded her counſels whilſt ſhe was a colony.</p>
               <p>The inſtitution of a loan-office is one of the moſt maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrokes of national good ſenſe: the advantages of the preſent one, though ſo new in its operations, have been of amazing ſervice. Vaſt numbers of our citizens were in debt to the ſtate for their lands, which they held by occupancy only: thoſe people have been enabled to pay their debts to the ſtate; and to aſſiſt the public creditors, by increaſing the demand for their certificates. I will mention one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:—as I was coming to this city laſt week, I met with a man who had patented his own land, and procured a loan of one hundred pounds. In conſequence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> orders I had with me, I received about half his loan; and brought it back to pay for the lands of others. Thus it not only pays an intereſt, but ſinks a treble intereſt.</p>
               <p>A loan-office, at this time, is not only a ſource of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, to the amount of the net intereſt it brings; but has contributed by raiſing the demand, to raiſe the public certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates from 3s. 9d. to 6s.: and as every pound value of them laid out as above, takes off an intereſt from three to four for one, by ſinking ſuch a proportion of the public debts—it is one of thoſe honourable and uſeful kinds of ſpeculation, fraught with advantage both to the ſtate and to individuals; and gives the ſureſt fund for the redemption of paper money. The inſtitution of a bank, on the other hand, as I ſaid before, increaſes uſury; promotes the ſpirit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly; and, in our preſent ſituation, prevents improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and equal circulation of money.</p>
               <p>All the gentlemen on the other ſide of the queſtion, deny that it promotes uſury. Let us examine this a little. Does it not give a facility to trade? Is not this its proper uſe? Is not the balance of trade againſt us? Does it not, therefore, give facility to importation in a degree too great for our exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely, it does. When gentlemen obtain the aſſiſtance—the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:019884_0128_0FAD404D49340888"/>
ready and generous aſſiſtance of the bank, to purchaſe imported goods—muſt they not pay at a ſhort and a certain day? And when the market is glutted with goods, and the appetite of the conſumer cloyed, what ſhall—what can the borrower do? He may and often does go to the vendue ſtores, and loſe his property by ready money ſales, at the rate of 50s. a minute: or he may go to the rapacious bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, whoſe exiſtence in Philadelphia is coeval with the bank, and of them borrow at five or ſix per cent. per month. This has been the relief, no leſs common than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive—the mournful relief of thoſe who have with the beſt deſigns and flattering expectations, made uſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſory aſſiſtance of the bank: and thus it is likely to be with every inſtitution inconſiſtent with the laws and manners of a people.</p>
               <p>But this is not all: the bank, it is certain, takes a kind of compound intereſt itſelf: and when ſimple intereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires about ſeventeen years to enable one million of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to grow into two—the method practiſed by the bank (ſuppoſing the holders not to draw their dividends) would make one million produce above ſix in about 26 years: and to follow this thought for a century to come, how ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the idea! In the bank money is arreſted. It muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, without a poſſibility of becoming leſs. It is ſecured by ſuch a charter from every riſk, and guarded againſt every danger but what may ariſe from the poſſible villainy of the conductors of its operations.</p>
               <p>As wealth is the means of conducting—as wealth is the means of obtaining monopolies—even when in the hands of jarring individuals—how much more muſt it facilitate ſuch deſigns, when in the hands of a permanent ſociety, congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by ſpecial privilege, and actuated by the principles of united avarice? Let us ſuppoſe for a moment, that I poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the greateſt real eſtate under the government, and that I had likewiſe the greateſt commercial wealth, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a greater credit in all commercial countries than any other citizen in the ſtate, and that I had the greateſt number of ſhares in, and conſequently the greateſt influence over the bank, would not I in this caſe have it in my power to mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize the moſt valuable foreign markets, and to ſay who ſhall and who ſhall not trade? Would it not be in my power to fix the rate of exchange as I pleaſed—ſo that when in the natural courſe of trade it ſhould be 163 or 170, I could raiſe
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:019884_0129_0FAD404E25AE9758"/>
it to 175 or 180? I could increaſe the neceſſity of remitting by bills, and avail myſelf of that neceſſity.</p>
               <p>The bank in the preſent ſtate of things, prevents even the improvement of this city. Houſes and lands have been ſold, and their price locked up in the bank, where it is free from taxes, and where it increaſes without the labour of the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thus by diſcouraging improvements, it prevents po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and with it the riſing glory and ſtrength of the commonwealth. An equal circulation of the ſigns of wealth, tends to promote equal intereſts—equal manners—and equal deſigns: but the ſituation and circumſtances of few countries admit of equal circulation: yet ſurely government ought not to give its ſpecial aid to render circulation neceſſarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. However this is an argument well underſtood, and has been ſpoken to formerly.</p>
               <p>One gentleman [mr. Morris] would perſuade us that the transfers of ſtock prevent the dangers or cure the evils of the inſtitution. How can this be? Will a few individuals transferring their bank ſtock, change the principles—the nature—and influence of the inſtitution? By no means; but this is too plain a caſe to dwell upon; and has already been well ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>Againſt the right of the legiſlature to diſſolve ſuch char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it has been often ſaid that that body might as well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul the patents of our lands: and for the ſame purpoſe, agrarian laws have been, I think, rather improperly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. What do theſe arguments mean? Is diſſolving the charter of the bank, and entering into it, to take away the gold and ſilver from the owners, for the public uſe, the ſame thing? Surely no. But the right of the legiſlature is ſo clearly confeſſed by gentlemen of legal knowledge—it is ſo eſſential to the ſafety of government—and has already been ſo well ſpoken to—that it would perhaps be an inſult to the good ſenſe of this houſe, to ſay any thing further on this head.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid by gentlemen on the other ſide of the queſtion, reſpecting the advantage ariſing from the bank to the farmer, the mechanic, &amp;c.—It ſeems to be denied that the balance of trade is againſt us; or that the bank promotes that unfavourable balance. One gentleman [mr. Fitzſimons] ſuppoſes that I ſtated the exports from Pennſylvania too low: I believe he did not hear me well—for in every other mention of my arguments, he did me juſtice. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repeat my ſentiments on that head. We export flour—but not ſo much as formerly: this is owing, among other
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:019884_0130_0FAD404ECD892238"/>
things, to a ſcarcity of labouring people: the drain of young men during the war, and for many years having ſo few emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, accounts for this. We export flaxſeed, though not ſo much of it as uſual: the binding of our lands, through long working, and the change of ſeaſons, together with people depending more upon hemp, accounts for this. That the lumber trade muſt continue to decay, requires no inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation to account for it. What elſe of conſequence does Pennſylvania export? Nothing, I believe, worth enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yet we have the foundations of commerce, which riſing ages will doubtleſs improve. I perfectly ageee with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that it is our duty to cultivate the mutual intereſt of the farmer, the mechanic, and the merchant; but how is this to be done? We have been told we ought to alter the balance of trade, &amp;c. but in the preſent ſtate of things, we may as well talk of turning the ſtream of the Delaware. To cultivate theſe now jarring intereſts, and render them mutual, we muſt firſt propagate or import a greater number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that we may have labour of all ſorts cheaper; we muſt encourage our own produce and manufactures; we muſt try to curb our luxury—to mortify our madneſs for trade and foreign wares. Our preſent manner of trading, if perſiſted in, muſt prevent us from ever being in any reputable degree, an independent or a commercial nation; ſtill it is ſaid that the balance of trade is not ſo much againſt us; but I aſk any gentleman acquainted with it, if the rate of exchange is not againſt us? I aſk is not the rate of exchange the touchſtone of trade—and the infallible criterion which ſide the balance turns to? It ſhews the price of money. Is not the rate of exchange more againſt us than before the bank exiſted? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is; and the influence of the bank is well calculated to keep it ſo. I wiſh for a commerce built upon the foundation of population and induſtry; every other kind of commerce muſt be ruinous, and ought to be diſcouraged.</p>
               <p>The trade of Amſterdam has been mentioned by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and applied to our caſe; but I cannot ſee any ſimilarity. It is true, the people of Amſterdam have very little of the produce of their own country to trade upon; but they make the materials of almoſt all the world their own—ſo as to promote population and induſtry; they are in a great degree the mechanics, the factors, and the carriers of Europe; and their wealth is the envy even of London herſelf. But we neither manufacture nor carry for ourſelves—nor do we get rich.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:019884_0131_0FAD404FD1C178A0"/>
A gentleman from the city [mr. Fitzſimons] has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the cheap bargains overtrading and uſury have given many an opportunity of obtaining: but I ſhould have thought this a ſufficient argument on the other ſide. Is it not an evidence of the evils about which we complain? Is it not the cauſe of the ruin of many?</p>
               <p>The great amount of the impoſt received laſt year is alſo uſed as an argument: certainly this is an inconteſtible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to my purpoſe. We received 100,000l. of an impoſt: and we may preſume that much eſcaped the notice of the officers: and the impoſt a part of that time was low: how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazingly, therefore, muſt our imports have exceeded our exports! I ſuppoſe the difference could not have been leſs than fifty, perhaps a hundred to one. Can any nation long exiſt, conducting ſuch a trade? The gentleman mentions the vaſt improvements occaſioned in Scotland by banks ſince their eſtabliſhment. I believe Scotland has received benefit from banks: but our circumſtances and thoſe of Scotland are very different; and though I am not ſufficiently inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be able to deſcribe the banks of Scotland, I know they are neither chartered nor conducted like the late bank, now under debate.</p>
               <p>A worthy member [mr. Morris] in his arguments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the bank told this houſe, that I alſo loved wealth, and purſued it—Doubtleſs I do. I love and purſue it—not as an end, but as a means of enjoying happineſs and independence; and ſo far I am for enjoying it. Though I have it not in any proportion to the degree of what the worthy gentleman has informed us of himſelf—yet I have more land than I can make a proper uſe of, and not a great deal leſs than I wiſh to have, though I purchaſed it at ſecond hand. I have enough of wealth to give a ſpring to induſtry; and to procure the neceſſaries and a competence of the comforts of life. But he has ſaid that I follow land-jobbing; that he has ſeen me in the land office; and that if I did not procure lands for myſelf, I charged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion upon doing it for my neighbours. I denied theſe charges with perhaps too much warmth—not becauſe they were diſgraceful—but becauſe they were, as applied to me, miſtaken; the gentleman has told us to-day that he is able to prove the charge againſt ſome one perſon. I wiſh the perſon was produced, and the charge proved; I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on the proof being brought forward, but from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs that it will not apply to me—and from an opinion that it was improperly introduced into the preſent debate.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:019884_0132_0FAD40509B95DBF0"/>
However, I believe, if members of this houſe are meant, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are rare; and I ſhould have paſſed the whole as a piece of humour, but for the opportunity it gives me of offering a ſhort but true picture of the ſituation of many of my conſtituents. Living as they do, in a new ſettlement, after having encountered the accumulated woods of ages, and beaſts ravenous by nature, and rendered ſtill more ſo by the unbounded extent of their range, they had ſcarcely made openings round their abodes—they had not baniſhed the beaſts of prey—when men more fierce, more cruel than the beaſts, deſolated their new raiſed dwellings, and ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction far and wide. Now, when they are returned, and feebly repairing the ruins of their dreary waſtes, they find themſelves in debt to the ſtate for the very lands in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which many of them loſt their deareſt friends and all their wealth. They endeavour—they ſtrive with arduous diligence to pay the ſtate its due: and, to be able to call the lands their own, they ſell the laſt cow and ſheep, to procure a little money (for nothing but cows and ſheep will find mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney there). I myſelf have been urged to take the laſt cow—to take any thing they had, in order to ſecure their lands. They raiſe the laſt ſhilling they are able—and plead, as if for life, that we may add a few dollars to the ſcanty ſum; and theſe are the people from whom the gentleman ſeems to think I take enriching commiſſions; but all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous feelings of the human ſoul forbid ſuch means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining wealth; and it is a method much better ſuited to the habits of a merchant than a farmer.</p>
               <p>One argument much uſed on the other ſide of the debate, I beg leave, altho' it has been well replied to already, to notice a little further. It reſpects the number of petitioners who have now brought this matter (it is ſaid) before the houſe—it is emphatically called the voice of the people. In addition to what other gentlemen have juſtly obſerved upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I would further remark, that in every government (even the moſt abſolute) the popular opinion, if not immoral, is the voice of God; but in Pennſylvania, it is not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally but in fact the voice of the government—the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſolely founded on the popular authority; and the legiſlature being authoriſed and inſtructed to ſpeak the popular voice, they are neceſſarily ſuppoſed to ſpeak the voice of the people; one exception may be admitted, <abbr>viz.</abbr> if ſome new caſe ariſe, or if ſome new information is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the majority of the people inſtructing and informing
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:019884_0133_0FAD4053493A9068"/>
their repreſentatives, ought to be attended to. But is this the caſe in the preſent debate? By no means. The peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners do not amount to one twentieth of our conſtituents; and under all the influence that the nature of the inſtitution cannot fail to produce on the human mind, ſurely it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, every thing conſidered, that a much greater number of petitioners was not obtained, and ſtrange that the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould make uſe of the few that are obtained, as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; but the caſe is too plain to be dwelt upon.</p>
               <p>Having laboured arguments too long, which are clear in themſelves, and, I truſt, well underſtood in this houſe—I ſhall juſt obſerve that as ſome of them have been mis-ſtated, a few inſtances of which I have mentioned—and ſome others replied to with candour and ability—and as the two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who have riſen in anſwer, have made honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my general arguments, but ſtated their objections—I have ground to believe that thoſe obſervations of mine which have not been replied to, are admitted; and, indeed, as they were drawn from the nature of things, I think they were unanſwerable—for things will ever operate according to their nature.</p>
               <p>We are one great family: and the laws are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon inheritance. They are general rules, and common in their nature. No man has a greater claim of ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for his £.100,000 than I have for my £5. No. The laws are a common property. The legiſlature are entruſted with the diſtribution of them. This houſe will not—this houſe has no right, no conſtitutional power to give monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of legal privilege—to beſtow unequal portions of our common inheritance on favourites.</p>
               <p>This bank, the charter of which has been diſſolved, and is now endeavoured to be renewed again, was truly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary creature. None like it does, I believe—none like it ever did exiſt in any nation: and ſurely ſuch <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> being will never be reſtored—will never be created again by the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of this ſtate. If we ſhould reſtore it, we would have no ſecurity but in the moderation of the directors and ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: but who will anſwer—who can be reſponſible for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture men—future times—and future events?</p>
               <p>Mr. Clymer. Being conſiderably indiſpoſed, I ſhould not have taken any part in this day's debate, but that the report before us has been cavilled at. The gentleman from Fayette has again cenſured the charge in it, againſt the committee of the late houſe for not making enquiry at the bank. Where
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:019884_0134_0FAD4054615470B0"/>
would have been the uſe of this, ſays he, does any one think the preſident and directors would have given any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt themſelves? I will tell that gentleman its uſes: It would have, at leaſt, ſatisfied the forms of juſtice: and, had anſwers to proper queſtions been refuſed, it would have furniſhed more real matter againſt them, than any which has been alleged. The gentleman from Weſtmore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has found it exceptionable in attacking the law on a wrong principle. When a law is once paſſed, ſays he, you ſhould attend to its policy—and not to the means by which it was obtained—or, in effect, if the end be good, it ſhall ſanctify the means. It has been a reproach to the order of the jeſuits, that they held this doctrine: but I find there may be jeſuits out of the Roman church. It is not taught by any preſbyterian ſynod that I know of. It is not drawn from religion or morals—it is not the uſual doctrine of the world,—near three thouſand of our fellow citizens know nothing of it: they have, in their memorials to this houſe, omitted the policy of the law, to arraign the means of obtaining it—it was ſufficient for them that the means were bad. The committee to whom their memorials were referred, have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their example: they have proved that the late houſe were deceived by their committee—that the repealing law ſtands upon the falſeſt ground, the aſſumption in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being abſolutely without ſupport from fact, and is not now contended for in argument: they are therefore fully juſtified in the concluſions they have drawn from thoſe premiſes.</p>
               <p>It was the leaſt of my deſign to touch upon any thing but what concerned the report: but as the vote is, I ſuppoſe, to be immediately put, I would rectify the ſame gentleman's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the banks of Scotland, which he ſeems to think are banks of mortgage: as far as I have read or heard, there were two banks of diſcount at Edinburgh, which alſo lent on mortgage for a time, as long as they were able. Being obliged to drop the practice, the landholders, to ſupply their neceſſities, inſtituted a new bank at Ayr, for the ſole purpoſe of lending on mortgage. But the long credit on ſuch loans, ſoon reduced it to the greateſt difficulties. It at length broke, and involved the whole country in ruin.</p>
               <p>Previous to putting the queſtion on the report, mr. Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num moved to add to the reſolution it contained, a direction to the committee to introduce a clauſe into the bill it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to be brought in, a clauſe ſubjecting the charter of the bank to proper regulations, reſtrictions and limitations.</p>
