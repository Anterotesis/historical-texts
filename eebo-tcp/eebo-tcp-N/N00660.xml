            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And tells us that he <hi>had fainted unleſs he had believed to ſee the Goodneſs of the Lord. (Pſal.</hi> 27.14.) of which the Scripture gives an account.</p>
            <p>The laſt Lords-Day we were called upon in the word (and that in compliance with ſuch awful Diſpenſations of Divine Providence as were then among us) to mourn &amp; weep, but withal to weep as tho' we wept not; ſince which time we have been under ſuch Diſpenſations as call for an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of Tears, ſo that there is leſs danger of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; our great care is (or ſhould be) leſt thro' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of Gods hand we be found ſhort of our Duty.</p>
            <p>We were yeſterday at the opening of a Grave, wherein no ſmall part of the remaining Glory of this Province is covered up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Graves,</hi> and <hi>Funeral Diſcourſes</hi> are of late grown common among us, tho' ſuch Graves (I confeſs) are not common.</p>
            <p>Since the coming in of this laſt Month, how many Witneſſes hath the Lord renewed againſt us? how many Deaths in this little place? Let me without offence allude to a Text in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. where the loſs of <hi>Davids</hi> ſide is reckoned up and worded thus [<hi>Nineteen men and Aſahel</hi>] And why
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000802_0004_0FAA49EE358AD538"/>
not twenty men? Becauſe <hi>Aſahel</hi> was a man of ſingular Worth, and therefore deſerved to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſingly, and hence not reckoned in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the vulgar, but ſet by himſelf. Among our ſelves I may ſay, we have loſt within the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed preciſely the like number, and let it be thus worded [<hi>Nineteen men and Daniel</hi>] A perſon that deſerved to be diſtinctly mentioned, let him ſtand alone, it being very difficult to find an equal to ſet by him. It was part of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Bleſſing. (<hi>Numb.</hi> 23 9.) <hi>to dwell alone, and not be reckoned among the Nations.</hi> A <hi>Daniel</hi> he was indeed, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſignifies Judgment of God, or Judgment from God, and we may ſay ſo of him two ways, either,</p>
            <p>He was a man of <hi>Judgment,</hi> which was given him by God from whom all Wiſdom, Prudence and Judgment comes, and he had a large meaſure of it, was a man of great Judgment, Meekneſs and Moderation alſo, prudent and patient, as all that knew him know.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Judgment of God,</hi> as a man the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of whom is a great Judgment from God upon us, for ſo is the removal of the <hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, &amp;c.</hi> accounted (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.1 —3.) A man whoſe loſs eſpecially at ſuch a time we ſhall have occaſion many a Day hence to bewail, a uſeful perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved (I fear in Judgment to us) from the Evil to come. Thus God takes away ſuch <hi>of whom the World is not worthy,</hi> and leaves ſuch among us that are not worthy of a place in the World.</p>
            <p>I remember ſome of his dying words. <hi>I have</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000802_0005_0FAA49EF9DBCF9E0"/>
(ſaid he) <hi>eſpecially of late times made it any Buſineſs to ſecure mine Intereſt in Chriſt, and have made ſuch progreſs therein, that I can hopefully lean upon him for pardon and life, and am willing to dye.</hi> So lived, ſo died this pious, righteous, prudent, patient, amiable perſon. I neither need nor dare flatter in the caſe. To flatter a man is to ſpeak more good of him than he deſerves, a Crime not ſo eaſily committed upon ſo worthy a Subject. We may and muſt ſpeak of perſons and things as they be, and of him we may truly ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abner,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.38, 39. <hi>Know you not that here is a Prince and great man fallen this Day in Iſrael, and I am this day weak,</hi> &amp;c. A Text which I had ſome thoughts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe, had I not been for ſome cogent reaſons diverted; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever take theſe four notes from the words, very ſuitable to our preſent Concerns, which I ſhall but name, and come to my Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Men of Prudence and Conduct, are great men</hi>; yea, Princes in a Place. So is <hi>Abner</hi> called, and ſo was our <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whatever perſons be in themſelves, or whatever the Concernment of the place is in them, yet Death will make them fall.</hi> This great man and Prince (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) is fallen. <hi>Wiſe men dye as well as fools. Pſa.</hi> 49.10. Neither piety nor prudence, nor uſefulneſs can keep men from falling. Princes and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, the Studs and Staies of a Place muſt fall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Fall of ſuch perſons is a weakening to the Survivers.</hi> His Fall made <hi>David</hi> weak.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000802_0006_0FAA49EFED5DD4A0"/>4. <hi>The Death of ſuch Worthies ought to be noted</hi>: Hence know you not, ſuppoſing they did, &amp; could not but know, &amp; that it was their Duty to know.</p>
            <p>The Application and Improvement of theſe Notes, I leave to the ſerious hearer, and the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Regarder</hi> of the <hi>Operation of Gods Hand,</hi> who will readily underſtand the ſeaſonableneſs and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of ſuch Truths.</p>
            <p>But to come to my Text.</p>
            <p>This <hi>verſe</hi> is the cloſe of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> one of the Children of the Captivity, &amp; a man of great Integrity &amp; Intimacy with God, whom the Lord preſerved in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and (tho' a Captive) made uſe of as an eminent Inſtrument in his Hand for the Service of the Church, &amp; for that end ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him unto great Dignity, made him a chief Ruler, and kept him in his place for the good of his poor people, tho' he had many Enemies, that out of envy and malice watcht for his halting. And beſides that, the Lord was pleaſed to be very familiar with him, &amp; acquaint him with much of his mind and will concerning both his preſent and future Diſpenſations in his Providence, both to the Church and the World, as is to be ſeen at large in his Prophecy.</p>
            <p>Not to go any further back than this <hi>Chapter,</hi> here is in the Beginning of it a <hi>Revelation</hi> of a Time of great Trouble coming upon his people; ſuch as had not been ſince they were a Nation; (<hi>v.</hi> 1.) with other things that <hi>Daniel greatly deſired</hi> a plainer diſcovery of, and further ſatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000802_0007_0FAA49F0A933F558"/>
as not fully underſtanding what was ſaid, &amp; therefore enquired, <hi>v.</hi> 8. but received that Anſwer <hi>v.</hi> 9. that the words were <hi>Sealed till the Time of the End,</hi> and therefore willed him to <hi>go his way,</hi> and adds that <hi>many ſhould be tried, and that the wiſe ſhould underſtand, &amp;c.</hi> and annexes ſomething (tho' dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too) concerning the Time of the end. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12. about which he had enquired. (<hi>v.</hi> 8.)</p>
            <p>The words read are an <hi>Encouragement</hi> and <hi>Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> referring to his own particular Caſe, there ſhould be ſuch and ſuch diſmal Changes and Troubles in the World, and upon the Jews, but as for his part it ſhould be well with him, he ſhould go to Reſt, and <hi>at the End of Dayes ſhould riſe and ſtand up to take his Lott.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People of God that have a proſpect of Evil to come, are very much concerned there about, &amp; ſo was he, but God gave him this word of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which is of uſe to all other in like Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thou</hi>] i. e. Thou <hi>Daniel,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 9. unto whom this ſpeech was directed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Go thy way</hi>] Satisfy thy ſelf with what I have told thee, ceaſe to be over inquiſitive about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſet thy heart at reſt, ſpeak no more to me, concerning this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Until the End] i. e.</hi> until thy End, which is quickly coming, or which thou haſt but a little way to; go about thy Buſineſs till thou come to the end of thy Buſineſs, be not over ſolicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe future events, nor diſtractingly thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about what ſhall fall out. Think of thine end
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000802_0008_0FAA49F162226358"/>
to which thou art going, and there ſhall be an end of all Trouble with thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt reſt</hi>] Sometimes God gives his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Servants a particular Exemption from future Trouble, tho' they live in the Time of it, they ſhall not ſhare in it; he finds <hi>Chambers of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to hide them in</hi> (Iſa. 26.20.) we hear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Noah, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> what ſhall be their perſonal Lott in troubleſome Times; tho' they ſhall <hi>Save neither Son nor Daughter,</hi> yet themſelves ſhall eſcape. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14, 16. But this ſeems not to be the meaning here, rather it refers to the end of his life, that he ſhould reſt in the Grave which is given in Scripture as the common place of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reſt to all the Saints.

               <p>The Scripture is full of this Truth.</p>
               <p>The ground of it is, <hi>partly</hi> from their <hi>Union to Chriſt</hi> their Head, who dyed and roſe again, and ſo ſhall they by vertue of his Reſurrection. Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may receive their <hi>Reward</hi> according to <hi>their works.</hi>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2 Learn hence alſo that <hi>however the Death of any may prove to the Survivers, it's always in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Godly.</hi> As all other Troubles, ſo <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>theirs</hi>; let it come when and how it will. It is an effect of his Kindneſs to them, and in purſuance of his Care for them. Gods way often is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the beſt firſt, and lay them up ſafe out of harms way, and leave the reſt, either to mend or grow worſe; and if they grow worſe, ſo to ripen them unto ruin, for not growing better under ſuch <hi>awakening Providences</hi> as the removal of the good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. <hi>Then we ſhould not be inordinately careful or ſolicitous, for fear of Trouble before hand</hi>; do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract thy ſelf about what may be hereafter; yea, tho' it ſeems to be near, even at the very door:

For, beſides that fixedneſs without <hi>fear of evil Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> is attainable, and ought to be laboured after, as a fruit of Faith. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 112.7, 8. and beſides that many times evils feared do not come at all. I ſay beſides both theſe, this may comfort us againſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Trouble, that it may be we may be gone into the Grave before it comes: Who can tell how ſoon God may ſay to him, <hi>Go thy way Daniel,</hi> go to thy Reſt out of the reach of that Trouble thou feareſt, before it comes to ſuch an height as to work thee any conſiderable Damage. A <hi>prudent foreſight</hi> of evil, and guarding or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt it is good, and a Duty, but <hi>diſtracting thoughtfulneſs</hi> is always ſinful, and oft needleſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe poſſibly thou mayſt not live to ſee it.</p>
               <p>If thou art a good, faithful and diligent Servant, the Lord may accept of thy good will, and call thee off before the pinch comes. A good Maſter will do ſo by a good Servant that is diligent, and willing to do what he is able; he will call him by name, and take him off when he ſees the heat of the day a coming, or ſome pinch at hand that will be too hard for him, he will favour him, and lay the burden upon others. So did the Lord here ſay to <hi>Daniel, Go thy way,</hi> give over, thou haſt done well, go lye down and take thy Reſt.</p>

               <p>It's true, Death is indiſpenſibly the Lot of all, and made ſo by Divine Appointment; (<hi>Heb</hi> 9.27.) and it is to <hi>Nature</hi> very irkſome, and unto <hi>ſinning Nature</hi> terrible and affrighting, but to them that are in Chriſt, and ſo have their ſins pardoned, &amp; the <hi>Sting of Death</hi> removed, it ſhould not be ſo.

World to his people, that they may be willing to leave it, long to be out of it, deſirous of the Grave, that they may go to Reſt therein.</p>

               <p>Indeed for our own loſs of them we ſhould grieve and for Gods diſpleaſure that may appear in the ſtroke we ſhould mourn, and for our ſins that have made God angry, we ſhould cry bitterly; but for them that are gone to Reſt, ſee that we <hi>weep as though we wept not.</hi>

Let this ſerve alſo <hi>to comfort and quiet us against all the labour, toyl and travel that God hath appointed to us in this World.</hi> Work willingly, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour chearfully, bear our Croſs which God lays on us without repining or reluctance, it is but for a little while, <hi>Rest</hi> is a coming.</p>
               <p>It comforts the <hi>Hireling</hi> while he is bearing the heat and burden of the day, that it is but for a <hi>Day,</hi> and when he hath accompliſhed <hi>his Day,</hi> there is a Recompence and Reſt ready for him, when he hath ended his <hi>work,</hi> he ſhall have his <hi>Reward,</hi> and go to his <hi>Reſt.</hi> And as <hi>the Reſt of a labouring man is ſweet,</hi> when it comes, ſo the fore-thoughts of it ſhould be ſweet while he is at work; be ſure it ſhould be ſo with all the Godly. It ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000802_0020_0FAA49FE236C7B40"/>
make every good mans work go off hand with the more content and comfort: I ſhall reſt anon, and the harder my work, the ſweeter my Reſt.</p>
               <p>The Parents of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he was born, by a Spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi> (no doubt Gen. 5.29.) called him <hi>Noah</hi>; promiſing themſelves <hi>Reſt</hi> by him under all their Toyl, <hi>&amp;c. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the true <hi>Noah,</hi> from whom all true <hi>Reſt</hi> comes; he hath by his lying in the Grave made it a place of Reſt; and this ſhould be thought on, together with that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Reſt that Death leads to; and with this ſhould we comfort our ſelves and one another.</p>
               <p>And as this Conſideration ſhould comfort us while we live, ſo it is ſuitable <hi>to make us willing to dye</hi>; yea, to long for Death as much as ever a tired Traveller or weary Labourer did for his bed.</p>
               <p>Alas! for all that lothneſs to dye which is to be found in us, either we are not weary of the world, but have too much content and reſt in it. Or we do not look upon the Grave as a place of Reſt.</p>
               <p>Or we do not conſider the ſweetneſs of that <hi>Reſt</hi>; or we are not well aſſured that it is a Reſt for us; or elſe [<hi>Go thy way and go to Reſt</hi>] would be a ſweet word to us.</p>
               <p>This ſhould make us <hi>Love Death,</hi> be fond of it, embrace it as a very welcome Meſſenger ſent to poor weary Creatures to put them to Bed. We read of ſome who out of their extream miſery, have been <hi>ſeeking Death,</hi> courting the Grave, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a paſſage into the Grave; but how much more earneſt and intenſe ſhould we be, if beſide
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000802_0021_0FAA4A0BC919BA28"/>
the Troubles here to drive us, we had the hope of Reſt to allure us.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Hence alſo, <hi>Pious Friends though gone away are not loſt</hi>; as they are not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſo as not to be, ſo neither are they loſt ſo as not to be found. As to this world, ſo they are loſt never to be ſeen here any more in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity as formerly: <hi>the place that has known them, ſhall know them no more,</hi> they ſhall no more have a Portion in ought that is done under the Sun; but really they are not loſt, they ſhall all be found and ſtand up: Not one Grain ſhall be loſt; all the Dead both ſmall and great ſhall make their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance; and eſpecially none of Chriſts Beloved Ones ſhall be loſt.</p>
               <p>We think it no great matter to take leave of our Friends at Bed Time, yea to look on them and ſee them unclothe themſelves and go to bed, lye down to reſt, we can chearfully bid them good night, expecting to ſee them upon their legs again, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up next morning. It's want of Faith that we do not treat our dying friends accordingly; take leave of them chearfully, wiſhing them a good nights reſt, expecting to ſee them in the <hi>Morning</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> (as Pſal. 49.14.) when the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall ſtand up,</hi> and be uppermoſt too, have dominion over all their Enemies that deſpiſed and trampled upon them in this World.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Hence <hi>there is a peculiar Lott appointed to each after the Reſurrection.</hi> Every one ſhall have his own lot, reward and portion; every one that is written up among the Living ſhall ſtand up unto a Lot, and to that which is his own lot, not another mans.

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. See hence <hi>what ought to be our great care while here,</hi> viz. <hi>after a good Lot then, &amp; our ſtanding therein.</hi> E're long we muſt go into the Grave, where there is no work or device, nothing more to be done, ſave only to receive &amp; take poſſeſſion of our lot anſwerable to the life we have led while
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000802_0024_0FAA4A13287CC2E8"/>
here. <hi>To work cut our Salvation with fear &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> is therefore our buſineſs now, and then our Lot will be anſwerable. Be found in the way that may lead us to the getting a good lot then; we would not then be <hi>gathered with Sinners &amp; bloody</hi> or worldly <hi>men. (Pſal</hi> 26) then do not <hi>caſt in our Lot</hi> with them now, which we may be tempted to, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.14. it is no great matter what we get or loſe here, ſo we may have a good lot there. Here is a great deal of ado among us at this day about our Lots &amp; Lands, what a ſcuffle is there about a little Earth? here is arreſting, pleading, impleading, fending and proving; one pleading his right, &amp; another his, one claiming &amp; another endeavouring to invalidate his claim; and about this how buiſy are men! But be not over ſolicitous here, know that there is a far greater Queſtion in hand, <hi>viz. What ſhall be my Lot and where ſhall it lye in the other World</hi>; &amp; how ſhall I get a good Title to a good Lot there, and how ſhall I maintain it, and ſecure my right againſt all that would diſpoſſeſs me? Oh! let this be the main buſineſs with us. Alas, the beſt Lot that any man has in this world is <hi>Cabul,</hi> a dirty place, &amp; it will coſt more to keep it than its worth, conſidering what ſtriving and contending there is about it: but if thou get a Lot there, God is the maintainer of it; it was purchaſed for thee, and given to thee by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo <hi>reſerved</hi> and kept for thee, that God who hath given it thee is obliged to make good &amp; to warrant his Deed of Gift againſt all Claimers whatſoever. No Writ of Ejection ſhall ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs

thee. And it is a Lot lying in a pleaſant place, and a <hi>goodly Heritage.</hi> It is the <hi>Lot of the Righteous</hi> upon which the <hi>Rod of the Wicked</hi> ſhall not always reſt: A lot which God hath caſt for thee, which Chriſt is gone before as thy <hi>Forerunner, Agent, Advocate,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of for thee, and in thy name &amp; ſtead, if thou be a believer on him, kept for thee, &amp; thou <hi>kept for it &amp; to it, by the mighty power of God thro' Faith unto Salvation.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. Thy Lot there is the <hi>Inheritance among the Saints in Light, Abrahams Boſome,</hi> the <hi>Maſters Joy,</hi> an <hi>Incorruptible Crown,</hi> a <hi>Kingdom prepared,</hi> &amp;c. Then let not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Poſſeſſions, Enjoyments, Profits, Pleaſures, Bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs take up that time, and thoſe thoughts that ſhould be imployed about things of an higher Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port &amp; Concernment. We may conclude our Diſcourſe with this one practical Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What ſhall I do that when called away, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go away, I may be ſure to reſt till the end of Dayes, and then ſtand up in an Happy Lott?</hi> Or how ſhall I ſo live that I may go to reſt when I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from hence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is a great Queſtion, and that which near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns us all.</p>
               <p>In general, I would ſay it is for the Lords faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, his <hi>Daniels,</hi> or <hi>beloved ones,</hi> this <hi>Reſt remains for the People of God,</hi> and that for thoſe that are really not only nominally ſo. It is the <hi>Righteous man,</hi> who when he dyes <hi>enters into his Bed, &amp; Reſts in his Grave,</hi> (Iſa. 57.1, 2.) The Securing to thy ſelf that thou art one of theſe will ſecure the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:000802_0026_0FAA4A14AE1A23A8"/>More particularly take theſe three Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If thou wouldeſt go to Reſt when thou dyeſt, <hi>See that a State of Sin which is a State of Nature be made a Reſtleſs ſtate to thee</hi>: See that thou be not able to reſt in Sin, or in any thing in this World; ſee that nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun quiet or give thee reſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom God brings to reſt when they dye, are ſuch as were diſreſted while alive, driven out of all falſe Reſts that Sinners take up withal in the World. Some reſt in one thing, ſome in another. Some cannot reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they Sin or have done ſome miſchief: Some rejoyce in Iniquity, ſome reſt in the Abundance of the World, fill their Barns &amp; Bags, and then go to reſt; ſome get a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Godlineſs, a Name to live, they hear, read, pray, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and therein they reſt, their Priviledges, their own Righteouſneſs is the <hi>Rest</hi> of many. But the Lords way to give <hi>Reſt</hi> is firſt by diſquieting and diſreſting them in till he brings them out of all other things that ſo he may bring them to the true <hi>Reſt.</hi> Sin ſhall give thee no Reſt, no nor the World, nor any thing therein. If the Lord intend to bring thee to reſt, an Unregenerate Eſtate ſhall be an unquiet State to thee, thou ſhalt find no reſt to the Sole of thy foot, while in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no reſt till got into the Ark, the only place of Reſt If ever God give thee Reſt, Sin ſhall be a meer <hi>Slavery</hi> &amp; <hi>Bondage</hi> to thee, worſe than E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Bondage, under which he will make thee to groan and ſigh and cry till he bring thee out. He will make indwelling Sin, out-breaking Sin, Original Sin, actual Sin, a burden to thee too heavy for thee to bear, if ever he give thee Reſt. This know, that one of the next Mercies to Chriſt, and a Preparatory Mercy in order to the giving of Chriſt &amp; Reſt in him, is to diſreſt in Sin, and for want of Chriſt; nor will he ever bring any to Reſt but in this way. And thou muſt be ſo diſquieted about Sin, that all
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000802_0027_0FAA4A1564BD9808"/>
the World cannot quiet thee, neither pleaſures, profits, honours, company, buſineſs; no nor thy Duties, Prayers, Tears, own Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be able to give thee Reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being thus weary, labouring and reſtleſs, <hi>Come to Christ at his Call,</hi> and his Promiſe is, that <hi>he will give thee Reſt</hi> (Mat. 11.28.) Oh! make that thy buſineſs (as our <hi>Daniel</hi> whoſe Death we are bewailing, ſaid he had done) to ſecure an Intereſt in Chriſt, and there is Reſt. Faith in Chriſt will give thee true Reſt. Faith ſtabliſhes and ſixeth the Heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. Faith in his Power, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Will. And be ſure thou make Chriſt not only the <hi>Refuge,</hi> but the <hi>Reſt</hi> of thy Soul, which no Hypocrite does or can do; ſay of him and to him, <hi>I have none but thee</hi>: he whoſe heart can ſay, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Christ,</hi> ſhall have him and in him Reſt here, and with him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt hereafter. Make uſe of all Bereavements, diſquietments, troubles here to make thee hie away to Chriſt for Reſt. The poor <hi>Dove</hi> found nothing but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all over the face of the Earth, and could not be quiet till gotten to the Ark, where <hi>Noah</hi> was ready to put forth his hand and pull her in. This World hath alwayes been, though at ſome times more than other, it is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea, there is nothing but inſtable Water; uncertain comforts, certain diſquietments; let this Serve to make Chriſt Precious, with whom is certain Reſt.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why thoſe that get into Chriſt ſhall reſt is becauſe he takes away Sin the only cauſe of diſreſt, Sin the ſting of Death, and then <hi>Death cannot ſeparate from the Love of Chriſt,</hi> and where that is muſt needs be Reſt. He that hath ſeen Chriſt and in him obtained Salvation from Sin, he may <hi>depart in peace,</hi> and ſhall <hi>goe to Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Then follow Jeſus Christ <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally, Laboriouſly in all the wayes of New Obedience</hi>; and that will carry thee to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000802_0028_0FAA4A1662898998"/>
Reſt. Thoſe only that followed the Lord fully entered into Reſt, and had a Lott in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they were only two of the Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14 24 with 32.12. If you would Reſt when you dye, work hard for Chriſt while you live. <hi>The Reſt of a Labouring man is ſweet</hi>; then labour with all your might, and that will both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Reſt and make it Sweet. And indeed it is a buiſy World in which we are, here is a great deal of work, much buſineſs to be done for Chriſt, none need ſtand ſtiil for want of work, and none ſhall reſt but thoſe that did work. Lazy, idle, ſlothful Sinners ſhall never goe to reſt: Idleneſs tends to diſreſt, but all regular la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and motion leads to reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the nearer we come to our end the more vigorouſly let us move toward our reſt.</hi> Its obſerved of natural Motions the nearer the Centre the Swifter, ſo let it be with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Are there any of us Aged and Gray-headed, do we ſee the Time of our Diſſolution drawing nigh, are the Shadows of the Evening ſtretcht out upon us, then let us lift up our feet, put on, mend our pace, the Grave is in view, we walk &amp; work in the ſight of our Reſting place, and that ſhould quicken us. It is the laſt day of the Week with many of us, and toward the evening of that alſo, and then comes the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Rest,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, eternal reſt of labouring Believers, thoſe who have been working, their <hi>Works follow them</hi> and yield them <hi>Reſt.</hi> And if the Lord help us now to believe, and that with ſuch a Faith as works by Love, we not only ſhall, but already <hi>doe enter into Reſt.</hi> Heb. 4.3. Troubles in the World we ſhall have, but peace and reſt in Chriſt. Sin diſturbs, fleſh makes us groan, bodily diſeaſes afflict us, toyl &amp; travel in the World tire us, evil Tidings make us afraid, and fears of worſe diſquiet us, but ſtill this Reſt remains ſure. And know that there is a voice of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000802_0029_0FAA4A16E7E760B8"/>
Chriſt in every trouble, loſs, bereavement, is that we come to him for Reſt, he is Father, Mother, Wife, and he is the only Husband in whoſe Houſe we ſhall find Reſt. Oh! let all the Sorrowful, bereaved ones that are ready to ſay with him (Jer. 45.3.) <hi>Wo is me, I faint and find no Reſt</hi>; I ſay, let all ſuch hear Chriſt ſaying, <hi>Come to me and take my Yoke on you and walk</hi> with, and work for me, and <hi>you ſhall find Reſt.</hi> Hearken to this Invitation unto <hi>Reſt,</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> leads to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of, <hi>Obedience</hi> helps to a progreſs in, and <hi>Death</hi> will bring to the full Accompliſhment of. And <hi>let us follow them who through Faith and Patience doe inherit the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>: and for our Imitation, let me Commend to you ſome of the Excellencies found in this <hi>Daniel</hi> of whom the Text ſpeaks, and there were not none of them wanting in our <hi>Daniel,</hi> whoſe Death we are lamenting.</p>
               <p>He is noted for a man of <hi>Great Wiſdom and Prudence,</hi> (Chap 1.) <hi>The Fear of God is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> and the Lord has directed all that want Wiſdom to ask it.</p>
               <p>He was a man of a <hi>Tender Conſcience,</hi> afraid of defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the Portion of the Kings meat. Oh! get and keep a Tender Conſcience, eſpecially in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, tempting and defiling times; a <hi>Tender Conſcience,</hi> eſpecially where there is an inlightened underſtanding, and sound Judgment, is a choice Mercy.</p>
               <p>Again, He was a man <hi>not given to Appetite,</hi> but one whoſe <hi>Moderation</hi> was eminently obvious, he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with <hi>Pulſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Water,</hi> when he might have had Wine and fleſh.</p>
               <p>A man <hi>much in Prayer,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> from which Duty <hi>three Times a day,</hi> the Kings Edict, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being devoured by <hi>Lyons</hi> could not deterr him, yea was converſant alſo in <hi>Fasting and Prayer.</hi> A man of

Prayer, hence mentioned as ſuch an one. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.

               <p>He was a <hi>Thankful man,</hi> as well as a Praying man. See <hi>Chap</hi> 2. &amp; 7.</p>
               <p>A very <hi>Humble, ſelf-denying man</hi>; ſtill gave God the Glory of ought that was done by him: <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Praiſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. So he <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.28, 30. <hi>God revealeth Secrets, and it is not for my Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>above others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was not lifted up by his great Advancement,</hi> ſo as to forget his God, himſelf, or his buſineſs; one of the firſt or beſt of thoſe few that was not the worſe for Worldly greatneſs or advancement, loſt nothing of his Religion by his preferment.</p>
