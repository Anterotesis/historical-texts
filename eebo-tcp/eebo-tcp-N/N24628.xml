            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT cannot be wondered at, though <hi>Wonders</hi> we deal in, why the preſent collection of ſurpriſing ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, partly ſelected from the works of our moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors, and partly original, being written on purpoſe by ſeveral well known characters (both ladies and gentlemen) for this valuable undertaking, is now with profound reverence and due reſpect off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such encouragement well deſerves the public thanks and acknowledgments of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and, in order to prove his ſenſe of the great favors received, of the great encouragement that has been given, he is induced to offer the Wonderful Story-Teller, as a ſupplement to the Wonderful Magazine, preſuming, that the ſtories herein deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, will be found both equally ſurpriſing and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; the Magazine, being confined to ſixty numbers, would not admit theſe additional tales — it was the Editor's wiſh to include them, but ſound it impoſſible; he therefore thought it his duty, as a caterer for the Public, to ſnatch from the ſhelves of oblivion the following pages, and expreſs at the ſame time (though here language is faint) his grateful and moſt humble thanks for the very flattering ſucceſs he has already met with.</p>

The ſerious will be delighted with ſeveral ſentimental hiſtories, and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral intereſting narratives; the lively will diſcover ſuch wit and humour, in ſome of our characters and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heir comic ſituations, as muſt ſurely afford them high diverſion and entertainment. In ſhort, all Readers we hope will find the Wonderful Story Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a good companion, and declare no <hi>better companion</hi> could poſſibly have been provided for the Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magazine.</p>
            <p>All Readers being invited, the <hi>ladies</hi> are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly courted—there is nothing in this whimſical medley that can give the leaſt offence to the utmoſt delicacy, or put the gentle cheeks of mild modeſty to the bluſh: too great is the Editor's regard for female innocence to wound it with any falſe wit; on the contrary, he has ſelected on purpoſe for <hi>their</hi> improvement, ſuch entertaining ſtories, as will prove, he hopes, that "Virtue is its own reward;" and as there is in every tale ſomething of a ſurpriſing, ſtrange, or intereſting tendency, it is preſumed the admittance of each into this volume will be deemed juſt and applicable.</p>
            <p>To ſay more, might, perhaps, be ſaying <hi>too much</hi>; every reader can judge for himſelf, and it is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate arrogance for either writers or compilers to found their own trumpets, and become their own panegyriſts.</p>

               <head>THE HAUNTED HOUSE. A Narrative, founded upon Fact.</head>
               <p>IN a village, ſome diſtance from town, there lived a reſpectable family, who had once occupied an adjoining houſe, which, on account of the frequent knockings and diſturbances they had heard and met with therein, they were under the diſagreeable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of leaving. Mr. Goodwin, the owner thereof, had inceſſantly endeavoured to let it, but in vain, the report was too prevalent, and the houſe became a ſad burden on his hands; he had often advertiſed it, and, indeed, offered it at ſo low a rent, that ſeveral were induced to try it. An old ſoldier, who had more than once buffeted all the dangers of war, now begged permiſſion to lodge in it for a few days upon trial, promiſing, if it were poſſible to inhabit it, that he would immediately take a leaſe on the terms propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032623_0005_0FF3E0461D9666E0"/>Permiſſion was readily granted for this eſſay, and this old follower of Mars, who deemed the whole ſtory but a mere empty report, determined to ſleep by himſelf that night in the houſe; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he left in the day time a loaded piſtol, and a broad ſword, near the room which he intended for his bed-chamber, and ſolaced himſelf with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing idea of having obtained a very comfortable bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; having now properly ſecured the hall door, reſolving that there ſhould be neither egreſs nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, except to himſelf, he went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o take a ſufficient quantity of ſtout beer, and prepare himſelf for the attack.</p>
               <p>It was rather late before he returned, and he went to bed ſomewhat mellow, laughing at all the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe of ghoſts, ſpirits, and hobgoblins. After a ſleep of about two hours, a dreadful noiſe awoke him: he liſtened —and heard a foot aſcending the ſtairs ſo plain, that he thought it expedient to run into the next room for his piſtols; accordingly he armed himſelf with two, one in each hand, and now on the top of the ſtairs, he perceived a horrid figure, which undauntedly ſtood before him, apparently very furious, and nodding with ſeeming anger.</p>
               <p>Our hero repeatedly inquired, who and what he was, whether dead or alive; but there was no anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; he then threatened to fire, which ſo evidently exaſperated the figure, that he ſtamped ſeveral times with his foot againſt the ground, and made ſuch a violent noiſe, that the very ſtair-caſe ſhook with it; the ſoldier preſented and fired, but the figure did not ſeem at all diſmayed; on the contrary, he ſmiled with diſdain; finding this without effect, he now diſcharged the other, which, inſtead of intimidating his unknown antagoniſt, rendered him, if poſſible, more reſolute and fierce; the ſoldier ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpriſed, and apprehended that it was neither fleſh or blood, ſince his piſtols had failed; however, not willing to remain longer defenceleſs, he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his broad ſword: the ſpirit purſued him, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032623_0006_0FF3E04849871A28"/>
ere he could enter the room where it was, gave him ſuch a violent blow, as almoſt felled him to the ground; as ſoon as he had recovered himſelf, for he was very much ſtunned, he looked about him, but the figure had vaniſhed. This event having taken place in the ſummer time, the ſun afforded him an early opportunity of looking about; he went to bed again, with the ſword in his hand, but being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interrupted with noiſes, could ſleep no more. Early in the morning he took leave of this haunted houſe, and began ſeriouſly to think on what had paſſed.</p>
               <p>At breakfaſt his friends were very eager to hear the ſtrange occurrences of the night, for knowing the blunt character of this man, and his diſbelief of ghoſts, they could not doubt the veracity of all he ſaid: he confeſſed there was ſomething exceedingly ſtrange in the buſineſs, and ſufficient indeed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidate the moſt brave, but he was determined to make another attempt; he could not imagine that Heaven would allow the dead to hurt the living, and his face bore ample teſtimony of the ſeverity of the blow. "I forgot," ſays he, "at any rate to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate it, as I am told I ſhould have done—I am therefore reſolved, this night, to have further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and ſatisfy myſelf if the figure be really, or not, ſupernatural."</p>
               <p>This determination was deemed by all his friends exceedingly daring and dangerous, but the ſoldier would not be diſſuaded from his deſign, as his honor, he thought, was too deeply concerned; beſides, he could not bear the idea that an enemy, thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or, what was ſtill worſe, a meer ſhadow, ſhould get the better of him. Another eſſay was therefore looked upon abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The next night he provided himſelf with larger piſtols, and abundance of ball and powder— He did not load till about the time he was going to bed— he left a chair againſt the door, thereby to prove
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032623_0007_0FF3E04BB69B5AD8"/>
whether the thing was ſupernatural, or not; if ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, he ſuppoſed it would enter, as ghoſts are thought to do, through the key-hole, or, at leaſt, without throwing down the chair. However, in the middle of the night, he heard the ſame knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the door opened, and down went the chair, which added not a little to the noiſe. Our hero roſe, ſeized two piſtols, and firſt queſtioning who he was, the figure which was evidently not the ſame he ſaw the preceding night, made no reply; he threatened to fire—</p>
               <p>"Forbear," cried the ſuppoſed ſpirit, "if you will be ſatisfied, follow me."</p>
               <p>"I will," replied the ſoldier, "but obſerve this, that if any danger awaits me, as you are my leader, it is at you therefore I ſhall diſcharge the contents of theſe."</p>
               <p>He followed him—the figure brought him down ſtairs to a private place under ground, where, a clandeſtine door being opened, he was admitted into the preſence of a gang of robbers; the ſoldier ſtill defended himſelf with his piſtols, vowing he would diſcharge them if his life was threatened, but the captain of the gang aſſured him he was ſafe.</p>
               <p>"I am the perſon," cried he, "who gave you the blow laſt night; believe me, I ſhould not have ſo reſolutely ſtood your fire, had I not taken previous care to prevent your piſtols (which you left here) from endangering my life; but you have been too prudent this time. We have long inhabited this place, and made it a practice to deter people from living in the houſe, that our ſtay might be long and uninterrupted; we take it by turns to haunt the houſe. Now, therefore, as we have been ſo far can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did to you, ere you depart from this, you muſt ſwear not to divulge our ſecret within fourteen days, by which time, we ſhall provide ſome other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ourſelves, and give you quiet poſſeſſion of this houſe."</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032623_0008_0FF3E04EF0A5BC40"/>The ſoldier, without any heſitation, agreed to this; upon which his health was drank, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came better acquainted with his <hi>new</hi> friends, for notwithſtanding their occupation, he thought there was ſome honor among them, it being their ſworn rule to make depredations only, but never commit murder, if avoidable; this was certainly evident in their behaviour to him—for doubtleſs they could have deſtroyed him without fear of diſcovery, inſtead of which, they preferred rather making him their friend, and even giving up to him their convenient reſidence.</p>
               <p>The next morning, the ſoldier's friends were very anxious to know his ſucceſs: he amuſed them with a humorous fictitious tale that the ſpirit (which was a <hi>ſpirited</hi> one indeed) confeſſed, upon being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated three times, that he was uneaſy, on account of ſome buſineſs he had omitted doing before he had died, the performance of which would render him now happy, and he would reſt for ever. "I offered my ſervices," added the ſon of Mars—"Thank you," cried he, "you are a very good fellow;"—then he told me what it was, which being enjoined to keep ſecret, I cannot poſſibly reveal; in fourteen days time, however, I ſhall be able to accompliſh it, and then, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall have quiet poſſeſſion of my houſe at an eaſy rent; in order to effect the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he went and made his bargain ſure with the landlord. About the expiration of a fortnight, he went to his houſe, but firſt of all, paid a viſit to the apartment that was under ground; he ſoon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door— he opened it, but the tenants were gone; on the table, there was a letter for him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning him hearty and ſincere thanks for the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable adherence he obſerved to his oath — as a requital for which, a bill for an hundred pounds was encloſed; this, thought the ſoldier, will be great help toward <hi>houſekeeping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His family now came to congratulate him, among
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032623_0009_0FF3E050C039E838"/>
whom was an old ſuperſtitious woman, who hoped he was perfectly convinced that there were ſuch things as ghoſts and apparitions.</p>
               <p>"No," cried our hero, "I am not convinced yet."</p>
               <p>They all wondered at his incredulity, but more ſo, when they heard the real ſtory, and were admitted to the ſecret apartment, which was demonſtration ſufficient of its truth: herein they made merry, and drank a health to the new owner.</p>
               <p>After a few months quiet poſſeſſion, this happy and uninterrupted tenant received the following brief, but pleaſing note, from one of his predeceſſors:
<floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>In the hurry and confuſion of our leaving thoſe under-apartments, which we occupied in your houſe, either without permiſſion or the knowledge of the owner, we omitted taking away a ſmall box that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome bags of gold; you are certainly entitled to the ſame for having ſo honorably kept your word, which you may find under a ſtone that is marked B.

               <head>Remarkable Anecdotes of Dr. YOUNG, Author of "The Night Thoughts."</head>
               <p>DR. Young was rector of Welwyn, in Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; a living worth about five hundred pounds per annum; and though he was in the blaze of court favour, he never had the fortune to riſe to greater preferment. Indeed, during the laſt reign, poetry or real eloquence was but little promoted or encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged from the throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032623_0010_0FF3E05365556F20"/>When the Doctor was pretty far advanced in life, he married the lady Elizabeth Lee, daughter of the late Earl of Litchfield. This lady was a widow, and had two children, a ſon and a daughter, who were both very deſerving, but both died young and in a ſhort time of each other. What he felt for their loſs as well as for that of his wife, we may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by his fine poem of the Night Thoughts, in which they are characterized, the young lady under the name of Narciſſa, her brother by that of Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his wife, though nameleſs, is frequently alluded to. He thus regrets his loſs in his apoſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe to death.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Inſatiate Archer, could not one ſuffice?</l>
                  <l>Thy ſhaft flew thrice, and thrice my peace was ſlain,</l>
                  <l>And thrice, ere thrice yon moon renew'd her horn.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Of Dr. Young's tragedies, the <hi>Revenge</hi> is the beſt. This play met with very great ſucceſs. The deſign of it ſeems to have been borrowed partly from Shakeſpear's Othello, and partly from Mrs. Behn's Abdallazar; the plot bearing many marks of the former; and the principal character Zanga, of the latter. Yet it will not ſurely be ſaying too much, when we affirm that Dr. Young has in many reſpects improved his originals. If we compare the Iago in one, with the Zanga in the other tragedy, we ſhall find the motives of reſentment greatly different, and thoſe of Young much more juſtly as well as more nobly founded, than thoſe of Shakeſpear. Iago's cauſe of reſentment againſt Othello, is only his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet a younger officer over his head, and on a particular and ſingle vacancy, notwithſtanding he himſelf has reaſon to expect a poſt of equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. To this is added, a ſlight ſuſpicion of Othello's having been too intimate with his wife. But Zanga's cauſe of anger is quite different. The death of his father, ſlain by Alonzo, the loſs of a kingdom in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032623_0011_0FF3E055D4772A90"/>
conſequence of his ſucceſs, and the indignity of a blow received from the ſame hand; all theſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated injuries, added to the impoſſibility of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a noble means of revenge, urge him, againſt his will, to the more ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le and underhand methods he employs. Othello's jealouſy is raiſed by trifles, and by appearing too credulous, he forfeits that pity which his diſtreſſes would otherwiſe demand. Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, on the contrary, long ſtruggles againſt conviction, nor proceeds to extremities, till he finds <hi>proofs riſe on proofs, and ſtill the laſt the ſtrongeſt.</hi> In a word, we may aſſign this piece with great juſtice, a place in the very firſt rank of dramatic writings, and were we to ſhew foreigners a tragedy as a ſample of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh genius, after two or three others, we ſhould produce the Revenge, written by Dr. Young, as a ſpecimen.</p>
               <p>As a poet, the Doctor was conſidered as the only palladium of ancient genius; and as a Chriſtian, one of the fineſt examples of primeval piety. The turn of his mind was naturally ſolemn, and he uſually, when at home in the country, ſpent many hours of the day walking in his own church-yard among the tombs. His converſation, his writings, had all a reference to the life after this; and this turn of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition mixed itſelf even with his improvements in gardening. He had, for inſtance, an alcove with a bench ſo painted near his houſe, that at a diſtance it looked like a real one, which the ſpectator was then approaching. Upon coming up near it, the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was perceived, and this motto appeared:
<q>Inviſibilia non decipiunt.</q>
Tranſlated,
<q>The things unſeen do not deceive us.</q>
Yet, nowithſtanding this gloomineſs of temper, he was fond of innocent ſports and amuſements; he inſtituted an aſſembly and a bowling-green in his pariſh, and often promoted the gaiety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:032623_0012_0FF3E059484084B0"/>His wit was very poignant, and always levelled at thoſe who expreſſed any contempt for decency and religion. His epigram ſpoken extempore on Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire, is well known, who happening in his company to ridicule Milton, and the allegorical perſonage of Death and Sin; Young thus addreſſed him:
<q>
                     <l>Thou art ſo witty, profligate, and thin,</l>
                     <l>You ſeem a Milton with his Death and Sin.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When he firſt publiſhed his admirable Night Thoughts, either through modeſty, or for ſome other reaſon, he choſe to conceal his name as the author, and publiſhed them in numbers. Sir Jeremy Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke, a Baronet of great integrity, and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his hoſpitality, lived about ſeven miles from the Doctor, but ſo great was their intimacy, that the Doctor uſed daily, when the weather permitted, to dine at Sir Jeremy's table. The Baronet was totally blind, yet very facetious, and a competent judge of men and books. He employed his nephew, who reſided in London, to ſend him down weekly, all the new publications. Among others, the firſt number of the Night Thoughts made its appearance. Sir Jeremy deſired Dr. Young would read it, which he accordingly did, and we may be ſure with great propriety, as none can read works better than the authors of them. The approbation of the company was teſtified in an extraordinary manner, and they were all very deſirous of knowing the author; ſome little time afterwards Dr. Young left the room to walk in the garden. Upon which Lady Judy Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke ſaid, "Brother, I believe I have found out the author of that excellent piece of poetry the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has been reading." "Ah, ſiſter Judy," ſaid Sir Jeremy, "how came you to be ſo much before-hand with us in your diſcoveries; pray, who is the author?" "Why," ſaid ſhe, "the Gentleman who read it is the author of it. And I have this reaſon for thinking ſo; I perceived the Doctor take
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032623_0013_0FF3E05BE0A3D5C0"/>
his eyes from the book, and repeat three or four lines without looking at it, now you will judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not he could do that upon the firſt ſight of a new publication, unleſs he was the author of it." When the Doctor returned, Sir Jeremy ſaid to him, "Dr. Young, I am much indebted to you for <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that incomparable work, but much more ſo for <hi>writing</hi> it."</p>

               <p>THE kingdom of Gurrat in Hindoſtan was gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by queen Dargocette, eminent for ſpirit and beauty. Small as that kingdom is, it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about ſeventy thouſand towns and villages, the effect of long peace and proſperity. Being invaded by Aſaph Can, not many years ago, the queen mounted on an elephant, led her troops to battle. Her ſon Rajah Bier Shaw, being wounded in the heat of action, was by her orders carried from the field. That accident having occaſioned a general panic, the queen was left with no more than three hundred horſemen. Adhar, who conducted her elephant, exhorted her to retire, while it could be done with ſafety. The heroine rejected the advice. "It is true," ſaid ſhe, "we are overcome in battle; but not in honour. Shall I, for a lingering ignomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious life, loſe a reputation that has been my chief ſtudy!

poor creatures are ſuffered to toil in the fields and woods, ready to faint with exceſſive labour, while the monſters of men will not give themſelves even the trouble of training animals for work, though they have the example of the Portugueſe before their eyes.</p>
               <p>It is the buſineſs of the women among the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Arabs of Africa, to card, ſpin, and weave, and to manage other houſhold affairs. They milk the cattle, grind, bake, brew, dreſs the victuals, and bring home wood and water. They even take care of their huſbands' horſes, feed, curry, comb, bridle and ſaddle them. They would alſo, like Mooriſh wives, be obliged to dig, ſow, and reap their corn, but luckily for them, the Arabs live entirely upon plunder. Father Joſeph Gumilla, in his account of a country in South America, bordering upon the great river Oronooko, deſcribes pathetically the miſerable ſlavery of married women there, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a practice that would appear incredible to one unacquainted with the manners of that country; which is, that married women frequently deſtroy their female infants. A married woman of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous character and a good underſtanding, having been guilty of that crime, was reproached by our author in very bitter terms. She heard him patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end of his diſcourſe with eyes fixed on the ground, and anſwered as follows: "I wiſh to God. Sir, I wiſh to God, that my mother had by my death, prevented the manifold diſtreſſes I have endured, and have yet to endure as long as I live. Had ſhe kindly ſtifled me at my birth, I ſhould not have felt the pain of death, nor numberleſs other pains to which life hath ſubjected me. Conſider, father, our deplorable condition. Our huſbands go out to hunt with their bows and arrows, and trouble themſelves no farther. We are dragged along with one infant at our breaſt, and another in a baſket.

with the burthen of our children; and though tired out with a long march, are not permitted to ſleep, but muſt labour the whole night in grinding maize to make chica for them. They get drunk, and in their drunkenneſs they beat us, draw us by the hair of the head, and tread us under foot. And what have we to comfort us for ſlavery, perhaps of twenty years? A young wife is brought in upon us, who is permitted to abuſe us and our children, becauſe we are no longer regarded. Can human nature endure ſuch tyranny? What kindneſs can we ſhew to our female children, equal to that of delivering them from ſuch ſervitude, more bitter a thouſand times than death? I ſay again, would to God that my mother had put me under ground the moment I was born."</p>

               <p>HERODOTUS ſays, that a Scythian preſents the King with the heads of the enemies he has killed in battle; and the man who does not bring a head, gets no ſhare of the plunder. He adds, that many Scythians clothe themſelves with the ſkins
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032623_0016_0FF3E064AC7AE2F8"/>
of men, and make uſe of the ſkulls of their enemies to drink out of. Diodorus Siculus reports of the Gauls, that they carry home the heads of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſlain in battle; and after embalming them, depoſit them in cheſts as their chief trophy, bragg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſums offered for theſe heads by the friends of the deceaſed, and refuſed.</p>
               <p>No ſavages were more cruel than the Greeks and Trojans, as deſcribed by Homer; men were butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in cold blood, towns were reduced to aſhes, ſovereigns were expoſed to the moſt humiliating indignities, and no reſpect was paid to age or ſex. The young Adraſtus thrown from his car, and lying in his face in the duſt, obtained quarter from Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus. Agamemnon upbraided his brother for leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: "Let none from deſtruction eſcape," ſaid he, "not even the liſping infant in the mother's arms: all her ſons muſt with Illium fall, and on her ruins unburied remain." He pierced the ſuppliant with his ſpear, and ſetting his foot on the body pulled it out.</p>
               <p>Hector having ſtript Patroclus of his arms, drags the ſlain along, vowing to lop the head from the trunk, and to give the mangled corſe a prey to the dogs of Troy. And the 17th book of the Illiad is wholly employed in deſcribing the conteſt about the body, between the Greeks and the Trojans.</p>
               <p>Beſides the brutality of preventing the laſt duties from being performed to a dead friend, it is a low ſcene, unworthy of heroes. It was equally brutal in Achilles, to drag the corſe of Hector to the ſhips, tied to his car.

Prometheus makes free with the heavenly fire, in order to give life to man. As a puniſhment for bringing rational creatures into exiſtence, the gods decree, that he be chained to a rock and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to birds of prey. Vulcan is introduced by Eſchylus rattling the chain, nailing one end to a rock, and the other to the breaſt-bone of the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal. Who but an American ſavage, can now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch a ſpectacle, without being ſhocked at it! A ſcene repreſenting a woman murdered by her children would be hiſſed by every modern audience, and yet that horrid ſcene was repreſented with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in the Electra of Sophocles. Menander ſays, that even the gods cannot inſpire a ſoldier with civility; no wonder that the Greek ſoldiers were brutes and barbarians, when war was waged, not only againſt the ſtate, but againſt every individual.</p>
               <p>The Greeks are the leſs excuſable for their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they appear to have been ſenſible, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is a cardinal virtue. Barbarians are always painted by Homer, as cruel; poliſhed nations as tender and compaſſionate.</p>

               <p>That cruelty was predominant among the Romans, is evident from every one of their hiſtorians. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond triumvirate, horrid cruelties were every day perpetrated without pity or remorſe. Anthony having ordered Cicero to be beheaded, and the head being brought to him, viewed it with ſavage pleaſure. His wife Fulvia, laid hold of it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032623_0018_0FF3E068AEBA47C0"/>
and ſtruck it on the face, uttered many bitter exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, and having placed it between her knees, drew out the tongue and pierced it with a bodkin.</p>
               <p>The following inſtance of barbarity excels any already mentioned.</p>
               <p>Madam Lapouchin, the great ornament of the court of Peterſburg, during the reign of the Empreſs Elizabeth, having contracted an intimacy with a foreign ambaſſador, was brought under ſuſpicion of plotting with him againſt the government, and was accordingly condemned to undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the knout. At the place of execution ſhe appeared in a genteel undreſs, which heightened her beauty. Of whatever indiſcretion ſhe might have been guilty, the ſweetneſs of her countenance, and her compoſure, left not in the ſpectators the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuſpicion of guilt. Her youth alſo, her beauty, her life and ſpirit pleaded for her. But all in vain: ſhe was deſerted by all, and abandoned to ſurly executioners, whom ſhe beheld with aſtoniſhment, ſeeming to doubt whether ſuch preparations were intended for her. The cloak that covered her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom being pulled off, modeſty took the alarm, and made her ſtart back: ſhe turned pale, and burſt into tears. One of the executioners ſtripped her naked to the waiſt, ſeized her by both hands, and threw her on his back, raiſing her ſome inches from the ground. The other executioner laying hold of her delicate limbs with his rough fiſts, put her in a poſture for receiving the puniſhment. Then laying hold of the knout, a ſort of whip made of a leather ſtrap, 'he retreated a few ſteps, and with a ſingle ſtroke tore off a ſlip of ſkin from the neck down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, repeating his ſtrokes till all the ſkin of her back was cut off in ſmall ſlips. The executioner finiſhed his taſk by cutting out her tongue; after which ſhe was baniſhed to Siberia.</p>
               <p>The preſent Empreſs of Ruſſia, has laid an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation for civilizing her people, which is a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032623_0019_0FF3E06A52415AE8"/>

Peter I. reformed many bad cuſtoms; but being rough in his own manners, he left the manners of his people as he found them.

               <p>WHEN Monſ. Thurot, during our late war with France, appeared on the coaſt of Scotland with three armed veſſels, the terror he at firſt ſpread, ſoon yielded to admiration, inſpired by his human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. He paid a full price for every thing he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in general behaved with ſo much affability, that a countryman ventured to complain to him of an officer who had taken from him fifty or ſixty guineas. The officer acknowledged the fact; but ſaid, that he had divided the money among his men. Thurot ordered the officer to give his bill for the money, which he ſaid, ſhould be ſtopped out of his pay, if they were ſo fortunate as to return to France. Compare this incident with that of the great Scipio, celebrated in Roman ſtory, who reſtored a beautiful bride to the bridegroom, and it will not ſuffer by the compariſon. Another inſtance is no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. One of his officers gave a bill upon a merchant in France, for the price of proviſions pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by him. Thurot having accidentally ſeen the bill, informed the countryman, that it was of no value, reprimanded the officer bitterly for the cheat, and compelled him to give a bill upon a merchant
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032623_0020_0FF3E06E881EE738"/>
whom he knew would pay the money. At that very time, Thurot's men were in bad humour, and were diſpoſed to mutiny. In ſuch circumſtances, would not Thurot have been excuſed, for winking at a fraud to which he was not acceſſary? But he acted all along with the ſtricteſt honour, even at the hazard of a mutiny. Common honeſty to an enemy is not a common practice in war. Thurot was ſtrictly honeſt in circumſtances that made the exertion of common honeſty an act of the higheſt magnanimity. Theſe incidents ought to be held up to princes as examples of true heroiſm. War car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in that manner, would, from deſolation and horror, be converted into a fair field for acquiring true military glory, and for exerciſing every manly virtue.</p>
               <p>This great man will be kept in remembrance by every true-hearted Briton; though he died fighting againſt us. But he died in the field of honour, fighting for his country.</p>
               <p>The policy of the Greeks and Romans in war, was to weaken the ſtate by deſtroying its people. Humanity with us prevails even in war. Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als not in arms are ſecure, which ſaves much inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood. Priſoners were formerly ſet at liberty by paying a ranſom, and by later improvements in manners, even that practice is left off, as too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile, and a more honourable one is inſtituted, that of exchanging priſoners. Humanity was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a ſtill greater height in our late war with France, by an agreement between the Duke de Noailles and the Earl of Stair, that the hoſpitals for the ſick and wounded ſoldiers ſhould be free from all hoſtiliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the French troops were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to abandon their conqueſts in the electorate of Hanover, their Generals every where burnt their magazines and plundered their people. The Duke ne Raudan, who commanded in the city of Hanover, put the magiſtrates in poſſeſſion of his magazines,

requeſting to diſtribute their contents among the poor; and he was beſides extremely vigilant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſoldiers from committing acts of violence. As we prize humanity wherever it is exerciſed, we cannot help expreſſing a wiſh, that the American General Lincoln, and the French Count D'Eſtaing, had given us ſome ſpecimen of it in their late attack upon Savannah; on the contrary, we are ſorry to ſay, that they refuſed a veſſel to convey away the women and children, which was requeſted of theſe commanders, in order that they might not be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the horrors of a ſiege.</p>

               <head>The FRENCH Lover.</head>
               <p>THE Marquis De F. was on the point of being married. He called at Dr. M's lodgings in Paris a few days ago. His air was ſo very gay, that Dr. M. imagined he had ſome agreeable news to communicate. <hi>Me voilà au déſeſpair, mon cher ami,</hi> (Behold me in deſpair, my dear friend) ſaid he, with a loud laugh. You are the merrieſt man I ever ſaw in that ſituation, ſaid Dr. M. He then ſaid that the old Marquis de R. his miſtreſs's father, had waited on his mother, and after ten thouſand apologies and circumlocutions, had given her to underſtand that certain things had intervened, which rendered it impoſſible that he ſhould ever have the honour of being father-in-law to her ſon, and requeſted her to inform him, how infinitely eaſy he and all his family were, at an incident which deprived them of the pleaſure they had expected from that connection. His mother, he ſaid, had endeavoured to diſcover the incident which had produced this alteration, but to no purpoſe. The old gentleman contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with aſſuring her that the particulars would be equally diſagreeable and ſuperfluous, and then took
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032623_0022_0FF3E072C77BB5E0"/>
his leave in the moſt polite and affectionate terms that the French language could furniſh him with.</p>
               <p>The Marquis de F. told Dr. M. this with an air ſo eaſy and contented, that the Doctor did not well know what to make of it. My dear Marquis, ſaid he, it is fortunate that I have been miſtaken, for you muſt know I had taken it into my head that you were fond of the lady. You were in the right, my friend, ſaid the Marquis, <hi>Je l'aimai infiniment,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My mother, added he, who is the beſt creature in the world, and whom I love with all my ſoul, told me this marriage would make her quite happy. All my uncles and aunts and couſins for ten genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions told me the ſame. I was informed, over and above, that the lady, her father, and all her relations, wiſhed this alliance with the moſt obliging earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Why ſhould I refuſe to do a thing which will pleaſe ſo many people, without being in the ſmalleſt degree diſpleaſing to myſelf?—To be ſure, ſaid Dr. M. that would have been ill-natured. It was lucky, however, that you happened to be perfectly diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and did not prefer any other woman.</p>
               <p>You miſtake, my friend, ſaid he, I preferred many to the lady in queſtion, and one in particular, whoſe name I will not mention, but whom I love, whom

               <p>MY friend the Count de L. called on me at Paris, a few days ſince, and as ſoon as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that I had no particular engagement, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that I ſhould drive ſomewhere into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, dine tete-a-tete with him, and return in time for the play.</p>
               <p>When we had driven a few miles I perceived a genteel-looking young fellow dreſſed in an old uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. He ſat under a tree, on the graſs, at a little

diſtance from the road, and amuſed himſelf by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the violin. As we came nearer we perceived he had a wooden leg, part of which lay in fragments by his ſide. —What do you there, ſoldier? ſaid the Count. I am on the way home to my own village, <hi>mon officer,</hi> ſaid the ſoldier. But my good friend, ſaid the Count, you will be a long time before you arrive at your journey's end, if you have no other carriage beſides theſe, pointing to the fragments of his broken leg. I wait for my equipage and all my ſuite, ſaid the ſoldier; and I am greatly miſtaken if I do not ſee them this moment coming down the hill.</p>
               <p>We ſaw a kind of cart drawn by one horſe, in which was a woman and a peaſant that drove the horſe. While they drew near, the ſoldier told us he had been wounded in Corſica, that his leg had been cut off; that before ſetting out on that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he had been contracted to a young woman in the neighbourhood, that the marriage had been poſtponed to his return; but when he appeared with the wooden leg, all the girl's relations oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the match. The girl's mother, who was her only ſurviving parent, when he began his courtſhip had always been his friend, but ſhe had died whilſt he was abroad. The young woman herſelf, however, remained firm in her affections, received him with open arms, and had agreed to leave her relations and accompany him to Paris, from whence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet out in the Diligence to the town where he was born, and where his father ſtill lived.

If they had made a little, however, ſaid the Marquis, you would not have been ſingular in your way of thinking; but <hi>allons,</hi> continued he, addreſſing himſelf to me.

               <p>AT a certain parade where the Sovereign himſelf was preſent, and many officers aſſembled, a corpulent general officer ſuddenly ſtarted, as if he had ſeen ſomething preternatural. He immediately waddled towards the ranks with all the expedition of a terrified gander. It was ſurpriſing to the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, what had put his excellency into a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo little ſuitable to his years and habit of body. While they were on tip-toe to obſerve the iſſue of this phaenomenon, he arrived at the ranks, and in great wrath, which probably had been augmented by the heat acquired in his courſe, he pulled off one of the ſoldiers hats, which it ſeems had not been properly cocked, and adjuſted it to his mind. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regulated the military diſcipline in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant particular, he returned to the Prince's right hand, with a ſtrut expreſſive of the higheſt ſelf-approbation.</p>
               <p>At Heidelberg in Germany, not only the ſoldiers' muſquets and the attitudes of their bodies, but alſo their devotions are under the direction of the Major's cane. The following motions are performed, as part of the military manouvres every day, before

the troops are marched to their different guards. The Major flouriſhes his cane, the drum beats a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle tap, and every man under arms raiſes his hand to his hat; at a ſecond ſtroke on the drum, they take off their hats, and are ſuppoſed to pray: at a third they finiſh their petitions, and put their hats on their heads. If any man her the aſſurance to prolong his prayer a minute longer than the drum indicates, he is puniſhed on the ſpot, and taught to be leſs devout in future. The ingenious inventor of drums certainly never dreamt of their becoming the regulators of people's piety. But the modern improvements in the military art are very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! and we need not deſpair after this, of ſeeing a whole regiment, by the proof of diſcipline, ſo mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled as to eat, drink, and perform other animal func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, uniformly together at the word of command, as they poiſe their firelocks.</p>

                  </gap>emed to be the reſidence of ſome prince or biſhop at leaſt. I was ſurpriſed I never had heard it ſpoken of, as it had a more magnificent appearance than any modern building I had ſeen in Germany. I rode up, and upon entering it, found that the apartments within (though not laid out in the beſt taſte) ſeemed to correſpond in point of expence with the external appearance.</p>
               <p>I was informed by the workmen, who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in finiſhing theſe apartments, that this pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace belonged to a Tobacconiſt in Frankfort, where he ſtill kept a ſhop, and had accumulated a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fortune by making and ſelling ſnuff.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032623_0030_0FF3E088D936BE10"/>Near to the principal houſe is another great build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended for a workhouſe, in which tobacco is to be manufactured, with many apartments for the workmen, and vaulted cellars in which the various kinds of ſnuff are to be kept moiſt, till ſent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſale to Frankfort, or ſhipped at the Maine for foreign markets.</p>
               <p>The owner informed me, that there were exactly three hundred rooms in both buildings, and the greater number of theſe belonged to the dwelling-houſe. I did not chuſe to puzzle the man by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult queſtions, and therefore refrained from inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what uſe he intended to make of ſuch an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing number of rooms, which ſeemed rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as barracks for two or three thouſand ſoldiers, than for any other purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When I returned to town I was informed, that this perſon is not a native of Frankfort, though he has been many years eſtabliſhed there, and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the magiſtrates for liberty to purchaſe a certain ſpot of ground, on which he propoſed to build a dwelling-houſe, &amp;c. which cannot be done without the conſent of the magiſtrates. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſed, he bought a piece of land in the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mentz, immediately beyond that of Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and on the banks of the Maine; and being highly piqued by the refuſal he had met with from the magiſtrates, he reared a building greatly larger and more extenſive than was neceſſary, or than he firſt intended, in full perſuaſion that the remorſe of the magiſtrates would be in proportion to the ſize of his fabric. The Tobacconiſt has already expended Fifty thouſand pounds on this temple of vengeance, and his wrath againſt the magiſtrates ſeems ſtill unappeaſed, for he continues to laviſh his money with a rancour againſt theſe unfortunate men, that is very unbecoming a Chriſtian.

               <p>A French poſtillion is generally either laughing or fretting, or ſinging or ſwearing, all the time he is on the road. If a hill or a bad road oblige him to go ſlow, he will of a ſudden fall a cracking his whip over his head for a quarter of an hour together, without rhime or reaſon; for he knows the horſes cannot go a bit faſter, neither does he mean they ſhould.

               <p>THE character of a ſovereign at every court, has great influence in forming the taſte and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of courtiers. This muſt operate with increaſed force in the little court of Germany, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are brought nearer to each other, and ſpend moſt of their time together. The pleaſure which the Ducheſs of Brunſwick takes in ſtudy, has made reading very faſhionable among the ladies of the court. The following curious inſtance is a ſufficient proof of it:</p>
               <p>A lady whoſe education had been neglected in her youth, and who had arrived at a very ripe age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving any inconvenience from the accident, had obtained by the intereſt of ſome of her relations, a place at the court of Brunſwick. She had not been there long before ſhe perceived that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the Ducheſs' apartments frequently turned upon ſubjects of which ſhe was intirely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and that thoſe ladies had moſt of her Royal Highneſs' ear who were beſt acquainted with books. She regreted for the firſt time, the neglect of her own education, and although ſhe had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that kind of knowledge, which is derived from reading as unbecoming a woman of quality, yet as it was now faſhionable at court ſhe reſolved to ſtudy hard, that ſhe might get on the top of the mode as faſt as poſſible. She mentioned this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ducheſs, deſiring at the ſame time that her Highneſs would lend her a book to begin. The

Ducheſs applauded her deſign, and promiſed to ſend one of the moſt uſeful in her library, it was a French and German dictionary. Some days after, her Highneſs enquired how ſhe reliſhed the book. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, replied this ſtudious lady. It is the moſt delightful book I ever ſaw. The ſentences are all ſhort and eaſily underſtood, and the letters charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly arranged in ranks like ſoldiers on the parade; whereas in ſome other books which I have ſeen, they are mingled together in a confuſed manner like a mob, ſo that it is no pleaſure to look at them, and very difficult to know what they mean.

Beeoming gradually weaker by the increaſe of the diſtemper, he could not ſit, but was obliged to lie on a couch through the day. When at any time he was uncommonly languid, they raiſed his head to the window, and a ſight of the men under arms was perceived to operate like a cordial to his fainting ſpirits. By frequent repetition, however, even this cordial loſt its effect. His eyes became dim when his head was raiſed, he could no longer perceive his ſoldiers, and he expired.</p>

               <p>I know ſome preciſe Doctors are againſt all invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſaints; at preſent I ſhall not diſpute with them; but they muſt grant me, that there is much more to be ſaid in juſtification of ſuch a prayer to the gout, than can be ſaid for the offices directed to any other ſaints, not excepting the virgin. I defy their worſhipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs to prove, that there has been the tithe of ſo much good done by them all; as I ſhall prove has been done by the beneficial gout.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The gout gives a man pain without danger. Pain without danger is a bleſſed thing. For inſtance, ſuffering under a painful threatning diſtemper. What is the firſt queſtion, (Doctor pray be plain with me, and let me truly know what I am to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, don't flatter a ſick man, but tell me) Am I likely to recover or not? The pain he ſuffers, you ſee does not at all trouble him, he is only afraid he ſhall die, ſecure him from that danger, and all is well with him.</p>
               <p>When the Doctor comes (the phyſician of the ſoul I mean, whoſe coming bodes no good to the body) he tells the patient a long ſtory of the pains and miſeries of life, in order to make his <hi>nunc dimittis</hi> go down the eaſier; but that method ſeldom is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs, for he is contented to live, and will take his chance for the reſt.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that gouty perſons eſcape death no more than any other men, which is very true, but that is becauſe men are fools, and do not know when they are ſafe; they muſt be curing the gout forſooth, and on this account deal with the Doctor, who is the purveyor of the grave, and good at cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining nothing but living bodies into duſt and aſhes. Let every one bear his own burden; the gout has nothing to do with the carnage of a Doctor; and now, Sir, let me tell you a ſtory, the famous Willis
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032623_0036_0FF3E09B6E13F5A0"/>
ſhall be my voucher, who diſſected the body of the learned, reverend, and pious Dr. Hammond, killed purely by his friend, who unhappily taught him a medicine to cure the gout; upon the ſucceſs of that medicine, the Doctor's old <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ephritic</hi> pains returned, and in a fortnight diſpatched him.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Sir, for your own ſake, for your lady's ſake, and for your children's ſake, welcome the gout to your houſe, and if you ſhut all the doors againſt the phyſician, I will warrant you for upwards of a hundred. How glad ſhall I be to ſee them pull chalk-ſtones out of your worſhip's feet, ſome forty or fifty years hence; by that time you will have learned ſo much patience as never to roar for the matter. But if you do roar, they who look on, if they love life, will envy, not pity you. Indeed you are already a fit object for the envy of thinking men, for I have heard you confeſs, that your's is an hered<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary gout, and that is for the better; an hereditary gout is a far greater happineſs than an acquired one; what a deal of intemperance, and amorous exceſſes might it have coſt your worſhip to have got the gout before forty? Whereas now you have got the mighty bleſſing for nothing; it is your birth-right, Sir; never think of parting with it.</p>
               <p>Second, The gout is no conſtant companion, but allows his patient lucid joyous intervals.</p>
               <p>Human nature is ſo framed, that no one thing is agreeable to it always, therefore it is well for us that the world is ſo full of changes; the earth we tread on, the ſeas we ſail on, the air we breathe in, the ſtarry firmament expanded round us, have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual viciſſitudes which make all for our advantage and delight. How welcome is a gueſt that knows when to be gone? But, if his ſtay be longer than ordinary, we are ready to thruſt him out of doors. Whatever ſome impatient weak minds may think, it is manifeſt, that the gout, by his coming and going, takes the right courſe to be very agreeable and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032623_0037_0FF3E09D1D660810"/>
Weak people may curſe the gout, and wiſh to be wholly excuſed from his intermitting viſits; but I look upon ſuch people, as men who are weary of the world, and being willing to leave it, I grant they have reaſon to be angry with the gout, that folds their mortality ſo faſt about them.</p>
               <p>Courage, Sir, and be adviſed by me, it is good advice I am giving, and you ſhall have it gratis. When your foot ſwells, and burns, and throbs, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh all fooliſh ſorrow and repining; inſtead whereof, let ſwelling joys dilate your generous breaſt; when ſharp fermenting juices ſhall meet, and by their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conteſt cauſe cruel twitchings of your nervous fibres, comfort your heart and be extremely pleaſed; but touch not, taſte not the Doctor's emulſions, julips, &amp;c. ſo let your friend the gout take his courſe and maul you ſoundly. O! ſo eaſy, ſo pleaſed, ſo joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo happy, ſo bleſſed will you be, when the turn of health ſhall come; why, Sir, you will be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while you are on earth; you will be entirely beatified on this ſide the grave. I am of opinion, Sir, that you are nearly converted to my ſentiments already, but for fear that you are not a complete proſelyte, I will proceed to the third head; I have no doubt, before I have done with you, to make you rather part with your eyes than your true friend.</p>
               <p>Third, The gout preſents you with a perpetual almanack; and that it never may be out of the way, but ready always for your worſhip's uſe, ſafely depoſits it in the <hi>internodia</hi> of your bones. Barom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eters, thermometers, and others the inventions of men, not yet perfect maſters of their arts, ſerve more for the delight, than the uſe of the curious; but the uſeful pains of the gout, give your honour truſty prognoſtics of the ſeaſon. As often as a moiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the year, ſouth or north winds, or ſnow are at hand, you predict thoſe things from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of your pains; and by the abſence of your pains, you forbode the contrary; ſo one way or other your <hi>bone almanack</hi> ſerves for all changes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:032623_0038_0FF3E09F236C67B8"/>Fourth, Gouty perſons are moſt free from the head-ach.</p>
               <p>The heavy recrement of the blood and nervous juice, always fall downwards to the gouty joints. Perſons much favoured by the gout, upon every long abſence of that beſt friend, (whether occaſioned by unknown accidents, or unwiſe recourſes to the Doctor) exchange their freedom from the gout, for pain more intenſe and dangerous; but of all other pains, they are extremely ſubject to the head-ach; but as ſoon as ever the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut pleaſes to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſit them, (forgiving their ingratitude) preſently the weather breaks up, the nerves are relaxed, the ſibres unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, the membranes and muſcles recover their right tone, while the inimicous conteſting particles are thrown down to the remote parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Fifth, The gout preſerves its patients from the great danger of fevers.</p>
               <p>Gouty perſons, as they live free from the dreadful pains of the head-ach, ſo likewiſe from the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of fevers. There is not certainly a ſeverer torment than a burning fever, nor a more ſovereign antidote than the medicinal gout; ſo that it is a truth clear as the ſun, if more people had the gout, fewer would die of a fever. Having placed theſe things in a light ſo forcible, I am ſtrongly perſuaded that not your worſhip only, but the generality of the age will put their prejudice aſide, and yield to the truth here aſcertained; and inſtead of the old parting compliments, "<hi>Save you, Sir; God keep you in good health</hi>" — I queſtion not but we ſhall ſay, "<hi>The gout d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d you, Sir; God give you the gout</hi> —" for we ought not to hope for a bleſſing without the means. To wiſh a man the gout, is to wiſh him that which withdraws fuel from diſeaſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves life at ſo cheap a rate, it coſts a man nothing but patience.</p>
               <p>It has been the opinion of ſome writers, that none can be ſaved who die of the plague; but in judging
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032623_0039_0FF3E0A11059DE08"/>
of the future ſtate of others, I think it beſt to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being miſtaken on the charitable ſide; and therefore I would ſooner believe, that none can be damned who have the gout; and I muſt tell your worſhip, that I have known a leſs probable ſign of ſalvation given by a clergyman to his hearers.</p>
               <p>Sixth, To crown the honour of the gout, it is not to be cured.</p>
               <p>The gout defies all your groſs Galenical methods, and all your exalted chymical preparations; for the conjunct cauſes thereof lie in parts ſo very remote, that the virtues of no medicines can reach them, and Heaven be praiſed for it; for why, Sir, would you cure (as you call it) the gout, which gives you pain without danger; a better taſte of health by an acquaintance with pain, a knowledge of future things, freedom from the head-ach, and from ſevers? I hope, my dear friend, you and I ſhall be better adviſed than to tamper with the gout, which really is not to be cured. The fear of loſing a bleſſing, takes off from the pleaſure of enjoying it. Thieves may plunder your houſe, age will ruin your beauty, envy may hurt your reputation, bribes corrupt your faith; but the gout is a ſure inheritance, neither thieves nor knaves, neither time nor envy, nor any thing elſe can deprive you of it. They ſay there is more care and trouble in keeping an eſtate than in getting it; as for the gout, there may be ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in getting it, though that is mixed with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too; but no man is put to the leaſt care or trouble for the ſafe keeping of the gout; he may endure miſery enough indeed, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You cannot be always young and handſome, but gouty once, and gouty always, thence came the proverb, "<hi>Drink claret and have the gout; and drink no claret and ſtill have it.</hi>" The gout, it is true, is the reward of ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Captain, whoſe leg was hanging by the ſkin, ſaid to the Admiral, "Indeed, Sir, this was a cruel ſhot, to knock down both father and ſon." Mr. Watſon's heart was too full for a reply; he only ordered both to be carried down to the ſurgeon. The Captain, who was firſt brought down, told Mr.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032623_0042_0FF3E0AA53B6DC18"/>
Ives the ſurgeon, how dangerouſly his Billy had been wounded. Preſently after the brave youth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, with his eyes overflowing with tears, not for himſelf, but for his father. Upon Mr. Ives aſſuring him that his father's wound was not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, he became c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a fellow ſufferer, "Pray, Sir, dreſs alſo that poor man who is groaning ſo ſadly beſide me." Mr. Ives told him that the man had been already taken care of, and begged that he now might have the liberty to examine his wound. He ſubmitted, and calmly ſaid, "Sir, I fear you muſt amputate above the joint." The ſurgeon replied, "My dear, I muſt." He claſped his hands together, and lifting up his eyes towards heaven, he offered up the following ſhort, but earneſt petition: "Good God! do thou enable me to behave in my preſent circumſtances, worthy of my father." He then ſaid he was all ſubmiſſion. The operation was performed above the joint of the knee; and during the whole time, the intrepid youth never ſpoke a word, nor uttered a groan that could be heard at the diſtance of a yard. It is eaſier to imagine, than to expreſs the feelings of the father at this time: but whatever he felt, tears were the only expreſſion. Both of them were carried to Calcutta: the father was lodged in the houſe of his brother-in-law; and the ſon was placed with the ſurgeon in the hoſpital. For the firſt week, comfort was given to them both, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying good tidings of one another. But, alas! all the good ſymptoms that had attended the young man, began to diſappear. The Captain perceived all in the ſurgeon's countenance; and ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing was he to add to the diſtreſs of the latter, as ſeldom to ſpeak about his ſon. One time he ſaid, "How long, my friend, do you think my Billy may remain in a ſtate of uncertainty?" Mr. Ives replied, "If he ſurvives the fifteenth day after
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032623_0043_0FF3E0AC91F584D8"/>
the operation, there would be ſtrong hopes of his recovery." On the thirteenth he died; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Montauban, in love with the wife of Gilles, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke, perſuaded the Duke that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was laying plots to dethrone him. Gilles being impriſoned, the Duke's beſt friends conjured him to pity his unhappy brother, who might be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but aſſuredly was innocent; but in vain. Gilles being proſecuted before the three eſtates of the province for high treaſon, was unanimouſly abſolved, which irritated the Duke more and more. Arthur of Montauban artfully ſuggeſted to his maſter to try poiſon; which having miſcarried, they next reſolved to ſtarve the priſoner to death. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate prince, through the bars of a window, cried aloud for bread; but the paſſengers durſt not ſupply him. One poor woman only had courage more than once, to ſlip ſome bread within the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. He charged a prieſt, who had received his confeſſion, to declare to the Duke, "That ſeeing juſtice was refuſed him in this world, he appealed to Heaven, and called upon the Duke to appear before the judgment ſeat of God in forty days." The Duke and his favourite, amazed that the prince lived ſo long without nouriſhment, employed aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins to ſmother him in his bed-cloaths. The prieſt, in obedience to the orders he had received, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf before the Duke, and with a loud voice, cited him in the name of the deceaſed lord Gilles, to appear before God in forty days. Shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe verified the prediction. The Duke was ſeized with a ſudden terror; and the image of his brother, expiring by his orders, haunted him day and night. He decayed daily, without any marks of a regular diſeaſe, and died within the forty days, in frightful agony.</p>
               <p>A Pruſſian peaſant accompanied ſome of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to the houſe of a fellow who aſſumed the character of a fortune-teller; and having diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, by expreſſing a contempt of his art, the

This ſeemed to make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle impreſſion at the time, but afterwards recurred often to this unhappy creature's memory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came everyday more troubleſome to his imagination. At length the idea haunted his mind ſo inceſſantly, that he was rendered perfectly miſerable, and could no longer endure life.</p>

He reſolved, therefore, to commit murder, that he might be deprived of life by the hand of juſtice; and mingling a ſentiment of ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evolence with the cruelty of his intention, he reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if he murdered a grown perſon, he might poſſibly ſend a ſoul to hell. To avoid this, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to murder a child, who could not have committed any ſin which deſerved damnation, but dying in innocence, wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In conſequence of theſe ideas, he actually murdered an infant of his maſter's, for whom he had always ſhewn an uncommon degree of fondneſs. Such was the ſtrange account that this infatuated creature gave on his trial; and thus the random prophecy proved, as in many other caſes, the cauſe of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as he aſcended the ſcaffold, he took off his coat and waiſtcoat; his ſhirt was rolled down below his ſhoulders; his night-cap was pulled over his eyes; he was placed on his knees, and the executioner with a ſingle ſtroke of a broad ſword, ſevered his head from his body.

               <head>Odd Way of bargaining for a Wife.</head>
               <p>MERCATOR, who went originally from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, acquired a fortune in the iſland of Jamaica; he concluded with himſelf he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unleſs he ſhared it with a woman of merit; none of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the female line ſuited his inclination; he therefore determined to write for one to his correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent in London, through whoſe means he had obtained his fortune and conſequence. As he had been ſo much verſed in mercantile matters, the ſtile of writing uſual in that way of buſineſs ſtill adhered to him. Therefore treating of love as he did of buſineſs, after giving his correſpondent many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, he reſerved the following for the laſt, viz.</p>

               <p>The London correſpondent read over and over this odd commiſſion, which put the future ſpouſe on the ſame footing with the bales of goods he was to ſend his friend. He nevertheleſs complied with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary demand, and fixed his eyes upon a young perſon of a reputable family, but no fortune, of good humour, who had received a polite education, very well made, and more than tolerably handſome.

               <p>The goodneſs of her conſtitution was likewiſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by four eminent phyſicians.

He was on the look out when the ſhip arrived, was charmed with her diſtinguiſhed beauty, and inquired if ſhe was the lady recommended by his friend.

               <head>Anecdote of the late Duke of <hi>Montagu.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE late Duke of Montagu who reſided in St. James's Park, frequently obſerved a middle aged man in ſomething like a military dreſs, of which the lace was much tarniſhed, and the cloth worn thread-bare; who always appeared at a certain hour in the mall. His countenance was grave and ſolemn; and he took no notice of the gay croud that was paſſing by him.</p>
               <p>The Duke ſingled him out as a fit object for a frolic. He began to exerciſe his mirth by inquiring into his hiſtory; he ſoon learnt that he was a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced officer upon half pay; that he had behaved with great bravery in the late war; that he had a wife and ſeveral children, whom he was obliged to ſend into Yorkſhire where they could live cheap; and that he had received a ſmall pittance of his income to keep himſelf near the metropolis, where alone he could hope to obtain a more advantageous ſituation.</p>
               <p>The Duke took an opportunity when the Captain was ſitting alone upon one of the benches, buried in ſpeculation, to ſend his gentleman to him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments and an invitation to dinner the next day. The Duke placed himſelf at a convenient diſtance, ſaw his meſſenger approach without being perceived,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032623_0051_0FF3E0C0EF119750"/>
and begin to ſpeak without being heard; he ſaw his intended gueſt ſtart at the meſſage, and queſtion its authenticity. The Captain was at length perſuaded of its reality, though very much ſurprized at its ſingularity. He returned thanks for the honour intended him, and ſaid he would wait upon his grace at the time appointed.</p>
               <p>He came, the Duke received him with great civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, took him aſide, and with an air of ſecrecy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that he was induced to give him this invitation at the particular requeſt of a lady who had a moſt tender regard for him. The Captain was confounded, and ſeemed as if he did not know whether to receive it as an affront or a compliment. The Duke aſſured him upon his honour, that he had told him nothing but the ſtricteſt truth.</p>
               <p>Dinner was announced. The Captain entered the room with great curioſity and wonder, which was not diminiſhed, when he ſaw at the table his own wife and children. The Duke began his frolic by ſending for them out of Yorkſhire; which as much aſtoniſhed the wife as the huſband;— and took care ſhe ſhould have no opportunity of ſending him a letter. This ſudden unexpected meeting, produced very pleaſing effects: it afforded the Duke much ſatisfaction; but it was with difficulty he got his gueſts quietly ſeated at table. Soon after dinner, word was brought that the Duke's ſolicitor attended. He was introduced, and pulled out a deed for the Duke to ſign. He was deſired to read it, and apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogized to the company for the interruption. The Captain and his wife were ſtill more aſtoniſhed if poſſible, when they found the writings contained a ſettlement of 200l. per annum upon them and their family. The inſtrument was executed, and the Duke preſented it to the Captain, ſaying, "Sir, I beg your acceptance of this. I aſſure you it is the laſt thing I would have done, could I have laid out my money more to my ſatisfaction."</p>

               <p>A London gentleman went to ſee his relations in the country. The houſe was full, a wedding being celebrated there. Only one room was vacant. There no one choſe to ſleep, as it was ſuppoſed to be haunted. The London ſpark had no fear about him, and ſaid he would ſleep there. He fell aſleep. About three in the morning he was wakened by the opening of the door, and the entrance of a young woman in appearance, with only a night dreſs on her head, and her ſhift on. This lovely appearance walked two or three times about the room, and at length laid itſelf down on the bed. The young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did not much like his unknown bedfellow. He lay as far as he could on the other ſide. After ſome time he perceived his bedfellow breathe, and ſuppoſing her to be true fleſh and blood, and no phantom, he ventured to touch her. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his opinion, and finding a ring on her finger, he gently took it off. She lay ſome time, and he did not diſturb her. She then got up, and went out of the room as ſhe came in. The young gentleman perceived how the room was haunted, by a female walking in her ſleep. The morning came. The family were inquiſitive about him. He deſired all the family might be ſummoned, when, lo! the ring fitted the eldeſt daughter's finger, who had been in great tribulation about the loſs. "This, Sir," ſaid he to the father, "is the lovely ſpirit which haunts the room." She declared herſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ignorant; but was convinced of its truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ring. "Well, Sir," ſaid the father, "if you have no objection, ſince my daughter has been to bed to you, you ſhall go to bed to my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and there is 5000l. for her portion." The match was that day conſummated.</p>

               <head>A Character.</head>
               <p>VOLATILIS called at Serenus's lodgings a few ſummers ago. Serenus had remained in town merely becauſe he had no particular buſineſs elſewhere; but Volatilis aſſured him, that the town was a deſart; that it was ſhameful to be ſeen in the ſtreets; that all the world were at Brighthelmſtone. Serenus allowed Volatilis to conduct him to that place, where they had remained only a few days, when the latter told the former, that none of the people he cared for were there; and as Serenus had nothing particular to detain him, Volatilis begged as a favour he would accompany him to Tunbridge. They went accordingly. Volatilis remained pretty quiet for four days; he yawned a good deal on the fifth, and the ſixth his jaws were nearly diſlocated. As he perceived Serenus was pleaſed with the place, and would take none of his hints about leaving it, he at laſt pretended that he had received a letter, which made it abſolutely neceſſary for him to ſet out for London, and away he went.</p>
               <p>Serenus ſtayed three weeks at Tunbridge. On his return to town, he underſtood that Volatilis had taken a genteel furniſhed houſe for the remainder of the ſummer in Yorkſhire, where he had already paſſed a week, having engaged a female friend to go along with him. He left word in town that he was not to be expected till the meeting of Parliament. Though Serenus never imagined that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main quite ſo long, yet he was a little ſurpriſed to ſee him enter his room a few days after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this information. He told Serenus he was quite diſguſted with his houſe, and ſtill more ſo with his companion; and beſides, he had taken a violent fancy to go to Paris, which, ſaid he, is the moſt delightful place in the world, eſpecially in ſummer; for the company never think of rambling

about the country like our giddy fools in England; but remain together in the capital, as ſenſible peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to do.</p>
               <p>He then propoſed that Serenus and himſelf ſhould pack up a few things, take poſt, paſs over and ſpend a couple of months at Paris. Finding Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Serenus heard no more of him for ſix weeks, but at the end of that time, happening to be at Bath, ſaw his friend Volatilis enter the pump room. Egad! ſaid he, Serenus, you were wiſe to ſtay at home; Paris is become the moſt inſipid place on earth, I could not ſupport it above ten days. But having heard a good deal of Holland, I took a journey to Amſterdam, which between friends I found very little more amuſing than Paris; two days after my arrival, finding an Engliſh ſhip ready to ſail, I thought it would be a pity to let the opportunity ſlip. So I ordered my trunk aboard. We had a diſagreeable paſſage: however, I arrived ſafe a few days ago at Harwich.</p>

               <head>FRA. PASQUAL.</head>
               <p>IN a convent at Bologna, near Palermo, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a capuchin, known by the name of Fra. Paſqual, who had paſſed through many ſingular ſcenes of life, which it would be too long to recount. His laſt migration, or rather tranſmigration, was from one of the banditti in this kingdom, in which capacity he had been enrolled for ſome time; but tired of the danger and fatigue, to which he was perpetually expoſed, he at laſt determined to change the character of the hero, for that of the ſaint, and try if it was not both ſafer and ſurer to rely on the weakneſs of others, than on our own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:032623_0055_0FF3E0CA16102D98"/>Fra. Paſqual pretended a ſtrong compunction for the tranſgreſſions of his paſt life, and made a prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe to the virgin, that the remainder of it ſhould be ſpent in mortification and penance, to atone for them. To this end, Paſqual took the vows of pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and chaſtity, and entered into all the rigours of the monaſtic life. For ſome weeks he behaved in a moſt exemplary manner; he went barefooted, wore a large roſary, and thicker cord of diſcipline than any monk in the convent; and his whole deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave teſtimony of the moſt unfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; however, the devil was ſtill at work in the heart of Fra. Paſqual, and all theſe external morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications made him work the harder; in ſhort, he found it impoſſible to drive him out: Paſqual was ſenſible of this; and afraid leſt the enemy ſhould at laſt get the better of him, he thought it adviſeable to leave at Palermo the character of ſanctity he had acquired, and begin ſome where elſe upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew ſcore. He embarked for Naples, where he was ſoon admitted into a capuchin convent.</p>
               <p>As Paſqual knew from experience that the dull uniformity of the monaſtic life required ſome little amuſements to render it ſupportable, the firſt thing he ſet about was to find a miſtreſs. He made love to a lady of eaſy virtue, who ſoon admitted his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, but at the ſame time informed him, that he had a formidable rival, who was jealous as a tyger, and would not fail to put them both to death, ſhould he diſcover the intrigue. This was no other than a life-guard man, a fellow of ſix feet two inches high, with a vaſt ſpada, like that of Goliah, and a monſtrous pair of curled whiſkers, that would caſt a damp upon the heart of any one man but Fra. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>qual; but the monaſtic life had not yet enervated him; he was accuſtomed to danger, and loved a few difficulties: however, as in his preſent charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he could not be on a footing with his rival, he thought it beſt only to make uſe of prudence and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032623_0056_0FF3E0CE0632EA00"/>
ſtratagem to ſupplant him: Theſe are the eccleſiaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical arms, and they generally have been found too hard for the military.</p>
               <p>The lady promiſed him an interview, as ſoon as the court ſhould go to Portici, where the life-guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's duty obliged him to attend the King. Paſqual waited with impatience for ſome time; at laſt the wiſhed for night arrived; the King ſet off, after the opera, with all his guards. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſqual flew like lightning to the arms of his miſtreſs; the prelimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries were ſoon ſettled, and the happy lovers had juſt fallen aſleep, when they were ſuddenly alarmed by a rap and a well known voice at the door. The lady ſtarted up in an agony of deſpair, aſſuring Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual that they were both undone; that this was her lover: and if ſome expedient was not fallen upon, in the firſt tranſports of his fury, he would certainly put them both to death. There was no time for reflection; the life-guard-man demanded entrance in the moſt peremptory manner, and the lady was obliged to inſtant compliance. Paſqual had juſt time to gather his rags together, and cram himſelf below the bed; at that inſtant the door flew open, and the giant came in, rattling his arms and ſtorming at his miſtreſs, for having made him wait ſo long; however ſhe ſoon pacified him. He then ordered her to ſtrike a light, that he might ſee to undreſs: This ſtruck Paſqual to the ſoul, and he gave himſelf up for loſt; however, the lady's addreſs ſaved him, when he leaſt expected it; in bringing the tinder, ſhe took care to let fall ſome water into the box; and all the beating ſhe and her lover could beat, they could not produce one ſpark. Every ſtroke of the flint ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Paſqual's ears like his death knell; but when he heard the life guard-man ſwearing at the tinder for not kindling, he began to conceive ſome hopes, and bleſſed the fertile invention of woman. The lady told him he might eaſily get a light at the guard, which was at no great diſtance. Paſqual's heart
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032623_0057_0FF3E0D0365B7378"/>
leaped for joy; but when the ſoldier anſwered that he was abſent without leave, and durſt not be ſeen, again it began to flag; but on his ordering <hi>her</hi> to go, it died within him, and now he found himſelf in greater danger than ever. The lady herſelf was diſconcerted; but quickly recovering, ſhe told him, it would be too long before ſhe could get dreſſed; but adviſed him to go to the corner of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreet, where there was a lamp burning before the Virgin Mary, who could have no objection to his lighting a candle at it. Paſqual revived; but the ſoldier declared he was too much fatigued with his walk, and would rather undreſs in the dark; he at the ſame time began to grope for a bottle of liquor which he knew ſtood there. Paſqual ſhook like a quaker; however, ſtill he eſcaped. The lady obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he was about, made a ſpring and got him the bottle, at the very inſtant he was within an inch of ſeizing Paſqual's head. The lady went to bed, and told her lover as it was a cold night, ſhe would warm his place for him. Paſqual admired her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and began to conceive ſome hopes of eſcaping.</p>
               <p>His ſituation was the moſt irkſome in the world; the bed was ſo low, that he had not room to move; and when the great heavy life guard-man entered it, he found himſelf ſqueezed down to the ground. He lay trembling and ſtifling his breath for ſome time, but found it abſolutely impoſſible to ſupport his ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation till morning; and indeed if he had, his clothes being ſcattered about, muſt infallibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him: he therefore began to think of making his eſcape; but could not move without alarming his rival, who was now lying above him. At firſt he thought of ruſhing ſuddenly out, and throwing himſelf into the ſtreet; but this he diſdained, and on ſecond thoughts, determined, to ſeize the life guard-man's ſword, and either put him to death, or make an honourable capitulation both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the lady. In the midſt of theſe reflections
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032623_0058_0FF3E0D1CF407AE0"/>
his rival began to ſnore, and Paſqual declares that no muſic was ever ſo grateful to his ſoul. He tried to ſtir a little, and finding that it did not awake the enemy, he by degrees worked himſelf out of his priſon. He immediately laid hold of the great ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, when all his fears forſook him, and he felt as bold as a lion. He now relinquiſhed the daſtardly ſcheme of eſcaping, and only thought how he beſt could retaliate on his rival for all that he had made him ſuffer.</p>
               <p>As Paſqual was ſtark naked, it was no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him to put on the ſoldier's clothes than his own; and as both his cloak and his cappouch toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not worth a ſixpence, he thought it moſt eligible to equip himſelf <hi>a la militaire,</hi> and to leave his ſacerdotal robes to the ſoldier. In a ſhort time he was dreſſed <hi>cap-a-pee.</hi> His greaſy cowl, his cloak, his ſandals, his roſary, and his rope of diſcipline, he gathered together, and placed on a chair before the bed, and girding himſelf with a great buff belt, inſtead of the cordon of St. Francis, and graſping his truſty toledo inſtead of the crucifix, he ſallied forth into the ſtreet. He pondered for ſome time what ſcheme to fall upon; and at firſt thought of returning in the character of another life-guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, pretending to be ſent by the officer, with a guard in queſt of his companion, who not being found in his quarters, was ſuppoſed to have deſerted: and thus, after having made him pay heartily for all that he had ſuffered under the bed, to leave him to the enjoyment of his panic, and the elegant ſuit of clothes he had provided him. However, he was not ſatisfied with this revenge, and determined on one ſtill more ſolid. He went to the guard, and told the officers that he had met a capuchin friar, with all the enſigns of his ſanctity about him, ſculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the ſtreets in the dead of night, when they pretend to be employed in prayer for the ſins of mankind. That prompted by curioſity to follow
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032623_0059_0FF3E0D3899969A8"/>
him, the holy friar, as he expected, went ſtraight to the houſe of a celebrated courtezan; that he ſaw him admitted, and liſtened at the window till he heard them go to bed together; that if he did not find this information to be true, he would reſign himſelf his priſoner, and ſubmit to whatever puniſhment he ſhould think proper.</p>
               <p>The officer and his guard, delighted to have ſuch hold of a capuchin (who pretend to be the very models of ſanctity, and who revile in a particular manner the licentious life of the military) turned out with the utmoſt alacrity, and under the conduct of Paſqual, ſurrounded the lady's houſe. Paſqual began thundering at the door; and demanded en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for the officer and his guard. The unhappy ſoldier waking with the noiſe, and not doubting that it was a detachment ſent to ſeize him, gave himſelf up to deſpair, and inſtantly took ſhelter in the very place that Paſqual had ſo lately occupied; at the ſame time laying hold of all the things be found on the chair, never doubting that they were his own cloaths. As the lady was ſomewhat dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in opening the door, Paſqual pretended to put his foot to it, when up it flew, and entering with the officer and his guard, demanded the body of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin friar, who they were informed lodged with her that night. The lady had heard Paſqual go out, and having no ſuſpicion that he would inform againſt himſelf, ſhe proteſted her innocence in the moſt ſolemn manner, taking all the ſaints to witneſs that ſhe knew no ſuch perſon: But Paſqual ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the retreat of the lover, began groping below the bed, and ſoon pulled out his greaſy cowl and cloak: "Here, (ſaid he to the officer) here are proofs enough: I'll anſwer for it Signor Padre him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is at no great diſtance;" and putting his noſe below the bed; "Fogh (ſaid he) I ſmell him; he ſtinks like a fox. The ſureſt method of finding a capuchin is by the noſe; you may wind him a mile
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032623_0060_0FF3E0D68DDE79E0"/>
off." Then lowering their lanthorn, they beheld the unfortunate lover ſqueezed in betwixt the bed and the ground, and almoſt ſtifled. "Here he is (ſaid Paſqual) with all the enſigns of his holineſs;" and pulling them out one by one, the crucifix, the roſary, and the cord of diſcipline; "You may ſee, (ſaid he) "that the reverend father came here to do penance;" and taking up the cord, "ſuppoſe now we ſhould aſſiſt him in this meritorious work. Do you hear, Signor Padre? We will ſave you the trouble of inflicting it yourſelf, and whether you come here to ſin, or to repent, by your own maxims, you know a little ſound diſcipline is healthful to the ſoul." The guard were lying round the bed, in convulſions of laughter; and began breaking the moſt inſolent jokes upon the ſuppoſed Padre. The life guard-man thought himſelf inchanted. He at laſt ventured to ſpeak, and declared they were all in a miſtake; that he was no capuchin: upon which the laugh redoubled, and the coarſeſt jokes were repeated. The lady, in the mean time, with the beſt diſſembled marks of fear and aſtoniſhment, ran about the room, declaring that ſome ſorcerer had been at work, and his incantations had taken their full effect. Paſqual delighted to ſee that his plan had operated well, thought it now time to make his retreat, before the unfortunate lover could have an opportunity of examining his clothes, and perhaps detecting him: He therefore pretended regimental buſineſs, and regretting much that he was obliged to join his corps, took leave of the officers and his guard; at the ſame time recommending by all means, to treat the holy father with all that reverence and reſpect that was due to ſo ſacred a perſon.</p>
               <p>The life guard man, when he got out from below the bed, began to look about for his clothes; but obſerving nothing but the greaſy weeds of a capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin friar, he was now perfectly convinced, that Heaven had delivered him over, for his offences, to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032623_0061_0FF3E0D975FE3460"/>
the power of ſome daemon; (for of all mortals, the Neapolitan ſoldiers are the moſt ſuperſtitious) the lady, too acted her part ſo well, that he had no longer any doubt of it. "Thus it is (ſaid he in a penitential voice) to offend Heaven! I own my ſin: I knew it was Friday, and yet, O fleſh! fleſh! Had it been any other day, I ſtill ſhould have remained what I was. O, St. Januarius; I paſſed thee too, without paying thee due reſpect: thy all ſeeing eye has found me out. Gentlemen, do with me what you pleaſe; I am not what I ſeem to be." No, no, (ſaid the officer) we are all ſenſible of that: But come, Signor Padre, on with your garments, and march; we have no time to trifle. Here corporal (giving him the cordon) tie his hands, and let him feel the weight of St. Francis. The ſaint owes him that, for having ſo impudently denied him for his maſter." The poor ſoldier was perfectly paſſive; they arrayed him in the ſandals, the cowl and the cloak of Fra. Paſqual, and put the great roſary about his neck; and a moſt woeful figure he made. The officer made him look in the glaſs, to try if he could recollect himſelf, and aſked him if he was a capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin now, or not. He was ſhocked at his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but bore every thing with meekneſs and reſignation. They then conducted him to the guard, belabouring him all the way with the cord of St. Francis, and aſking him every ſtroke, if he knew his maſter now.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Paſqual was ſnug in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, enjoying the ſweets of his adventure. He had a ſpare cloak and a cowl, and was ſoon equipped again like one of the holy fathers; he then took the clothes and accoutrements of the life-guard-man and laid them in a heap near the gate of another convent of capuchins, but at a great diſtance from his own, reſerving only to himſelf a trifle of money, which he found in the breeches pocket, juſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify him for the loſs of his cloak and his cowl;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032623_0062_0FF3E0DB09B25878"/>
and even this, he ſays, he ſhould have held ſacred, but he knew whoever ſhould find the clothes, would make a lawful prize of it.</p>
               <p>The poor ſoldier remained next day a ſpectacle of ridicule to all the world; at laſt his companions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ard of his ſtrange metamorphoſis, and came in troops to ſee him: their jokes were perhaps ſtill more galling than thoſe of the guard; but as he thought himſelf under the finger of God, or at leaſt of St. Januarius, he bore all with meekneſs and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: at laſt his clothes were found, and he was ſet at liberty; but he believes to this day, that the whole was the work of the devil, ſent to chaſtiſe him for his ſins; and has never ſince ſeen his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs on a Friday, nor paſſed the ſtatue of St. Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius without muttering a prayer. Fra. Paſqual has told the ſtory to ſeveral of his moſt intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whom he can depend on; among others, is the Abbe T. who has often had it from his own mouth.</p>

               <p>IT is neceſſary to ſay, that I am very well deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; my anceſtors have made ſome noiſe in the world; for my mother cried oyſters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had ſome trumpeters in our family. Many a nobleman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew ſo reſpectable a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father deſigned to breed me up to his own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which was that of drummer to a puppet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

progreſs, becauſe I naturally had no ear for muſic; ſo, at the age of fifteen, I went and liſted for a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, ſo I ſoon found that I diſliked carrying a muſquet alſo; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one trade nor the other were to my taſte, for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, and I have mine: now I very reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</p>
               <p>The ſpleen was the conſequence of leading a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's life; I aſked leave to quit the ſervice; but, as I was tall and ſtrong, my Captain thanked me for my kind intention, and ſaid, becauſe he had a regard for me, we ſhould not part. I wrote to my father a very diſmal penitent letter, and deſired that he would raiſe money to pay for my diſcharge; but the good man was as fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I have not money, ſaid I to myſelf, to pay for my diſcharge, I muſt find an equivalent ſome other way; and that muſt be by running away. I deſerted, and that anſwered my purpoſe every bit as well as if I had bought my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>As I had by this means got rid of my military oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, I ſold my ſoldier's cloaths, bought worſe, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the moſt unfrequented roads poſſible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found to be the curate of the pariſh, thrown from his horſe in a miry road, and almoſt ſmothered in the mud. He deſired my aſſiſtance; I gave it, and drew him out with ſome difficulty. He thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for my trouble, and was going off; but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate aſked an hundred queſtions; as whoſe ſon I was; from
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032623_0064_0FF3E0E2690B4B30"/>
whence I came; and whether I would be faithful. I anſwered him greatly to his ſatisfaction; and gave myſelf one of the beſt characters in the world for ſobriety, diſcretion and fidelity. To make a long ſtory ſhort, he wanted a ſervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other; I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat: I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-ſervant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to ſtarve me between them, I made a pious reſolution to prevent their committing murder: I ſtole the eggs as ſoon as they were laid; I emptied every unfiniſhed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was ſure to diſappear: in ſhort, they found I would not do; ſo I was diſcharged one morning, and paid three ſhillings and ſix pence for two months wages.</p>
               <p>I employed myſelf in making preparations for my departure, while my money was getting ready; two hens were hatching in an out-houſe, I went and took the eggs from habit, and, not to ſeparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knapſack. After this piece of frugality, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to receive my money, and with my knapſack on my back, and a ſtaff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the houſe, when I heard behind me the cry of 'ſtop thief'! but this only increaſed my diſpatch; it would have been fooliſh to ſtop, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. I think I paſſed thoſe months at the curate's without drinking; and I never ſpent two more pious, ſtupid months in all my life.</p>
               <p>I happened to meet with a company of ſtrolling players, after travelling ſome days. The moment I ſaw them at a diſtance, my heart warmed to them; I had a ſort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order: they were employed in ſettling
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032623_0065_0FF3E0E45769AED0"/>
their baggage, which had been overturned in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way; I offered my aſſiſtance, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and we ſoon became ſo well acquainted, that they took me as a ſervant. This was a paradiſe to me; they ſung, danced, drank, eat, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, all at the ſame time. By the blood of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every word that was ſpoken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure; and, though I was poor, I was not modeſt.</p>
               <p>Above all things in the world, I love a ſtraggling life; ſometimes good, ſometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when it ſtands before me. We arrived that evening at Tenterden, and took a large room at the Greyhound; where we reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit Romeo and Juliet, with the funeral proceſſion, the grave, and the garden ſcene. Romeo was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ury-Lane; Juliet by a lady who had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on any ſtage before; and I to ſnuff the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles: all excellent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dreſs them. The ſame coat that ſerved Romeo, turned with the blue lining outwards, ſerved for his friend Mercutio; a large piece of crape ſufficed at once for Juliet's pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat and pall: a peſtle and mortar from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring apothecary's anſwered all the purpoſes of a bell; and our landlord's own family, wrapped in white ſheets, ſerved to fill up the proceſſion. In ſhort, there were but three figures among us that might be ſaid to be dreſſed with any propriety: I mean the nurſe, the ſtarved apothecary, and myſelf. Our performance give univerſal ſatisfaction: the whole audience were inchanted with our powers.</p>
               <p>A ſtrolling player may be ever ſure of ſucceſs, if he follows one rule; that is, in our theatrical way of expreſſing it, to make a great deal of the character.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032623_0066_0FF3E0E5EEAFEB68"/>
To ſpeak and act as in common life, is not playing, nor is it what people come to ſee: natural ſpeaking, like ſweet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and ſcarce leaves any taſte behind it; but being high in a part, reſembles vinegar, which grates upon the taſte, and one feels it while he is drinking. To pleaſe in town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the emphaſis, ſlap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling ſickneſs: that is the way to work for applauſe; that is the way to gain it.</p>
               <p>Our ſkill in this firſt exhibition eſtabliſhed our reputation, and it was but natural for me to aſcribe part of the ſucceſs to myſelf; I ſnuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-ſnuffer, the piece would loſe half its embelliſhments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this manner we continued a fortnight, and drew tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable houſes; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very beſt piece, in which all our ſtrength was to be exerted. We had great expectations from this, and even doubled our prices, when behold one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a ſtroke like thunder to our little company: they were reſolved to go in a body, to ſcold the man for falling ſick at ſo inconvenient a time, and that too of a diſorder that threatened to be expenſive; I ſeized the moment, and offered to act the part myſelf in his ſtead. The caſe was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly ſat down, with the part in my hand, and a tankard before me, and ſtudied the character, which was to be rehearſed the next day, and played ſoon after.</p>
               <p>Drinking, I found, helped my memory exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I learned my part with aſtoniſhing rapidity, and bid adieu to ſnuffing candles ever after. I found that nature had deſigned me for more noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and I was reſolved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehearſe, and I informed my companions, maſters now no
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032623_0067_0FF3E0E7F4E26BF0"/>
longer, of the ſurpriſing change I felt within me. Let the ſick man, ſaid I, be under no uneaſineſs to get well again; I will fill his place to univerſal ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I will engage that he ſhall never be miſſed. I rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before them, ſtrutted, ranted, and received ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. They ſoon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were beſpoke. Before I aſcended the ſtage, however, I concluded within myſelf, that, as I brought money to the houſe, I ought to have my ſhare in the profits. Gentlemen, (ſaid I, addreſſing our company) I do not pretend to direct you; far be if from me to treat you with ſo much ingratitude: you have publiſhed my name in the bills, with the utmoſt good nature; and, as affairs ſtand, cannot act without me; ſo, gentlemen, to ſhew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwiſe I declare off. I will bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh my ſnuffers, and clip candles as uſual. This was a very diſagreeable propoſal, but they found it was impoſſible to refuſe it; it was irreſiſtible, it was adamant: they conſented, and I went on in king Bajazet: my frowning brows, bound with a ſtocking ſtuffed into a turban, while on my captived arms I brandiſhed a jack-chain.</p>
               <p>I was tall, and had a loud voice; nature indeed had fitted me for the part: my very entrance excited univerſal applauſe; I looked round on the audience with a ſmile, and made a moſt low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very paſſionate part, I invigorated my ſpirits with three full glaſſes of brandy. By Alla! it is almoſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how I went through it: Tamerlane was but a fool to me; though he was ſometimes loud enough too, yet I was ſtill louder than he: but then, beſides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded upon the pit of my ſtomach; it is the way at Drury-Lane, and has always had a fine effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:032623_0068_0FF3E0EC4D92E638"/>In ſhort, I came off like a prodigy; and, ſuch was my ſucceſs, that I could raviſh the laurels even from a ſirloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me, after the play was over, to compliment me upon my ſucceſs; one praiſed my voice, another my perſon; upon my word, ſays the 'ſquire's lady, he will make one of the fineſt actors in Europe; I ſay it, and I think I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a judge.—Praiſe in the beginning is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough, and we receive it as a favour; but when it comes in great quantities we regard it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: inſtead of thanking them, I internally applauded myſelf. We were deſired to give our piece a ſecond time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</p>
               <p>In order to be at a horſe-race at ſome diſtance from thence, we left the town. I ſhall never think of Tenterden without tears of gratitude and reſpect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. We quitted the town, I ſay; and there was a wide diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence between my coming in and going out; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the town a candle-ſnuffer, and I quitted it an hero!—Such is the world; little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could ſay a great deal more upon that ſubject, ſomething truly ſublime, upon the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give you the ſpleen, and ſo I ſhall paſs it over.</p>
               <p>Before we arrived at the next town, the races were ended, which was no ſmall diſappointment to our company; however, we were reſolved to take all we could get. I played capital characters there too, and came off with my uſual brilliancy. I ſincerely believe I ſhould have been the firſt actor in Europe, had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly froſt which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me once more down to the common ſtandard of humanity. I played Sir Harry

Wildair; all the country ladies were charmed if I but drew out my ſnuff-box, the whole houſe was in a roar of rapture; when I exerciſed my cudgel, I thought they would have fallen into convulſions.</p>
               <p>As bad luck would have it, there was here a lady who had received an education of nine months in London; and this gave her pretenſions to taſte, which rendered her the indiſputable miſtreſs of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies wherever ſhe came. She was informed of my merits; every body praiſed me; yet ſhe refuſed at firſt going to ſee me perform; ſhe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſhe ſaid, any thing but ſtuff from a ſtroller; talked ſomething in praiſe of Garrick, and amazed the ladies with her ſkill in enunciations, tones, and cadences: ſhe was at laſt, however, prevailed upon to go; and it was privately intimated to me what a judge was to be preſent at my next exhibition: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no way intimidated, I came on in Sir Harry, one hand ſtuck in my breeches, and the other in my boſom, as uſual at Drury-Lane; but, inſtead of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me, I perceived the whole audience had their eyes turned upon the lady who had been nine months in London; from her they expected the deciſion which was to ſecure the General's truncheon in my hand, or ſink me down into a theatrical letter-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier. I opened my ſnuff-box, took ſnuff; the lady was ſolemn, and ſo were the reſt; I broke my cudgel on Alderman Smuggler's back; ſtill gloomy, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly all, the lady groaned and ſhrugged her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; I attempted, by laughing myſelf to excite at leaſt a ſmile; but not a cheek could I perceive wrinkled into ſympathy: I found it would not do; all my good humour now became forced; my laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was converted into hyſteric grinning; and, while I pretended ſpirits, my eye ſhewed the agony of my heart: in ſhort, the lady came with an intention to be diſpleaſed, and diſpleaſed ſhe was; my fame expired for ever!</p>

               <head>Proof of the Neceſſity of an early Choice of our Profeſſion, and Perſeverance in it, exemplified in the remarkable Conduct of Polyphilus.</head>
               <p>IT is never without very melancholy reflections, that we can obſerve the miſconduct or miſcarriage of thoſe men, who ſeem by the force of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or extent of knowledge, exempted from the general frailties of human nature, and privileged from the common infelicities of life. Though the world is crouded with ſcenes of calamity, we look for the moſt part upon the general maſs of wretchedneſs with very little regard, and fix our eyes upon the ſtate of particular perſons, whom the eminence of their qualities mark out from the multitude. As in reading the account of a battle, we ſeldom reflect on the vulgar heaps of ſlaughter, but follow the hero with our whole attention, through all the varieties of his fortune, without a thought of the thouſands which are falling round him.</p>
               <p>With the ſame kind of anxious veneration, I have for many years paſt, been making obſervations on the life of Polyphilus, a man whom all his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have, from his firſt appearance in the world, feared for the quickneſs of his diſcernment, and admired for the multiplicity of his attainments; but whoſe progreſs in life, and whoſe uſefulneſs to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have perhaps been hindered by the ſuperfluity of his knowledge, and the celerity of his mind.</p>
               <p>Polyphilus was remarkable at ſchool for ſurpaſſing all his companions, without any viſible application: and, at the univerſity, was diſtinguiſhed equally for his ſucceſsful progreſs, as well through the rough and thorny mazes of ſcience, as the ſmooth and flowing parts of politer literature; without any ſtrict confinement to hours of ſtudy, or any remarkable forbearance of the common amuſements of young men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:032623_0071_0FF3E0F1F2B137F8"/>When Polyphilus was at the age in which men uſually chuſe their profeſſion, and prepare to enter into a public character, every academical eye was fixed upon him; and all were curious to enquire what this univerſal genius would fix upon for the employment of life; and, no doubt was made but, that he would leave all his cotemporaries behind him, and mount to the higheſt honors of that claſs in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſhould inliſt himſelf, without thoſe delays and pauſes which muſt always be endured by meaner abilities.</p>
               <p>Polyphilus, though by no means inſolent, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, had been ſufficiently encouraged by unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſs, to place great confidence in his own parts; and was not below his companions in the indulgence of his hopes and expectation of the aſtoniſhment with which the world would be ſtruck, when firſt his luſtre would break out upon it; nor could he help to join ſometimes in the mirth of his friends, at the ſudden diſappearance of thoſe, who having ſhone a while, and drawn the eyes of the public upon their feeble luſtre, were now doomed to fade away before him.</p>
               <p>It is natural for a man to catch advantageous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the condition, which thoſe with whom he converſes are ſtriving to attain. Polyphilus, in a ramble to London, fell accidentally among the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and was ſo much pleaſed with the proſpect of turning philoſophy to profit, and ſo highly delighted with a new theory of fevers, which darted into his imagination, and which, after having conſidered, in a few hours, he found himſelf able to maintain againſt all the advocates for the ancient ſyſtem, that he reſolved to apply himſelf to anatomy, botany, and chemiſtry; and to leave no part unconquered, either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms.</p>
               <p>He, therefore, read authors, contraſted ſyſtems, and tried experiments. But unhappily, as he was going to ſee a new plant in flower at Chelſea, he met,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032623_0072_0FF3E0F5D6E73860"/>
(in croſſing Weſtminſter, to take the water) the Chancellor's coach. He had the curioſity to follow him into the hall, where a remarkable cauſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be tried; and found himſelf able to produce ſo many arguments, which the lawyers had omitted on both ſides, that he determined to quit phyſic for a profeſſion in which he found it would be ſo eaſy to excel, and which promiſed high honours, and large profits, without melancholy attendance upon miſery, mean ſubmiſſion to peeviſhneſs, and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual interruption of reſt and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>He immediately took chambers in the Temple, bought a common place book, and confined himſelf for ſome months to the peruſal of the ſtatutes, year books, pleadings, and reports. He was a conſtant hearer of the proceedings in the courts, and began to put caſes with reaſonable accuracy. But he ſoon diſcovered, by conſidering the patience of lawyers, that preferment was not to be got by acuteneſs, learning, and eloquence. He was perplexed by the abſurdities of attornies, and miſrepreſentations made by his clients of their own cauſes; by the uſeleſs anxiety of the one, and the inceſſant impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of another. He began to repent of having devoted himſelf to a ſtudy, which was ſo narrow in its comprehenſion, which could never carry his name to any other country, and thought it unworthy of a man of parts, to ſell his life only for money. The barrenneſs of his fellow ſtudents, forced him general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into other company at his hours of entertainment; and among the varieties of converſation through which his curioſity was daily wandering, he, by chance, mingled at a tavern with ſome intelligent officers of the army. A man of letters was eaſily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance, and ſoftened into kindneſs by the politeneſs of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. He therefore cultivated this new acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and when he ſaw how readily they found, in every place, admiſſion and regard, and how famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iarly
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032623_0073_0FF3E0F791972898"/>
they mingled with every rank and order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for military honours, and wondered how the prejudices of the Univerſity ſhould have made him ſo long inſenſible of that ambition, which had fired ſo many hearts in every age; and negligent of that calling, which is above all others, univerſally and invariably illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which gives even to the exterior appearance of its profeſſors, a dignity and freedom unknown to the reſt of mankind.</p>
               <p>Theſe favourable impreſſions were made ſtill deeper by his converſation with the ladies, whoſe regard for ſoldiers he could not obſerve without wiſhing himſelf of that fraternity, to which the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male world ſeemed to devote all their charms and kindneſs. The love of knowledge, which was ſtill his predominant inclination, was gratified by the recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and, therefore, he thought there was no way of life in which all his views could ſo completely concentre as in that of a ſoldier. In the art of war he thought it not difficult to excel, having obſerved his new friends not very much verſed in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of tactics, or fortification; and, therefore, he ſtudied all the military writers, both ancient and modern; and, in a ſhort time, could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been loſt from the beginning of the world. He often ſhewed at a table how Alexander ſhould have been checked in his conqueſt, what was the fatal error at Pharſalia, how Charles of Sweden might have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his ruin at Pultowa, and Marlborough might have been made to repent his temerity at Blenheim. He entrenched armies upon paper, ſo that no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of numbers could force them; and modelled in clay many impregnable fortreſſes, on which the preſent arts of attack would be exhauſted without effect.</p>
               <p>Polyphilus in a ſhort time obtained a commiſſion,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032623_0074_0FF3E0F9D7F462A0"/>
but before he could rub off the ſolemnity of a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and gain the true air of military vivacity, a war was declared, and forces ſent to the continent. Here Polyphilus unhappily found, that ſtudy alone would not make a ſoldier; for being much accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to think, the ſenſe of danger ſunk into his mind, and he felt at the approach of any action, that terror which a ſentence of death would have brought upon him. He ſaw that inſtead of conquering their fears, the endeavours of his gay friends were only to eſcape them; but his philoſophy chained his mind to its object, and rather loaded him with ſhackles than furniſhed him with arms. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuppreſſed his miſery in ſilence, and paſſed through the campaign with honour, but found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf utterly unable to ſupport another.</p>
               <p>He then had recourſe again to his books, and continued to range from one ſtudy to another. As I uſually viſit him once a month, and am admitted to him without previous notice; I have found him within this laſt half year decyphering the Chineſe language, making a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the obſolete terms of the Engliſh law, writing an inquiry concerning the ancient Corinthian braſs, and forming a new ſcheme of the variations of the needle.</p>
               <p>Thus his powerful genius, which might have extended the ſphere of any ſcience, or benefited the world in any profeſſion, is diſſipated in a boundleſs variety, without any profit to others or to himſelf. He makes ſudden irruptions into the regions of knowledge, and ſees all obſtacles give way before him; but he never ſtays long enough to complete his conqueſt, to eſtabliſh laws, or bring away the ſpoils.</p>

               <head>The Way of the World.</head>
               <p>FULVIUS was a very good natured fellow, but is now no more. He was bred in a compting-houſe, and his father dying juſt as he was out of his time, left him an handſome fortune, and many friends to adviſe with. The reſtraint in which he had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his temper, which ſome regarded as prudence; and, from ſuch conſiderations he had every day repeated offers of friendſhip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their aſſiſtance that way; and thoſe who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, adviſed him to marry. Fulvius was in good circumſtances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wiſe; and therefore modeſtly declined their propoſals.</p>
               <p>He was brought to a different way of thinking by ſome errors in the management of his affairs, and ſeveral loſſes in trade; and he at laſt conſidered, that it was his beſt way to let his friends know that their offers were at length acceptable. His firſt addreſs was to a ſcrivener, who had formerly made him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent offers of money and friendſhip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew thoſe offers would have been refuſed. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refuſed, he requeſted the uſe of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas for a few days, as he juſt then had occaſion for money. "And pray, Sir," replied the ſcrivener, "do you want all this money?" "Want it, Sir," ſays the other, "if I did not want it I ſhould not have aſked it." "I am ſorry for that," ſays the friend, "for thoſe who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they come to pay. To ſay the truth, Sir, money is money now; and I believe it is all ſunk in the bottom of the ſea, for my part; he that has got a little is a fool if he does not keep what he has got."</p>
               <p>Fulvius was not quite diſconcerted by this refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032623_0076_0FF3E0FF07EFC4D0"/>
and was reſolved to apply to another, whom he knew was the very beſt friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addreſſed, received his propoſal with all the affability that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from generous friendſhip. "Let me ſee, you want an hundred guineas; and pray, my dear friend, would not fifty anſwer?" "If you have but fifty to ſpare, Sir, I muſt be contented." "Fifty to ſpare; I do not ſay that, for I believe I have but twenty about me." "Then I muſt borrow the other thirty from ſome other friend." "And pray," replied the friend, "would it not be the beſt way to borrow the whole money from that other friend, and then one note will ſerve for all, you know? You know, my dear Sir, that you need make no ceremony with me at any time; you know I am your friend; and when you chuſe a bit of dinner, or ſo—You, Tom, ſee the gentleman down. You won't forget to dine with us now and then. Your very humble ſervant."</p>
               <p>This treatment diſtreſſed, but did not diſcourage him, and he was at laſt reſolved to find that aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from love, which he could not have from friendſhip. A young lady, a diſtant relation by the mother's ſide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as ſhe had already made all the advances that the modeſty of her ſex would permit, he made his propoſal with confidence. He ſoon, however, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that no bankrupt ever found the fair one kind. She had lately fallen deeply in love with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had more money, and the whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood thought it would be a match.</p>
               <p>Every ſucceeding day now began to ſtrip him of his former finery; his cloaths flew piece by piece, to the pawnbroker's, and he ſeemed at length equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the genuine livery of misfortune. But ſtill he thought himſelf ſecure from actual neceſſity; the numberleſs invitations he had received to dine, even after his loſſes, were yet unanſwered; he was
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032623_0077_0FF3E101AF60AD68"/>
therefore now reſolved to accept of a dinner becauſe he wanted one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week without being openly affronted. The laſt place he went to, he had, as he fancied, juſt nicked the time of dinner, for he came in as the cloth was laying. He took a chair without being deſired, and talked for ſome time without being attended to. He aſſured the company that nothing procured ſo good an appetite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and praiſed the figure of the damaſk table-cloth; talked of a feaſt where he had been the day before, but that the veniſon was overdone. But all this procured him no invitation: finding therefore the gentleman of the houſe inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all his fetches, he thought proper, at laſt, to retire, and mend his appetite by a ſecond walk in the Park.</p>
               <p>O ye ſons of misfortune whoever you be, whether in rags or lace; whether in Kent-ſtreet or the Mall; whether at the Smyrna or St. Giles's, be adviſed by a friend, never ſeem to want the favour which you ſolicit. Apply to every paſſion but human pity for redreſs: you may find permanent relief from vanity, from ſelf-intereſt, or from avarice, but from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion never. The very eloquence of a poor man is diſguſting, and that mouth which is opened even by wiſdom, is ſeldom expected to cloſe without the horrors of a petition.</p>
               <p>If you wiſh to ward off the gripe of poverty, you muſt pretend to be a ſtranger to her, and ſhe will at leaſt uſe you with ceremony. If you be caught dining upon a halfpenny porringer of peaſe-ſoup and potatoes, praiſe the wholeſomeneſs of your fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal repaſt. You may obſerve, that Dr. Cheyne has preſcribed peaſe-broth for the gravel; hint that you are not one of thoſe who are always making a deity of their belly. If, again, you are obliged to wear a ſlimſy ſtuff in the midſt of winter, be the firſt to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032623_0078_0FF3E10346FD8D00"/>
remark, that ſtuffs are very much worn at Paris; or, if there be found ſome irreparable defects in any part of your equipage, which cannot be concealed by all the arts of ſitting croſs-legged, coaxing, or derning, ſay, that neither you nor Sampſon Gideon were ever very fond of dreſs. If you be a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, hint that Plato or Seneca are the taylors you chooſe to employ; aſſure the company that man ought to be content with a bare covering, ſince what now is ſo much his pride, was formerly his ſhame. In ſhort, however caught, never give out; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the frugality of your diſpoſition what others might be apt to attribute to the narrowneſs of your circumſtances. To be poor, and to ſeem poor, is a certain method never to riſe: pride in the great is hateful: in the wiſe it is ridiculous; but beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride is a rational vanity, which I have been taught to applaud and excuſe.</p>

               <head>On Pleaſure.</head>
               <p>IT has been the object of writers of every age to ſhew that pleaſure is in us, and not in the objects offered for our amuſement. If the ſoul be happily diſpoſed, every thing becomes capable of affording entertainment, and diſtreſs will almoſt want a name. Every occurrence paſſes in review like the figures of a proceſſion; ſome may be aukward, others ill-dreſſed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the maſter of the ceremonies.</p>
               <p>An inſtance of the truth of this was ſeen in the perſon of a ſlave in a fortification in Flanders, who appeared no way touched with his ſituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to this for life; yet, with all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of apparent wretchedneſs, he ſung, would
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032623_0079_0FF3E1068DC5D548"/>
have danced, but he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrieſt, happieſt man of all the garriſon. What a practical philoſopher was here! an happy conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſupplied philoſophy; and, though ſeemingly deſtitute of wiſdom, he was really wiſe. No reading or ſtudy had contributed to diſenchant the fairy-land around him. Every thing furniſhed him with an opportunity of mirth; and, though ſome thought him, from his inſenſibility, a fool, he was ſuch an ideot as philoſophers ſhould wiſh to imitate; for all philoſophy is only forcing the trade of happineſs, when nature ſeems to deny the means.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who, like our ſlave, can place themſelves on that ſide of the world in which every thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a pleaſing light, will find ſomething in every occurrence to excite their good humour. The moſt calamitous events, either to themſelves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the buſtle of heroiſm, or the rants of ambition, ſerve only to heighten the abſurdity of the ſcene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in ſhort, as little anguiſh at their own diſtreſs, or the complaints of others, as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, though dreſſed in black, feels ſorrow at a funeral.</p>
               <p>The famous Cardinal de Retz poſſeſſed this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of temper in the higheſt degree, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than any other man in the world. As he was a man of gallantry, and deſpiſed all that wore the pedantic appearance of philoſophy, wherever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was to be ſold, he was generally foremoſt to raiſe the auction. Being an univerſal admirer of the fair ſex, when he found one lady cruel, he gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally fell in love with another, from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a more favourable reception: if ſhe too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his addreſſes, he never thought of retiring into deſarts, or pining in hopeleſs diſtreſs. He perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, that, inſtead of loving the lady, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032623_0080_0FF3E109C2B3E500"/>
fancied that he had loved her, and ſo all was well again. When fortune wore her angrieſt look, and he at laſt fell into the power of his moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Cardinal Mazarine, (being confined a cloſe priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in the caſtle of Valenciennes) he never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport his diſtreſs by wiſdom or philoſophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himſelf and his perſecutor, and ſeemed infinitely pleaſed at his new ſituation. In this manſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, though ſecluded from his friends, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied all the amuſements, and even the conveniences of life, he ſtill retained his good humour; laughed at all the little ſpite of his enemies; and carried the jeſt ſo far as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</p>
               <p>To be ſtubborn or ſullen under misfortunes, is all that the wiſdom of the proud can teach. The Cardinal's example will inſtruct us to be merry in circumſtances of the higheſt affliction. It matters not whether our good humour be conſtrued by others into inſenſibility, or even ideotiſm; it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to ourſelves, and none but a fool would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his ſatisfaction by what the world thinks of it: for my own part, I never paſs by one of our priſons for debt, when I do not envy that felicity which is ſtill going forward among thoſe people who forget the care of the world by being ſhut out from its ambition.</p>
               <p>The following account of a good natured fellow, who actually ſubſiſts at this moment, is a caſe in point. Whenever he fell into any miſery, he uſually called it ſeeing life. If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a ſharper, he comforted himſelf by imitating the Hibernian dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the one, or the more faſhionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiſs to him. His inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to money matters had incenſed his father to ſuch a degree, that all the interceſſion of friends in his fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r was fruitleſs. The old gentleman was
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032623_0081_0FF3E10C436A4868"/>
on his death-bed. The whole family, and Dick among the number, gathered around him. "I leave my ſecond ſon Andrew," ſaid the expiring miſer, "my whole eſtate, and deſire him to be frugal" Andrew, in a ſorrowful tone, as is uſual on theſe occaſions, prayed Heaven to prolong his life and health to enjoy it himſelf. "I recommend Simon, my third ſon, to the care of his elder brother, and leave him beſide four thouſand pounds." "Ah! father," cried Simon (in great affliction to be ſure) "May Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourſelf." At laſt, turning to poor Dick, "As for you, you have always been a ſad dog; you will nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come to good; you will never be rich; I will leave you a ſhilling to buy an halter." "Ah! father," cries Dick, without any emotion, "may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it yourſelf." This was all the trouble the loſs of fortune gave this thoughtleſs imprudent creature. However, the tenderneſs of an uncle recompenſed the neglect of a father; and he is now not only exceſſively good-humoured, but competently rich.</p>
               <p>Let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public which pronounces him a dunce; at a General who ſmiles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good humour in ſpite of ſcandal; but ſuch is the wiſeſt behaviour that any of us can poſſibly aſſume; it is certainly a better way to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe calamity by diſſipation, than to take up the arms of reaſon or reſolution to oppoſe it: by the firſt method, we forget our miſeries; by the laſt, we only conceal them from others; by ſtruggling with misfortunes, we are ſure to receive ſome wounds in the conflict; but a ſure method to come off vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, is by running away.</p>

                  <p>THEY were the ſweeteſt notes I ever heard; and I inſtantly let down the fore-glaſs, to hear them more diſtinctly.—It is Maria, ſaid the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillion, obſerving I was liſtening—Poor Maria, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued be (leaning his body on one ſide to let me ſee her, for he was in a line betwixt us) is ſitting upon a bank playing her veſpers upon her pipe, with her little goat beſide her.</p>
                  <p>The young fellow uttered this with an accent, and a look ſo perfectly in turne to a feeling heart, that I inſtantly made a vow, I would give him a four and twenty ſous piece, when I got to Moulines—</p>
                  <p>—And who is poor Maria? ſaid I.</p>
                  <p>The love and pity of all the villages around us, ſaid the poſtillion—it is but three years ago that the ſun did not ſhine upon ſo fair, ſo quick witted, and amiable a maid; and a better fate did Maria deſerve, than to have her banns forbid by the intrigues of the curate of the pariſh who publiſhed them—</p>
                  <p>He was going on, when Maria, who had made a ſhort pauſe, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again—they were the ſame notes—yet were ten times ſweeter; it is the evening ſervice to the virgin, ſaid the young man—but who has taught her to play it—or how ſhe came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that Heaven has aſſiſted her in both; for ever ſince ſhe has been unſettled in her mind, it ſeems her only conſolation—ſhe has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that ſervice upon it both night and day.</p>
                  <p>The poſtillion delivered this with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and natural eloquence, that I could not help decyphering ſomething in his face above his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhould have ſifted out his hiſtory, had not poor Maria's taken poſſeſſion of me.</p>

                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:032623_0083_0FF3E10F8ED0B598"/>We had got up by this time almoſt to the bank where Maria was ſitting: ſhe was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two treſſes, drawn up into a ſilk net, with a fine olive leaf twiſted a little fantaſtically on one ſide—ſhe was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honeſt heart ach, it was the moment I ſaw her—</p>
                  <p>—God help her! poor damſel! above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred maſſes ſaid the poſtillion, have been ſaid in the ſeveral pariſh churches and convents around, for her—but without effect; we have ſtill hopes, as ſhe is ſenſible for ſhort intervals, that the virgin at laſt will reſtore her to herſelf; but her parents, who know her beſt, are hopeleſs upon that ſcore, and think her ſenſes are loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>As the poſtillion ſpoke this, Maria made a cadence ſo melancholy, ſo tender and querulous, that I ſprung out of the chaiſe to help her, and found myſelf ſitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt her and her goat before I relapſed from my enthuſiaſm.</p>
                  <p>Maria looked wiſhfully for ſome time at me, and then at her goat—and then at me—and then at her goat again, and ſo on alternately.—</p>
                  <p>—Well, Maria, ſaid I ſoftly—What reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance do you find?</p>
                  <p>I do intreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humbleſt conviction of what a beaſt man is, that I aſked the queſtion; and that I would not have let fall an unſeaſonable pleaſantry in the venerable preſence of miſery, to be entitled to all the wit that even Rabelais ſcattered.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, Maria!—adieu, poor helpleſs damſel!— ſome time, but not now, I may hear thy ſorrows from thy own lips—but I was deceived, for that moment ſhe took her pipe, and told me ſuch a tale of woe with it, that I roſe up, and with broken and irregular ſteps walked ſoftly to my chaiſe.</p>

                  <p>WHEN we had got within half a league of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I diſcovered poor Maria ſitting under a poplar—ſhe was ſitting with her elbow in her lap, and head leaning on one ſide within her hand—a ſmall brook ran at the foot of the tree.</p>
                  <p>I bade the poſtillion go on with the chaiſe to Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines—and La Fleur to beſpeak my ſupper—and that I would walk after.</p>
                  <p>She was dreſſed in white, and much as my friend deſcribed her, except that her hair hung looſe, which before was twiſted within a ſilk net. She had ſuper-added likewiſe to her jacket, a pale green ribband, which fell acroſs her ſhoulder to the waiſt, at the end of which hung her pipe. Her goat had been as faithleſs as her lover, and ſhe had got a little dog in lieu of him, which ſhe had kept tied by a ſtring to her girdle; as I looked at her dog, ſhe drew him towards her with a ſtring.—"Thou ſhalt not leave me, Sylvio," ſaid ſhe. I looked in Maria's eyes, and ſaw ſhe was thinking more of her father than of her lover, or her little goat; for as ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, the tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>I ſat down cloſe by her, and Maria let me wipe them away, as they fell, with my handkerchief. I then ſteeped it in my own—and then in her's—and then in mine—and then I wiped her's again—and as I did it—I felt ſuch undeſcribable emotions within me, as I am ſure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion.</p>
                  <p>I am poſitive I have a ſoul, nor can all the books with which materialiſts have peſtered the world ever convince me of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>When Maria had come a little to herſelf, I aſked her if ſhe remembered a pale thin perſon of a man, who ſat down betwixt her and her goat about two

years before: She ſaid ſhe was unſettled much at that time, but remembered it upon two accounts— that ill as ſhe was, ſhe was ſure the perſon pitied her; and next, that her goat had ſtolen his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, and ſhe had beat him for the theft—ſhe had waſhed it, ſhe ſaid, in the brook, and kept it ever ſince in her pocket to reſtore it to him, in caſe ſhe ſhould ever ſee him again; which, ſhe added, he had half promiſed her. As ſhe told me this, ſhe took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me ſee it; ſhe had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied round with a tendril—on opening it, I ſaw an S marked in one of the corners.</p>
                  <p>She had ſince that, ſhe told me, ſtrayed as far as Rome, and walked round St. Peter's once—and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back—that ſhe found her way alone acroſs the Appenines—had travelled over all Lombardy without money—and through the flinty roads of Savoy without ſhoes—how ſhe had borne it, and how ſhe had got ſupported, ſhe could not tell—but God tempers the wind, ſaid Maria, to the ſhorn lamb.</p>
                  <p>Shorn indeed! and to the quick, ſaid I; and waſt thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it, and ſhelter thee, thou ſhouldſt eat of my bread, and drink of my own cup. I would be kind to thy Sylvio—in all thy weakneſſes and wanderings I would ſeek after thee, and bring thee back—when the ſun went down I would ſay my prayers, and when I had done, thou ſhouldſt play thy evening ſong upon thy pipe, nor would the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of thy ſacrifice be worſe accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart.</p>
                  <p>Nature melted within me as I uttered this; and Maria obſerving, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was ſteeped too much already to be of uſe, would needs go waſh it in the ſtream. And where will you dry it, Maria? ſaid I. I will dry it in my boſom, ſaid ſhe—it will do me good.</p>
                  <p>And is your heart ſtill ſo warm, Maria? ſaid I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:032623_0086_0FF3F26A6DDA76E0"/>I touched upon the ſtring on which hung all her ſorrows—ſhe looked with wiſtful diſorder for ſome time in my face, and then, without ſaying any thing, took her pipe and played her ſervice to the virgin. The ſtring I had touched ceaſed to vibrate—in a moment or two Maria returned to herſelf—let her pipe fall—and roſe up.</p>
                  <p>And where are you going, Maria? ſaid I. She ſaid, to Moulines.—Let us go, ſaid I, together. Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the ſtring, to let the dog follow—in that order we entered Moulines.</p>
                  <p>Though I hate ſalutations and greetings in the market-place, yet when we had got into the middle of this, I ſtopped to take my laſt look, and laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of Maria.</p>
                  <p>Maria, though not tall, was nevertheleſs of the firſt order of fine forms—affliction had touched her looks with ſomething that was ſcarce earthly— ſtill ſhe was feminine—and ſo much was there about her of all that the heart wiſhes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and thoſe of Eliza's out of mine, ſhe ſhould not only eat of my bread, and drink of my cup, but Maria ſhould lie in my boſom, and be unto me as a daughter.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, poor luckleſs maiden! imbibe the oil and wine which the compaſſion of a ſtranger, as he journieth on his way, now pours into thy wounds— the being who has twice bruiſed thee can only bind them up for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> contraſted. A VISION.</head>
               <p>THE following remarkable dream made ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon the mind of Caſtillus, that we will relate it in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:032623_0087_0FF3F26CAE880490"/>Methought I was in the midſt of a very entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet of company, and extremely delighted in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their lively converſation; when on a ſudden, I perceived one of the moſt ſhocking figures imagination can frame, advancing towards me. She was dreſſed in black; her ſkin was contracted into a thouſand wrinkles; her eyes deep ſunk in her head; and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death. Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting ſeverity; and her hands arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with whips and ſcorpions. As ſoon as ſhe came near, with an horrid frown, and a voice that chilled my very blood, ſhe bade me follow her. I obeyed; &amp; ſhe led me through rugged paths, beſet with briars and thorns, into a deep ſolitary valley. Wherever ſhe paſſed, the fading verdure withered beneath her ſteps, her peſtilential breath infected the air with malignant vapours, obſcured the luſtre of the ſun, and involved the fair face of heaven in univerſal gloom. Diſmal howling reſounded through the foreſt; from every baleful tree the night raven ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his dreadful note, and the proſpect was filled with deſolation and horror. In the midſt of this tremendous ſcene, my execrable guide addreſſed me in the following manner:</p>
               <p>"Retire with me, O raſh, unthinking mortal! retire from the vain allurements of a deceitful world, and learn that pleaſure was not deſigned the portion of human life. Man was born to mourn and to be wretched. This is the condition of all below the ſtars, and whoever endeavours to oppoſe it, acts in contradiction to the will of heaven. Fly then from the fatal enchantments of mirth and ſocial delight, and here conſecrate the ſolitary hours to lamentation and woe. Miſery is the duty of all ſublunary beings: and every enjoyment is an offence to the Deity, who is to be worſhipped only by the mortification of every ſenſe of pleaſure, and the everlaſting exerciſe of ſighs and tears."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:032623_0088_0FF3F26EE2FAE138"/>This melancholy picture of life quite ſunk my ſpirits, and ſeemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me. I threw myſelf beneath a blaſted yew, where the winds blew cold and diſmal round my head, and dreadful apprehenſions chilled my heart. Here I reſolved to lie till the hand of death, which I impatiently invoked, ſhould put an end to the miſeries of a life ſo deplorably wretched. In this ſad condition I eſpied on one hand of me a deep muddy river, whoſe waves rolled on in ſlow ſullen murmurs Here I determined to plunge, and was juſt upon the brink, when I found myſelf ſuddenly drawn back. I turned about, and was ſurpriſed by the ſight of the lovelieſt object I ever beheld. The moſt engaging charms of youth and beauty appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all her form: effulgent glories ſparkled in her eyes, and their awful ſplendor were ſoftened by the gentleſt looks of compaſſion and peace. At her approach, the frightful ſpectre, who had before tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented me, vaniſhed away, and with her all the horrors ſhe had cauſed. The gloomy clouds bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into cheerful ſunſhine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of Eden. I was quite tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at this unexpected change, and reviving pleaſure began to gladden my thoughts; when, with a look of inexpreſſible ſweetneſs, my beauteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer thus uttered her divine inſtructions.</p>
               <p>"My name is Religion. I am the offspring of Truth and Love, and the parent of Benevolence, Hope, and Joy. That monſter from whoſe power I have freed you, is called Superſtition; ſhe is the child of Diſcontent, and her followers are Fear and Sorrow. Thus, different as we are, ſhe has often the inſolence to aſſume my name and character, and ſeduce unhappy mortals to think the ſame, till ſhe at length drives them to the borders of deſpair, that dreadful abyſs into which you were juſt going to ſink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:032623_0089_0FF3F271190F63D8"/>"Look round and ſurvey the glorious beauties of this globe, which heaven has deſtined for the ſeat of the human race; and conſider whether a world thus exquiſitely framed, could be meant for the abode of miſery or pain. For what end has the laviſh hand of Providence diffuſed ſuch innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the privilege of exiſtence, and be filled with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the beneficent Author of it? Thus to enjoy the bleſſings he has ſent, is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merely as means of pleaſure, is pitiable ignorance, or abſurd perverſeneſs. Infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite goodneſs is the ſource of created exiſtence. The proper tendency of every rational being, from the higheſt order of raptured ſeraphs, to the meaneſt rank of men, is to riſe inceſſantly from lower degrees of happineſs to higher. They have each faculties aſſigned them for various orders of delights."</p>
               <p>What! cried Caſtillus, is this the language of Religion? Does ſhe lead her votaries through flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery paths, and bid them paſs an unlaborious life? Where are the painful toils of virtue, the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of penitents, and the ſelf-denying exerciſes of ſaints and heroes?</p>
               <p>"The true enjoyment of a reaſonable being (anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered ſhe mildly) does not conſiſt in unbounded indulgence, or luxurious eaſe, in the tumult of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the languor of indolence, or the flutter of light amuſements. Yielding to immoral pleaſure corrupts the mind; living to animal and trifling ones debaſes it; both in their degrees diſqualify it for its genuine good, and conſign it over to wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Whoever would be really happy, muſt make the diligent and regular exerciſe of his ſuperior powers his chief attention, adoring the perfections of his Maker, expreſſing good will to his fellow creatures, and cultivating inward rectitude. To his lower faculties he muſt allow ſuch gratifications as will, by refreſhing them, invigorate his noble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits.

In the regions inhabited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity for ever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant ſtream, nor needs there any mound to check its courſe. Beings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of a frame of mind originally diſeaſed, as all the human race has cauſe to be, muſt uſe the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a ſtricter felf-government. Whoever has been guilty of voluntary exceſſes, muſt patiently ſubmit both to the painful workings of nature, and needful ſeverities of medicine, in order to his cure. Still he is entitled to a moderate ſhare of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair manſion of his merciful Parent affords, conſiſtent with his recovery. And in proportion as this recovery advances, the livelieſt joy will ſpring from his ſecret ſenſe of an amended and improved heart. So far from the horrors of deſpair is the condition even of the guilty. Shudder poor mortal at the thought of the gulph into which thou waſt juſt now going to plunge.</p>
               <p>"While the moſt faulty have every encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to amend, the more innocent ſoul will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſtill ſweeter conſolations under all its experience of human infirmities, ſupported by the gladdening aſſurances, that every ſincere endeavour to outgrow them, ſhall be aſſiſted, accepted, and rewarded. To ſuch a one, the loweſt ſelf-abaſement is but a deep laid foundation for the moſt elevated hopes; ſince they who faithfully examine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what they are, ſhall be enabled under my conduct to become what they deſire. The Chriſtian and the hero are inſeparable; and to the aſpirings of unaſſuming truſt and filial confidence are ſet no bounds. To him who is animated with a view of obtaining approbation from the Sovereign of the univerſe, no difficulty is inſurmountable. Secure in this purſuit of every needful aid, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the ſevereſt pains and trials, is little more than the vigorous exerciſe of a mind in health. His patient dependance on that Providence which
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032623_0091_0FF3F2764DD03970"/>
looks through all eternity, his ſilent reſignation, his ready accommodation of his thoughts and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to its inſcrutable ways, is at once the moſt excellent ſort of ſelf-denial, and ſource of the moſt exalted tranſports. Society is the true ſphere of human virtue. In ſocial, active life, difficulties will be perpetually met with, reſtraints of many kinds will be neceſſary, and ſtudying to behave right in reſpect of theſe, is a diſcipline of the human heart, uſeful to others, and improving to itſelf. Suffering is no duty, but where it is neceſſary to avoid guilt, or to do good, nor pleaſure a crime, but where it ſtrengthens the influence of bad inclinations, or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens the generous activity of virtue. The happineſs allotted to man in his preſent ſtate, is indeed faint and low, compared with his immortal proſpect and noble capacities; but yet, whatever portion of it the diſtributing hand of heaven offers to each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, is a needful ſupport and refreſhment for the preſent moment, ſo far as it may not hinder the attaining his final deſtination.</p>
               <p>"Return then with me from continual miſery to moderate enjoyment, and grateful alacrity; return from the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are the gloomy doctrines of ſuperſtition, by which ſhe endeavours to break thoſe chains of benevolence and ſocial affection, that link the welfare of every particular with that of the whole. Remember, that the greateſt honor you can pay the Author of your being, is ſuch a cheerful behaviour, as diſcovers a mind ſatisfied with his own diſpenſations."</p>

               <head>On the extreme Folly of being diſſatisfied with our preſent Circumſtances, exemplified in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Hiſtory of Horatio,</head>
               <byline>written by Himſelf.</byline>
               <p>I AM the ſon of a younger brother of a good fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, who, at his deceaſe, left me a little fortune of about one hundred pounds per annum. I was put early to Eton ſchool, where I learned Latin and Greek, from whence I went to the Univerſity, where I learned not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune while I was at college, and having no inclination to follow any profeſſion, I removed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to town, and lived for ſome time as moſt young fellows do, by ſpending four times my income. But it was my happineſs, before it was too late, to fall in love with, and to marry a very amiable young creature, whoſe fortune was juſt ſufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured as well as I was able, to ſquare my wiſhes to my circumſtances. In this endeavour I ſucceeded ſo well, that excepting a few private hankerings after a little more than I poſſeſſed, and now and then a ſigh when a coach and ſix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a very happy man.</p>
               <p>I can truly ſay, that though my family oeconomy was not much to be boaſted of, and in conſequence of it, we were frequently driven to great ſtraits and difficulties, I experienced more real ſatisfaction in this humble ſituation, than I have ever done ſince in more enviable circumſtances. We were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed a little in debt, but when money came in, the pleaſure of diſcharging what we owed, was more than equivalent for theſe pains it put us to; and though the narrowneſs of our circumſtances ſubjected us to many cares and anxieties, it ſerved to keep the body in action as well as the mind; for, as our garden was ſomewhat large, and required
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032623_0093_0FF3F27A0EAC2638"/>
more hands to keep it in order than we could afford to hire, we daily laboured in it ourſelves, and drew health from our neceſſities.</p>
               <p>I had a little boy who was the delight of my heart, and who probably might have been ſpoiled by nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if the attention of his parents had not been otherwiſe employed. His mother was naturally of a ſickly conſtitution, but the affairs of her family, as they engroſſed all her thoughts, gave her no time for complaint. The ordinary troubles of life, which to thoſe who have nothing elſe to think of, are almoſt inſupportable, were leſs terrible to us than to perſons of eaſier circumſtances, for it is a certain truth, that where the mind is divided among many cares, the anxiety is lighter than when there is only one to contend with. Even in the happieſt ſituation, in the midſt of eaſe, health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious in tormenting itſelf, loſing the immediate enjoyment of thoſe invaluable bleſſings, by the painful ſuggeſtion that they are too great for continuance.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reflections that I have made ſince, for I do not attempt to deny, that I ſighed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an addition to my fortune. The death of a diſtant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happieſt man living. My income was now increaſed to ſix hundred a year; and, I hoped, with a little oeconomy, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in leſs eaſy circumſtances had not touched me ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was now conſtantly in my thoughts, and ſoured all my enjoyments. The conſciouſneſs too of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an eſtate to leave my boy, made me ſo anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to preſerve him, that inſtead of ſuffering him to run at pleaſure where he pleaſed, and to grow hardy by exerciſe, I almoſt deſtroyed him by confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We now did nothing in our garden, becauſe we were in circumſtances to have it kept by others;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032623_0094_0FF3E038CD7FA0A0"/>
but as air and exerciſe were neceſſary for our healths, we reſolved to abridge ourſelves of ſome unneceſſary articles, and to ſet up an equipage. This, in time, brought with it a train of expences, which we had neither prudence to foreſee, nor courage to prevent. For, as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our viſits, it greatly increaſed our acquaintance, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected us to the neceſſity of making continual enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments at home, in return for thoſe which we were invited to abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living, were much too great for the income we poſſeſſed; inſomuch, that we found ourſelves in a very ſhort time more neceſſitous than ever. Pride would not ſuffer us to lay down an equipage, and to live in a manner unſuitable to it, was what we could not think of. To pay the debts I had contracted, I was ſoon forced to mortgage my eſtate; and, at laſt, to ſell the beſt part of it; and, as it was utterly impoſſible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it adviſeable to remove of a ſudden, to ſell our coach in town, and to look out for a new ſituation, at a greater diſtance from our acquaintance.</p>
               <p>But unfortunately for my peace, I carried a habit of expence along with me, and was very near being reduced to abſolute want, when by the unexpected death of an uncle, and his two ſons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I ſucceeded to an eſtate of 7000l. a year.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation I might be called a very happy man, and ſo indeed I was; I ſet about the regulation of my family with the moſt pleaſing ſatisfaction. The ſplendor of my equipage, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of ſervants that attended me, the elegance of my houſe and furniture, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the court that was every where paid me, gave me inexpreſſible delight ſo long as they were novelties; but no ſooner were they become habitual
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032623_0095_0FF3F27DC9E1BD48"/>
to me, than I loſt all manner of reliſh for them, and I diſcovered in a very little time, that by having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to wiſh for I had nothing to enjoy. My appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite grew palled by ſatiety, a perpetual crowd of viſitors robbed me of all domeſtic enjoyment, my ſervants plagued me, and my ſteward cheated me.</p>
               <p>But the courſe of greatneſs did not end here. Daily experience convinced me that I was compelled to live more for others than for myſelf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zealous oppoſer of all miniſterial meaſures; as his eſtate was the largeſt of any gentleman in the county, he ſupported an intereſt in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me in gratitude to declare myſelf on that ſide; but the difficulties I had to encounter were too many and too great for me; inſomuch that I have been baffled and defeated in almoſt every thing I have undertook. To deſert the cauſe in which I have embarked would diſgrace me; and to go greater lengths in it will almoſt undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual ſtate of warfare with the principal gentlemen of the county, and am cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by my tenants and dependants for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are pleaſed to tell me) contrary to their conſciences.</p>
               <p>My wife and I had once pleaſed ourſelves with the thoughts of being uſeful in the neighbourhood, by dealing out our charity to the poor and induſtrious; but the perpetual hurry in which we live, renders us incapable of looking out for objects ourſelves, and the agents we intruſt are either pocketing our bounty, or beſtowing it on the undeſerving. At night when we retire to reſt, we are venting our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints on the miſeries of the day, and praying heartily for the return of that peace, which was the only companion of our humbleſt ſituation.</p>
               <p>Where pain, ſickneſs, and abſolute want, are out of the queſtion, no external change of circumſtances
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032623_0096_0FF3F2809C252B70"/>
can make a man more laſtingly happy than he was before. It is to our ignorance of this truth, that the univerſal diſſatisfaction of mankind is principally to be aſcribed. Care is the lot of human life; and he that aſpires to greatneſs in hopes to get rid of it, is like one, who throws himſelf into a furnace to avoid the ſhivering ague.</p>
               <p>The only ſatisfaction I can enjoy in my preſent ſituation is, that it has not pleaſed Heaven in its wrath to make me a king.</p>

               <head>On the Amuſements of <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is aſtoniſhing to conceive what quantities of bread, cheeſe, cakes, ale, &amp;c. are conſtantly conſumed on a Sunday, in all the little towns near London. It is incredible how many thouſand buns are devoured in that one day at Chelſea, and the neighbouring villages, and how much beer is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at Iſlington, and Mile-end, as well as what oceans of tea and coffee, and cart loads of hot loaves at White Conduit Houſe, Bagnigge, Wells, Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Houſe, the Spa, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Could an exact eſtimate be formed, the review would be very entertaining, and we muſt conclude that the Sabbath is a moſt excellent inſtitution, ſince the very breaking of it is the ſupport of half the villages about the metropolis.</p>
               <p>That part of the fourth commandment which prohibits the doing any work on Sunday, is very ſtrictly obſerved by the common people, who ſeem to underſtand it as if it gave them an uncontrolled licence to pleaſurable indulgences. They take this opportunity of walking as far as the iſland of St. Helena, or eating white bait at Blackwall. As they all aim at going into the country, nothing can be a greater misfortune to the meaner part of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants

of London and Weſtminſter, than a rainy Sunday. How many city apprentices, merchants' clerks, as well as ſeveral other people of different profeſſions, would be diſappointed of a ride once a week, if the legiſlature were to limit the hired horſes, and one horſe chaiſes, from working on that day to a certain number.</p>
               <p>The plodding tradeſman is carried to his ſnug box, which has nothing rural about it except the ivy which over-runs the front, and is placed as near to the road as poſſible, where the pleaſure of ſeeing carriages pop under his window, compenſates for being almoſt ſmothered with duſt. The young ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices, clerks, &amp;c. above alluded to, are ſeen whipping and ſpurring their broken winded jades up the hills; and the good natured huſband, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his mate, are dragged along the road to the admiration of the foot paſſenger, who trudges patiently with a child in one arm, while his beloved doxy leans on the other.</p>

               <p>To people of one claſs, Sunday wears the ſame face as the reſt of the week. It is really a matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment, that no public place, ſuch as Ranelagh, and Vauxhall, ſhould not be open of a Sunday evening, where perſons of faſhion might paſs away the hours that hang ſo heavy upon their hands, till the time arrives when they might with propriety ſit down to the card table, for it certainly is more decent to make aſſignations there than at church, which we are ſorry to ſay is too much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented for that purpoſe alone; though this is pretty well remedied by the concourſe of people who attend the Mall and Kenſington Gardens.

room; to others it affords a cheap opportunity of ſhewing their taſte for dreſs; not a few are drawn together in our cathedrals and large churches, by the influence of the muſic, rather than by the prayers, and are kept awake by a jig from the organ loft, though they are lulled aſleep by the harangue from the pulpit</p>
               <p>A well diſpoſed Chriſtian will go a mile from his own houſe to St. Paul's, for the ſake of the anthem rather than the ſermon, and many a Methodiſt will trudge to the Lock chapel, not becauſe M— is to preach, but becauſe Lockhart plays on the organ, and Miſs— leads the enchanting train of female ſingers.</p>
               <p>Upon modern principles it appears very ſtrange, that going to church ſhould be deemed a kind of amuſement, at leaſt it is ſo wholly incompatible with the polite ſyſtem of life, that a perſon of faſhion, as affairs are now managed, finds it abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to comply with the practice.

A Chineſe, who had long ſtudied the works of Confucius, who knew the characters of fourteen thouſand words, and could read a great part of every book that came in his way, once took it into his head to travel into Europe, and obſerve the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a people whom he thought not very much inferior, even to his own countrymen, in the arts of refining upon every paſſion. Upon his arrival at Amſterdam, his paſſion for letters naturally led him to a bookſeller's ſhop; and, as he could ſpeak a little Dutch, he civilly aſked the bookſeller for the works of the immortal Xixofou. The bookſeller aſſured him he had never heard the book mentioned before. "What, have you never heard of that immortal poet?" returned the other much ſurpriſed, "that light of the eyes, that favourite of kings, that roſe of perfection! I ſuppoſe you know nothing of the immortal Fipſihihi, ſecond couſin to the moon?" "Nothing at all, indeed, Sir," returned the other. "Alas!" cries our traveller, "to what purpoſe, then, has one of theſe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So prevalent is this that there is ſcarce a village in Europe, and not one univerſity, that is not thus furniſhed with its little great men. The head of a petty corporation, who oppoſes the deſigns of a prince, who would tyrannically force his ſubjects to ſave their beſt cloaths for Sunday; the puny pedant, who finds one undiſcovered property in the polype, or deſcribes an unheeded proceſs in the ſkeleton of a mole; and whoſe mind, like his microſcope, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives nature only in detail; the rhymer, who makes ſmooth verſes, and paints to our imagination, when he ſhould only ſpeak to our hearts: all equally fancy themſelves walking forward to immortality, and deſire the crowd behind them to look on. The crowd takes them at their word. Patriot, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032623_0103_0FF46FA81C0B9890"/>
and Poet, are ſhouted in their train. "Where was there ever ſo much merit ſeen? No times ſo important as our own; ages, yet unborn, ſhall gaze with wonder and applauſe!" To ſuch muſic, the important pigmy moves forward, buſtling and ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and aptly compared to a puddle in a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>How vain and unſtable is popularity! I have lived to ſee Admirals and Generals who once had crowds hollowing after them wherever they went, who were praiſed by newſpapers and magazines, thoſe echoes of the voice of the vulgar, and yet they have long ſunk into merited obſcurity, with ſcarce even an epitaph left to flatter. A few years ago the herring fiſhery employed all Grub-ſtreet; it was the topic in every coffee-houſe, and the burden of every ballad. We were to drag up oceans of gold from the bottom of the ſea; we were to ſupply all Europe with herrings upon our own terms At preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent we hear no more of all this. We have fiſhed up very little gold that I can learn; nor do we furniſh the world with herrings, as was expected. Let us wait but a few years longer, and we ſhall find all our expectations in herring-fiſhery.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not at all wonder if the caprice of the populace which made the ſkies ring with the name of a Keppel, ſhould repeat, if poſſible, louder huzzas at the advancement of his adverſary.</p>

               <head>Animadverſions on the Conduct of the Clergy.</head>
               <p>IT is undoubtedly true, that our Engliſh divines receive a more liberal education, and improve that education, by frequent ſtudy, more than any others of this reverend profeſſion in Europe It may be obſerved alſo in general, that a greater degree of gentility is affixed to the character of a ſtudent in England than elſewhere; by which means our clergy
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032623_0104_0FF46FAB85AABAB8"/>
have an opportunity of ſeeing better company while young, and of ſoon wearing off thoſe prejudices which they are apt to imbibe even in the beſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated univerſities, and which may be juſtly termed the vulgar errors of the wiſe.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is very obvious with all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that the clergy are no where ſo little thought of, by the populace, as here; and, though our divines are foremoſt, with reſpect to abilities, yet they are found laſt in the effects of their miniſtry; the vulgar, in general, appearing no way impreſſed with a ſenſe of religious duty. I am not for whining at the depravity of the times, or for endeavouring to paint a proſpect more gloomy than in nature; but certain it is, no perſon who has travelled will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me, when I aver, that the lower orders of mankind, in other countries, teſtify, on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the profoundeſt awe of religion; while in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land they are ſcarcely awakened into a ſenſe of its duties, even in circumſtances of the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s.</p>
               <p>Foreigners are apt to attribute this diſſolute and fearleſs conduct to climate and conſtitution; may not the vulgar, being pretty much neglected in our exhortations from the pulpit, be a conſpiring cauſe? Our divines ſeldom ſtoop to their mean capacities; and they who want inſtruction moſt, find leaſt in our religious aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me a principal duty, whatever may become of the higher orders of mankind, who are generally poſſeſſed of collateral motives to virtue, the vulgar ſhould be particularly regarded, whoſe beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in civil life is totally hinged upon their hopes and fears. Thoſe who conſtitute the baſis of the great fabric of ſociety, ſhould be particularly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, in policy, as in architecture, that maxim holds good, ruin is moſt fatal when it begins from the bottom.</p>
               <p>It is the misfortune of men of real ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to prefer a prudent mediocrity to a
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032623_0105_0FF3F28C8146FB08"/>
precarious popularity; and, fearing to outdo their duty, leave it half done. Their diſcourſes from the pulpit are generally dry, methodical, and unaffecting; delivered with the moſt inſipid calmneſs; inſomuch, that, ſhould the peaceful preacher lift his head over the cuſhion, which alone he ſeems to addreſs, he might diſcover his audience, inſtead of being awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remorſe, actually ſleeping over his methodical and laboured compoſition.</p>
               <p>Some people call this method of preaching, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to reaſon, and not to the paſſions; this is ſtiled the making of converts from conviction: but ſuch are indifferently acquainted with human nature, who are not ſenſible, that men ſeldom reaſon about their deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Thoſe who attempt to reaſon us out of our follies, begin at the wrong end, ſince the attempt naturally preſuppoſes us capable of this, which is one great point of the cure.</p>
               <p>In order to become a popular preacher, there are but few talents requiſite, for the people are eaſily pleaſed if they perceive any endeavours in the orator to pleaſe them; the meaneſt qualifications will work this effect, if the preacher ſincerely ſets about it. Perhaps little, indeed very little more is required, than ſincerity and aſſurance; and a becoming ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity is always certain of producing a becoming aſſurance. "Si vis me fiere, dolendum eſt primum tibi ipſi," is ſo trite a quotation, that it almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands an apology to repeat it; yet, though all allow the juſtice of the remark, how few do we find put it in practice!

are about to deliver; they, of all profeſſions, ſeem the moſt baſhful, who have the greateſt right to glory in their commiſſion.</p>
               <p>It is the cuſtom with the French preachers gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to aſſume all that dignity which becomes men who are ambaſſadors from Chriſts whilſt the Engliſh divines, like erroneous envoys, ſeem more ſolicitous not to offend the court to which they are ſent, than to drive home the intereſts of their employer. The biſhop of Maſſilon, in the firſt ſermon he ever preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, found the whole audience, upon his getting into the pulpit in a diſpoſition no way favourable to his intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their nods, whiſpers, or drowſy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſhewed him that there was no great profit to be expected from his ſowing in a ſoil ſo improper; however, he ſoon changed the diſpoſition of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by his manner of beginning: "If," ſays he, "a cauſe, the moſt important that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were to be tried at the bar before qualified judges; if this cauſe intereſted ourſelves in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; if the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed upon the event; if the moſt eminent council were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides; and if we had heard from our infancy of this yet undetermined trial; would you not all ſit with due attention, and warm expectation, to the pleadings on each ſide? Would not all your hopes and fears be hinged upon the final deciſion? And yet, let me tell you, you have this moment a cauſe of much greater importance before you; a cauſe where not one nation, but all the world, are ſpectators; tried, not before a fallible tribunal, but the awful throne of heaven, where not your temporal and tranſitory intereſts are the ſubject of debate, but your eternal happineſs or miſery, where the cauſe is ſtill undetermined; but, perhaps the very moment I am ſpeaking may fix the irrevocable decree that ſhall laſt for ever; and yet, notwithſtanding all this, you can hardly ſit with patience to hear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:032623_0107_0FF46FB208816DE0"/>It may be urged, that the ſtile, the abruptneſs of a beginning like this, in the cloſet would appear abſurd; but in the pulpit it is attended with the moſt laſting impreſſions: that ſtile which, in the cloſet, might juſtly be called flimſy, ſeems the true mode of eloquence here. I never read a fine compoſition, under the title of a ſermon, that I do not think the author has miſcalled his piece; for the talents to be uſed in writing well, entirely differ from thoſe of ſpeaking well. The qualifications for ſpeaking, as has been already obſerved, are eaſily acquired; they are accompliſhments which may be taken up by every candidate who will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Impreſſed with a ſenſe of the truths he is about to deliver, a preacher diſregards the applauſe or contempt of his audience, and he inſenſibly aſſumes a juſt and manly ſincerity. With this talent alone we ſee what crowds are drawn around enthuſiaſts, even deſtitute of common ſenſe; what numbers converted to Chriſtianity. Folly may ſometimes ſet an example for wiſdom to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and our regular divines may borrow inſtruction even from methodiſts, who go their circuits, and preach prizes among the populace. Let clergymen do their duty, and the number of theſe people will decreaſe.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will ſay, that, by confining the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of a preacher to proper aſſurance, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtneſs, and openneſs of ſtyle, I make the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too trifling for eſtimation: there will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing called oratory brought up on this occaſion; action, attitude, grace, elocution, may be repeated as abſolutely neceſſary to complete the character; but let us not be deceived; common ſenſe is ſeldom ſwayed by fine tones, muſical periods, juſt attitudes, or the diſplay of a white handkerchief; oratorial behaviour, except in very able hands indeed, gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſinks into aukward and paltry affectation.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary to remark, that theſe rules are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032623_0108_0FF3F2929B38CBB8"/>
only for him who would inſtruct the vulgar, who ſtand in moſt need of inſtruction. To addreſs philoſophers, and to obtain the character of a polite preacher among the polite—(a much more uſeleſs, though more ſought-for character)—requires a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent method of proceeding. All I ſhall obſerve on this head is, to intreat the polemic divine, in his controverſy with the Deiſts, to act rather offenſively than to defend; to puſh home the grounds of his belief, and the impracticability of theirs, rather than to ſpend time in ſolving the objections of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent. It is ten to one," ſays a late writer on the art of war, "but that the aſſailant who attacks the enemy in his trenches, is always victorious."</p>
               <p>I am clearly of opinion, that upon the whole, our clergy might employ themſelves more to the benefit of ſociety, by declining all controverſy, than by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting even the profoundeſt ſkill in polemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; their conteſts with each other often turn on ſpeculative trifles; and their diſputes with the Deiſts are almoſt at an end, ſince they can have no more than victory, and that they are already poſſeſſed of, as their antagoniſts have been driven into a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the neceſſity of revelation, or an open avowal of atheiſm. To continue the diſpute longer would only endanger it; the ſceptic is ever expert at puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling a debate which he finds himſelf unable to continue; "and, like an Olympic boxer, generally fights beſt when undermoſt."</p>

               <head>New and genuine Anecdotes of <hi>Dean Swift.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT appears by a memorandum in one of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count books which Dean Swift always made up yearly, that his mother died in the year 1710. On each page of this memorandum book, the Dean en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered minutely all his receipts and expences in every
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032623_0109_0FF3F294D10A59B8"/>
month, beginning his year from the firſt of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He obſerved this method all his life time to his laſt illneſs. At the foot of that page which includes his expences of the month of May 1710, at the glebe houſe of Laracor, in the county of Meath, where he was then reſident, are theſe remarkable words, which ſhew, at the ſame time, his filial piety, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious uſe which he thought it his duty to make of that melancholy event. "Memorandum, On Wedneſday, between ſeven and eight in the evening, May 10, 1710, I received a letter in my chamber at Laracor (M Percival, and J. Beaumont, being by) from Mrs. F—, dated May 9, with one incloſed ſent by Mrs. Mouall at Leiceſter, to Mrs. F—, giving an account that my dear mother, Mrs. Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail Swift, died that morning, Monday, April 24, 1710, about 10 o'clock, after a long ſickneſs, being ill all winter, and lame, and extremely ill about a month or ſix weeks before her death. God grant I may live to be as well prepared for it as I confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe her to have been: If the way to heaven be thro' piety, truth, juſtice, &amp; charity, ſhe is there. J.S."</p>
               <p>The Dean always treated his mother during her life, with the utmoſt duty and affection; and ſhe ſometimes came to Ireland to viſit him after his ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement at Laracor. She lodged at Mr. Brent's a Printer in George Lane, Dublin. She aſked Mrs. Brent, the landlady, whether ſhe could keep a ſecret: She replied, ſhe could very well. Upon which ſhe enjoined her not to make the matter public which ſhe was now going to communicate to her. "I have a ſpark in this town, that I carried on a correſpondence with while I was in England; he will be here preſently to pay his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, for he hath heard by this time of my arrival; but I would not have the matter known." Soon after this a rap was heard at the door, and Dean Swift walked up ſtairs; Mrs. Brent retired, but after a little time ſhe was called, and then Mrs. Swift intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to her ſon, and ſaid, "This is my ſpark
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032623_0110_0FF3F2965D4FA598"/>
I was telling you of, this is my lover, and indeed the only one I ſhall ever admit to pay their addreſſes to me." The Doctor ſmiled at his mother's humour, and afterwards paid his duty to her every day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected by Mrs. Brent, whom he invited ſome years afterwards to take care of his family affairs, when he became Dean of St. Patrick's; and when Mrs. Brent died, he continued her daughter, a poor widow, in the ſame office.</p>
               <p>Dr. Sacheverel, in conſequence of a moſt inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſermon, preached before the Lord Mayor, on November 5, 1709. was impeached at the bar of the Houſe of Lords, in the name of the Commons of Great Britain, for high crimes and miſdemeanours, &amp;c. Having been tried before the Lords, and found guilty, he was ſilenced for the ſpace of three years, and his ſermon was condemned to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, which ſentence was rigidly executed.</p>
               <p>When this affair was over, the miniſtry took very little notice of him, and treated him with great indifference; but upon the rectory of St. Andrew's, Holborn, being vacant, the Doctor applied to them for that living, but they paid no regard to his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Upon which he went to Dr. Swift, with whom he had a very ſlender acquaintance, to requeſt his intereſt with the government for that pariſh; and ſet forth how much he had ſuffered for them, and their cauſe. Dr. Swift immediately carried this letter to Lord Bolingbroke, then Secretary of State, who railed much at Sacheverel, calling him a buſy intermeddling fellow; a prig, and an incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had ſet the kingdom in a flame, which could not be extinguiſhed, and therefore deſerved cenſure inſtead of a reward, To which Swift replied, "True, my Lord, but let me tell you a ſtory. In a ſea-fight in the reign of Charles II. there was a very bloody engegement between the Dutch and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh fleets; in the heat of which a Scotch ſeaman was very ſeverely bit by a louſe in his neck, which
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032623_0111_0FF46FBE65C75F18"/>
he caught, and ſtooping down to crack it between his nails, many of the ſailors near him had their heads taken off by a chain-ſhot from the enemy, which ſcattered their brains and blood about him. On this he had compaſſion upon the poor louſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him to his place, and bid him live there at diſcretion; for as he had ſaved his life, he was bound in gratitude to ſave his." The recital of this threw my Lord B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lingbroke into a fit of laughter, who when it was over, ſaid, "The louſe ſhall have the living for your ſtory," and ſoon after Sacheverel was preſented to it.</p>
               <p>In Dublin, as in other large cities, fires have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happened, by which people of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been ſufferers; upon which melancholy occaſion, the Dean always exerted himſelf not only in perſon, by going from houſe to houſe to make collections for them, but wrote and recommended their melancholy caſes to the public. He would go to the afflicted ſufferers, offer them his ſervices, and would be the firſt to ſubſcribe in a moſt princely and generous manner to their relief, which worthy example of his the benevolent citizens of Dublin would imitate.</p>
               <p>His charity appears to have been a ſettled princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of duty, more than an inſtinctive effort of good nature; but as it was then founded and ſupported, it had extraordinary merit, and ſeldom f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led to exert itſelf in a manner that contributed moſt to render it moſt beneficial. He did not laviſh his money upon the idle and worthleſs; he nicely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated characters, and was ſeldom the dupe of impoſition. Hence his generoſity always turned to an uſeful account, while it relieved diſtreſs it encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged induſtry, and rewarded virtue.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, he was a very peculiar man in every reſpect. Some people have ſaid, "What a man he would have been had he been without thoſe whims and infirmities, which ſhaded both his genius and
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032623_0112_0FF3F29B67ACA978"/>
his character." But perhaps the peculiarities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of were inſeparable from his genius. The vigour and fertility of the root could not fail now and then of throwing out ſuperfluous ſuckers that produced theſe, produced alſo the more beautiful branches, and the fruit with all its richneſs.</p>
               <p>It muſt even be acknowledged, that the Dean's fancy hurried him into great abſurdities and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, for which nothing could atone but extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary talents and virtues diſcovered in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The rancour he diſcovered towards the Diſſenters is well known; no ſect or party of men could have merited it in the degree in which he always ſhewed it to them; for in ſome inſtances it bordered on downright perſecution. He doubtleſs had his reaſons for expoſing their principles into ridicule, and might perhaps have ſufficient grounds for ſome of his accuſations againſt their principal leaders in Ireland; but nothing could juſtify his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulence againſt the whole body. Indiſcriminate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections in a community at large, are generally the offspring of ignorance or malice. It is impoſſible to put down his prejudices to the account of the former, and we ſhould be ſorry to impute them to a worſe principle. So great was the Dean's chagrin in the choice which the Corporation of Dublin had made of a Diſſenter for a phyſician to an hoſpital in that city, that he immediately altered a will in which he had nominated them truſtees to a public charity of his own; this action ſtrongly marked his temper, but he ſhould have conſidered that the Corporation had acted not in a religious, but in a civil capacity, ſo that it was at leaſt poſſible a man might be a very ſkilful phyſician, without being an orthodox church-man.</p>
               <p>The Dean's particular averſion to Lord Wharton, is well known and accounted for by a curious anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, communicated by the late Dr. Salter.</p>
               <p>"Lord Somers, recommended Dr. Swift, at his
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032623_0113_0FF3F29CEF76F488"/>
own requeſt, to Lord Wharton, when that Earl went as Lord Lieutenant to Ireland, in 1708, but without ſucceſs; and the anſwer his Lordſhip is ſaid to have given, was never forgotten or forgiven by Dr. Swift, but ſeems to have laid the foundation for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rancour with which he always mentions Lord Wharton. I ſaw and read (ſays Dr. Salter) two letters of Jonathan Swift, then Prebendary of St. Patrick's, Dublin, to Lord Somers; the firſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreating his favour, pleading his poverty, and profeſſing the moſt unalterable attachment to his Lordſhip's perſon, friends, and cauſe; the ſecond acknowledging Lord Somers's kindneſs in having recommended him, and concluding with the like ſolemn profeſſions."</p>
               <p>"Not more than a year before, Swift deſerted Lord Somers, and all his friends, writing avowedly on the contrary ſide, and (as he boaſts himſelf) libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the junto round. I ſaw alſo the very letters which Lord Somers wrote to the Earl of Wharton, in which Swift is very heartily and warmly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and I well remember the ſhort and very ſmart anſwer that Lord Wharton is ſaid to have given, which as I obſerved, Swift never forgave or forgot. It was to this purpoſe: "Oh my Lord! <hi>We</hi> muſt not prefer or countenance theſe fellows; we have character enough <hi>ourſelves.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Dean Swift was likewiſe very angry with Dr Sharp, Lord Archbiſhop of York, who replied to Queen Anne, when ſhe was conſulting the Doctor about making Swift a biſhop, "I hope your Majeſty will firſt be ſatisfied that Dean Swift is a Chriſtian." It is very certain that this ſpeech favoured of extreme aſperity, and it was never forgiven by Swift.</p>
               <p>Repeated diſappointments increaſed the natural acrimony of Swift's temper; this gave a ſplenetic tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his writings, and amidſt the duties of private and domeſtic life, it too frequently appeared to ſhade the luſtre of his more eminent virtues. A pre-ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032623_0114_0FF3F29E77733890"/>
which he had long entertained of that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs which would inevitably overtake him towards the cloſe of life, by the failure of his intellects, crouded his mind with the moſt melancholy ideas, and tinged every object around him. How far his gloomy ſentiments prevailed, we learn from a very remarkable anecdote, preſerved by Dr. Young, in his conjectures upon original compoſition. Mr. Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in his letter to Lord Cheſterfield, hath given one of a very ſimilar nature, which we will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe: "One time in a journey from Dorgheda to Navan, the Dean rode before the company, made a ſudden ſtop, diſmounted his horſe, fell on his knees, lifted up his hands and prayed in the moſt devout manner. When his friends came up, he deſired and inſiſted on their alighting, which they did, and aſked him the meaning; "gentlemen, ſaid he, pray join your hearts in fervent prayers with mine that I may be never like this oak tree, which is decayed and withered at top, whilſt all the other parts are ſound."</p>
               <p>The concluding ſcene of his life was truly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afforded a ſtriking leſſon to check the pride of human genius, and great abilities. Mr. Faulkner gives the following account of it:</p>
               <p>"Swift was never very outrageous, but his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory failed him by degrees for ſeveral years together, inſomuch that he forgot all his friends and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; he could not call any of them by their names, nor for clothes, food, nor any of the neceſſaries he wanted. In ſhort, his forgetfulneſs grew ſo much upon him, that he could not remember any one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his life, nor read, nor even tell his letters for near two years before his death. He likewiſe loſt the uſe of his ſpeech, excepting now and then utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome incoherent, rambling words, being incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aſking any queſtions, or returning any anſwers; nor could he aſk for one neceſſary of life. During this melancholy ſituation, great care was taken of his perſon and food, as he was incapable of dreſſing,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032623_0115_0FF3F2A157F11AC8"/>
undreſſing, or helping himſelf to clothes or victuals; and ſo totally was he deprived of all rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he was treated like a new-born infant, being taken out of bed, undreſſed, and put into bed like the youngeſt child; and had the actions of one, being fond of gold and ſilver toys, which he would play with, or put in his mouth. When he was dead, Mr. Whiteway, an eminent ſurgeon, nearly related to him, opened his ſkull, and found much water in the brain."</p>

               <head>The Prudent Wife—A True Story.</head>
               <p>IN the libidinous reign of king Charles II. there was a young lady named Iſabella, who was one of the maids of honour to the ducheſs of York, that drew the attention of the whole court upon her; ſhe was the reigning to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt of that galtant age, and equally admired by the men of pleaſure, and men of wit; with her beauty ſhe was ſtrictly modeſt; with her wit ſhe was prudent and good-natured. Among her numerous train of admirers, none ſeemed ſo agreeable and deſerving her eſteem, as the young Viſcount Belmour, who, incapable of any baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, even when ſuch deſigns were thought rather an honour than a reflection, gave ſuch aſſurances of his love, that Iſabella eaſily ſurrendered her heart. Iſabella's aunt, who was her guardian, readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the match, and the nuptials were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with mutual joy. As this was a marriage not made up by treaty, but free choice and inclination, they did not fall into that modiſh coldneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant indifference people of faſhion are ſoon apt to do. The Viſcount was a man of unuſual ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability of temper, which, when joined to that of Iſabella's, muſt neceſſarily make him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with his wife; yet this happineſs of temper drew him into ſome misfortunes; his eaſineſs and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the generoſity and openneſs of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, had like to have leſſened his domeſtic felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had not Iſabella's diſcretion prevented it. My lord had contracted a moſt intimate acquaintance with one Mr. Horneck, a man of a pleaſant conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, had a pretty knack of telling a ſtory, ſung agreeably, was an arch mimic; and, in ſhort, an humourous companion. Such was his public cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; but this was only a maſk to conceal the tricking gameſter, and the deſigning pander. To render himſelf more powerful with men of quality, he made himſelf inſtrumental to their follies or their
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032623_0118_0FF3F2A7421AF4A8"/>
vices, and was never without ſome new face to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his acquaintance. Viſcount Belmour was not inclined to any of theſe vices that Horneck was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of; yet this wretch had cunning enough to draw him into all: with drinking, his health ſoon began to impair; with loſſes, his temper was often ſoured; with wenching, that fondneſs and cordial love he was uſed to ſhew to his lady, began to ceaſe. Iſabella was not a little alarmed at this conduct; ſhe was too well informed of his vices, yet prudently thought, that any violent oppoſition would but heighten the miſchief; on the contrary, ſhe took care to make home as eaſy to him as poſſible; ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to oblige him, ſhe never diſguſted him with harſh reproaches, or ſatirical reflections on his conduct; neither, though careful to pleaſe him, did ſhe run into an extreme of fondneſs; ſhe was not fond when ſhe thought it would be diſagreeable; for ſhe knew that a wife without diſcretion may make the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt endearments the moſt troubleſome. Iſabella was gay or fond, as ſhe ſound my lord in the temper to receive either; and without letting him know ſhe had information of his gaming abroad, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe cards or hazard at home, with ſuch company as ſhe thought would pleaſe him; and never forgot to include Mr. Horneck among them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes her propoſal was accepted, and by that means found out the ſharper, the pander, the flatterer, and the villain, in Mr. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Luckily for this diſcreet lady it happened, that, at the ſame time, Florella, a beautiful lady, who had married my lord's brother, was extremely unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy by her jealouſy; for, being certainly informed of her huſband's keeping a woman of the town, and, at the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pacify her, but all in vain; my lady ſucceeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who taking this opportunity to ſhew my lord his own foibles, thus addreſſed herſelf to her ſiſter: "I fancy, dear ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, you want only a little prudential good humour to reclaim your huſband; beauty and wit will not avail without diſcretion. There is a paſſive kind of virtue neceſſary to ſhew him his follies; it muſt not be done with ill nature and conſtant reproaches on his conduct, which, I am afraid, is your method. If my lord Belmour were guilty of the ſame follies, (which I dare affirm he never will) I ſhould myſelf act as I adviſe you. You have beauty enough to pleaſe a huſband; have therefore an equal deſire to do it; be the more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of his humour, as he is the more faulty in his conduct; and let your affability ſhew his injuſtice in wronging you: nor can you think this policy falſe, when the miſtreſſes men viſit, exert all their little arts to pleaſe them, and render their company agreeable; and this for gain only, without honour, without conſcienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHEN I went the other day to viſit Mrs. Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope Doat, after I had been waiting ſome time in the parlour, the ſervant returned with her miſtreſs's compliments, and acquainted me, that ſhe was extremely buſy, and begged to be excuſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to me, but that ſhe ſhould be very happy to ſee me in the nurſery. I was a good deal ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the meſſage, as I knew ſhe was a maiden lady; but I thought proper to follow the ſervant up ſtairs to her miſtreſs, whom I found coming a little white dog that lay in her lap, with a grey parrot perching on one arm of the ſopha where ſhe ſat, a monkey on the back, and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other corner. The whole room, which was a very large one, was a nurſery for all kinds of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, except thoſe of the human ſpecies. Cages hung all round it, containing parrots, mackaws, Canary birds, nightingales, linnets, goldfinches, &amp;c. On the chairs were ſeveral cars repoſing themſelves on ſoft cuſhions; and there were little kennels in the Chineſe taſte in almoſt every corner of the room, filled with pugs, fidos, and King Charles's breed.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the chattering of the birds, the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dogs, and the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(holding up the little dog while combing) a beauty, Sir, a fine long eared ſnub noſed beauty! Lady Faddle advertiſed three quarters of a year, and could not get the fellow to it. Ah, bleſs it and love it, ſweet ſoul!" And then ſhe ſtroked it, and kiſſed it for near two minutes, uttering the whole time all thoſe inarticulate ſounds, which cannot be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to paper, and which are only addreſſed to dogs, cats, and children, and may very properly be ſtiled the language of the nurſery.</p>

How can you be ſo cruel? Poor dumb things! I would not have them hurt for all the world; nor do I ſee why a lady ſhould not indulge herſelf in having ſuch ſweet little company about her, as well as you men run out eſtates in keeping a pack of filthy hounds." She then laid Pompey on his velvet cuſhion by the fire ſide, and railed at the barbarity of the human ſpecies to the reſt of the creation, and entered into a long diſſertation on tenderneſs and humanity.</p>
               <p>An humane diſpoſition is indeed ſo amiable either in man or woman, that it ought always to be cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed and kept alive in our boſoms; but at the ſame time we ſhould be cautious not to render the firſt virtue of our nature ridiculous. The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate temper may be ſufficiently gratified by relieving the wretched of our own ſpecies; but who would even boaſt of their generoſity to a lap-dog, and their conferring eternal obligations on a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key? Or would any perſon deſerve to be celebrated for their charity, who ſhould deny ſupport to a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a friend, becauſe he maintains a litter of kittens? For my own part, before I would treat a Dutch puppy with ſuch abſurd fondneſs, I muſt be brought to worſhip dogs as the Egyptians did of old; and before I would ſo extravagantly doat upon a monkey, I would change my humanity with a baboon.</p>
               <p>My female friend is not the only inſtance of this fondneſs for the brute creation being carried to ſuch ridiculous lengths.

               <p>It is not ſo ſurpriſing that a ſtage coachman ſhould love his horſes better than his wife or children; or a country Eſquire be fond of his hounds and hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, becauſe the reaſon of this regard for them is eaſily accounted for; upon the ſame principles, a ſea captain has been known to contract an affection for his ſhip; but no coachman would like Caligula, tie his horſes to a golden rack, but thinks he ſhews ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient kindneſs by filling them with good wholeſome provender; and the country ſportſman takes care to provide his hounds with a good kennel and horſe-fleſh, but would never dream of placing them on cuſhions before the fire, feeding them with fricaſſees, or breeding them with as much care as the heir to his eſtate,</p>

How often has the ſlighted gallant envied the careſſes given to a lap-dog, or kiſſes beſtowed on a ſquirrel! and "I would I were thy bird!" has been the fond exclamation of many a Romeo. But this affection for birds and beaſts generally wears off after marriage, and the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032623_0129_0FF3F2BCB56910B0"/>
ladies commonly diſcard their four-footed darlings, and feathered favourites, when they can beſtow their endearments on an huſband. On this account, theſe dry nurſes to pugs and grimalkins, are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be met with among thoſe females, who have been diſappointed in the affairs of love, and have, againſt their will, retained the flower of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity till it has withered in their poſſeſſion.

               <p>After what has been ſaid, it will not appear ſtrange, that a lady ſhould be very ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the breed of her favourite animals; a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in St. James's ſtreet, lately ſent his little Cupid in a ſedan chair as far as Groſvenor-ſquare, to wait upon a lady's Venus for this purpoſe; and I ſhall always remember a card which was ſent to another lady on a like occaſion, expreſſed in the following terms:</p>

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032623_0131_0FF3F2C1DE1EA1E0"/>
a long time waited in vain for an opportunity of making myſelf known to you; and having at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent the conveniences of pen, ink, and paper by me, I gladly take the occaſion of giving you my hiſtory in writing, which I could not do by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, Madam, that about a thouſand years ago, I was an Indian Brachman, and verſed in all thoſe myſterious ſecrets which your European philoſopher called Pythagoras, is ſaid to have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our fraternity. I had ſo ingratiated myſelf by my great ſkill in the occult ſciences with a daemon whom I uſed to converſe with, that he promiſed to grant me whatever I ſhould aſk him. I deſired that my ſoul might never paſs into the body of a brute creature; but this he told me was not in his power to grant me. I then begged that into whatever creature I ſhould chance to tranſmigrate, I might ſtill retain my memory, and be conſcious that I was the ſame perſon who lived in different animals. This he told me was within his power, and accordingly promiſed on the word of a daemon, that he would grant me what I deſired. From that time forth I lived ſo very unblameably, that I was made preſident of a college of Brachmans, an office which I diſcharged with great integrity till the day of my death.</p>
               <p>I was then ſhuffled into another human body, and acted my part ſo well in it, that I became firſt miniſter to a prince who reigned on the banks of the Ganges. I here lived in great honour for ſeveral years, but by degrees loſt all the innocence of the Brachman, being obliged to rifle and oppreſs the people to enrich my ſovereign; till at length I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo odious, that my maſter, to recover his cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it with his ſubjects, ſhot me through the heart with an arrow, as I was one day addreſſing myſelf to him at the head of his army.</p>
               <p>Upon my next remove I found myſelf in the woods,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032623_0132_0FF3F2C369725618"/>
under the ſhape of a jackall, and ſoon liſted myſelf in the ſervice of a lion. I uſed to yelp near his den about midnight, which was his time of rouſing and ſeeking after his prey. He always followed me in the rear, and when I had run down a fat buck, a wild goat, or an hare, after he had feaſted very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully upon it himſelf, would now and then throw me a bone that was but half picked for my encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement; but upon my being unſucceſsful in two or three chaces, he gave me ſuch a confounded gripe in his anger, that I died of it.</p>
               <p>In my next tranſmigration I was again ſet upon two legs, and became an Indian tax-gatherer; but having been guilty of great extravagances, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married to an expenſive jade of a wife, I ran ſo curſedly in debt, that I durſt not ſhew my head. I could no ſooner ſtep out of my houſe, but I was arreſted by ſome perſon or other that lay in wait for me. As I ventured abroad one night in the duſk of the evening, I was taken up and hurried into a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, where I died a few months after.</p>
               <p>My ſoul then entered into a flying fiſh, and in that ſtate led a moſt melancholy life for the ſpace of ſix years. Several fiſhes of prey purſued me when I was in the water, and if I betook myſelf to my wings, it was ten to one I had a flock of birds aiming at me. As I was one day flying amidſt a fleet of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſhips, I obſerved an huge ſea gull whetting his bill, and hovering juſt over my head; upon my dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into the water to avoid him, I fell into the mouth of a monſtrous ſhark that ſwallowed me down in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>I was ſome years afterwards, to my great ſurpriſe, an eminent banker in Lombard-ſtreet; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering how I had formerly ſuffered for want of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey, became ſo very ſordid and avaricious, that the whole town cried ſhame of me. I was a miſerable little old fellow to look upon, for I had in a manner ſtarved myſelf, and was nothing but ſkin and bone when I died.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:032623_0133_0FF3F2C59797DB20"/>I was afterwards very much troubled and amazed to find myſelf dwindled into an emmet. I was heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily concerned to make ſo inſignificant a figure, and did not know but ſome time or other I might be reduced to a mite if I did not mend my manners. I therefore applied myſelf with great diligence to the offices that were allotted me, and was generally looked upon as the notableſt ant in the whole mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. I was at laſt picked up as I was groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a burden, by an unlucky cock-ſparrow that lived in the neighbourhood, and had before made dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radations upon our commonwealth.</p>
               <p>I then bettered my condition a little, and lived an whole ſummer in the ſhape of a bee; but being tired with the painful and penurious life I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone in my two laſt tranſmigrations, I fell into the other extreme, and turned drone. As I one day headed a party to plunder an hive, we were received ſo warmly by the ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm which defended it, that we were moſt of us left dead upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>I might tell you of many other tranſmigrations which I went through; how I was a town rake, and afterwards did penance in a bay gelding for ten years; as alſo how I was a taylor, a ſhrimp, and a tom tit. In the laſt of theſe my ſhapes I was ſhot in the Chriſtmas holidays by a young jackanapes, who would needs try his new gun upon me.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall paſs over theſe and ſeveral other ſtages of life, to remind you of the young bean who made love to you about ſix months ſince. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Madam, how he maſked, and danced, and ſung, and played a thouſand tricks to gain you; and how he was at laſt carried off by a cold that he got under your window one night in a ſerenade; I was that unfortunate young fellow, whom you were then ſo cruel to. Not long after my ſhifting that unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky body, I found myſelf on a hill in Ethiopia, where I lived in my preſent groteſque ſhape, till I was caught by a ſervant of the Engliſh factory, and ſent over

into Great Britain; I need not inform you how I came into your hands; you ſee, Madam, that this is not the firſt time that you have had me in a chain; I am however very happy in this my captivity, as you often beſtow on me thoſe kiſſes and careſſes which I would have given the world for when I was a man.

               <head>The Generoſity of a Lord Chancellor.</head>
               <p>A Living of five hundred pounds per annum falling into the gift of a late Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, the Premier recommended one of his friends as deſerving it, whom his lordſhip approved. In the interim, the curate, who had ſerved the late incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent many years, for thirty pounds per annum, came up with a petition ſigned by many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, teſtifying his good behaviour, and ſetting forth that he had a wife and ſeven children to maintain, and begging his lordſhip would ſtand his friend, that he might be continued in the curacy; and in conſideration of his large family, if he could prevail with the next incumbent to add ten pounds a year he ſhould for ever pray for him. His lordſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to ſerve him. The reverend gentleman for whom the living was deſigned, ſoon after going to pay his reſpects to his lordſhip, my lord told him the affair of the curate, with this difference only, that he ſhould allow him ſixty pounds a year inſtead of thirty. The parſon in ſome confuſion replied, that he was very ſorry he could not grant his lordſhip's requeſt, ſor that he had promiſed the curacy to another, and could not go back from his word. How! ſaid his lordſhip,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032623_0135_0FF3F2CA076E5BE8"/>
have you promiſed the curacy before you were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the living? Well, to keep your word with your friend, I will give him the curacy, but the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I aſſure you I will give to another; and having ſo ſaid, left him. The next day the poor curate coming to know his deſtiny, his lordſhip told him, that he had uſed his endeavours to ſerve him as to the curacy, but with no ſucceſs, the reverend gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman having diſpoſed of it before. The curate, with a deep ſigh, thanked his lordſhip for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was going to withdraw; when my lord calling him back, ſaid with a ſmile, "Well, my friend, it is true I have it not in my power to give you the curacy, but if you will accept the living it is at your ſervice." It is not in the power of words to deſcribe the curate's ſurprize and joy at this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den turn in his favour, who, with the moſt moving expreſſions of gratitude, returned his lordſhip thanks, whoſe goodneſs had in a moment raiſed him and his family from the moſt neceſſitous condition to eaſe and affluence: and my lord to complete his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity, ordered his clerks to make out the diploma, without taking their cuſtomary fees.</p>

               <head>Anecdote of the late Earl of Roſs.</head>
               <p>THE late Earl of Roſs, was in character and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, like the humourous Earl of Rocheſter. He had an infinite fund of wit, great ſpirits; was fond of all the vices which the <hi>beau monde</hi> call plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and by that means firſt impaired his fortune as much as he poſſibly could; and finally, his health beyond repair.</p>
               <p>The poor Earl having led this life till it brought him to death's door, the Reverend Dean Madden, a man of exemplary piety and virtue, having heard his lordſhip was given over, thought it his duty to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032623_0136_0FF3F2CB92C69C30"/>
write him a very pathetic letter, to remind him of his paſt life; the particulars of which he mentioned, ſuch as whoring, gaming, drinking, rioting, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming his Maker, and, in ſhort, all manner of wickedneſs, exhorting him in the tendereſt manner, to employ the few moments that yet remained to him, in penitently confeſſing his manifold tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and ſoliciting his pardon from an offended Deity, before whom he was ſhortly to appear.</p>
               <p>It is proper to acquaint the reader, that the late Earl of Kildair was one of the moſt pious noblemen of the age, and, in every reſpect, a contraſt in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to Lord Roſs. When the latter, who retained his ſenſes to the laſt moment, and died rather for want of breath, than want of ſpirits, read over the Dean's letter (which came to him under cover) he ordered it to be put in another paper, ſealed up, and directed to the Earl of Kildair; he likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the Dean's ſervant to carry it, and to ſay it came from his maſter, which he was encouraged to do by a couple of guineas, and his knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the contents. Lord Kildair was an effem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate, puny, little man, extremely formal and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, inſomuch that, when he was married to lady Mary O'Brien, one of the moſt ſhining beauties then in the world, he would not take his wedding gloves off when he went to bed. From this ſingle inſtance, it may be judged with what ſurpriſe and indignation he read over the Dean's letter, containing ſo many accuſations for crimes he knew himſelf entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of. He firſt ran to his lady, and informed her that Dean Madden was actually mad; to prove which, he delivered her the epiſtle he had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Her ladyſhip was as much confounded and amazed at it, as he could poſſibly be, but withal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the letter was not written in the ſtile of a madman, and adviſed him to go to the archbiſhop of Dublin about it; accordingly his lordſhip order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his coach, and went to the epiſcopal palace,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032623_0137_0FF3F2CDE43CB008"/>
where he found his grace at home, and immediately accoſted him in this manner: "Pray, my lord, did you ever hear that I was a blaſphemer, a whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a rioter, and every thing that is baſe and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous?" "You, my lord, ſaid the biſhop, every one knows you are the pattern of humility, godlineſs, and virtue." "Well, my lord, what ſatisfaction can I have of a reverend Divine, who, under his own hand, lays all this to my charge?" "Surely, (anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered his grace) no man in his ſenſes, that knows your lordſhip, would preſume to do it. And if any clergyman has been guilty of ſuch an offence, your lordſhip will have ſatisfaction from the ſpiritual court." Upon this lord Kildair delivered to his grace the letter, which he told him was delivered by the Dean's ſervant, and which both the archbiſhop and the Earl knew to be the Dean's own hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The archbiſhop immediately ſent for the Dean, who, happening to be at home, inſtantly obeyed the ſummons; before he entered the room, he adviſed lord Kildair to walk into another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which his lordſhip accordingly did. When the Dean entered, his grace looked very ſternly, and demanded if he had written that letter; the Dean anſwered, "I did, my lord." "Mr. Dean, (returned the prelate) I always thought you a man of ſenſe and prudence, but this unguarded action muſt leſſen you in the eſteem of all good men. To throw out ſo many cauſeleſs invectives againſt the moſt unblem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed nobleman in Europe, and accuſe him of crimes to which he and his family have ever been ſtrangers, muſt certainly be the effect of a diſtempered brain; beſides, Sir, you have by this means laid yourſelf open to a proſecution, which will oblige you either publicly to retract what you have ſaid, or to ſuffer the conſequence." "My lord, anſwered the Dean, I never think, act, or write any thing for which I am afraid to be called to an account before any tribunal upon earth; and, if I am to be proſecuted for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032623_0138_0FF3F2D0285CE2C0"/>
the duties of my function, I will ſuffer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the ſevereſt penalties in juſtification of it." And ſo ſaying, the Dean retired with ſome emotion, and left the two noblemen as much in the dark as ever. Lord Kildair went home, and ſent for a proctor, to whom he communicated the Dean's letter, and ordered a citation to be ſent him as ſoon as poſſible; in the mean time, the archbiſhop, who knew the Dean had a family to provide for, and foreſaw that ruin muſt attend his entering into a ſuit with ſo powerful a perſon, went to his houſe, and recommended to him, to aſk my lord's pardon before the matter became public; "aſk his pardon! ſaid the Dean, why, the man's dead." "Lord Kildair dead!" "No, lord Roſs." "Good God! ſaid the archbiſhop, did you not ſend a letter yeſterday to lord Kildair?" "No, truly my lord, but I ſent one to the unhappy Earl of Roſs, who was then given over, and I thought it my duty to write to him in the manner I did." Upon examining the ſervant, the whole was rectified, and the Dean ſaw with great regret, that lord Roſs died as he had lived; nor did he continue in this life above four hours, after he ſent off the letter. The footman loſt his place by the jeſt, and was, indeed, the only ſufferer for my lord's laſt piece of humour.</p>

I know not what would have been the conſequence, had not I exerted the whole ſtrength of my lungs, and, by the dint of vociferation, been heard above them all.

To prevent this inconvenience, a ſage lady ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to them, that in this aſſembly reſpect and precedency were only due to ſeniority. This ſpeech occaſioned quite an oppoſite difficulty; for now the whole ſtream of the crowd ran to the lower end of the room to be thought youngeſt; nay, a deſire of youth ſeemed by far a ſtronger paſſion than that of honour; and we were reduced to a ſad dilemma.

               <head>An Uſeful Eſſay on Laughter.</head>
               <p>THE famous Mr. Hobbs, in his diſcourſe upon Human Nature, after making curious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon laughter, concludes thus: "The paſſion of laughter is nothing elſe but ſudden glory ariſing from ſome ſudden conception of ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in ourſelves, by compariſon with the infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of others, or with our own formerly; for men laugh at the paſt follies of themſelves, when they come ſuddenly to remembrance, except they bring with them any preſent diſhonour."</p>
               <p>According to this Author therefore, when we hear a man laugh exceſſively, inſtead of ſaying he is very merry, we ought to tell him he is very proud. And indeed if we look into the bottom of the matter, we ſhall meet with many obſervations to confirm us in his opinion. Every one laughs at ſome body that is in an inferior ſtate of folly to himſelf. It was
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032623_0144_0FF3F2DC4DACF230"/>
formerly the cuſtom for every great houſe in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to keep a tame fool dreſſed in petticoats, that the heirs of the family might have an opportunity of joking upon him and diverting themſelves with his abſurdities. For the ſame reaſon idiots are ſtill in requeſt in moſt of the courts of Germany, where there is not a Prince of any great magnificence, who has not two or three dreſſed, diſtinguiſhed, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted fools in his retinue, whom the reſt of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are always breaking their jeſts upon.</p>
               <p>The Dutch, who are more famous for their induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and application, than for wit and humour, hang up in ſeveral of their ſtreets what they call the ſign of the gaper, that is the head of an idiot dreſſed in a cap and bells, and gaping in a moſt immoderate manner; this is a ſtanding jeſt in Amſterdam.</p>
               <p>Thus every one diverts himſelf with ſome perſon or other that is below him in point of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and triumphs in the ſuperiority of his genius, while he has ſuch objects of deriſion before his eyes. Mr. Dennis has very well expreſſed this in a couple of humourous lines, which are part of the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſatire in Monſieur Boileau.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus one fool <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olls his tongue out at another,</l>
                  <l>And ſhakes his empty noddle at his brother.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. Hobbs' reflection gives us the reaſon why the inſignificant people above mentioned, excite laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among men of a groſs taſte; but as the more underſtanding part of mankind do not find their riſibility affected by ſuch ordinary objects, it may be worth our while to examine into the ſeveral provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catives of laughter in men of ſuperior ſenſe and knowledge.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, there is a ſet of merry drolls, whom the common people of all countries admire, and ſeem to love ſo well that they could eat them according to the old proverb; I mean thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feraneous
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:032623_0145_0FF3F2DE7836DE80"/>
wits whom every nation calls by the name of that diſh of meat which it loves beſt In Holland they are termed Pickle Herrings; in France, Jean Pottages; in Italy, Maccaronies; and in Great Britain, Jack Puddings. Theſe merry wags from whatſoever food they receive their titles, that they may make their audiences laugh, always appear in a fool's coat, and commit ſuch blunders and miſtakes in every ſtep they take, and every word they utter, as thoſe who liſten to them would be aſhamed of.</p>
               <p>But this little triumph of the underſtanding under the diſguiſe of laughter, is no where more viſible than in that cuſtom which prevails every where among us on the firſt day of April, when every body takes it into his head to make as many fools as he can. In proportion as there are more follies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſo there is more laughter raiſed on this than on any other day in the whole year.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee in proportion as one man is more refined than another, he chuſes his food out of a lower or higher claſs of mankind, or to ſpeak in a more philoſophical language, that ſecret elation and pride of heart which is generally called laughter, ariſes in him from comparing himſelf with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject below him, whether it ſo happens that it be a natural or an artificial fool. When a man of wit makes us laugh, it is by betraying ſome oddneſs or infirmity in his own character, or in the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which he makes of others.</p>

               <p>MANY people who have travelled, may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have ſeen Fayette and Graſſe at ſchool, in the town of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

its kettles. Fayette was the ſon of a horſe dealer of high renown, and Graſſe derived his birth from an able huſbandman, who with the help of four horſes cultivated a neighbouring farm, and when he had paid the poll tax, the ſubſidy, the exciſe, the ſalt tax, the poundage, the capitation, and the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth penny, we cannot ſuppoſe he was overburdened with riches.</p>
               <p>Fayette and Graſſe were comely well looking lads for Auvergneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and contracted a great intimacy and friendſhip for each other; they had their little ſchemes and <hi>tete-a-tetes</hi> by themſelves, upon which they reflected with great pleaſure when they were together in other company.</p>
               <p>The time of their ſtay at ſchool was nearly expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when a taylor brought Fayette a ſuit of figured velvet, and a rich waiſtcoat, made up in a very good taſte, with a letter addreſſed to Monſ. de la Fayette. Graſſe admired the cloaths without envy, but Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette aſſumed an air of ſuperiority which very much grieved Graſſe. From this time Fayette forſook his learning, and employed his time almoſt wholly in the looking-glaſs, which, added to the contempt with which he treated his ſuppoſed inferiors, made him very diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>A ſhort time after this elevation of our gentleman, a valet de chambre came poſt with another letter, directed to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſieur the Marquis de la Fayette, which contained an order from Monſieur his father, for his coming to Paris. This Fayette inſtantly obeyed, and as he got into the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſe, took Graſſe by the hand, and gave him a ſmile of protection with as much of the conſequential air as could be expected; Graſſe, touched with an humiliating ſenſe of his own inferiority, melted into tears, and Fayette drove away in all the glory of his n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w dignity.</p>
               <p>But as our readers will naturally inquire how Fayette came by this dignity, it is neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, that the father had ſuddenly acquired
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:032623_0147_0FF3F2E2DE8195E8"/>
an immenſe fortune; Monſ. Fayette was an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome man, and Madam was not without her charms. When ſhe was ſtill in her bloom, they were brought to Paris by a law ſuit, which totally ruined them; but fortune who delights in the capricious exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and debaſement of mankind, juſt then threw them in the way of a Commiſſary, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to furniſh the military hoſpitals during the war; the Commiſſary was a man of great talents, and could boaſt of having killed more ſoldiers in one year than gunpowder had killed in ten; the Commiſſary's wife was ſmitten with Fayette, and the Commiſſary himſelf was ſmitten with Fayette's wife. Fayette ſoon came in for a ſhare of the contract, and undertook other buſineſs on his own account.</p>
               <p>When a man once gets into the middle of the ſtream, the tide itſelf will carry him along; this is verified in the inſtance of Commiſſaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors, who get immenſe ſums very frequently with little or no trouble; ſuch was the proſperous fortune of Fayette, the father, who became immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately Monſ. de la Fayette, and ſoon after having bought a Marquiſate, which at once ennobled him and his children, he ſent for the Marquis his ſon from ſchool, that he might place him among the <hi>beau monde</hi> at Paris.</p>

                  </gap>, who ſtill remembered his old ſchool fellow with a tender ſenſibility, wrote him a few lines to congratulate him; the new Marquis ſent him no anſwer, and Graſſe was indiſpoſed on account of this neglect.</p>
               <p>The father and the mother of Fayette procured a tutor for their ſon, who was a man of genteel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but knew nothing, and conſequently could not teach him any thing. The father was deſirous the ſon ſhould learn latin, but the mother oppoſed; after much debate it was agreed that the queſtion ſhould be referred to an author, who was celebrated for many agreeable performances. He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032623_0148_0FF3F2E4661E9738"/>
invited to dinner, and the maſter of the houſe began by ſaying, "Sir, as you are a latin ſcholar, and a man of the world"—"I a latin ſcholar!" ſaid the belle eſprit, "I do not know one word of the language, and ſo much the better for me; theſe people certainly ſpeak their own language beſt, whoſe attention is not divided between that and others. Conſider only the ladies, how much more pleaſing is their wit than ours! their letters are written with infinitely more elegance, and this ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority is certainly owing to their not having learned latin."</p>
               <p>"Very well (ſays Madam) am I not then in the right? I would have my ſon a man of wit, I would have him make a figure in the world, and you ſee plainly if he learns latin, he will be undone; are operas and plays, I would fain know, performed in latin? Do lawyers ſpeak latin at the bar? Or do young gentlemen make love in latin?"</p>
               <p>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ. de la Fayette being wholly unable to reſiſt this amazing force of argument, immediately paſſed ſentence, and it was concluded that the young Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſhould not loſe his time in getting acquainted with Cicero, Horace, Juvenal or Virgil.</p>
               <p>"But then, ſaid the father, what ſhall he learn? for certainly it is neceſſary that he ſhould learn ſomething. May he not be taught a little geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy?" "Of what ſervice will that be?" ſays the tutor. When the Marquis ſhall think proper to viſit his eſtates, do you think the poſtillions will not know the road? Take my word for it, there is no danger of their loſing their way. A man of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion can travel very well without a quadrant, and go with great conveniency from Paris to Auvergne, without knowing what latitude he is in."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly right, fays the father, but I have heard ſomething of a fine ſcience which I think they call aſtronomy." It is a pity, ſays the tutor, you ever heard of it at all; what occaſion is there
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032623_0149_0FF3F2E696D90F60"/>
for people in this world to regulate their motions by the ſtars? Is it fit that the young Marquis ſhould be fatigued to death by the calculation of an eclipſe, when he may find the time exactly by conſulting an almanack, which will alſo acquaint him with all the moveable feaſts, the age of the moon, and of all the ſovereign princes in Europe?"</p>
               <p>Madam entirely agreed with the tutor in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the young Marquis his ſon was over joyed, and the father was in ſuſpence—"What then, ſaid he, muſt my ſon learn?"—"To be amiable," replied the friend they had conſulted, "if he knows the art of pleaſing, he knows all that is worthy to be known, and this art he cannot fail of learning under his mother's eye, though neither ſhe nor you ſhould give yourſelves the leaſt trouble about it."</p>
               <p>Madam was ſo delighted with this compliment that ſhe embraced the pleaſing dunce who paid it. "Ah! Sir, ſaid ſhe, it is eaſy to diſcover that you are wiſer than all the world beſides; my ſon will be wholly indebted to you for his education; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, after all, it would not be amiſs for him to learn a little of hiſtory." "Alas; Madam, replied the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle, what good can that do him? Certainly no hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is either uſeful or pleaſing but that of the day. All ancient hiſtories, as one of our belle eſprits has very juſtly obſerved, are nothing more than fables artfully put together; and as for modern hiſtories, they are a chaos which it is impoſſible to reduce to order. Of what importance is it to your ſon that Charlemagne inſtituted the twelve Peers of France? And that his ſon had an impediment in his ſpeech?"</p>
               <p>"There never was a more true obſervation, cried the tutor; the young mind is often buried under a load of uſeleſs learning, by which its native powers are firſt reſtrained, and then deſtroyed; but of all that is abſurd among what are called the ſciences, the moſt abſurd is geometry. The objects of geom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry are ſurfaces, lines, and points, which have no
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:032623_0150_0FF3F2E964968808"/>
exiſtence in nature; and an hundred curve lines are fancied between a circle and a ſtraight line that touches it, though in reality there is not room for a ſtraw. In ſhort, geometry is no better than a dull joke."</p>
               <p>The father and mother ſcarcely underſtood one word of this ingenious argument againſt geometry, which notwithſtanding made a great impreſſion upon them, and they declared themſelves entirely of the tutor's mind.</p>
               <p>"A great lord (continued he) like Monſieur the Marquis, ought not to puzzle his brains with vain ſpeculations. If he ſhould ever have occaſion for the moſt ſublime part of this ſcience to lay down a plan of his eſtates, he may have them ſurveyed for his money; if he would trace his nobility back to the remoteſt ages, he may without difficulty find a Benedictine monk that will do it; the ſame may be ſaid of all the arts; a young lord of illuſtrious birth, is neither a painter, a muſician, an architect, nor a ſtatuary; but he makes all thoſe arts flouriſh by his munificence; and it is certainly better to patroniſe than practiſe them. It is enough for the Marquis to have taſte; it is the duty of artiſts to exert their ſkill for his pleaſure and advantage, and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well ſaid, that perſons of quality, I mean thoſe who are very rich, know all things without learning any; their taſte enables them to judge of every thing which they command and for which they pay."</p>
               <p>The maſter of the art of pleaſing then interpoſed: "You have obſerved, Madam, ſaid he, that the great purpoſe of life is to ſucceed in the world, but will any man pretend that this purpoſe can be anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

charms had given her ſome introduction to the <hi>beau monde</hi>) and it is by no means proper, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, my ſon, ſhould cramp his genius by the ſtudy of all this trumpery; but at laſt what ſhall we teach him, for certainly as his father has obſerved, a young gentleman ought to be qualified to ſhine upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. I remember to have heard an Abbe ſay, that there was one ſcience extremely agreeable and genteel; I cannot recollect the name of it, but it begins with a B." "With a B. Madam, ſaid the genius, it could not be botany;" "No, (replied Madam) it was not botany, yet it ended ſomething like that too." "O, I know what it was, ſaid he, it was blazonry; but I aſſure you it is by no means the mode at preſent; it has been wholly laid aſide ever ſince painting coats of arms upon coaches went out of faſhion; it was, to be ſure, at that time the moſt uſeful knowledge in the world, but the caſe is altered now; beſides, at preſent the ſtudy of heraldry would be infinite, for there is not a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who has not his coat of arms, and when a thing becomes common, you know people of faſhion ſhould diſregard it." Upon the whole, this ſag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cious and illuſtrious ſociety, having fairly diſcuſſed the ſciences, it was at laſt determined that Monſieur the Marquis de la Fayette ſhould learn to dance.</p>
               <p>Nature, however, who indeed does every thing, had given this flower of nobility a talent which very ſoon diſplayed itſelf with aſtoniſhing ſucceſs. This happy talent was that of ſinging a good ſong; the graces of youth, joined to this ſuperior endowment, drew every one's eyes upon him as a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great expectation; he was a very great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite among the ladies, and having his head full of ſongs, he could eaſily form new out of the old by a different combination of the phraſes and figures that he was continually repeating; but as his verſes had a foot too little or too much, he got them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the rate of twenty louis d'ors a ſong, and he at laſt got into the annals of literature, and was
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032623_0152_0FF3F2EC77472368"/>
claſſed with the La Fairs, the Chaulieus, the Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, the Sarazines, and the Voltures of the time.</p>
               <p>The Marchioneſs then conſidered herſelf as the mother of wit, and gave ſuppers to the wits of the town; the young man's head was turned; he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the art of ſpeaking without knowing what he would ſay, and became perfect by habit in being ſit for nothing.</p>
               <p>When his father ſound him thus amazingly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, he very much regretted that he had not taught him latin, as he then might have bought him a conſiderable place in the law. His mother, who looked ſtill higher, undertook to get him a regiment, and in the mean time the young gentleman thought proper to make love.</p>
               <p>As love is rather an expenſive article, ſo it coſt our hero more than a regiment; his expences were very great, and his parents ran out their fortunes very faſt by living like people of the firſt quality.</p>
               <p>But as the ſtate of their finances was known only to themſelves, a young widow of great rank, but of middling circumſtances, in the neighbourhood, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to be very rich, reſolved to ſecure their fortune to herſelf by making the young Marquis her huſband.</p>
               <p>She accordingly threw out a lure that brought him to her houſe; ſhe ſuffered herſelf to be loved, and convinced him that he was not indifferent to her; ſhe led him on by degrees; he was at length altogether faſcinated by her wiles and her charms, ſo that her conqueſt was complete; at the ſame time ſhe gave him ſo many commendations, and ſo much good advice, that the father and mother conſidered her as the beſt friend they had in the world.</p>
               <p>An old lady in the neighbourhood propoſed the marriage on the part of the widow, and the Marquis and Marchioneſs de la Fayette, dazzled with the ſplendor of ſuch an alliance, accepted the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032623_0153_0FF3F2EEA60477B8"/>
deareſt friend. The youth was on the point of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a lady whom he adored, and who returned his paſſion; he received the congratulations of his friends, the marriage articles were drawing up, and the wedding clothes and verſes were making.</p>
               <p>He was kneeling one morning at the feet of the dear angel, whom love, eſteem, and friendſhip were ſoon to make his own for ever; they were enjoying, in a converſation that touched every ſtring of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſenſibility, a foretaſte of their approaching felicity, and laying out a ſcheme of life in which one delight ſhould perpetually ſucceed another, when a ſervant of the Marchioneſs his mother, arrived in great haſte, and with looks as wild as if he had ſeen an apparition: "I am come, ſaid he, with news very different from what you think of; the ſheriff's offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are in poſſeſſion of my lord's houſe, they have ſeized all the goods, they talk of ſecuring his perſon, and as I have not a moment to loſe, I am going to ſecure my wages."</p>
               <p>"Do not be in ſuch a violent hurry, ſaid the Marquis, let us ſee a little what this affair is." "Do, ſays the widow, run this inſtant, puniſh the wretches for their inſolence."</p>
               <p>The Marquis went home directly, and found that his father was already taken to priſon, and that all the ſervants were gone off, each having carried away what he could lay his hands upon. He found his mother totally deſerted, without ſuccours, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, ſitting on the floor, and drowned in tears, with nothing left but the remembrance of her fortune and her beauty, her follies and her faults.</p>
               <p>After her ſon had wept with her till the tumult of his mind a little ſubſided, and he was able to ſpeak, he endeavoured to alleviate her diſtreſs by a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had ſoothed his own, "do not let us deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, ſaid he, the widow whom I was about to marry is yet more generous than rich; I will anſwer for all that is in her power; I will fly to her this moment and bring her hither."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:032623_0154_0FF3F2F0F11984E0"/>He returned to his miſtreſs with great precipitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and found her <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> with an handſome young officer of the army. "What, is it you, Monſieur de la Fayette, ſaid ſhe, what in the name of wonder have you to do here? How could you think of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your poor mother? Go back to her for heaven's ſake, and tell her how ſorry I am for her misfortune; I always wiſhed her well; and upon my word as my woman is going away, I will not think of another till I have given her the refuſal of the place."— "My good lad, ſaid the officer, you ſeem to be well made, and if you will enter into my corps, I will liſt you upon good terms."</p>
               <p>The Marquis was ſtruck ſpeechleſs with rage and indignation, and burſting away without reply, he went directly to his old tutor, to pour his ſorrows into his boſom, and derive comfort from his advice. This gentleman propoſed that he ſhould undertake the education of children. "Alas, ſaid the Marquis, I know nothing, you have taught me nothing, and that indeed has been the cauſe of all my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes." "Write novels, ſays a belle eſprit who was then preſent; it is now an excellent expedient to get money at Paris."</p>
               <p>The young man now ſunk deeper in deſpair than ever, went as his laſt reſource, to a monk of great reputation, who had been his mother's confeſſor, and who attended nobody in that capacity but peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of rank and condition. The monk, as ſoon as he ſaw him, ran towards him in a rapture of ſurpriſe and joy, and cried out, "My God! Monſieur le Marquis, what do you do here a foot! For heaven's ſake where is your coach, and how does the worthy lady Marchioneſs your mother!" The unhappy youth replied by giving him an account of the ruin of his family; as he advanced in his narrative, the monk's countenance became gradually more grave, more indifferent, and more important. "My ſon, ſaid he, we may now ſee plainly what God intended for
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032623_0155_0FF3F2F361C8C5F0"/>
you; riches ſerve only to corrupt the heart; God has therefore been graciouſly pleaſed to reduce your mother to beggary; yes, Sir, and a very merciful diſpenſation it is, for it will certainly enſure the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her ſoul." The Marquis replied, "but father, while we are waiting for that event in the next world, is there no means of obtaining ſome aſſiſtance in this?" "My ſon, ſaid the monk, God be with you, adieu! there is a lady of great faſhion waiting for me at court."</p>
               <p>The poor Marquis, who was very near fainting away at this treatment of the monk, was treated in nearly the ſame manner by the whole circle of his acquaintance, and gained more knowledge of the world in half a day than he had done in all the reſt of his life.</p>

In this vehicle ſat a young man, cleanly but not coarſely clad, with a ruddy ſun-burnt countenance, that expreſſed at once the higheſt happineſs and good humour. A young, healthy, comely freſh coloured girl, that ſeemed to be his wife, ſat jolting by his ſide, for the carriage did not move like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The maſter as he drove on had time to contemplate the Marquis, who ſtood torpid in ſuſpenſe, motionleſs, and with his eyes fixed upon the ground. "Bleſs my ſoul, ſaid he, when he came almoſt up to him, ſurely this is not Fayette!" At this name the Marquis ſtarted as from a dream, and looked up, and the driver inſtantly ſtopped his cart. "Yes, by my faith, ſaid he, it is Fayette himſelf;" and with that he made but one leap to the ground, and caught him in his arms; Fayette at once recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his old ſchool-fellow Graſſe, and his face was inſtantly covered with confuſion and tears. "You have forſaken me, ſaid Colin, but you may be as
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032623_0156_0FF3F2F4EBA9AC60"/>
great a lord as you will, I am determined to love you for all that." Fayette whoſe tenderneſs and confuſion increaſed every moment, told him in a few words a part of his hiſtory. "Come along, ſaid Graſſe, you ſhall go home with me to the inn where I put up, and tell the reſt at your leiſure; ſalute my little wife, this is ſhe, and let us make haſte to dinner."</p>
               <p>Graſſe and his wife, and the Marquis, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on foot following the baggage. "Pray, ſaid Fayette, what is all this, does it belong to you?" "Yes, ſaid Graſſe, the whole belongs to me and my wife, we are juſt come out of the country; I am at the head of a good manufacture of braſs and tin; I married the daughter of a man who had acquired very conſiderable ſubſtance by making and ſelling a commodity that is equally neceſſary to rich and poor; we work very hard; Providence has bleſſed our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; we continue to get forward in the world; we are very happy in ourſelves, and thank God we have it in our power to aſſiſt our friend Fayette; do not be a Marquis any longer, all the great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world are not worth one true friend; you ſhall go along with me into the country, you ſhall learn my trade which will be eaſily done, I will take you in partner, and we will live cheerfully together in the obſcure but happy retreat where we were born."</p>
               <p>Fayette heard this propoſal with undeſcribeable ſenſations; his heart was divided between grief and joy, tenderneſs and ſhame, and turning to his true friend ſaid, in an humble voice, "all my gay friends have deſerted me, and Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe whom I injuriouſly neglected, has afforded me that comfort, which from him I did not deſerve." What a lecture is this for thoſe who are entering into life? The virtue of Graſſe called out the virtue which lay hidden in the breaſt of Fayette, and which all his habits of folly and diſſipation had not deſtroyed. He felt a
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032623_0157_0FF3F2F6755755A0"/>
ſecret repugnance to deſert his father and mother. "We will take care of thy mother, ſaid Graſſe, and as to the good man thy father, who is in priſon, I know a little of the world, and his creditors know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has nothing to ſatisfy them, will compound their debts for a trifle, and I will take upon me to make an end of matters with them, and ſet him once more clear in the world." Graſſe was very ſoon as good as his word; the old man was diſcharged out of priſon, and his creditors gave him a general releaſe. Fayette returned with his friends into his native country, and took his parents with him, who followed their original profeſſion. Fayette married Graſſe's ſiſter, who being of the ſame amiable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with her brother, made him very happy; and Fayette the father, Fayette the mother, and Fayette the ſon, were at laſt thoroughly convinced, that happineſs is not to be found in vanity.</p>

               <p>AT a little diſtance from an old gentleman's houſe in the country, among the ruins of an old abbey, there is a long walk of aged elms, which are ſhot up ſo very high, that when one paſſes under them, the rooks and crows that reſt upon the top of them, ſeem to be cawing in another region. I am very much delighted with this ſort of noiſe, which I conſider as a kind of natural prayer to that Being who ſupplies the wants of his whole creation, and who, in the beautiful language of the Pſalms, feedeth the young ravens that call upon him. I like this retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the better, becauſe of an ill report it lies under of being <hi>haunted</hi>; for which reaſon (as I have been told in the family) no living creature ever walks in it beſides the chaplain. My good friend the butler deſired me with a grave face, not to venture myſelf
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032623_0158_0FF3F2F95969DFE8"/>
after ſun-ſet, for that one of the footmen had been frighted almoſt out of his wits by a ſpirit that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in the ſhape of a black horſe without a head; to which he added, that about a month ago, one of the maids coming home late that way, with a pail of milk upon her head, heard ſuch a ruſtling that ſhe let it fall.</p>
               <p>I was taking a walk in this place laſt night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hours of nine and ten, and could not but fancy it one of the moſt proper ſcenes in the world for a ghoſt to appear in. The ruins of the abbey are ſcattered up and down on every ſide, and half covered with ivy and elder buſhes, the harbours of ſeveral ſolitary birds, which ſeldom make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance until the duſk of the evening. The place was formerly a church-yard, and has ſtill ſeveral marks in it of graves and burying places; there is ſuch an echo among the old ruins and vaults, that if you ſtamp but a little louder than ordinary, you hear the ſound repeated. At the ſame time, the walk of elms, with the croaking of the ravens, which from time to time are heard from the tops of them, looks exceeding ſolemn and venerable. Theſe objects naturally raiſe ſeriouſneſs and attention; and when night heightens the awfulneſs of the place, and pours out her ſupernumerary horrors upon every thing in it, I do not at all wonder that weak minds fill it with ſpectres and apparitions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Locke, in his Chapter of the Aſſociation of Ideas, has very curious remarks to ſhow how by the prejudice of education, one idea often introduces into the mind a whole ſet that bear no reſemblance to one another in the nature of things. Among ſeveral examples of this kind he produces the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtance: "The ideas of goblins and ſprights, have really no more to do with darkneſs than light; yet let but a fooliſh maid inculcate theſe often on the mind of a boy, and raiſe them there together, poſſibly he ſhall never be able to ſeparate them again
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:032623_0159_0FF3F2FB8D9A21C8"/>
ſo long as he lives, but darkneſs ſhall ever afterwards bring with it thoſe frightful ideas, and they ſhall be ſo joined, that he can no more bear the one nor the other." As I was walking in this ſolitude, where the duſk of the evening conſpired with ſo many other occaſions of terrors, I obſerved a cow grazing not far from me, which an imagination that was apt to ſtartle, might eaſily have conſtrued into a black horſe without an head, and I dare ſay the poor footman loſt his wits upon ſome ſuch trivial occaſion.</p>
               <p>My old friend in the country has often told me with a good deal of mirth, that at his firſt coming to his eſtate, he found three parts of his houſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs; that the beſt room in it had the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation of being haunted, and by that means was locked up; that noiſes had been heard in his long gallery, ſo that he could not get a ſervant to enter it after eight o'clock at night; that the door of one of his chambers was nailed up, becauſe there was a ſtory in the family, that a butler had formerly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in it; and that his mother who lived to a great age, had ſhut up half the rooms in the houſe, in which either her huſband, a ſon, or daughter had died. My friend ſeeing his habitation reduced to ſo ſmall a compaſs, and himſelf in a manner ſhut out of his own houſe, upon the death of his mother, ordered all the apartments to be flung open, and exorciſed by his chaplain, who lay in every room one after another, and by that means diſſipated the fears which had ſo long reigned in the family.</p>

I give you my inſtructions in writing, that in what place or condition you are, they may be always preſent with you, and that when death deprives you of me, it may not at the ſame time rob you of that which may be more uſeful to you than myſelf. A cuſtom wiſely introduced into the world, having made me truſt your bringing up to perſons who are, by being ſhut in a cloiſter, ſecured from all worldly troubles, will therefore prevent two things equally unhappy; either too great an inclination for a monaſtic life, or too violent for an abhorrence of it; be upon your guard, my deareſt Julia, againſt both. Youth always fond of novelty, often ſurrenders itſelf without conſulting reaſon. The tranquillity of a monaſtic life, the enticing diſcourſes of thoſe whoſe only aim is to make you embrace the vows they are already bound by, make me appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend your adding to the number of ſo many young creatures, who are, by an acceſſible grate often ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more wretched than thoſe whoſe morals have been corrupted by the world.

               <p>The charms with which heaven has bleſſed you, while they delight the eye, make me tremble for you hereafter. Beauty has often been the rock on which virtue has ſplit, when care has not been taken to enrich the mind with meaſures which may defend it in all the various changes of life. A ſplendid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is ever attended by luxury, whoſe companion is coquetry. The adoration of the men, and the perpetual flatteries from them are often too pleaſing to our vanity, and by liſtening to a number, the heart is uncertain in its determination, and we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly give up to a crowd that reputation which we fear to truſt with one perſon, and which ought to be dearer to us than our life. Poverty, misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and a life embittered with eternal vexations, are no leſs fatal to virtue; ſuch a woman is apt to make uſe of her beauty to ſubdue her enemies, to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032623_0162_0FF3F300D9615C38"/>
procure her friends in time of need; ſhe meets it is probable with dangerous conſolers, and her hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is the ſacrifice to gratitude. To prevent theſe accidents, wiſdom is the only means, but endeavour to be wiſe without affectation; wiſdom does not require ſo much outward ſhew as vice and ſeverity. Be prudent without being a prude; let your modeſty be accompanied with gaiety, and your reſerve with good nature; apply yourſelf to learn what will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh your mind, but let not vanity attend your knowledge; let your philoſophy be Chriſtian; be affable and obliging to all, intimate but with few; pity the misfortunes you are in no proſpect of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, behave without too much ſubmiſſion to your equals, and without pride to your inferiors; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the diſtreſſed of all conditions; do nothing but what is praiſe worthy, without aiming at praiſe; for the oſtentation of a good action often eclipſes the glory which it would otherwiſe deſerve. If fate allots you to a happy marriage, make the bleſſing permanent by love, virtue and a generous confidence. If on the contrary you are unfortunately ſo, and your mind torn and diſtracted with the agonies of domeſtic jars, look out for friends who have a greater regard for your virtue than your beauty; and if by that means you get no relief, ſeek it from him who alone can extricate us out of the deepeſt diſtreſs. If you love your huſband paſſionately, and he but ill returns your tenderneſs, let mildneſs, complaiſance, and a blameleſs conduct, be the only arms wherewith you combat his ill humour; jealouſy, ſullenneſs, or a peeviſh melancholy, will never regain a heart liable to wandering. If the match is diſproportioned, and he happens to be very agreeable in his humour, but the contrary in his perſon, never ceaſe endeavouring to conquer your diſlike, and remember the beauties of the mind are by far the moſt preferable. If you chance to be equally indifferent to each other, let not that draw you into any irregularities, ſhun the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032623_0163_0FF3F303A5C4C320"/>
opportunities of finding in another the charms that are wanting in your huſband, and let the force of duty ſupply the defects of fondneſs.</p>
               <p>It is in ſuch circumſtances as theſe that it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to preſerve one's virtue; but then it is at theſe times, that it is moſt requiſite, and appears with greater luſtre. A woman perfectly happy, who is not wanting in her duty, is eſteemed without being praiſed, becauſe having no complaint, ſhe has no pretence for doing otherwiſe; but a woman that is unfortunate and yet wiſe, ſeems to exceed even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. The virgin or the widow ſtate alſo ſeems to me as much or more expoſed to danger, as a young woman that is left without father or mother, and entirely miſtreſs of her actions, cannot be too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in them. She takes no ſtep that does not endanger her reputation. If ſhe keeps a great deal of company, ſhe paſſes for a coquette; if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines herſelf to a few ſelect friends, ſhe then has ſome ſecret intrigue; in ſhort, every body paſſes their judgment upon her with leſs charity, becauſe they know ſhe has nobody to be reſponſible for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It is then I adviſe retirement, but without entering into religious orders. If you ſhould marry, and your huſband die, take care not to imitate thoſe women, who think, becauſe they have nobody to whom they are obliged to be accountable for what they do, they may with ſafety abandon themſelves to an irregular conduct, believing that under the umbrage of their crape, they may conceal the looſe inclinations of their hearts.

               <p>JACK WILDING, the ſon of a late worthy citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, was contracted, by the mutual conſent of the parents, to Miſs Seymour, the daughter of a very reſpectable merchant; but ſuch was the wild infat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated diſpoſition of the young man, that, becoming an eaſy dupe to pleaſure, he not only ſlighted, but totally neglected the fair object of this contract— Eliza, who was partial to her unworthy intended, ſaw with regret the volatile character of her unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving lover—for <hi>lover</hi> was a title he always aſpired to, in hopes of rendering himſelf agreeable in the

                  </gap>he was <hi>leſs</hi> a lover, than to thoſe fair ones who were leſs worthy of his love.—In ſhort, he was a general gallant, and would have taken unwarrantable liberties with Miſs Sey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our, had not her delicacy and virtue prudently defended themſelves.</p>
               <p>Wilding, upon the death of his father, became more and more the libertine; while ſuch was Miſs Seymour's ſituation, that ſhe was entirely ſubject by this contract, to the wavering diſpoſition of Wilding; unable, except upon a very ſevere forfeit (which her father would not ſubmit to) to procure a liberation, and be free to marry another. By ſome unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means indeed ſhe had given her <hi>heart</hi> to the man who thus deferred the acceptance of her hand, and by a cruel procraſtination proved that it was never his intention to fulfil an engagement, which unfortunately he was not compelled to by any pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty in the contract, through the neglect of Mr. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, who never ſuſpected his inconſtancy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price; of this however the old gentleman ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; and no doubt it was the ſole occaſion of his ſudden death; for he ſaw the unhappy fate of his poor orphan child.</p>
               <p>Miſs Seymour, now fatherleſs, became more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inſults of Wilding; who, laughing at her punctilious notions of virtue, made many unworthy attempts to injure it; however, to the great HONOR of Miſs Seymour be it added, all his endeavours were happily ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The young lady being rather in a ſolitary ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more in want of a female companion than many of her ſex, now prevailed on the daughter of a late worthy friend of her deceaſed father to remain with her a few months; hoping by her advice and aſſiſtance not to <hi>recover</hi>—(for it never was <hi>Won</hi>) but obtain, and then <hi>ſecure</hi> the affection of this harum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarum youth. Lydia Harcourt, whoſe nature was exceedingly good and ſympathetic, readily acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſced
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032623_0166_0FF3F309913FA640"/>
with the invitation; for ſhe pitied her unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate companion, and, notwithſtanding her juſt hatred to Wilding, was induced, by her tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant love for Eliza, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e both her conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and occaſional friend.</p>
               <p>During the viſit of Miſs Harcourt, Wilding was a more conſtant gueſt; but the reaſon ſoon became evident—he wiſhed to add to the liſt of his <hi>ruined</hi> favorites, the boſom friend and confidant of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Eliza. One day when Lydia was nobly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for the wronged Miſs Seymour, and by the eloquence of friendſhip pleading her cauſe— during which time the trembling Eliza was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively liſtening—the thoughtleſs youth attributed all his neglect, all his inconſtancy, to the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant beauty of the fair advocate.</p>
               <p>"O!" cried he in a tone of rhapſody and well-diſſembled love, "how is it poſſible that you can behold my indifference to Miſs Seymour, and not immediately perceive the cauſe, thou dear bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thief—it is thou who haſt ſtolen my heart, and rendered me totally inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Miſs Harcourt liſtened to this enthuſiaſtic declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with profound attention, and when he had concluded, ſhe coolly withdrew her hand, and, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wiſhed that her friend Eliza was preſent to witneſs his diſſembled paſſion, as then, ſhe was very ſure, all eſteem ſhe could entertain for him muſt certainly be at an end; and that ſhe would ſuffer any thing on her part before ſhe would marry him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:032623_0167_0FF3F30BCC1E6AC0"/>This very deliberate manner of addreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance had no kind of effect upon Wilding—On the contrary, it only ſerved to ſpur him on more in his wicked deſigns, and excite new projects of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gallantry. He now proceeded to violence. Such was Eliza's ſituation, that ſhe did not interpoſe —fearful if ſhe had diſcovered herſelf, ſhe would ſeem to have ſuſpected the friendſhip of Miſs Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, or met with the ill-timed ſarcaſms of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking libertine—However, the ſeaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of Jenny the ſervant, put an end at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Mr. Wilding's intention. He ſeemed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly mortified at the intruſion, and ſpeedily took leave.</p>
               <p>Miſs Harcourt was determined to be revenged on him for this audacious attempt. She communicated her ſentiments to Jenny, who wiſhed much to invent ſome ſtratagem for puniſhing the preſumption of the youth, and make him at the ſame time ſenſible of the injury he had offered Miſs Harcourt.</p>
               <p>Eliza, who had overheard their wiſhes to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices in a plot, now reſolved, as ſhe was moſt particularly concerned, to be herſelf the inventreſs. She accordingly imparted her deſign to a nephew of the late Mr. Seymour's; who, having fortunately procured an acquaintance with Wilding, aſſured her that every thing in his power he would, without the leaſt heſitation, accompliſh. This young man, we ſhall call Charles, aſſociated on purpoſe with Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſeemed an advocate for pleaſure like himſelf, and ſhared in all manner of wild intoxication.</p>
               <p>Miſs Seymour had now moved her reſidence to a country village, and, in order to allure Wilding to follow them, Charles (who was prudently admitted into the ſecret) very ſagaciouſly laid a wager with his friend Wilding, that he would never accompliſh his deſign over Miſs Harcourt. This ſtimulated the young man to follow them; and Charles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Col. Riot (who was not in the plot) were conſequently his companions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="unknown:032623_0168_0FF3F30D545F06E0"/>The place which Miſs Seymour repaired to, was a lonely unneighbourly town. The cottage, formerly a caſtle, was large, wild, and diſordered—a gloomy aſpect hung over the place, and was ſeemingly well-ſuited for the daring project which ran in her head. —Jenny, and Tom a man-ſervant, were the only attendants which ſhe took.</p>
               <p>Wilding, in order to gain his purpoſe over Miſs Harcourt, attempted to bribe Jenny. This ſagacious girl, to avoid ſuſpicion, accepted his money (which was rather tempting, being plentifully offered) with little or no reluctance, ſeeming rather to acquieſce with his deſigns, and inclined to give the aſſiſtance which he pretended to want ſo much.</p>
               <p>Charles, on the evening intended for Wilding's bold eſſay, now under pretence of ſpiriting him up to action, invited him to a bottle. This was the time for him to perform his arduous part, on which depended the whole ſtratagem, and this he did both honorably and ſucceſsfully. He ſeized an happy opportunity of mixing opium with Wilding's liquor, which, in addition to the ſpirits (for Charles made him drink more than uſual) had ſuch an effect over his underſtanding, as to render him totally inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and almoſt dead.</p>
               <p>While in this inſenſible ſtate of ignorant inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Charles had the unfeeling body of his friend conveyed, by proper ſervants, to a room which was on purpoſe fitted up in this melancholy and wild reſidence that Miſs Seymour had deſignedly choſen: it was hung with black, and every thing that could render it diſmal and awful was moſt induſtriouſly executed: the ſkulls and bones of departed friends were here and there ſcattered. <hi>Memento mori</hi> ſeemed to be the motto of all around; a coffin with glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering lights was carefully placed before him. In ſhort, the whole ſcene was both intereſting and tremendous.</p>
               <p>Wilding, who had been, during his tranſlation,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032623_0169_0FF3F30EDBC61798"/>
ignorant of all that was ſaid or done, how ſnored away his intoxication, and ſuddenly awaked in this room of horror; he rubbed his eyes, for ſome time gazing with wonder around, then doubtful that he was yet awake, he rubbed again; he looked at the ſkulls; took them up in his hands, then gazing at the arms and legs he went to the door, beheld two mutes who looked horror and death; he ſpoke to them, but they gave no anſwer, nor ſeemed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; he returned, walked about, beheld the coffin; this rouſed his curioſity; he read the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and was no doubt aſtoniſhed to find that John Wilding (himſelf) died ſuddenly the very day he was drinking with his friend Charles. This amazed him; he could not believe his eyes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no wonder; he was however reſolved to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine more cloſely into the matter, and endeavour to open the coffin for the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of ſeeing his own dead body; but herein he was diſappointed; for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors of the ſcheme had it ſo well ſcrewed down, that all his ability was in vain; now, in a ſtate of melancholy reflection, he ſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome time; at laſt Miſs Seymour and her confidant entered in deep mourning; he addreſſed them, but they took no notice of him; he ſpoke to them, but they did not anſwer; and, when they did break ſilence, their words were entirely foreign to the queſtions propoſed.</p>
               <p>"I will—cried Miſs Seymour in a fit of ſeeming diſtraction—I will give vent to my ſorrow and bewail the untimely death of this poor youth."</p>
               <p>"No, don't," cried Wilding, "look at me, I am not dead, upon my ſoul."</p>
               <p>Totally indifferent to Mr. Wilding's requeſt, ſhe mourned moſt plentifully over the coffin, and now and then would ſtare him in the face, to convince him that ſhe did <hi>not ſee him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Come away;" exclaimed Miſs Harcourt, who under pretence was adminiſtering all the conſolation in her power, "come, you did not know the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032623_0170_0FF3F311C5C82DC8"/>
of this man, or you would not now lament his deſerved fate; he had the impudence (I would not confeſs it to you, my dear, only he is now dead and gone) to attack even my virtue, and ſeek my utter ruin; laſt night I am told he had determined to complete his evil purpoſe; and heaven (I am ſure) inflicted this puniſhment upon him, for which I muſt always be thankful, to fruſtrate his dangerous deſign; otherwiſe he would not ſo ſuddenly have died of that ſmall cruſt of bread, which I am told ſtuck in his throat."</p>
               <p>"Speak not ſo harſhly I conjure you," cried Miſs Seymour, "he was young, and ſurely youth is ſome plea for his foibles; look at his coffin, he is no more than twenty, poor young man, had he lived, no doubt he would have atoned for all his errors."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, my dear, it is happier for you that he is now gone; conſider that you are thereby releaſed from a deteſtable contract; you are free, and I am ſure, if men ſuffer puniſhment after their death, he muſt feel NOW for his cruel treatment to you, and his wicked deſigns upon me."</p>
               <p>"Suffer!" echoed Wilding, "dear! dear! I believe I ſhall always be in hell."</p>
               <p>Jenny now entered, and ſeemed to bewail with equal ſorrow the untimely fate of poor Wilding: he did all in his power to ſhew himſelf, but ſuch was his misfortune, he could not <hi>appear</hi> to any; it was now Jenny diſcovered his intention of procuring ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to Miſs Harcourt by the bribes he had given her; in ſhort, all his ſins and iniquities ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtare him in the face, and riſe, as it were, in judgment againſt him.</p>
               <p>The ſervant brought in word that the undertaker was ready to inter the body; they all prepared, as mourners, to attend this awful funeral, even Charles now appeared in fable dreſs with watery eyes; the ladies went out firſt, and Wilding, who was left alone with his companion, endeavoured all in his power
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032623_0171_0FF3F313F7344F18"/>
to <hi>appear</hi> to him, but to no effect, he could not, for he <hi>would</hi> not ſee him.</p>
               <p>"Well by the—no I won't ſwear as I am dead," exclaimed Wilding, "but by my ſoul, for that is ſtill <hi>living,</hi> if you won't hear me, you ſhall <hi>feel</hi> me."</p>
               <p>Upon this Wilding gave Charles a moſt violent knock on the head, but, happily, the other attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to a ſudden head-ach, and convinced poor Wilding that he was a penitent ghoſt indeed.</p>
               <p>The diſmal ſituation of our hero cannot be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, particularly when he ſaw Charles, his boſom friend, preparing to pay his ſad reſpects to his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed remains— The women, Miſs Seymour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miſs Harcourt, and Jenny, went into one coach. Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to be among them, and, both out of reſpect to them, and love for the memory of himſelf, joined them in this ſtrange excurſion—the ladies artfully took no notice of his entering the carriage, and he ſat between Eliza and Lydia, who alternately lamented his fate, particularly the latter, who hoped (with a ſerious face while gazing inattentive to him) that heaven would have pity on his youth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him the manifold crimes he was guilty of.</p>
               <p>"But, alas!" continued Miſs Harcourt, "when I think on the heinous vices of which he has been guilty, I fear that brimſtone and fire muſt be his eternal lot—"</p>
               <p>"Heaven deliver me," ejaculated the terrified Wilding, who became conſcious of the ſins he had committed, and was rather apprehenſive of future puniſhment.</p>
               <p>In this affecting manner the company proceeded; while Jenny, who ſat oppoſite to Wilding, was rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violently againſt his juvenile follies, the tender Eliza beſeeching her to deſiſt, for this was no time to war with the duſt—While thus they were add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill to the terrors of Wilding, to complete both his aſtoniſhment and perturbation, they ſung the following

               <p>Now was the time when this unfortunate youth began to repent; now was the time when he ſaw his follies, and wiſhed himſelf alive again, that he might lead a <hi>new life.</hi> Eliza, who had ſo contrived that he ſhould be left behind, returned as it were to mourn over the remains of her dear but unworthy inconſtant—Wilding beheld her well-diſſembled grief; he looked at her, and wept likewiſe—She, with ſeaſonable cunning, ſtarted at his appearance.</p>
               <p>"Good heaven!" exclaimed ſhe, "it is—it is the ſhade of Mr. Wilding—"</p>
               <p>Wilding was happy that ſhe <hi>ſaw</hi> him—he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he was that unfortunate youth who was juſt now buried; he implored her forgiveneſs, and earneſtly prayed that ſhe would intercede for him

               <p>At this inſtant, Charles, who had accompanied Eliza, and during this ſcene ſecreted himſelf behind a tree, diſcovered himſelf by a loud laugh—the noiſe of which ſurpriſed Wilding; for, ſtruck with every ſound, he ſeemed apprehenſive that the <hi>devil</hi> was coming for him—he was happy however to ſee <hi>him</hi> in the ſhape of Charles his friend, who now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the plot; flattering himſelf that the effect thereof was both happy and ſucceſsful.</p>

It happened that Wilmot, the adopted heir of Sir Jeffery Woodſtock, beheld and loved her—the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet approved his choice—for the charms of Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da far exceeded the old man's conception, or even the deſcription of the lover.</p>
               <p>Wilmot had been the ſon of an honeſt but unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate man; he had found a friend in Sir Jeffery beyond his warmeſt expectations: for ſo great was this baronet's partiality for the youth, that he not only indulged him in all his juvenile purſuits, but even appointed him as heir to his large fortune.</p>
               <p>This uncommon partiality, the reader may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, reſulted from uncommon generoſity. But no: revenge, malignity, and all the ſecret impulſes of inward reſentment, occaſioned this apparent benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; his own ſon was abandoned, diſinherited— and why? The unfortunate youth had married a worthy but an indigent fair, and, being provoked that he ſhould have ſo little regard to his lineage and conſequence, determined never to ſee him more. In vain did Henry (for that was his name) endeavour to recover his father's good graces; the baronet was inexorable, and it was entirely owing to the heat of his paſſion, that Wilmot, the ſon of his neighbour,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032623_0175_0FF3F31C08B02EA0"/>
was appointed heir to his eſtate. This adopted ſon was exceedingly young, but very good natured. He was ignorant of the cauſe of Sir Jeffery's ſeeming humanity; and, like the majority of ſpectators, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all to his urbanity; but Henry ſeized many an opportunity of converſing with the young man, and, being unknown to him, very wiſely reſolved to keep the name of his obdurate parent ſtill concealed. They became ſo intimate at laſt, that Wilmot fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invited him to his houſe, anxious, he ſaid, to introduce him to Sir Jeffery; but Henry by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual evaſions declined this, and always contrived ſo as to meet the young man when his father was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Wilmot, ſtruck with the appearance of his new friend, was exceedingly deſirous to know his ſtory; he often interrogated him about his parentage, and at laſt Henry gave the following account.</p>
               <p>"I was the ſon of both a titled and a rich man—I ſay I <hi>was,</hi> becauſe I no longer <hi>am</hi>—and yet he is not dead, as you may naturally ſuppoſe, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;— I am—Oh! my dear friend, baniſhed from his preſence, becauſe I happened to marry the daughter of an humble farmer, whoſe virtue and beauty, I deemed a ſufficient portion; and had it pleaſed heaven that my dear Euphemia had lived to bleſs the remainder of my life, I would ſtill have ſmiled at the frowns of my father, for her ſake—but ah! I fear his diſpleaſure, added to the bitter pangs of poverty, were the ſad means of her diſſolution— ſhe died, my friend, of a broken heart!—my Euphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia is no more! My father was informed of this, and I thought, the unhappy cauſe of our diſunion being removed, that all his reſentment would have died likewiſe; but herein I deceived myſelf—his anger lives ſtill, and ſeems likely, I think, to remain for ever—he has ſubſtituted in my place a youth, whoſe manners and ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>racter indeed entitle him to every one's love—though my enemy, I look upon
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032623_0176_0FF3F31E47E5B2B0"/>
him as my friend—though the adoption is ſomewhat unnatural, I eſteem him as a real brother—he is to enjoy the inheritance which is my right—with all my heart—be it ſo; and long may he be happy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with."</p>
               <p>Wilmot was exceedingly moved with this ſhort hiſtory; he railed bitterly againſt the unknown father's cruelty, and curſed the youth that could retain ſo unjuſtly what was another's legal right and due—</p>
               <p>But Henry interrupted him, while thus railing againſt himſelf—</p>
               <p>"Forbear; you know not who you abuſe; I have a ſtratagem in my head, that I hope will baffle all the vindictive deſigns of my cruel father—Yes, I hope to puniſh his unkindneſs, by means of the puniſhment he intends for me."</p>
               <p>Wilmot preſſed him to be more explicit; he prayed earneſtly that he would confide in him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing not only profound ſecrecy, but even his aſſiſtance in any ſcheme that was honorable and likely to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>Henry thanked the youth for his generous offer— aſſured him that his aſſiſtance was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and one day or other he would communicate his intentions—at preſent his deſigns were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ripe for execution, and therefore it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, he ſaid, to mention them.</p>
               <p>"I cannot," continued Henry, "forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the contradictory paſſions of my father: he ſees faults in me, which, though glaring in his newly adopted ſon, he is moſt obſtinately blind to: the very crime which I have committed, my brother (give me leave ſo to call him) has his permiſſion for doing: he is in love with a young girl who is equally as poor as my dear Euphemia was—her birth and parentage equally obſcure and mean; yet, wonderful to tell, the old gentleman has not only conſented, but abſolutely encourages this unequal union.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032623_0177_0FF3F31FCF178680"/>
However, when they are married, I ſhall take the liberty of making the compariſon, and inquiring wherein I am more to be cenſured than my repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative; but, perhaps, I may be told that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without leave, and he had permiſſion; but why had not I the ſame indulgence, or he the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal, that his ſuperior duty and filial piety might have been proved?—"</p>
               <p>"The remarks are juſt," anſwered Wilmot— "Oh! Henry had you been bleſt with a father like Sir Jeffery, how different had been your lot! (Henry ſmiled.) "I experience (continued the youth) his ſuperlative goodneſs every day; ſince ſo kind to me, what muſt he have been to his <hi>own</hi> ſon, had he lived?"—For Wilmot was led to ſuppoſe that Sir Jeffery's ſon was dead."</p>
               <p>"I am happy," replied Henry, "that my friend enjoys ſo much uninterrupted bliſs."</p>
               <p>The youth now extravagantly expatiated upon the baronet's act of generoſity, particularly as he had indulged him in his love for Matilda, in praiſe of whoſe merit he was equally laviſh; he told Henry, that a meſſenger was to be immediatly diſpatched to the old lady, with whom his dear Matilda lived, to inform her of the ardour of his love, and his wiſh to call her his wife; "this (added he) is alſo to be urged by the ſolicitations of Sir Jeffery, who has nobly promiſed, on the day of marriage, to make a comfortable ſettlement, excluſive of what he means to give me, on the dear object of my wiſhes."</p>
               <p>Henry ſuppreſſed a ſigh at this relation; and after mutual promiſes of ſerving each other, the friends now parted.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger, who was diſpatched to the cottage where Matilda lived, was a young man, who had been ſome years in the ſervice of Sir Jeffery—his name was Spruce—both vain and illiterate; but being a great lover of intrigue, and often concerned in affairs of love, he was conſequently deemed the moſt proper for this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:032623_0178_0FF3F32204FCA450"/>On his arrival at the cottage, Matilda was juſt gone to take her uſual walk in the meadows. Spruce therefore imparted the motives of his viſit to the old lady. Dorothy was exceedingly hurt at this ſudden declaration of Wilmot's love, and the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals which were made by Sir Jeffery. As Dorothy was a maiden lady, and by her own accounts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſappointed in love, Spruce conceived that her averſion to this buſineſs naturally proceeded from that envy which women <hi>in her ſituation</hi> too often diſcover upon hearing of others, <hi>younger</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, advanced to the title of brides; but theſe were not altogether Dorothy's reaſons. Intereſt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely her view, and as neceſſity has no law, ſhe thought it expedient to make Spruce her friend and confidant. She therefore informed him, that if Miſs was married, ſhe muſt conſequently loſe her cottage, for that this place of reſidence was only allowed her for the ſake of ſupporting Matilda, whoſe education had been entirely left to her.</p>
               <p>Spruce was alarmed at this account, and being urged on by vanity and aſſurance reſolved to benefit himſelf by whatever ſcheme the old lady adopted. After ſome little conſideration and mutual ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Dorothy propoſed, that Mr. Spruce ſhould entirely reverſe his meſſage, and inſtead of informing Matilda, that it was Wilmot (to whom it was well known the young lady was partial) that intended her the honor of his hand—to declare it was Sir Jeffery Woodſtock, the old gentleman himſelf, who wiſhed to marry her, and that Mr. Wilmot intended to accompany the Baronet, in order to ſtrengthen his ſuppoſed ſolicitation.</p>
               <p>"Sir Jeffery," the old lady remarked, "is ſo old and infirm, that I know Matilda will be diſguſted with his appearance, and will abſolutely give him a refuſal, not knowing at the ſame time that it is her favorite Wilmot ſhe has rejected. I will take care," cried this artful woman, "their interview ſhall be ſo ſhort that no explanation ſhall take place."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="unknown:032623_0179_0FF3F3242A7B61A8"/>Spruce not only conſented, but approved of this ſcheme, on one condition, that Dorothy would uſe all her intereſt and ſway over Matilda to recommend <hi>his</hi> beautiful perſon; for this vain upſtart entertained a paſſion for the Maid of the Village, and infamouſly meditated her ruin.</p>
               <p>The old infamous woman too readily agreed to Spruce's deſign. Promiſes were therefore exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the plot now put into execution.</p>
               <p>When Matilda returned from the meadows, the old lady and Spruce began to deceive her. The poor girl was ſurpriſed to hear that Sir Jeffery ſhould think of her; but exceedingly grieved that Wilmot, her beloved, ſhould become an advocate for ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable an union. Spruce aſſured her, that it would be a thouſand pities her beauty ſhould be ſacrificed to the embraces of an old fellow, old enough to be her grandfather; and that he would exert all in his power, to relieve her embarraſſments. Dorothy adviſed her by all means to diſmiſs them before they began to argue the matter; "D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n't liſten to them," cried ſhe, "don't liſten to any of their propoſals."</p>
               <p>Sir Jeffery Woodſtock and Wilmot now arrived, while the trembling Matilda, to the great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter, endeavoured to avoid them.</p>
               <p>Sir Jeffery inſiſted on her ſtay, hoping that the buſineſs which his ſervant had orders to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate was perfectly agreeable.</p>
               <p>"You do me honor," cried the gentle maid; "but conſider, Sir, that I am poor and unknown—my circumſtances render me totally unworthy."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear," replied the urgent baronet, who now ſqueezed her hand, "what ſignifies your being poor—I have enough, and will make an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-proviſion for you; with your leave, then, a lawyer ſhall draw up the ſettlement."</p>
               <p>"Excuſe me, Sir"—Matilda now withdrew her hand, while ſorrow prevented further utterance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:032623_0180_0FF3F325B291D8B8"/>"O, Matilda!" exclaimed the agitated Wilmot; "and is it poſſible you can be ſo unkind? Look— look on me—and if I have any influence, which once I flattered myſelf I had, let me prevail upon you, at leaſt, to conſider before you abſolutely refuſe."</p>
               <p>Matilda, ſtruck with aſtoniſhment to find Wilmot ſo warm an advocate, as ſhe ſuppoſed, for Sir Jeffery Woodſtock, now turned about and took a faint view of Wilmot, as her tears had almoſt eclipſed him.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" ſhe exclaimed, is it poſſible, Mr. Wilmot, that you can bid me look on <hi>you</hi> and conſider upon <hi>this</hi> propoſal?"</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry," rejoined the miſunderſtood lover, "I am ſorry to find that I am ſo very deſpicable in your eyes."</p>
               <p>"<hi>You</hi> deſpicable! — how can you ſay ſo?"</p>
               <p>"Is it not evident by your abhorrence <hi>now?</hi>"</p>
               <p>Sir Jeffery was rather provoked at this ſeeming indifference to Wilmot.</p>
               <p>"What," cried he, "can be the cauſe of objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Do you, ill-natured fair one, deſire a man <hi>younger?</hi> Or is it one of the fops of the age who can pleaſe you better?"</p>
               <p>This ſevere reproach was deeply felt by the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Matilda, who, making no anſwer, immediately left their preſence.</p>
               <p>Sir Jeffery was exceedingly chagrined at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception—he knew not what to think. Being enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured himſelf with the beauty of Matilda, he was almoſt as eager for this match as even the fond lover; but her behaviour he deemed inſupportable Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he was for perſuading Wilmot to forget her— then imagining that his ſon had, by ſome artful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, occaſioned this her averſion, he appeared the more eager for the wedding. At laſt it was ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved, that Wilmot ſhould ſtill remain, and, by watching her cloſely, ſeize a private opportunity of urging his requeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:032623_0181_0FF3F327E3E97B40"/>In the mean time, Spruce and Dorothy were putt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their heads together. They rejoiced beyond meaſure, that ſo far their ſcheme had happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and now they began to conſider among themſelves, how they ſhould diſmiſs Sir Jeffery entirely.</p>
               <p>It was immediately conjectured by Spruce, as the ſureſt means of effecting their wiſhes, that he ſhould meet Matilda, and inform her a dangerous deſign was in agitation againſt her; then to prevail upon her to make her eſcape with <hi>him</hi>; and when he had conveyed her ſome diſtance from the village, put in force all the power of his intreaties, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of his wiſhes.</p>
               <p>This horrid ſcheme was greatly applauded by the infamous Dorothy, who immediately urged him to put it into execution.</p>
               <p>Matilda was now alone in the meadows, bewailing her unhappy fate, and railing at the ſuppoſed infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of Wilmot. Spruce ſeized this opportunity to effect his moſt horrid intention. He addreſſed her with pretended compaſſion and anxiety; aſſured her that a moſt horrid plot was formed againſt her, and that it was his wiſh to preſerve her from violence.</p>
               <p>The maid, no doubt, was alarmed at this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and gratefully thanked Mr. Spruce for the pains he had taken. She timidly inquired what was the plot, and by what means it was poſſible for her to eſcape.</p>
               <p>"You muſt know, Madam," cried the artful Spruce, "that my cruel maſter, Sir Jeffery, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you were adverſe to his propoſal, has ſince conſulted with Mr. Wilmot, and it has been agreed among them, that my young maſter ſhould ſtay here and watch an opportunity, when by fine ſpeeches he might cajole and amuſe you; and then, under pretence of making love to you himſelf, perſuade you to accompany him in a carriage, when his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inous intention was to deliver you up to the power of Sir Jeffery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:032623_0182_0FF3F32A2A93F6A0"/>"O heavens! is it poſſible?" exclaimed Matilda, "that Mr. Wilmot, who has often proteſted at my feet that he loved and adored but only me, ſhould now ungenerouſly forget all his vows, and uſe ſuch clandeſtine—ſuch baſe unworthy means of ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and delivering me up to a man I can never love?—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam, a man, as I ſaid before, that might be your grandfather—a decrepid old fellow, who would fain monopolize all your beauty to himſelf; but it ſhall not be—"forbid it honor, and forbid it love;" no, I am reſolved to protect and deliver you —yes, madam, command your very humble ſervant, who is entirely devoted to your ſervice."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Sir, but ſince Mr. Wilmot has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, I can hardly confide in any — him that I thought ſo generous, ſo kind, ſo tender, and ſo lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but now I remember he was always expatiating upon the bounty and ſincerity of Sir Jeffery; yet he only named him as a parent, not as a lover. Alas! I did not imagine that he was recommending him to me as an huſband."</p>
               <p>"O my dear, you are but little acquainted with the artifices of men; but I take pity on your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and youth—I compaſſionate your ſituation. Give me leave then to convey you from a place of danger; for I am ſure if you remain here any longer, that misfortunes will inevitably enſue; the very car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that is intended for your ruin, I will convert to your delivery. Depend upon my truth, I can have no other motive for theſe perſuaſions but hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and reſpect. Nay, to aſſure you of my integrity, the old lady of the houſe ſhall accompany us; for I ſcorn to act clandeſtinely or baſely. O then, think on the danger that awaits, and ſeize on this happy opportunity of eſcaping."</p>
               <p>Matilda gave way to credulity. Mr. Spruce's offer of taking Dorothy with him removed all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; and yet, when ſhe recollected the proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032623_0183_0FF3F32C5ECE6210"/>
of her Wilmot, which far exceeded all thoſe of Spruce, ſhe did not know whom to ſuſpect, or whom to believe. At laſt, unwary maid, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and now was willing to run into real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by way of avoiding evil that was only imaginary.</p>
               <p>The happy Spruce fell on his knees, to adore and praiſe her for her condeſcenſion; but while he was harping upon the deſigns of Sir Jeffery and Wilmot —behold the latter, who had been liſtening all the while, now appeared from his place of concealment, to the utter confuſion of both Spruce and his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Matilda—She, poor ſoul, deluded by the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhe had received, was avoiding her only friend; for inſtead of loving, ſhe began almoſt to <hi>hate</hi> him.</p>
               <p>However, the violent indignity of Wilmot, who now revenged himſelf on the deceitful Spruce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to operate on the mind of Matilda—there was little time needed to convince the fair how much ſhe had been miſtaken—the preſence of Sir Jeffery Woodſtock confirmed the aſſertions of the much injured Wilmot. Matilda was, notwithſtanding, rejoiced to find her lover was ſincere; and he equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy that his fair one was not unkind.</p>
               <p>When Dorothy perceived that the ſtratagem was totally baffled, ſhe deemed it the beſt way to keep in with the young lovers. The day was now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the union of Matilda and Wilmot forthwith celebrated.</p>
               <p>The day after marriage (as Matilda had requeſted to remain the firſt week in her village) Wilmot, on his return, from ſtraying round the meadows, was exceedingly ſurpriſed to find his wife in the arms of his friend Henry—He could hardly believe his eyes, and, that he might be the better convinced, retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a ſhort while—but their love, their embraces were too evident; and the violent Wilmot, unable to ſuppreſs his indignation any longer, burſt forth and inſiſted upon an explanation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:032623_0184_0FF3F32DE8753550"/>"O, my dear ſon!" exclaimed Henry, "for, being now the huſband of my dear daughter (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate you by that title) come to my arms!"</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! are you the father of my Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da—and why was this concealed?"</p>
               <p>"That I may ſurpriſe <hi>my</hi> obdurate father—I have, till now, ſecreted the birth of my dear and only child, having provided on purpoſe this cottage; I have encouraged your addreſſes, and I have long prayed for this union."</p>
               <p>The preſence of Sir Jeffery now interrupted them —He railed bitterly at the ſuppoſed intruſion of Henry; but who can paint his ſurprize, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that it was his grand-daughter whom he had married to his ſon—that to her he had given up the due inheritance of Henry which otherwiſe would have been her's—He ſaw, he felt the juſtice of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and, ſhaking hands with Henry, grieved that he had not been as kind as he ſhould have been to the mother of Matilda—but hoped all his unjuſt reſentment would be buried in total oblivion, as from henceforth he reſolved to reward the faithful love of Wilmot and his wife, and be a father—to the father.</p>

               <p>OLIVIA was a young lady of beauty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, conſequently ſurrounded with a number of ſuitors, all of whom profeſſed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt regard for her, and vied with each other who
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032623_0185_0FF3F32F6F8A78A0"/>
ſhould win her—Being an orphan, and without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, her ſituation was indeed critical, but Olivia did not want ſenſe or prudence to conduct herſelf.</p>
               <p>She found a friend and confidant in Sally, who was deſcended from rather a poor, but worthy fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. The ſuperior beauty of Olivia, above all, her great fortune, gave Sally but little chance of having admirers; there was, however, a young man who paid his addreſſes to her—Sally was partial to him; indeed ſhe was ſomewhat more happy in this reſpect than her friend, not being tormented by numerous ſolicitations, and conſequently puzzled in making a choice. She was only courted by one—and in that one, Thomas, ſhe flattered herſelf ſhe would find a ſincere lover.</p>
               <p>Not ſo with Olivia—ſhe deemed it expedient to change her ſituation, but was exceedingly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed about making her choice—the croud was ſo great—their proteſtations alike ſo ſtrong—their families all noble; that it was hard to know whom to prefer. One diſplayed great notions of honor— another of bravery. In ſhort, ſhe diſcovered in each ſome recommendation, ſome imperfection, and wanted a counſellor to direct her.</p>
               <p>Sally having, by ſome means or other, heard of two cunning men, adviſed her friend to ſubmit the caſe to their ſuperior knowledge. One of them, cries ſhe, I underſtand is both deaf and dumb, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he can <hi>tell no lies</hi>; the other is a ſort of interpreter, who explains every thing that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conjurer <hi>does not ſay</hi>; their penetration, I hear, is very profound — they know all the future as well as I know the paſt; and can read the characters of men with as much eaſe as I can ſay my prayers.</p>
               <p>Olivia, by this deſcription of the cunning men, was very much induced to ſee them. Sally rejoiced exceedingly, for ſhe alſo intended to be convinced of her Thomas's fidelity.</p>
               <p>Then, Madam, to tell the truth, exclaims Sally, I
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032623_0186_0FF3F331A5FE8C18"/>
have appointed theſe men to call in the evening; we muſt darken the room, as darkneſs I underſtand, in a great meaſure, aſſiſts all the conjurations, and if they don't tell us truth, it is agreed that they ſhall have no reward.</p>
               <p>Olivia was highly delighted with this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the ſervants were ordered to deny her to every gentleman that called, that ſhe might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by theſe cunning men, whom ſhe ſhould encourage. Curious to know, however, the means whereby Sally became acquainted with their ſkill, ſhe requeſted to know who it was recommended them. Her friend, without reſerve, aſſured her that it was the ſervant maid who had given this information; ſhe would (continued Sally) have communicated the matter to you herſelf, but was unwilling that her miſtreſs ſhould think her officious and impertinent —I therefore took it upon me to give permiſſion for their admittance, reſolving, if you were ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of trying their abilities, to ſummon courage ſufficient to ſee them alone.</p>
               <p>Polly, according to orders, denied her miſtreſs to every lover that called, and in the evening, about the appointed time, announced the arrival of the two cunning men.</p>
               <p>The ladies received theſe learned gentlemen with great dread and perturbation— Sally looking now and then about her to ſee if the third gentleman in black, old Nick, was viſible. The deaf and dumb conjurer made ſigns that the door ſhould be locked; this, his interpreter immediately complied with.</p>
               <p>Olivia now addreſſing the man that could <hi>hear,</hi> begged to know who among all her admirers loved her beſt — the conjurer bowed, and making ſigns to his comrade, obſerved to Olivia, that his brother firſt of all intended to inform her the characters of thoſe pretended admirers whom ſhe ſaw yeſterday — "he will ſhew you by his book of knowledge, their names and diſpoſition."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:032623_0187_0FF3F3347B260760"/>This wonderful promiſe excited the curioſity of both the ladies, upon which the cunning men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their <hi>pantomimical</hi> diſcourſe—the deaf and dumb one, by ſigns, now repreſented a fop, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter opening the book, declared his name to be Lord Foppington.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe Olivia's aſtoniſhment; as for Sally, ſhe remained with fixed eyes and open mouth, rivetted, as it were, to the ground. He next repreſented a gameſter; who the interpreter called Mr. Hazard; by ſtaggering and hiccuping, he alſo expreſſed a toper, Careleſs was his name; Gripe, a miſer, followed—and 'ſquire Crop, a huntſman, concluded the account.</p>
               <p>The credulous fair ones were now ſufficiently aſſured of the wonderful ſkill of theſe men; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they requeſted a further account of their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, as Olivia wiſhed to know if any were deſerving of her hand.</p>
               <p>When the interpreter communicated their wiſh to his comrade, he took pen and ink, and wrote the following advice to Olivia, in reſpect to Lord Foppington.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Remain as plain as bounteous nature made you,</l>
                  <l>Nor thro' ambition ſeek to be a lady;</l>
                  <l>Abhor Lord Foppington, whoſe chief deſire</l>
                  <l>Is, leading faſhions for your fools t' admire;</l>
                  <l>To ſtrut about in gold and ſilver lace,</l>
                  <l>And charm the fair ones with his pretty face.</l>
                  <l>Mark on the little finger, his fine ring,</l>
                  <l>To ſhew how inſignificant—the <hi>thing!</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Mark how in matters, either right or wrong,</l>
                  <l>His empty <hi>honor</hi> flies upon his tongue—</l>
                  <l>For ever flying, as, within his breaſt,</l>
                  <l>Honor can find no place wherein to <hi>reſt.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>How oft he gives, how oft forgets his word,</l>
                  <l>How oft will ſwear, and ſwearing ſhew the <hi>lord,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I know to love thee, he did late proteſt—</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="189" facs="unknown:032623_0188_0FF3F336AA31B260"/>But marry, and he'll ſay 'twas <hi>all a jeſt.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Oh! then beware, for nought will be your gains,</l>
                  <l>What is a powder'd head that lacketh brains?</l>
               </q>
               <p>Olivia was exceedingly grateful for this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—ſhe determined on diſmiſſing his lordſhip im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and eraſing him for ever out of the liſt of her admirers. The conjurer now, on being again importuned, wrote the following character of Mr. Hazard—
<q>
                     <l>Avoid this man, nor take him to your arms,</l>
                     <l>You ſacrifice your gold, as well as charms.</l>
                     <l>Tho' great as Dives—yet to-morrow night,</l>
                     <l>He may be Lazarus in diſmal plight;</l>
                     <l>And is't not even better to be poor,</l>
                     <l>Than wealth by horrid methods to procure—</l>
                     <l>To rob whole families—to leave forlorn</l>
                     <l>Wife, huſband, children, perhaps too th' unborn.</l>
                     <l>But mark the gen'ral end of men like theſe,</l>
                     <l>When conſcience and remorſe their boſoms ſeize;</l>
                     <l>When wild diſtraction entering the place,</l>
                     <l>Now want and ruin ſtare him in the face.</l>
                     <l>Should he behold a wife of all bereft,</l>
                     <l>His little ones, whom he has naked left,</l>
                     <l>How often ſuicide holds up the knife,</l>
                     <l>And frenzy prompts him to attack his life;</l>
                     <l>Then with a coward's arm, he gives the blow,</l>
                     <l>And flies to other ills he did not know!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſufficient—Convinced of the danger of marrying ſuch a man, Olivia immediately renounced him. Now Careleſs was pourtrayed, and the young lady thus cautioned—
<q>
                     <l>This character, a baſe inconſtant proves,</l>
                     <l>For he's another miſtreſs whom he loves.</l>
                     <l>His bottle—whom, with Bacchanalian roars,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="190" facs="unknown:032623_0189_0FF3F33831942B50"/>He plainly ſhews that he alone adores;</l>
                     <l>What, tho' you're wonderfully fair he vows,</l>
                     <l>Still greater charms he to his wine allows.</l>
                     <l>And tho' your eyes for brightneſs may ſurpaſs,</l>
                     <l>He ſees more ſparkling beauties in his glaſs;</l>
                     <l>What, tho' he ſwears to be for ever true,</l>
                     <l>His bottle he would ne'er forſake for you;</l>
                     <l>And ſay, what pleaſure could you ever taſte</l>
                     <l>With one who, tho' a man, is oft a <hi>leaſt,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Who turns his night to day, and day to night,</l>
                     <l>And, 'ſtead of pleaſing, is more apt t' affright?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, cried Olivia, he may marry his bottle for me—I'll have none of him.</p>
               <p>The cunning men now proceeded, and in a few minutes produced the following lines upon Gripe—
<q>
                     <l>The miſer view, whoſe greedy itching palm</l>
                     <l>Squeezes a purſe, as beggars would an alm;</l>
                     <l>So very fond of empty glitt'ring pelf,</l>
                     <l>Could he love you who does not love himſelf?</l>
                     <l>Beware of him, he never could be true,</l>
                     <l>He loves your money, but he loves not you;</l>
                     <l>And tho' you brought him thouſand bags of ſtore,</l>
                     <l>Still would he want, ſtill would he covet more.</l>
                     <l>Beſides, he's wrinkled, old, then think and ſay,</l>
                     <l>Shou'd <hi>January</hi> e'er be join'd with <hi>May?</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This old gentleman was accordingly ſtruck out of the liſt of Olivia's pretended admirers. Sally all this while appeared exceedingly mortified and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed; ſhe felt for her friend—apprehenſive that, notwithſtanding the number of her boaſting lovers, ſhe could not find one that was worthy and ſincere.</p>
               <p>The next character which appeared in writing was the 'ſquire's. Thus it follows, with the cunning man's advice—
<q>
                     <l>Oh, ſcorn this fellow's nothingneſs and art,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="191" facs="unknown:032623_0190_0FF3F33A621F4290"/>He has a tongue, but wants a feeling heart;</l>
                     <l>No real pleaſure does this man purſue,</l>
                     <l>For only game and riot are his view.</l>
                     <l>Were you this worthleſs creature to embrace,</l>
                     <l>He'd riſk you on a wager the next race;</l>
                     <l>Nor would it ſeem to thoſe, that knew him, ſtrange,</l>
                     <l>If for a dog or horſe his wife he'd change.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The cunning men's advice was accepted, and 'ſquire Crop accordingly rejected.</p>
               <p>"Lord, Lord," cried Sally, whoſe patience was now quite exhauſted, "paſs over all thoſe unworthy beings, and let my friend know who is moſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her hand; then, Sir, I ſhall trouble you to tell me whether Mr. Thomas is, or is not worthy of his Sally."</p>
               <p>The interpreter then requeſted his comrade to ſatisfy the wiſhes of the young ladies; accordingly, he gave Olivia the following paper—
<q>
                     <l>'Tis honeſt Love well who adores alone,</l>
                     <l>Which modeſty prevents the youth to own;</l>
                     <l>He loves you more than fops love dreſſes fine,</l>
                     <l>Gameſters, good luck, or topers their good wine.</l>
                     <l>Oh yes, believe me, fair, he loves you more</l>
                     <l>Than jockeys, game; or miſers, bags of ſtore;</l>
                     <l>Oh, then reward this lover that's ſo true,</l>
                     <l>And ſmile on him that thinks of nought but you.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Lovewell!—Olivia was amazed; and no wonder, for ſhe was never importuned by the youth, nor (though ſhe confeſſed ſhe felt a <hi>ſomething</hi> in her heart, which was very much in his favour) did ſhe ever ſuſpect the leaſt partiality on his ſide; for this reaſon ſhe did not encourage a hope that might have proved both falſe and fatal.</p>
               <p>The interpreter now conjured her, as her future happineſs thereupon depended, to grant Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the honor of her hand. Timidity, he ſaid, had
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032623_0191_0FF3F33C8C755C90"/>
prevented him from yet making known his love, but ſhortly ſhe ſhould behold him at her feet, when he hoped ſhe would remember his advice.</p>
               <p>Oliva declared ſhe would be mindful of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and, ſince he was deſerving, ſhe would reward his worth.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my dear angel," exclaimed the <hi>dumb</hi> man —and throwing off his diſguiſe, behold, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well himſelf was kneeling in her preſence.</p>
               <p>Olivia was both confuſed and aſtoniſhed, while Sally now believed the devil was in the room indeed.</p>
               <p>Lovewell! is it poſſible—and who are you? continued Sally, addreſſing the interpreter.</p>
               <p>Your faithful Thomas, he replied; and I conjure you likewiſe to ſmile on him.</p>
               <p>The whole buſineſs was now unravelled. The lovers, it ſeems, had invented this ſcheme, which, by the aſſiſtance of Polly, the ſervant maid, was put into execution, to warn the fair Olivia of thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous admirers who ſurrounded her, and, at the ſame time, diſcover the real adoration of Lovewell. The grateful Olivia, mindful of the promiſe ſhe had made, gave Mr. Lovewell her hand, as a gratuity for the pains he had taken—while Sally and Thomas made it a double union.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange metamorphoſe of the lovers created much diverſion in the neighbourhood:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>But men and women, children, all agreed</l>
                  <l>Lovewell and Tom were <hi>Cunning Men</hi> indeed.</l>

               <p>WILLIAM, the ſon of an old fooliſh 'ſquire who had accumulated a good deal of wealth, ſaw and admired Delia, the daughter of an eminent mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, whoſe country houſe was within a few miles of his father. 'Squire Sturdy having intended to ſend his ſon abroad, which he hoped would turn out greatly to his advantage, was exceedingly chagrined upon finding the young man averſe to his deſign; for William's heart being with Delia, he could not poſſibly think of leaving the place, and thereby giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all his hopes of future happineſs. Sooner than break his vows to his beloved, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, let what would be the conſequence, to refuſe obedience to his father's will. The old man was exceedingly provoked at this unexpected denial; for William, till now, was always willing and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he therefore declared, if he did not obey, he ſhould ſee him no more; and that he would marry again in hopes of getting another ſon that might be better deſerving of his love and fortune. William with an heavy heart quitted his father's habitation; for, though diſagreeable and painful as it was, he had rather leave that than leave his deareſt Delia.</p>
               <p>The 'Squire was ignorant of William's partiality for Mr. Violent's daughter: ſometimes, indeed, the ſon would have diſcloſed the ſecret of his heart, and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032623_0193_0FF3F34055ADC630"/>
the ſtrong motives he had for remaining at home; but then he apprehended that ſuch candor and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity might only incur greater diſpleaſure, and the conſequences bring alſo ſome trouble upon the fair object of his adoration, whoſe father was proud, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, and (ſtrange to tell) averſe to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's being united to a <hi>young</hi> man; it being his wiſh, and indeed hope, to provide a ſober, wealthy, middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged perſon, who might be more a companion for <hi>himſelf</hi> than for the unfortunate maid.</p>
               <p>William, now like the prodigal ſon, a voluntary exile, repaired to the houſe of Mr. Friendly, a young man who had been juſt married; he had been both ſchool-fellow and companion of William, and not only made ſeveral proteſtations of his regard, but proved it alſo by many tokens—Aſſured therefore of his aſſiſtance and good-nature, William diſcloſed to him the unkindneſs of his father; he wiſhed to be married privately to Delia, imagining that when his love was then revealed, and it was out of the power of <hi>either</hi> father to prevent his happineſs, that his own would ſeriouſly conſider the buſineſs, and compaſſionate his ſituation. Friendly agreed with his deſign, and reſolved, by way of expediting the buſineſs, to leave his juſt married Lucinda, and aſſiſt him in whatever ſcheme he might think fit to adopt.</p>
               <p>This further proof of Friendly's urbanity received the grateful thanks of William. During their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Mrs. Friendly went, according to invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to drink tea with a neighbour, who was a maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en lady, her name Dor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032623_0194_0FF3F3428A7D5168"/>
—Such was the character of this worthleſs female, too many of whom are daily permitted to murder reputations by their table-talk, and wound the peace of individuals by continual ſlander.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, Lucinda encouraged the viſits of this dangerous woman, and not only returned them, but credulouſly made her both a friend &amp; counſellor. She now imparted to her the unexpected viſit of William, for whom her huſband, ſhe ſaid, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the greateſt eſteem, and on whoſe account Friendly had intimated to her, that he ſhould be obliged to leave her for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Dorcas ſhook her head at this information— "Friendſhip (ſaid ſhe) never induced a man yet to leave his wife, for even an hour, if he loved her— particularly during the honey-moon—I am ſorry to hear this—I thought Mr. Friendly quite a different ſort of a man—but there is no dependence upon any of them, that's the truth of it."</p>
               <p>Theſe miſtruſtful hints awakened the curioſity of Lucinda, who conjured her, by the eſteem ſhe had profeſſed for her, to acquaint her candidly with her real opinion of the matter.</p>
               <p>"Excuſe me, my dear, I ſhould be exceedingly unwilling to alarm you—Heaven forbid that I ſhould make you uneaſy—No, no."</p>
               <p>Theſe words only rendered the unſuſpecting Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda the more eager and impatient — At laſt the old lady <hi>frankly</hi> declared (as ſhe termed it) that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was falſe, and this viſit was contrived between him and his friend, that he might have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſeeing and dallying with another fair, more charming in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Lucinda at firſt ſmiled at theſe ſuggeſtions; but the infamous Dorcas, to prove her great penetration and wiſdom, now added ſo many lies to her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, that jealouſy ſoon began to prey upon the mind of Mrs. Friendly.</p>
               <p>During this, William had projected a ſcheme of
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032623_0195_0FF3F344B95523A8"/>
eloping with his beloved Delia, which was highly approved by his friend. Being unknown, he ſaid, to Mr. Violent, he thought he might eaſily diſguiſe himſelf as a reaper, this being the ſeaſon for cutting down hay, and there being a ſcarcity of workman, indeed ſo much, that the old gentleman had very fortunately the preceding day applied to Mr. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (whom he knew) to look out for a few hands for him. A diſguiſe was ſoon had, and two real reapers, who were let into the ſecret, and well bribed, were to accompany him. Friendly was now to go and recommend them perſonally to Mr. Violent. As his wife had not yet returned from her neighbour's, and delay he feared would be dangerous, he left a letter for her with the ſervants, informing her that he ſhould be ſoon home, but was obliged to go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to fulfil the duties of friendſhip. This being written, and William properly attired, away they went to the old gentleman's country ſeat.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Friendly, on her return, miſſing her huſband, was now convinced of what before ſhe falſely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; the letter (for it was written in a hurry) being brief and unſatisfactory, helped to add to her uneaſineſs. She was told by the ſervants, that young Mr. Sturdy and their maſter were for a long time cloſetted with two reapers—There was a ſcheme evidently in agitation, and this ſcheme not being divulged to Lucinda, confirmed now all her ſuſpicions, and corroborated, ſeemingly, all the aſſertions of her neighbour.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Friendly ſearched the cloſet where they had been together, and, ſeeing the clothes of William, which he had leſt, in conſequence of putting on thoſe of a reaper—a thought ſtruck her—William being rather a ſlender made man, and ſomewhat ſhort, ſhe immediately tried his coat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:032623_0196_0FF3F34647AE8D80"/>Mr. Violent had juſt hired William and the other two men, on the recommendation of Mr. Friendly, with whom he ſhook hands, and ſeemed very happy at ſeeing them.</p>
               <p>"You are come, (cried he) at a very right time, boy, to celebrate my daughter's nuptials."</p>
               <p>"Your daughter's," echoed the aſtoniſhed Friendly—"Pray, Sir, may I inquire who is to be the happy man?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, I know you would be ſurpriſed—Faith, the matter is ſomewhat ſudden, I confeſs; but that's my way—I do things at once—You muſt know, Sir, I happened to be in company yeſterday with an elderly gentleman (for ſuch has been always my fixed determination to make a ſon-in-law) and very luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, Sir, this gentleman wanted a wife; for he had a wild unthinking youth of a ſon, who has thwarted his inclinations, and upon being rebuked, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe boy has left him. Mr. Sturdy is conſequently provoked to marry, and this day is appointed for the wedding"</p>
               <p>"But, Sir, is not this buſineſs too ſudden? Do you think, Mr. Sturdy can love the young lady ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to render him worthy of her hand? Beſides, are you ſure the match is perfectly agreeable to your daughter?"</p>
               <p>The old man ridiculed all theſe idle notions, as he called them—he confeſſed, indeed, that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, upon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Friendly was exceedingly hurt at this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and under pretence of giving orders to the workmen he had brought, haſtened immediately to his friend, and communicated the dreadful reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were now in agitation.</p>
               <p>William was equally ſurpriſed to hear that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was his rival, and it being dangerous to loſe

time, reſolved, by ſome means or other, to convey a letter to his dear Delia, and acquaint her what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he was about taking for her ſpeedy delivery. As his ſituation gave him many opportunities of converſing with the ſervants, he diſcovered that Ralph had frequent acceſs to his young miſtreſs, in order to bring her neceſſary refreſhments. William therefore ſeized a convenient time of ſpeaking to Ralph, and ſeeing him paſſing the meadows in a great hurry, inquired the cauſe.</p>
               <p>"I have got," ſays he, "a letter for my maſter, from Mr. Sturdy—he is coming anon—and the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cloaths for my young miſtreſs—I am to bring them to her."</p>
               <p>This was ſufficient; he then requeſted he would deliver her a letter, which had been left with him, for her. Ralph ſtared—wondering how he came by it, and from whom it was. William cunningly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a young flaſhy fellow had aſſured him, that whoever gave it to Miſs, unknown to her father, ſhould have fifty pounds in the evening.</p>
               <p>"Fifty pounds!" cried Ralph, "O dear, I'll give it to her with her cloaths."</p>
               <p>"Very well then," cried William, "I ſhall tell the gentleman who it was did him the favour; for my part, I don't like running hazards—I don't mind fifty pounds."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! O, then I do—I will live no longer with Mr. Violent; he knocked me down yeſterday in his paſſion—fifty pounds will render me very comfortable—yes, yes."</p>
               <p>Ralph took the letter with great pleaſure, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon to take the purſe; but as he could not read, and fearful of making a fatal miſtake, on account of Mr. Sturdy's letter, which he was to give imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his maſter, he put one into the right poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and another into the left; for being thus ſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, he could tell which is which.</p>
               <p>It happened now that a neighbour's child, for
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032623_0198_0FF3F349F5E45360"/>
whom he had promiſed to buy a halfpenny worth of apples, met him, and demanded the boon. Ralph, mindful of the promiſe, gave him two; but the little boy would not be perſuaded that he had no more, and cunningly inſiſted on ſearching his pockets. Ralph, who was almoſt as great a <hi>child</hi> as the other, granted permiſſion; ſo dragging his handkerchief and letter out of his right hand pocket, and taking the other and his gloves from the left hand, he gave the little rogue the full ſatisfaction he required, and ſoon convinced him of their emptineſs.</p>
               <p>Ralph put up his things again, but unfortunately, reſtored the letters to their wrong ſtations; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence was, that, upon his maſter's appearing, and demanding what anſwer Mr. Sturdy had ſent, he gave him the letter directed for his daughter.</p>
               <p>The impatient father made no ſcruple of opening it, and, to his great aſtoniſhment, made the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovery:

               <p>Mr. Violent did not tarry to aſk any queſtions now, but knocking down Ralph, ſnatched the key and other letter from him, and away flew to the old gentleman whom he intended for his daughter, to acquaint him with the deſigns of his ſon.</p>
               <p>The loud lamentations of Ralph, who fancied that his brains were beaten out, occaſioned the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032623_0199_0FF3F40E8F8C7800"/>
of William, for being on the watch, he was alarmed by every noiſe he heard; Ralph ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him in the moſt doleful manner of the miſtake he had committed, and the ill treatment he had received. William, though inwardly grieved, pretended the greateſt indifference about the matter, declaring that it was his intention to throw the letter away, for he would have nothing to ſay to it; he would not for an hundred pounds give offence to his <hi>good</hi> maſter. This diſaſter was ſoon revealed to Friendly, who ſeemed to apprehend ſome dreadful conſequences; he was happy, however, that the perſon of William was ſtill unknown, but feared much that the father and ſon would meet, and a fatal diſcovery take place; they reſolved, however, to keep their ground, and leave no ſtratagem untried, which might afford ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The two old gentlemen, in the mean time, were conſulting together. Old Sturdy was very much chagrined at his ſon's preſumption, imagining that William had profeſſed this attachment to Delia, merely for the ſake of fruſtrating his intentions; the old man was therefore ſtimulated the more to effect his purpoſe; his reſentment againſt William became greater, and his inclination to marry this young lady, ſtronger; for fear, however, that his ſon might baffle his deſign, he reſolved to watch for him at a diſtance, and by means of two truſty men that ſhould be diſguiſed as conſtables, have him ſecured—as it were, falſely arreſted, till the wedding was over, and all his art in vain.</p>
               <p>Two men were accordingly provided, while Mr. Violent haſtened home, in order to interrogate Ralph, and further ſecure his daughter, till he went for the chaplain.</p>
               <p>It happened now that Mrs. Friendly was ſtraying about the meadow in William's clothes; ſhe had juſt met Ralph, and was inquiring of him what was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; ſhe offered him ſome money, if he would
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032623_0200_0FF3F34E693149C0"/>
introduce her to his young miſtreſs, and was very curious, in reſpect to her huſband.</p>
               <p>Ralph, apprehenſive of his maſter's approach, and being knocked down again, evaded all explanation, and refuſed the money. Old Sturdy perceiving them together at a diſtance, and fancying it to be his ſon, on account of the dreſs, for he did not ſee her face, gave the ſignal, and the men whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeized Mrs. Friendly, and, in ſpite of all her reſiſtance, forced her away.</p>
               <p>Old Sturdy having inquired of Ralph the purport of their diſcourſe together, was perfectly ſatisfied that his conjectures were juſt, being told that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed rival wanted an interview with Delia.</p>
               <p>Ralph was immediately diſpatched, to inform his maſter of the ſucceſs of this arreſt, and requeſting him to provide the chaplain as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The poor timid ſervant ſtood at a reſpectful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, while informing his impetuous maſter of all this, and being aſſured by him, not only of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but likewiſe, a handſome gratuity, which had <hi>greater</hi> weight, he made a very candid confeſſion, that, for the ſake of fifty pounds from a fine flaſhy gentleman, which the reaper would not accept of, he meant to deliver that letter to his young miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>"How," exclaimed Mr. Violent, "and would not the reaper accept it?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, not double the ſum; he ſaid, he would not offend ſo good a maſter."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman delighted at ſo much ſeeming honeſty, deſired Ralph to go for him. William was accordingly conducted to his preſence, apprehenſive of ſome new diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Mr. Violent expatiated much upon his integrity and honor, and told him, he intended now to make a trial of his merit, which he would accordingly reward—"I am obliged, ſays he, to go as far as our vicar's reſidence, but fearful that my daughter, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my abſence may eſcape, for Ralph, I find, is

treacherous and frail, I entruſt the key of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to you (my honeſt fellow) and commiſſion you to deliver this bundle (which contains her wedding clothes) that ſhe may be dreſt for the occaſion."</p>
               <p>William readily accepted of this valuable key, which contained ſo great a treaſure, promiſing all due obedience to his maſter's commands, while, in return, the old gentleman aſſured him of an ample compenſation; and finding William not ſo mean in education, as he ſeemed to be in ſituation, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with old Sturdy's reſolution of making his ſon a temporary priſoner, till the wedding was over—Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>liam was thunder-ſtruck to think his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was capable of ſuch mean devices.</p>
               <p>"And pray, Sir," cried he, "is he looking for him now?"</p>
               <p>"Poh! he has found him out."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, and he is now ſecure—the plot is executed —he is in the cuſtody of two knowing fellows, who, when they hear from us again, are to pretend great ſorrow for their miſtake, and offer him a purſe (which my friend has given to them on purpoſe, and which, he thinks, will be very acceptable to his ſon) by the way of making it up.</p>
               <p>William was now more ſurpriſed than before, wondering within himſelf who could be his repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, but this being no time for conſideration, he gave vent to other thoughts that were now of greater conſequence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Violent rejoiced that he had ſo cunningly deprived his daughter of all poſſible means of ſeeing William, or making her eſcape, went for the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. William ſought his friend, and briefly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the jeſt—they flew to the place of Delia's captivity: William entered firſt, while the weeping fair, expecting the approach of ſome hard-hearted meſſenger, or, what was ſtill more diſagreeable, the ſight of her odious intended, turned away her face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

but the well known voice of her beloved William, ſoon diſpelled all her fears, and enlivened thoſe charms which deſpair had before deadened; joyfully ſhe accepted the hand of William, who now, by the generous aſſiſtance of Friendly, conveyed her far away, and was made happy by the poſſeſſion of his fair.</p>
               <p>Lucinda, however, experienced much uneaſineſs, being ſtill retained in confinement for William; ſhe had written a letter to Dorcas her <hi>good-natured</hi> friend, who obſerved, in writing, that ſhe was ſurpriſed Mrs. Friendly could ſend to her, having acted ſuch an <hi>indecent</hi> part.

               <p>The old men, by this time, had met, and, to their great ſorrow, diſcovered the bird had flown.

               <head>The Hypochondriac, or Force of Imagination. A PLEASANT STORY.</head>
               <p>MR Whimſical had one only child, Clarinda, whoſe affection for her father had made her ſolemnly vow that ſhe would never marry till he was cured of thoſe ſtrange and unaccountable hips, to which, ſince the death of her mother, he had been conſtantly addicted. Deſmond had paid his addreſſes to her, but in vain; he therefore ſolicited permiſſion to be admitted among the number of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when he would exert all in his power to recover her unfortunate father from his capricious humours. This requeſt was not only readily complied with, but gratefully acknowledged as a kindneſs; indeed, Deſmond's aſſiduity almoſt ſecured him the affection of Clarinda; ſhe felt a ſtrong partiality for him, on account of his tenderneſs to Mr. Whimſical.</p>
               <p>The manners of Mr. Whimſical, were extremely fantaſtical: he has frequently fancied himſelf in a ſtate of lunacy, and requeſted every attendant to ſtand at a reſpectful diſtance, for fear he might bite them. Deſmond, who for the ſake of Clarinda, had undertaken his cure, reſolved to feed his humours, in hopes of giving him a ſurfeit; he, therefore, put on a ſtraight waiſtcoat, and, by uſing ſeverity, ſoon recovered his patient from his frenzy fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Whimſical now imagined himſelf in danger of a putrid fever, and would not be perſuaded but that his hands had a moſt offenſive ſmell. Deſmond encouraged the idea, for he was always admitted as the phyſician, and ordered him ſuch diſagreeable potions, that Mr. Whimſical was afterwards very willing to think himſelf ſafe man.</p>
               <p>Once, indeed, having diſcovered an inſect in a baſon of water which he was drinking, he imagined himſelf full of worms; ſo great was the force of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, that he felt them, he declared, working
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032623_0204_0FF3F3568C197920"/>
within; this led him, at laſt, to ſuppoſe himſelf poſſeſt, and nothing would perſuade him, but that he had now an evil ſpirit tormenting him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Deſmond forced him to drink large draughts of chamomile tea, till he became ſo weary and weak with continual exerciſe, as to believe himſelf delivered —but the young gentleman, thinking proper to puniſh him for thoſe ill-timed fancies, in order to prevent their return, inſiſted that he was as bad as ever, and compelled him to drink more. In ſhort, he ſo diſguſted him of this ſuppoſition, that Mr. Whimſical was never troubled with an <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Another time, he fancied that he had loſt his noſe, and made great lamentations for his ſuppoſed mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; but Deſmond very ſpeedily reſtored this feature, by giving it ſuch a terrible pull as made him feel that it was really there.</p>
               <p>This, however, was the occaſion of another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fancy; for he now thought his noſe ſo exceedingly long, that, though his friends were ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral yards diſtance, he apprehended they would hurt it. "Take care of my noſe," he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually cry to every perſon that was at arms length —"You'll hurt my noſe," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Tho' this ſeemed to be no eaſy misfortune to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, yet Deſmond, by his uſual dexterity, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him of its real length, by tying an handkerchief round his face, which reduced his noſe to a proper ſize.</p>
               <p>Mr. Whimſical, at laſt, became ſo very ridiculous, as to imagine himſelf inanimate—He was ſometimes a tea-pot, and putting one arm a-kimbo, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another out, he ſaid that was the <hi>handle,</hi> and this was the <hi>ſpout,</hi> deſiring the ſpectator to <hi>fill him out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deſmond, being apprized of this ſtrange notion upon entering the room, taxed the ſervant for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his preſence that abominable old-faſhioned tea-pot, which he had ordered to be thrown away;
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032623_0205_0FF3F358B72A96D0"/>
then throwing Mr. Whimſical down, the tea-pot was ſuppoſed to be broken in pieces.</p>
               <p>This fall, however, was productive of another vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious conſequence, for Mr. Whimſical now conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf dead. Deſmond was reſolved, however, to indulge the idea, and, by this great attempt, cure him, if poſſible, of his ſtrange ideas.</p>
               <p>He was accordingly ſtretched out, and made wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all thoſe friends who came to mourn his untimely departure. According to their inſtructions, they abuſed his memory, ſlandered his name, and provoked poor Whimſical ſo much, that he wiſhed he was alive again to retaliate theſe inſults.</p>
               <p>He was now left alone, as he thought, but Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond remained liſtening; he began fervently to pray, when an hollow voice, which proceeded from Deſmond behind the curtain, thus anſwered him—</p>
               <p>"If you will promiſe to ſubmit to the counſel and directions of your daughter, thou ſhalt again be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to her, for thou art not dead, but in a trance; if, however, thou refuſeſt obſtinately to be guided by her, and your friends, the conſequence is, that thou ſhalt be buried alive."</p>
               <p>Whimſical liſtened, but made no reply; he was therefore put into a coffin, but while they were ſcrewing him down, he roared out moſt vociferouſly that he was alive, and prayed them not to bury him ſo. It was ſome time before they would take notice —at laſt, Deſmond took him out, declaring that he was a new man, quite young and handſome, which Mr. Whimſical conceiting, became ſo exceedingly briſk and merry, that every ailment was at an end.</p>
               <p>Clarinda now rewarded the kind attention of Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond with her hand. Whimſical danced at their wedding, and fancied himſelf ſo very hale and young, that he lived, until he <hi>really died.</hi>

               <head>CHARLES and MARIA. A INTERESTING TALE.</head>
               <p>CHARLES and Maria were the ſon and daughter of reſpectable tradeſmen in London, who, early in life teſtified the ſtrongeſt marks of affection for each other, which was both diſcovered and approved by each fond parent; it being long their mutual wiſh that their children ſhould be united. When Charles attained his eighth year, he was ſent to a boarding ſchool near the city; and Maria, likewiſe, was promiſed by her father a good education, in order to render her worthy of her huſband, partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly the ſon of his old friend, whoſe fortune was far ſuperior to his; for Good will had been much more fortunate in reſpect to trade than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The two friends, however, were ſo ſtrongly attached to each other, that no mean views of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt could poſſibly divide their friendſhip; in fact, Goodwill and Frankly were, what indeed is very ſeldom ſeen now-a-days, true and ſincere compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions.</p>
               <p>Goodwill, the father of Maria, had all his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty ſecure in England, therefore no change was likely to take place; but Mr. Frankly had moſt of his in merchandize abroad, and daily heard of an increaſe which gave him infinite pleaſure; for, like a prudent father, he wiſhed much to raiſe his ſon above the frowns of humble dependence. Charles improved ſo rapidly under the care of his preceptor, that it was now time to think for what profeſſion he was moſt ſuitable. Mrs. Frankly was for the church, Mr. Frankly for the law, but Charles himſelf for the army. A red coat has charms in it ſo irreſiſtible, that many young men put on their royal maſter's livery without poſſeſſing the qualifications which it requires; however, to do our young hero juſtice, he was more induced to wear it through the noble
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032623_0207_0FF3F35D1F854A48"/>
impulſes of honor and courage, than vanity or arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</p>
               <p>His father, always ready to comply with his wiſhes, purchaſed a commiſſion in the army. Few young men looked better, or did more honor to regimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals than our bold hero. His firſt viſit he paid to Maria, who thought ſhe never ſaw him look more to advantage. This young lady was now become the admiration of all, and the idol of her parents: ſhe was generous, amiable, and unreſerved. The parents began to think it full time that they were married; nor were the parties themſelves at all unwilling—each having exchanged their pictures to prove the originals were entirely theirs. The preparations for the wedding were now made, which were elegant without being extravagant—The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day arrives—They are married. For ſome time they lived in a ſtate of envied bliſs and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed happineſs. But Fortune, ſeemingly jealous of <hi>long</hi> pleaſures to young couples, generally mixes a little bitters with their ſweets. A young lady it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened had ſeen Charles ſeveral times, and being in love with him, took every opportunity of throwing herſelf in his way, not knowing he was married. Charles ſaw her—he danced with her at a public aſſembly, and, without any deſign on his part, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſeeing the lady home—She readily complied, and fancied ſhe had got him in her chains. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to ſup with her, and, being bountiful in her wine, not only rendered him forgetful of his Maria, but abſolutely provoked him, in fits of rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody, to make love to her; this to a lady who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be the caſt-off miſtreſs of Lord M—, was by no means diſagreeable—ſhe encouraged his profeſſions, which now became extravagant. Charles was, indeed, the firſt man who had ever raiſed a true flame in her breaſt, and ſhe was reſolved the bird ſhould not readily fly away from her cage; ſhe ſuffered him to take many liberties, and being a fine woman, Charles was by no means ſhy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:032623_0208_0FF3F35F566D68C8"/>Maria, unaccuſtomed to her huſband's abſence, became very uneaſy; but how great was her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and agitation, to find his future viſits at home very ſeldom, and then rather diſagreeable. This ſtrange alteration cauſed much uneaſineſs—however, ſhe never upbraided him, but, apprehenſive that ſomething in her behaviour to him was the occaſion, became doubly attentive—Aſſiduity ſhe hoped would regain his affection; but ah! ſhe was miſtaken: one morning he came home after a week's abſence, and told her he was going to the country for a month; he appeared more dull than uſual. Maria, for the firſt time, inquired the cauſe, but he anſwered her both cruelly and peeviſhly; ſhe heaved a ſigh, and was ſilent—he rang the bell, ordered his horſes, and left the once dear partner of his life to her own bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflections. Some ſhort time after his abſence ſhe was taken ill, and delivered of a fine boy—ſhe hourly prayed for her Charles's return, and now endeavoured to live for the ſake of her dear cherub; ſhe never once made a complaint to her parents, but they ſoon became acquainted with the cauſe of her malady. Charles was all this time with his new miſtreſs, beſtowing on her that love and attention which were the ſole right of his worthy wife. Maria was now, through fatigue of body and mind, in a high fever, while her mother, who had never left her ſince her illneſs, ſent for the moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced phyſicians; they all pronounced her death inevitable—ſhe became delirious, and continually called upon Charles to help her. It happened now that the vile cauſe of all this uneaſineſs finding Maria's picture with Charles, became apprehenſive of a rival; ſhe ſought with care the original, and, by theſe means was diſcovered by Mr. Frankly, who, underſtanding where his ſon-in-law was, conveyed him an account of Maria's ſituation: the awakened huſband returned home with eagerneſs, and ſeeing the ſad ſituation of his Maria, his affection returned
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032623_0209_0FF3F360DF18E830"/>
with double force—he fell on his knees, implored her forgiveneſs, frankly communicated all the wrongs he had done her, but aſſured her that he loved her better now than ever. Maria's happineſs returned, and what unavailing medicine could not accompliſh, all powerful love began to effect—Maria was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her huſband—Charles was reſtored to his wife; and now, for mutual love and happineſs, they became the admiration of all their neighbours.</p>
               <p>Charles wrote to his miſtreſs the next day, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her a bank-bill, which he begged her to accept inſtead of himſelf, and which, as her wiſhes were already gratified, and the remainder of her love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the account of his marriage, was, at preſent, far more acceptable.</p>

               <head>MEMOIRS Of CHRISTIAN JACOBSEN DRAKENBERG.</head>
               <p>CHRISTIAN Jacobſen Drakenberg was a boat-ſwain in the Daniſh army; he was born in the year 1626 (the month unknown) and died the 24th of June, 1770. Hiſtorians have not been very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in reſpect to his manners or life; it appears, therefore, that this veteran was more remarkable for longevity than for any peculiarity or heroiſm; it is, however, acknowledged that he was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly facetious and entertaining—his company was courted by many country gentlemen, for the ſake of hearing him relate ſome pleaſant ſtories When he arrived to the age of 139, he was conſtantly ſeen at Denmark, where he uſed to walk about, with all the vigour and ſpirit of youth, and, by means of his pleaſantry and good-nature, afforded great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>As the early part of his youth had been ſpent in
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032623_0210_0FF3F36319E26760"/>
the Britiſh ſervice, on board the navy, in Queen Anne's wars, he was, of courſe, deemed ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced man, and ſo capable of deciding matters of ambiguity, that, whenever any doubts aroſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning paſt times, he was always referred to, in order to make them clear; he was generally arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator in all points of difficulty, and whenever wagers were laid about the dates of any former tranſactions, Drakenberg was the man who was always appointed judge.</p>
               <p>Even in the latter part of his life, this man was renowned for the amazing ſtrength of his faculties: he retained his memory ſo wonderfully towards the moſt advanced period of his life, that he never was known to forget <hi>his jokes,</hi> or relate a ſtory twice to the ſame perſon. His narratives chiefly conſiſted of the <hi>whimſical</hi> and <hi>marvell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Drakenberg lived exceedingly temperate—he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from an exceſs of liquor, but now and then would take a wholeſome glaſs. Dainties he never deſired, and a plain diſh was the utmoſt of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this moderation was doubtleſs the cauſe of his longevity; he uſed continual exerciſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred walking to riding.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter part of his life, when his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance would ſeem to envy the length of his days, and wiſh that they might ſee as many, he would often ſhake his head, and make this reply—</p>

I have buried my moſt dear relations; and all thoſe endearing connections which I had formed in my youth, are now no more—they are diſſolved by death! The remembrance is ſomewhat painful—I am aſtoniſhed then to hear how any one can deſire to witneſs the diſſolution of their friends, the end of all their deareſt relations."</p>
               <p>Drakenberg, like the generality of men, who are renowned for long-dated lives, died ſuddenly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much pain; the candle of his days ſhone bright, while it laſted; it avoided thoſe many puffs which generally extinguiſh others, before they are advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſocket—it periſhed of itſelf!

               <head>The Abſent Man. A TRUE AND COMIC CHARACTER.</head>
               <p>MR. Thoughtful, having devoted his early days to ſtudy, became literally ſo wrapt up with his ideas as to be frequently inſenſible of what was ſaid or doing. His anſwers have been often incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and ſtrange; his actions equally wonderful and
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032623_0212_0FF3F3677555A408"/>
unaccountable. His father ſoon repented of having left him ſo long at college; or ſuffered him, when young, to apply his mind inceſſantly to learning: for, that
<q>A <hi>little</hi> knowledge is a dangerous thing,"</q>
is the aſſertion of a much-admired poet, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently exhorts all votaries to learning,
<q>To drink deep, or taſte not the Pierian ſpring."</q>
But here is a ſad proof that a man may drink <hi>too</hi> deep, or indeed <hi>ſo</hi> deep as to intoxicate his brain, and become as ſtupid and diſagreeable as one who is totally ignorant.</p>
               <p>The father was now determined to provide a wife for his ſon—in hopes that a woman might rouze him from his lethargy—might awaken him from this profound ſtupor; and by amuſing his perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, give him ſome life and animation.</p>
               <p>The father, according to his deſign, having fixed his eye upon a young lady in the neighbourhood, watched an opportunity of hinting the matter to his ſon.</p>
               <p>Young Thoughtful, who had been now ſent by the houſekeeper to deſire to know how his father wiſhed the gooſe to be dreſt—appeared in a very muſing poſture:</p>
               <p>"I am come," ſays the ſon, "to aſk you—" here he pauſed, and began to think on what he had come about.</p>
               <p>"I find," cried his father, "that I muſt provide ſomebody to ſharpen your memory—what think you of a wife, Charles? Perhaps ſhe may quicken your recollection."</p>
               <p>"A wife! A woman!"—</p>
               <p>"Aye, a fine young girl."</p>
               <p>"Otway, I think, was divided in <hi>his</hi> opinion;— in one of his plays he ſays 'We would be brutes without her;'—in another, he calls her 'the fountain

of all human frailty;'—for my part I muſt agree with Solon"—</p>
               <p>"Plague on Solon, he is not <hi>my</hi> ſon; I want to know if a wife is agreeable—now tell me immediately —what do you ſay? A wife is a good diſh, boy, for your nice appetites—you are not afraid of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, hey!—ſure it would be impoſſible for any woman to make a gooſe of ſuch a ſober, wiſe, young man."</p>
               <p>"A gooſe—" the ſon recollected the dinner, and begged to know how he wiſhed it to be dreſt.</p>
               <p>This being foreign to the ſubject, provoked the father, and he anſwered him both peeviſhly and harſhly—"with ſage and onions." He then reſumed his ſubject, and with ſome difficulty procured his acquieſcence. The old man was highly delighted with having ſo far ſucceeded, and gave him a twenty pound bill to buy clothes for the occaſion—recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a ſuit of white and ſilver, it being, in his opinion, the fitteſt to celebrate a wedding, and the moſt becoming for a bridegroom.</p>
               <p>"But," exclaimed the father, "how would you wiſh to be dreſſed?"</p>
               <p>The ſon ſtarted—looked fooliſh—coughed—and cried "eh!"</p>
               <p>"How would you wiſh to dreſſed?"</p>
               <p>A long pauſe now. At laſt, the ſon echoing "dreſſed," and the father anſwering "yes," he replied, "Oh, father, as you do—as you do, father —<hi>with ſage and onions.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The old gentleman was exaſperated at this reply, and was obliged to repeat all he had ſaid before, for the better comprehenſion of his ſon. At laſt, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he thought, recovered his recollection, he now left him in a greater labyrinth than ever.</p>
               <p>When alone, the wife entered into his head, and ſeemed to afford him ſome temporary pleaſure. He intended to go and ſee her. The houſe-keeper met him, and begged to know how the gooſe was to be dreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:032623_0214_0FF3F36B2C57E5F0"/>"Dreſſed, Oh, in white and, ſilver; that's my father's wiſh."</p>
               <p>He now went out, but forgetting his hat, was obliged to return; then anxious to ſee a friend of his, who was a ſtudent at Cambridge; he wrote a few lines—folded up the letter to put in the Poſt Office, but forgot to ſeal it.—Then thinking of his miſtreſs, he directed the letter to her, inſtead of his friend. Away he goes—firſt directing his ſteps to the Poſt Office, and when half way—turning back to ſee his miſtreſs—then backwards and forwards;— once indeed he went a mile beyond his miſtreſs's houſe;—then returning in a great hurry, forgot to ſtop where ſhe lived. At laſt he reached the Poſt Office, merely by chance—the letter box reminded him of his intention; but inſtead of throwing in the letter, he threw in the twenty pound bill, which was to purchaſe him clothes; then bending his courſe again to his miſtreſs's houſe, he was ſtopped by a beggar woman, who craved charity; the young man ſtopped too, and informed her it was <hi>paſt two o'clock</hi>: thus he ran about, without anſwering any purpoſe, or doing the leaſt good.</p>
               <p>By means of the father, indeed, the marriage took place; yet, the bridegroom was ſo abſent, that he made a very <hi>mal-à-propos</hi> reply to the chaplain, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ceremony They all came home to Mr. Thoughtful's houſe: the old gentleman gave up his chamber to the bride and bridegroom, but the young gentleman forgetting this, happened unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to go to his own bed, and the poor bride was entirely forſaken. The father brought his abſent ſon to a recollection of his duty; he aroſe and dreſſed himſelf; but forgetting the moſt material part of his covering, made ſuch an awkward appearance before his fair one, as ſhocked her not a little.</p>
               <p>We are not at liberty to proceed in the miſtakes of this abſent man. Suffice it to ſay, that his wife in due time recalled his recollection, and young Thoughtful became more conſiſtent.</p>

               <head>Singular Memoirs of PAT. O'CONNOR, An Iriſh Footman, during his ſervice with an Engliſh Gentleman.</head>
               <p>PAT. O'Connor, who never boaſted of his family, as they had been all buried in obſcurity, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing experienced the many heart-achs of being out of employ, and ſometimes the many belly-fulls of being in a good ſervice, after this round of ups and downs, at laſt engaged himſelf with an Engliſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman at Cork, who was now about leaving Ireland. The thoughts of quitting the dear land of ſaints, operated very much upon the heart of our hero, and ſorrow becoming dry, he applied himſelf frequently to a good glaſs of whiſkey, which ſhortly removed his grief.</p>
               <p>The day for departure came—Pat. took leave of his friends and country; while his conjectares on his new maſter engaged his preſent thoughts.</p>
               <p>He ſoon became acquainted with London, as well as the intrigues and roguery of his employer, who having been the ſon of a late reſpectable citizen, thought he could never ſpend a ſmall ſum that had been left him too ſoon or too extravagantly.</p>
               <p>A young lady near Windſor having attracted his notice, he was reſolved, in his general phraſe, to <hi>have her,</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe had already teſtified her diſapprobation of his addreſſes, as well as her diſlike to his perſon: this, however, inſtead of diſcouraging, provoked our volatile youth, to meditate a deſign of ruining her; for, though his partiality for ladies was great, yet marriage ſeldom entered his head.</p>
               <p>Her uncle, with whom ſhe lived, being a ſtrange character, that received the company of every one who boaſted of his parentage and lineage, he deemed it an eaſy taſk to ingratiate himſelf in his favor; to accompliſh this, however, he dared not acknowledge himſelf the ſon of a citizen, as that would totally
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032623_0216_0FF3F36EF20C60C0"/>
mar his deſigns, and defeat his purpoſe with the old gentleman—He was therefore reſolved to dreſs up Pat. O'Connor in great ſtyle, and introduce him as an Iriſh baronet, being his ſuppoſed uncle, whom he intended to inſtruct, and enable to puff off his unknown family. The project delighted poor Pat. who was highly pleaſed with the thoughts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a gentleman. He promiſed to expatiate upon the excellence of his birth, and inform this uncle of the large eſtate which he would give him. The day was accordingly fixed—an appointment made with Mr. Primſtiff, and Pat. was introduced as a man of conſequence and fortune.</p>
               <p>The mock hero now ſtrutted about with aſſumed ſtate and airs—the old gentleman, on account of his ſuppoſed rank, received him with the greateſt cordiality, and begged to know who the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's father was.</p>
               <p>"Why, my brother," cries Pat. "my brother, do you ſee—was a very good ſort of a gentleman, but not altogether ſo handſome as I." "And, pray, Sir, what fortune do you intend to give your nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew?"</p>
               <p>"What fortune—why faith and troth, honey, its hard for me to ſay, when I don't know the extent of it myſelf."</p>
               <p>"Is it in lands, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"Lands—O, aye—its in the <hi>Coomb</hi>—the <hi>Pottlehole</hi> —I'll give him a bit of the <hi>Liberty</hi>—a ſcrap or two of <hi>Meath-ſtreet</hi>—a few yards of <hi>Donnybrook,</hi> and—"</p>
               <p>"Why, Sir, I never heard of ſuch eſtates."</p>
               <p>"No—then you were never in ſweet Dublin."</p>
               <p>"I have heard many expatiate upon its beauties; indeed, from the traveller's account, one may be apt to think it was the promiſed land, that overflowed with milk and honey."</p>
               <p>"Milk and honey!" exclaims Pat. "O, honey, O! that's a ſingular union indeed—why you mean <hi>milk and potatoes,</hi> you fool!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:032623_0217_0FF3F3707ACCAC60"/>The familiarity of names did not agree with the family pride of the old gentleman; of courſe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel enſued; Pat. ſwearing by St. Patrick he was as good as he; and, in order to prove it, called out for his maſter.</p>
               <p>The ſound of <hi>maſter</hi> alarmed the old gentleman, but it did not in the leaſt confound Pat. who recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf, put it off with—"Why, aye, did not I tell you I would make him maſter of the <hi>Coomb</hi> and <hi>Pottlehole?</hi>"</p>
               <p>The maſter appeared, and as his ſervant was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally going beyond bounds, he applied a ſly pinch in order to remind him of his duty—Pat. gave a ſudden roar, and ſwore in a terrible manner, if he did that again he would divulge all.</p>
               <p>"All what?" cries the uncle.</p>
               <p>"Why, what's that to you?" rejoins Pat. "Muſt you know every thing, you old rogue?"</p>
               <p>"Rogue!—Sir, conſider my family—"</p>
               <p>It was with the greateſt difficulty the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman could reſtore peace and harmony, which at laſt he did, by aſſuring him that in his country, Rogue was an appellation of honor.</p>
               <p>"O yes," exclaims Pat. "we gentlemen are all rogues—but ſearch the world through, there are not more honeſt rogues than the ſons of Tipperary."</p>
               <p>The laſt ſcheme was to deceive the young lady— Pat. was informed that he muſt perſonate a chaplain, in order to give a mock ceremony, that Miſs might be deluded by a ſuppoſed private marriage. Our Iriſh hero was left alone to conſider, and ſeeing the young lady at a diſtance, flew to meet her, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the whole deſign.</p>
               <p>"He wants to make a gentleman in black of me, honey, but may the black gentleman ſeize me, if I wrong ſo much innocence.—"</p>
               <p>By this honeſt confeſſion, the young lady's honor was preſerved—in token of her gratitude ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her guardian uncle to take Pat. (who was

               <head>Diſtreſſes of a <hi>Modeſt</hi> Man.</head>
               <p>I Labor under a ſpecies of diſtreſs, which I fear will at length drive me utterly from that ſociety, in which I am moſt ambitious to appear; but I will give you a ſhort ſketch of my origin and preſent ſituation, by which you will be enabled to judge of my difficulties.</p>
               <p>My father was a farmer of no great property, and with no other learning than what he had acquired at a charity-ſchool; but my mother being dead, and I an only child, he determined to give me that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which he fancied would have made him happy, viz. a learned education. I was ſent to a country grammar ſchool, and from thence to the Univerſity, with a view of qualifying for holy orders. Here, having but a ſmall allowance from my father, and being naturally of a timid and baſhful diſpoſition, I had no opportunity of rubbing off that native awkwardneſs, which is the fatal cauſe of all my unhappineſs, and which I begin now to fear can never be amended. You muſt know, that in my perſon I am tall and thin, with a fair complexion, and light flaxen hair; but of ſuch extreme ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibility of ſhame, that on the ſmalleſt ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, my blood all ruſhes into my cheeks, and I appear a perfect full blown roſe. The conſciouſneſs of this unhappy failing, made me avoid ſociety, and I became enamored of a college life: particularly when I reflected, that the uncouth manners of my father's family, were little calculated to improve my outward conduct: I therefore had reſolved on living at the univerſity and taking pupils, when two unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032623_0219_0FF3F37590A1A508"/>
events greatly altered the poſture of my affairs, viz. my father's death and the arrival of my uncle from the Indies.</p>
               <p>This uncle I had very rarely heard my father mention, and it was generally believed that he was long ſince dead, when he arrived in England only a week too late to cloſe his brother's eyes. I am aſhamed to confeſs, what I believe has been often experienced by thoſe, whoſe education has been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than their parents, that my poor father's ignorance, and vulgar language, had often made me bluſh to think I was his ſon: and at his death I was not inconſolable for the loſs of that, which I was not unfrequently aſhamed to own. My uncle was but little affected, for he had been ſeparated from his brother more than thirty years, and in that time he had acquired a fortune which he uſed to brag would make a nabob happy; in ſhort, he had brought over with him the enormous ſum of thirty thouſand pounds, and upon this he built his hopes of never-ending happineſs. While he was planning ſchemes of greatneſs and delight, whether the change of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate might affect him, or what other cauſe I know not, but he was ſnatched from his dreams of joy, by a ſhort illneſs, of which he died, leaving me heir of all his property. And now, behold me at the age of twenty-five, well ſtocked with Latin, Greek, and Mathematics, poſſeſſed of an ample fortune, but ſo awkward and unverſed in every gentleman-like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, that I am pointed at by all who ſee me, as the wealthy learned clown.</p>
               <p>I have lately purchaſed an eſtate in the country, which abounds in (what is called) a faſhionable neighbourhood; and when you reflect on my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage and uncouth manners, you will hardly think how much my company is courted by the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing families, (eſpecially by thoſe who have marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able daughters;) from theſe gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived familiar calls, and the moſt preſſing invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032623_0220_0FF3F37718024168"/>
and though I wiſhed to accept of their offered friendſhip, I have repeatedly excuſed myſelf under the pretence of not being quite ſettled; for the truth is, that when I rode or walked with full intent to return their ſeveral viſits, my heart has failed me as I approached their gates, and I have frequently returned homeward, reſolving to try again to-morrow.</p>
               <p>However, I at length determined to conquer my timidity, and three days ago accepted an invitation to dine this day with one whoſe open, eaſy manner left me no room to doubt of a cordial welcome. Sir Thomas Friendly who lives about two miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, is a baronet, with about two thouſand pounds a year eſtate, joining that I purchaſed; he has two ſons and five daughters all grown up, and living with their mother and a maiden ſiſter of Sir Thomas's, at Friendly-hall, dependent on their father. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of my unpoliſhed gait, I have for ſome time paſt taken private leſſons of a profeſſor, who teaches <hi>grown gentlemen to dance</hi>; and though I at firſt found wonderous difficulty in the art he taught, my knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the mathematics was of prodigious uſe, in teaching me the equilibrium of my body, and the due adjuſtment of the centre of gravity to the five poſitions. Having now acquired the art of walking without tottering, and learned to make a bow, I boldly ventured to obey the baronet's invitation to a family dinner, not doubting but my new acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would enable me to ſee the ladies with tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intrepidity: but alas! how vain are all the hopes of theory, when unſupported by habitual practice: As I approached the houſe, a dinner-bell alarmed my fears, leſt I had ſpoiled the dinner by want of punctuality. Impreſſed with this idea, I bluſhed the deepeſt crimſon, as my name was repeat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dly announced by the ſeveral livery ſervants who uſhered me into the library, hardly knowing what or whom I ſaw; at my firſt entrance, I ſummoned all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and made my new-learned bow to Lady
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032623_0221_0FF3F37956B779B8"/>
Friendly: but unfortunately in bringing back my left foot to the third poſition, I trod upon the gouty toe of Sir Thomas, who had followed cloſe at my heels, to be the nomenclator of the family. The confuſion this occaſioned in me is hardly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſince none but baſhful men can judge of my diſtreſs, and of that deſcription, the number I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is very ſmall. The baronet's politeneſs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees diſſipated my concern; and I was aſtoniſhed to ſee how far good breeding could enable him to ſuppreſs his feelings, and to appear with perfect caſe after ſo painful an accident.</p>
               <p>The cheerfulneſs of her ladyſhip, and the familiar chat of the young ladies, inſenſibly led me to throw off my reſerve and ſheepiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſs, till at length I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to join in converſation, and even to ſtart freſh ſubjects. The library being richly furniſhed with books in elegant bindings, I conceived Sir Thomas to be a man of literature, and ventured to give my opinion concerning the ſeveral editions of the Greek claſſics, in which the baronet's opinion coincided with my own. To this ſubject I was led by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an edition of Xenophon in ſixteen volumes, which (as I had never before heard of ſuch a thing) greatly excited my curioſity, and I roſe up to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine what it could be: Sir Thomas ſaw what I was about, and, (as I ſuppoſe) willing to ſave me the trouble, roſe to take down the book, which made me more eager to prevent him, and haſtily laying my hand on the firſt volume, I pulled it forcibly; but lo! inſtead of books, a board which by leather and gilding had been made to look like ſixteen vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes, came tumbling down, and unluckily pitched upon a wedgwood inkſtand on the table under it. In vain did Sir Thomas aſſure me there was no harm; I ſaw the ink ſtreaming from an inlaid table on the Turkey carpet, and ſcarce knowing what I did, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſtop its progreſs with my cambrick hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief. In the height of this confuſion, we were
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:032623_0222_0FF3F37BA6AC3138"/>
informed that dinner was ſerved up, and I with joy perceived that the bell, which at the firſt ſo alarmed my fears, was only the half hour dinner bell.</p>
               <p>In walking through the hall, and ſuit of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the dining room, I had time to collect my ſcattered ſenſes, and was deſired to take my ſeat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Lady Friendly and her eldeſt daughter at the table. Since the fall of Xenophon, my face had been continually burning like a firebrand, and I was juſt beginning to recover myſelf, and feel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably cool, when an unlooked for accident, rekin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled all my heat and bluſhes. Having ſet my plate of ſoup too near the edge of the table, in bowing to Miſs Dinah, who politely complimented the pattern of my waiſtcoat, I tumbled the whole ſcalding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents into my lap In ſpite of an immediate ſupply of napkins to wipe the ſurface of my clothes, my black breeches were not ſtout enough to ſave me from the painful effects of this ſudden fomentation, and for ſome minutes my legs and thighs ſeemed ſtewing in a boiling cauldron; but recollecting how Sir Thomas had diſguiſed his torture, when I trod upon his toe, I firmly bore my pain in ſilence, and ſat with my lower extremities parboiled, amid the ſtifling giggling of the ladies and the ſervants.</p>
               <p>I will not relate the ſeveral blunders which I made during the firſt courſe, or the diſtreſs occaſioned by my being deſired to carve a fowl, or help to various diſhes that ſtood near me, ſpilling a ſauce-boat, and knocking down a ſalt-ſeller; rather let me haſten to the ſecond courſe, "where freſh diſaſters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed me quite."</p>
               <p>I had a piece of rich ſweet pudding on my fork, when Miſs Louiſa Friendly begged to trouble me for a pigeon that ſtood near me; in my haſte, ſcarce knowing what I did, I whipped the pudding into my mouth, hot as a burning coal; it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceal my agony, my eyes were ſtarting from their ſockets. At laſt, in ſpite of ſhame and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:032623_0223_0FF3F37DDF9AB6A8"/>
I was obliged to drop the cauſe of torment on my plate. Sir Thomas and the ladies all compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated my misfortune, and each adviſed a different application; one recommended oil, another water, but all agreed that wine was beſt for drawing out the fire; and a glaſs of Sherry was brought me from the ſide board, which I ſnatched up with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but O! how ſhall I tell the ſequel? Whether the butler by accident miſtook, or purpoſely deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to drive me mad, he gave me the ſtrongeſt brandy, with which I filled my mouth almoſt ſtayed and bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; totally unuſed to every kind of ardent ſpirits, with my tongue, throat, and palate as raw as beef, what could I do? I could not ſwallow, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my hands upon my mouth, the curſed liquor ſquirted through my noſe and fingers like a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, over all the diſhes; and I was cruſhed by burſts of laughter from all quarters. In vain did Sir Thomas reprimand the ſervants, and Lady Friendly chide her daughters; for the meaſure of my ſhame and their diverſion was not yet complete. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me from the intolerable ſtate of perſpiration which this accident had cauſed, without conſidering what I did, I wiped my face with that ill-fated hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief which was ſtill wet from the conſequence of the fall of Xenophon, and covered all my features with ſtreaks of ink in every direction. The baronet himſelf could not ſupport this ſhock, but joined his lady in the general laugh, while I ſprung from the table in deſpair, ruſhed out of the houſe and ran home in an agony of confuſion and diſgrace, which the moſt poignant ſenſe of guilt could not have excited.</p>
               <p>Thus without having deviated from the path of moral rectitude, I am ſuffering torments like a "gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin damned." The half of me has been almoſt boiled, my tongue and mouth grill'd, and I bear the mark of Cain upon my forehead; yet theſe are but trifling conſiderations, to the everlaſting ſhame
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032623_0224_0FF3F37F6E9B2700"/>
which I muſt feel, whenever this adventure ſhall be mentioned; perhaps by your aſſiſtance, when my neighbours know how much I feel on the occaſion, they will ſpare a baſhful man, and (as I am juſt informed my poultice is ready) I truſt you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the haſte in which I ſubſcribe myſelf, yours, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>AN eminent citizen, who had lived in good faſhion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable perplexity in his affairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a low condition. There is a modeſty uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attending faultleſs poverty, which made him rather chuſe to reduce his manner of living to his preſent circumſtances, than ſolicit his friends, in order to ſupport the ſhew of an eſtate when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was gone. His wife, who was a woman of ſenſe and virtue, behaved herſelf on this occaſion with uncommon decency, and never appeared ſo amiable in his eyes as now. Inſtead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune ſhe had brought, or the many great offers ſhe had refuſed for his ſake, ſhe redoubled all the inſtances of her affection, while her huſband was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints that he had ruined the beſt woman in the world. He ſometimes came home at a time ſhe did not expect him, and ſurpriſed her in tears, which ſhe endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulneſs to receive him. To leſſen their expences, their eldeſt daughter, (whom I ſhall call Amanda) was ſent into the country, to the houſe of an honeſt farmer, who had married a ſervant of the family. This young woman was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032623_0225_0FF3F3819F675650"/>
of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to give her an account of what paſſed from time to time of her father's affairs. Amanda was in the bloom of youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's houſe as he followed his country ſports, fell paſſionately in love with her. He was a man of great generoſity; but from a looſe education, had contracted an hearty averſion to marriage. He therefore entertained a deſign upon Amanda's virtue, which at preſent he thought fit to keep private. The innocent creature, who never ſuſpected his intentions, was pleaſed with his perſon; and having obſerved his growing paſſion for her, hoped, by ſo advantageous a match, ſhe might quickly be in a capacity of ſupporting her impoveriſhed relations. One day as he called to ſee her, he found her in tears over a letter ſhe had juſt received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been ſtripped of every thing by an execution. The lover, who with ſome difficulty found out the cauſe of her grief, took this occaſion to make her a propoſal. It is impoſſible to expreſs Amanda's confuſion, when ſhe found his pretenſions were not honorable. She was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of all her hopes, and had no power to ſpeak: but ruſhing from him in the utmoſt diſturbance, locked herſelf up in a chamber. He immediately diſpatched a meſſenger to her father with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing letter:

It is a mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cruel artifice, to make this propoſal at a time when he thinks our neceſſities muſt compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of ſhame; and therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the ſnare which is laid for thy virtue.

               <p>CALISTA was young and beautiful, bleſt with an uncommon ſhare of ſolid ſenſe, enlivened by the moſt ſprightly wit. Agathocles exceeded her a very little in point of age; he was well made, brave, and prudent. He had the good fortune to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at Caliſta's, where his looks, wandering indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently over a brilliant circle, ſoon diſtinguiſhed and fixed upon her: but endeavouring to recover himſelf from the ſhort ecſtaſy which his firſt glance produced, he immediately reproached himſelf as being guilty of rudeneſs and diſregard to the reſt of the company; and this fault he endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, by looking round upon other objects. Vain
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032623_0229_0FF3F389D30969C0"/>
attempt! they are attracted by an irreſiſtible charm, and again turned towards Caliſta. He bluſhed as well as ſhe, while a ſweet emotion hitherto unfelt, played upon his heart, and diſconcerted all his looks. They both became at the ſame time more timid and more curious. With pleaſure he gazed at Caliſta, and yet could not do it without trembling: while ſhe, ſecretly pleaſed with this flattering pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence, looked at him by ſtealth. They were both afraid, but eſpecially Caliſta, of being caught by the other in the fact, and both were ſo almoſt every moment. The hour of ſeparation came, and they thought came too ſoon. They made painful reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the rapidity of time. Imagination, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not ſuffer a total ſeparation to take place: for the image of Caliſta was deeply engraven on the mind of Agathocles, and the lineaments of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were as ſtrongly impreſſed on that of Caliſta. They both appeared leſs cheerful the reſt of the day; a lively and intereſting ſentiment, whatever it was employed their minds, which no amuſement could baniſh. It was two days before they ſaw each other again; and though during this interval their whole time had been filled up, either by buſineſs or recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they both felt a languid anxiety which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every thing inſipid, a void in their minds which we want words to define, and of which they knew not the cauſe; but diſcovered it the very inſtant at their meeting; for the perfect contentment, the ſoothing delight, which they taſted in the preſence of each other, would not ſuffer them to be longer ignorant of the cauſe of their melancholy. Agath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles now collected himſelf, and aſſumed the courage to addreſs Caliſta; he accoſted her with the moſt polite and obliging expreſſions, and for the firſt time enjoyed the happineſs of a particular converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her. He had hitherto ſeen only her exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior charms: he now diſcovered the beauties of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032623_0230_0FF3F38CCADC0F50"/>
ſentiments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what ſtill more delighted him, was the pleaſing hope that ſhe did not think him unworthy of her eſteem. From this time his viſits became very frequent; in every one of which he diſcovered ſome new perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the characteriſtic of real merit; it is a gainer by being laid open to the inſpection of a judicious eye. A man of underſtanding will ſoon be diſguſted with the wanton, the fooliſh, and the giddy: but if he has conceived a paſſion for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man worthy of himſelf, time, ſo far from weakening his attachment, can only ſerve to increaſe and ſtrengthen it.</p>
               <p>The fixed inclination of Agathocles made him now ſenſible, that what he felt for Caliſta was love; and that of the moſt tender and paſſionate kind. This he knew; but Caliſta was ſtill unacquainted with it, or at leaſt had never learnt it from his lips. Love is timorous and diffident: a bold and daring ſuitor is not the lover of the lady he addreſſes: the only object of his love is pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Agathocles at length took the reſolution to lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pen his heart to Caliſta, but not in the ſtudied language of a romantic paſſion. "Lovely Caliſta, (ſaid he, ingenuouſly) it is not merely eſteem which engages me to you; but the moſt ardent and tender affection. I feel that I cannot live without you. Can you without reluctance reſolve to make me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? I have hitherto loved without offending you, this is a tribute which your merit demands; but may I flatter myſelf with the hope, that you will make me ſome ſmall return?" A coquette would have affected to be diſpleaſed; but Caliſta not only heard her lover without interruption, but anſwered him without ſeverily, and permitted him to hope. Nor did ſhe put his conſtancy to a needleſs trial. The happineſs for which he ſighed was deferred no longer than was proper to make the neceſſary prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations. The marriage-ſettlements were eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted;
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032623_0231_0FF3F38E52C45DF8"/>
for in theſe ſordid intereſt had no ſhare; this ſolemn contract chiefly conſiſted in a mutual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of hearts, and this was already performed. What will be the lot of this newly wedded pair? I will venture to foretel that it will be the happieſt mortals can enjoy on earth. No pleaſure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that which affects the heart; nor does any other affect it with ſuch exquiſite delight as the pleaſure of loving and being beloved. To this tender union of ſouls we can never apply the words of Democritus, that "the pleaſure of love is only a ſhort epilepſy." He without doubt had that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure in his thought, which is ſo different from love, that the enjoyment may be without the paſſion, and the paſſion without the enjoyment. Their love will be conſtant; this I dare propheſy, and I know the cauſe: their paſſion is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty, they are both the friends of virtue: they love each other on this account; their love, therefore, will laſt as long as their virtue, and the continuance of that is ſecured by their union: for nothing can ſecure our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the paths of wiſdom ſo effectually as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inceſſantly a loving and beloved example walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before us. Their felicity can never be diſturbed unleſs by thoſe diſaſters and misfortunes from which their mutual tenderneſs cannot ſhelter them: but ſuppoſing theſe ſhould fall to their ſhare, they would then only partake of the common lot of mankind. Thoſe who have never taſted the tender delights of love are equally expoſed to diſappointment; and the lover is at leaſt a gainer, with reſpect to thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are of great account in the eſtimation of the value of life. Add to this, that love will greatly diminiſh the ſenſe of their misfortunes. It has the peculiar virtue of rendering the ſufferings of two well-paired hearts leſs acute, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights more exquiſite. It would ſeem as if by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating their diſtreſſes, each one felt but half
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032623_0232_0FF3F38FDAC02CD0"/>
their weight: while on the contrary, their ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are doubled by the participation. As a ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of ſoldiers is with more difficulty defeated in proportion to its cloſeneſs, ſo the happy pair reſiſt the attacks of trouble and adverſity with ſo much the more ſtrength and ſucceſs as they are firmly united.</p>

               <p>WHEN Charles, Duke of Burgundy, ſirnamed the Bold, reigned over ſpacious dominions, now ſwallowed up by the power of France, he heaped many favours and honours upon Claudius Rhyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, a German, who had ſerved him in his wars againſt the inſults of his neighbours. The prince himſelf was a perſon of ſingular humanity and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and being prepoſſeſſed in favour of Rynſault, upon the deceaſe of the governor of the chief town of Zealand, gave him that command. He was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ated on that government before he caſt his eyes upon Sapphira, a woman of exquiſite beauty, the wife of Paul Danvelt, a wealthy merchant of the city, under his protection and government. Rynſault was a man of a warm conſtitution, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inclination to women. He knew what it was to enjoy the ſatisfaction which is reaped from beauty; but was an utter ſtranger to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cencies, honours, and delicacies which attend the paſſion toward them in elegant minds. He could with his tongue utter a paſſion with which his heart was wholly untouched. In ſhort, he was one of thoſe brutal minds which can be gratified with the violation of innocence and beauty, without the leaſt pity, paſſion or love to that with which they are ſo much delighted.</p>
               <p>Rynſault, being reſolved to accompliſh his will on the wife of Danvelt, left no arts untried to get into a familiarity at her houſe; but ſhe knew his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:032623_0233_0FF3F39208AC8138"/>
and diſpoſition too well not to ſhun all occaſions that might enſnare her into his converſation. The governor deſpairing of ſucceſs by ordinary means, apprehended and impriſoned her huſband, under a pretence of an information that he was guilty of a correſpondence with the enemies of the duke, to betray the town into their poſſeſſion. This deſign had its deſired effect; and the wife of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Danvelt, the day before that which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his execution, preſented herſelf in the hall of the governor's houſe, and, as he paſſed thro' the apartment, threw herſelf at his feet, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his knees beſeeched his mercy. Rynſault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her with a diſſembled ſatisfaction; and aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an air of thought and authority, he bid her riſe, and told her ſhe muſt follow him to his cloſet; and aſking her if ſhe knew the hand of the letter he pulled out of his pocket, went from her, leaving this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition aloud: "If you will ſave your huſband, you muſt give me an account of all you know, without prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rication; for every body is ſatisfied, that he is too fond of you to be able to hide from you the names of the reſt of the conſpirators, or any other particulars whatever." He went to his cloſet, and ſoon after the lady was ſent for to an audience. The ſervant knew his diſtance when matters of ſtate were to be debated; and the governor, laying aſide the air with which he had appeared in public, began to be the ſuppliant, and to rally an affliction which it was in her power eaſily to remove. She eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his intention; and, bathed in tears, began to deprecate ſo wicked a deſign. Luſt, like ambition, takes all the faculties of the mind and body into its ſervice and ſubjection. Her becoming tears, her honeſt anguiſh, the wringing of her hands, and the many changes of her poſture and figure in the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of ſpeaking, were but ſo many attitudes in which he beheld her beauty, and farther incentives of his deſire. All humanity was loſt in that one
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032623_0234_0FF3F3943B976EA0"/>
appetite, and he ſignified to her in in ſo many plain terms, that he was unhappy till he poſſeſſed her, and nothing leſs ſhould be the price of her huſband's life; and he muſt, before the following noon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the death or enlargement of Danvelt. After this notification, when he ſaw Sapphira enough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to make the ſubject of their diſcourſe, to common eyes appear different from what it was, he called ſervants to conduct her to the gate. Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inſupportable affliction, ſhe immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs to her huſband, and having ſignified to the goalers that ſhe had a propoſal to make to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from the governor, ſhe was left alone with him, revealed to him all that had paſſed, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the endleſs conflict ſhe was in between love to his perſon and fidelity to his bed. It is not eaſy to imagine the ſharp affliction this honeſt pair were in, upon ſuch an incident, in lives not uſed to any but ordinary occurrences. The man was bridled by ſhame from ſpeaking what his fear prompted upon ſo near an approach of death; but let fall words that ſignified to her, he ſhould not think her polluted, though ſhe had not confeſſed to him that the governor had violated her perſon, ſince he knew her will had no part in the action. She parted from him with this oblique permiſſion, to ſave a life he had not reſolution enough to reſign for the ſafety of his honour.</p>
               <p>The next morning the unhappy Sapphira attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the governor, and being led into a remote apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubmitted to his deſires. Rhynſault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her charms; claimed a familiarity after what had paſſed between them; and with an air of gaiety, in the language of a gallant, bid her return and take her huſband out of priſon: but, continued he, my fair one muſt not be offended that I have taken care he ſhould not be an interruption to our future aſſignations. Theſe laſt words foreboded what ſhe found when ſhe came to the goal, her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band executed by the order of Rhynſault!!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="unknown:032623_0235_0FF3F39675235908"/>It was remarkable, that the woman, who was full of tears and lamentations during the whole courſe of her affliction, uttered neither ſigh nor complaint, but ſtood fixed with grief at this conſummation of her misfortunes. She betook herſelf to her abode; and, after having in ſolitude paid her devotions to Him who is the avenger of innocence, ſhe repaired privately to court. Her perſon, and a certain gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of ſorrow, negligent of forms, gained her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the preſence of the duke her ſovereign. As ſoon as ſhe came into his preſence, ſhe broke forth into the following words: "Behold, O mighty Charles, a wretch weary of life, though it has always been ſpent in innocence and virtue. It is not in your power to redreſs my injuries, but it is to avenge them; and if the protection of the diſtreſſed—the puniſhment of oppreſſors, is a taſk worthy of a prince, I bring the duke of Burgundy ample matter for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honor to his own great name, and of wiping infamy from mine." When ſhe had ſpoke this, ſhe delivered the duke a paper reciting her ſtory. He read it with all the emotion that indignation and pity could raiſe in a prince jealous of his honour in the behaviour of his officers, and the proſperity of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Upon an appointed day Rhynſault was ſent for at court, and in the preſence of a few of the council confronted by Sapphir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The prince aſking, "Do you know that lady?" Rhynſault, as ſoon as he could recover his ſurprize, told the duke he would marry her, if his highneſs would pleaſe to think that a reparation. The duke ſeemed contented with this anſwer, and ſtood by during the immediate ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnization of the ceremony. At the concluſion of it he told Rhynſault, "Thus far you have done as conſtrained by my authority: I ſhall not be ſatisfied of your kind uſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When theſe two acts were executed, the duke turned to the lady, and told her, "It now remains for me to put you in quiet poſſeſſion of what your huſband has ſo bountifully beſtowed on you;" and ordered the immediate execution of Rhynſault.</p>

               <p>I Contemplate, with the mixed emotions of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and awe, the period of a wedding. The moment approaches, in which two rational beings are to have their union cemented by ties, indiſſoluble except by the ſtroke of death.</p>
               <p>A pure friendſhip, a ſincere affection are neceſſary preparatives for the endearing relation. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal gift of the hand is indicative of a mutual exchange of kindred ſouls, impelled to each other by virtuous love. If the love be not virtuous; if mere perſonal beauty, worldly emolument, or the groſſer paſſions, excite to enter upon the connubial ſtate, its bliſs will be tranſient, and vanity will be inſcribed on the future proſpects of life.</p>
               <p>I have long cheriſhed an exalted idea of the purity of the female mind, where it has been poliſhed and refined by a ſuitable education. I believe, that the diſpoſition of the ſofter ſex towards their lovers is generally pure and chaſte. I am perſuaded, that a virtuous woman offers a degree of violence to the delicacy of her own feelings, by conſenting to be the property, even of the moſt meritorious huſband. It muſt, then, be ungenerous to wound her modeſty by any indecencies of ſpeech upon the occaſion of
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032623_0237_0FF3F39A2615F830"/>
her marriage. An innocent hiliarity may juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among the company aſſembled at its celebration. Every friendly boſom muſt beat with joy, at the idea of the enlargement of human happineſs. But <hi>double intendres</hi> and every ſpecies of looſe language ſhould be invariably excluded, as offering an affront and a ſtain to one of the moſt ſacred inſtitutions of ſociety.</p>
               <p>The ſubſequent hiſtory of the nuptials of a young gentleman of ſentiment and an amiable lady, as contained in that ingenious periodical work, THE BABLER, offers itſelf as a very inſtructive commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on our ſubject; and I hope, that it will have a ſalutary effect on the mind of every reader.</p>
               <p>"MY favorite nephew Harry had for ſome time conceived a paſſion for Miſs Cornelia Marchmont, whom I eſteem as the abſtract of every mental per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and every perſonal accompliſhment. He came to me, not long ſince, with an air of the greateſt tranſport, and informed me, that Miſs Marchmont had bleſſed him with the acknowledgment of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal eſteem, and that I was the perſon, whom ſhe had pitched upon, to open a negociation between the two families.</p>
               <p>"As I do not know any young lady exiſting who poſſeſſes a greater ſhare of my eſteem than Miſs Marchmont, nor ever ſaw a perſon ſo immediately calculated to make my nephew happy, I ſhook him cordially by the hand, wiſhed him joy from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my heart, and inſtantly ſet out to my ſiſter, his mother. Luckily, on my entrance, I found Mr. Marchmont, Cornelia's father, chatting with her at the parlour fire; and, as he and I have been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted for many years, I opened the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my errand without any ceremony, and this the more eſpecially, becauſe I knew neither could have any reaſonable objection to the match. Every thing turned out as I expected; both were rejoiced at the affection between the young couple; and there being no mighty matters to retard the celebration of
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032623_0238_0FF3F39C586796D0"/>
the nuptials, I thought it beſt to make ſhort work of the affair, and accordingly fixed the wedding at an early day. The propoſition being approved by the parent of each, I retired to make Harry happy with the intelligence; and in purſuance of the agreement, I ſaw him bleſſed with one of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as well as ſweeteſt girls in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>As I looked upon a wedding to be one of the moſt important calls which either of the ſexes have in their whole lives for the exertion of an extraordinary delicacy, I was not a little attentive to the behaviour of my two favorites; and it gave me great pleaſure to obſerve, upon the whole, that Harry's behaviour was manly, tender, and reſpectful, without deviating into that fulſome diſagreeable fondneſs, of which even men of the beſt ſenſe are often guilty, when they have juſt obtained the woman of their heart. As to Cornelia, I never ſaw a young creature in her ſituation conduct herſelf with more propriety: to all the dignity of conſcious virtue, ſhe joined all the ineffable ſweetneſs of an engaging timidity; and, though ſhe ſeemed proud of the man, whom ſhe had juſt preferred to all the world, yet ſhe had too much ſenſibility not to feel ſome amiable terrors, at ſo awful an alteration in her circumſtances.</p>
               <p>"After the performance of the ceremony, at which a large company were preſent, Harry judiciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed an unremitting round of amuſements, which entirely employed the attention of the moſt volatile, and prevented the circulation of thoſe indelicate ambiguities, with which occaſions of this kind are frequently diſgraced. So that our mirth was, as it ought to be, mingled with good ſenſe and manners; and of courſe the harmony could be little liable to interruption, while that harmony was regulated by reaſon and civility.</p>
               <p>"I have been often ſhocked, at the ſolemnization of a marriage, to ſee the ridiculous, I had almoſt ſaid the profligate, levity, with which people have

approached the altar of the Divine Being, and jeſted with one another at the inſtant of ſupplicating a bleſſing from his hand.</p>
               <p>"One would imagine, that if the friends of the married couple had even no veneration for the Deity, they would at leaſt have ſome little ſhare of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and be actuated by a tender concern for the feelings of the lady, if they felt no awe whatſoever in the preſence of their GOD.

               <p>A Gentleman who is very happy in a beautiful friend, and is a kind of enthuſiaſt for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, told me the following ſtory of an Italian
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032623_0240_0FF3F3A016BC1950"/>
pair, who were famous for their unalterable conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and affection. There lived at Genoa a young nobleman named MARINI, who had a large eſtate in the iſland of Corſica, whither he went every five for ſix years to regulate his affairs. At the age of five and twenty he was married to a beautiful lady, the daughter of a Venetian ſenator, named MONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIA, who had refuſed the greateſt matches in Italy, to prefer the fortunate MARINI. As their marriage was founded upon a mutual eſteem, their paſſion increaſed inſtead of diminiſhing by enjoyment, till they became an example of conjugal duty to all who knew them. They had lived many years in this uninterrupted ſtate of felicity, when MARINI was obliged to make a voyage to Corſica, which was then diſturbed by a rebellious inſurrection, in order to ſecure his patrimony, by encouraging his depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to ſtand firm in the defence of their country. But the greateſt affliction, and which abſorbed all the reſt, was his being neceſſitated to part for a while from MONIMIA, who, being then far advanced in a ſtate of pregnancy, was unable to go with him as uſual. When the fatal time of ſeparation was come, they embraced with the utmoſt grief, and the warmeſt prayers to Heaven for one another's ſafety. As ſoon as this afflicting ſcene was over, MARINI embarked, and having a fair wind, arrived ſafe at Baſtia in a few hours. The ſucceſs of the rebels being ſtopped, and the affairs of the iſland a little ſettled again, our lover began to prepare for his return to Genoa; but as he was walking one day by the harbour where the ſhips of burthen lay, he heard two ſailors, who were juſt arrived, talking of the death of a Genoeſe nobleman's wife then abſent from the republic. This caſual circumſtance greatly alarmed him, and excited his curioſity to liſten far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their converſation, when, after a little pauſe, he heard one of them mention the name of his dear MONIMIA. At theſe words, his ſurprize and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:032623_0241_0FF3F3A248A34208"/>
were ſo great, that he had not power to follow the mariners to ſatisfy his doubt, but inſtantly ſwooned away, and when he recovered, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſurrounded by his own ſervants lamenting over him. At the ſame time that this happened to MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINI, ſomething of the ſame nature equally diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed MONIMIA; for an imperfect account came to Genoa by the captain of a Venetian veſſel, that a gentleman named MARINI had been ſurpriſed near Baſtia by a remaining party of rebels, and that he and all his attendants were killed by them. Theſe two accounts involved our unfortunate pair in the greateſt diſtreſs; they immediately took ſhipping in order to be convinced of what they ſo much dreaded to know; the one for Corſica, the other for Genoa. They were both ſailed, when a violent ſtorm aroſe, which drove their veſſels upon a little iſland in the Mediterranean. MARINI's ſhip landed firſt, where, while the reſt of the crew were refreſhing themſelves, the inconſolable widower, as he thought himſelf, wandered with one ſervant only, into a little wood, that was near the ſea ſhore, to give vent to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate grief. Soon after, the Genoeſe ſhip land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too, and the ſame motive led MONIMIA with one of her maids to the wood where her huſband was, lamenting his unfortunate condition. They had not been long there, before they heard each other's complaint, and drew nearer mutually to ſee if there were any wretch living equally miſerable with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But how great was the aſtoniſhment of both, when they met in a little path and ſaw each other! the immoderate joy was ſuch, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from one extreme to the other ſo inſtantaneous, that all the power they had was to fall into each other's arms, where they expired in a few minutes after. Their bodies were conveyed to Italy, and were interred with all the ſolemnity and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence due to their quality and eminent virtues.</p>

               <p>IN this capital (Rome) we have juſt now witneſſed an event, which has drawn tears from every body here. It is five years ſince a young gentleman of the family of Amedei, married an amiable and virtuous young woman he loved, but whoſe birth was not equal to his. At the end of one year, they had a daughter as the fruit of their love; but this tender union was in a ſhort time cruelly diſturbed by the parents and relations of the gentleman, who exclaimed againſt his marriage as clandeſtine, and obtained againſt the unhappy young man an order of the Pope, by virtue of which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A proceſs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſtituted for annulling the marriage. The gentleman tried every means poſſible, to prove that his marriage was valid, and to have it ratified; his wife went alſo with her daughter in her arms, and threw herſelf at the feet of her judges; but in vain. A ſentence was at laſt pronounced, annulling the marriage, obliging the mother, that inconſolable wife, to write to her huſband with her own hand, the fatal news of their eternal ſeparation. Oppreſſed with the moſt cruel deſpair, ſhe thus wrote to him: "I find myſelf under the cruel neceſſity of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thoſe ſweet and ſacred bands which till now have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Live free, <hi>dear Huſband</hi> (this, alas! is the laſt time that my lips will pronounce ſo ſweet a name) O live! take comfort; and, if it be poſſible, live <hi>happy,</hi> far from me.

               <p>Four days afterwards, that unhappy and tender wife died in horrible convulſions; and her death ſet the gentleman at liberty, whoſe deſpair has not yet been calmed.</p>

Many matches have been brought about between two perſons, abſolute ſtrangers to each other, through this kind media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of friends, who are always ready to take upon them the office of an honorable go-between.</p>
               <p>As we cannot inſure happineſs to our friends, at the ſame time that we help them to huſbands and wives, one would imagine, that few would care to run the hazard of beſtowing miſery, where they meant a kindneſs. I know a good-natured lady, who has officiouſly brought upon herſelf the ill-will and the curſes of many of her deareſt and moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends on that very account. She has a ſiſter, for whom ſhe has provided a moſt excellent huſband, who has ſhewn his affection for her by ſpending her whole fortune upon his miſtreſſes: another near relation, having by her means ſnatched up a rich widow, the bridegroom was arreſted for her debts within a week after marriage: and it coſt her an whole twelvemonth to bring two doting lovers of her acquaintance together, who parted beds before the honey moon was expired.</p>
               <p>But if our friends will thus condeſcend to be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers from a ſpirit of benevolence, and for our own advantage only; there are others who have taken up the profeſſion from leſs diſintereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; who bring beauty and fortune to market, and traffic in all the accompliſhments that can make the married ſtate happy.

                  <hi>Lucretia</hi>—An Intereſting Story. Founded on Fact.</head>
               <p>LUCRETIA was a woman of great beauty and noble extraction; ſhe married Collatinus, a relation of Tarquinius Superbus, king of Rome. During the ſiege of Ardea, which laſted much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than was expected, the young princes paſſed their time in entertainments and diverſions. One day as they were at ſupper, at Sextus Tarquin's, the king's eldeſt ſon, with Collatinus, Lucretia's huſband, the converſation turned on the merit of their wives: every one gave his own the preference. "What ſignify ſo many words?" ſays Collatinus; "you may in a few hours, if you pleaſe, be convinced by your own eyes, how much my Lucretia excels the the reſt. We are young: let us mount our horſes, and go and ſurpriſe them. Nothing can better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide our diſpute than the ſtate we ſhall find them in at a time, when moſt certainly they will not expect us." They were a little warmed with wine: "Come on, let us go," they all cried together. They quickly galloped to Rome, which was about twenty miles from Ardea, where they find the princeſſes, wives of the young Tarquins, ſurrounded with company, and every circumſtance of the higheſt mirth and pleaſure. From thence they rode to Collatia, where they ſaw Lucretia in a very different ſituation. With her maids about her, ſhe was at work in the inner
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:032623_0247_0FF3F3AED26D4900"/>
part of her houſe, talking on the dangers to which her huſband was expoſed. The victory was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her unanimouſly. She received her gueſts with all poſſible politeneſs and civility. Lucretia's virtue, which ſhould have commanded reſpect, was the very thing which kindled in the breaſt of Sextus Tarquin a ſtrong and deteſtable paſſion. Within a few days he returned to Collatia, and upon the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible excuſe he made for his viſit, he was received with all the politeneſs due to a near relation, and the eldeſt ſon of a king. Watching the fitteſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, he declares the paſſion ſhe had excited at his laſt viſit, and employed the moſt tender intreaties, and all the artifices poſſible to touch a woman's heart; but all to no purpoſe. He then endeavoured to extort her compliance by the moſt terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings. It was in vain. She ſtill perſiſted in her reſolution; nor could ſhe be moved, even by the fear of death. But, when the monſter told her that he would firſt diſpatch her, and then having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a ſlave, would lay him by her ſide, after which he would ſpread a report, that having caught them in the act of adultery, he had puniſhed them as they deſerved; this ſeemed to ſhake her reſolution. She heſitated, not knowing which of theſe dreadful alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives to take, whether, by conſenting, to diſhonor the bed of her huſband, whom ſhe tenderly loved; or, by refuſing, to die under the odious character of having proſtituted her perſon to the luſt of a ſlave. He ſaw the ſtruggle of her ſoul; and ſeizing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky moment, obtained an inglorious conqueſt. Thus Lucretia's virtue, which had been proof againſt the fear of death, could not hold out againſt the fear of infamy. The young prince, having gratified his paſſion, returned home as in triumph.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, Lucretia, overwhelmed with grief and deſpair, ſent early in the morning to deſire her father and her huſband to come to her, and bring with them each a truſty friend, aſſuring them there
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:032623_0248_0FF3F3B05AF43520"/>
was no time to loſe. They came with all ſpeed, the one accompanied with Valerius, (ſo famous after under the name of Publicola) and the other with Brutus. The moment ſhe ſaw them come, ſhe could not command her tears; and when her huſband aſked her if all was well: "By no means," ſaid ſhe, "it cannot be well with a woman after ſhe has loſt her honor. Yes, Collatinus, thy bed has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by a ſtranger: but my body only is polluted; my mind is innocent, as my death ſhall witneſs. Promiſe me only, not to ſuffer the adulterer to go unpuniſhed: it is Sextus Tarquinius, who laſt night, treacherous gueſt, or rather cruel foe, offered me violence, and reaped a joy fatal to me; but, if you are men, it will be ſtill more fatal to him." All promiſed to revenge her: and, at the ſame time, tried to comfort her with repreſenting, "That the mind only ſins, not the body; and where the conſent is wanting, there can be no guilt." "What Sextus deſerves," replies Lucretia, "I leave you to judge; but for me, though I declare myſelf innocent of the crime, I exempt not myſelf from puniſhment. No immodeſt woman ſhall plead Lucretia's example to outlive her diſhonor." Thus ſaying, ſhe plunged into her breaſt a dagger ſhe had concealed under her robe, and expired at their feet.</p>
               <p>Lucretia's tragical death has been praiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled by Pagan writers, as the higheſt and moſt noble act of heroiſm. The goſpel thinks not ſo: it is murder, even according to Lucretia's own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſince ſhe puniſhed with death an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at leaſt acknowledged as ſuch by herſelf. She was ignorant that our life is not in our own power, but in his diſpoſal from whom we receive it.</p>
               <p>St. Auſtin, who carefully examines, in his book, what we are to think of Lucretia's death, conſiders it not as a courageous action, flowing from a true love of chaſtity, but as an infirmity of a woman too ſenſible of worldly ſame and glory; and who, from

But what can not be ſufficiently admired in this Roman lady is her abhorrence of adultery, which ſhe ſeems to hold ſo deteſtable as not to bear the thoughts of it. In this ſenſe, ſhe is a noble example for all her ſex.</p>

               <head>The Trial, Sufferings, and Death of Mrs. <hi>Aſkew.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIR William Aſkew, of Kelſay, in Lincolnſhire, was bleſſed with ſeveral daughters. His ſecond, named Anne, had received a genteel education; which, with an agreeable perſon, and good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, rendered her a very proper perſon to be at the head of a family. Her father, regardleſs of his daughter's inclination and happineſs, obliged her to marry a gentleman who had nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him but his fortune, and who was a moſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oted papiſt. No ſooner was he convinced of his wife's regard for the doctrines of the reformation from popery, than, by the inſtigation of the prieſts, he violently drove her from his houſe, though ſhe had borne him two children, and her conduct was unexceptionable. Abandoned by her huſband, ſhe came up to London, in order to procure a divorce, and to make herſelf known to that part of the court who either profeſſed, or were favourers of proteſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm: but, as Henry VIII. with conſent of parliament, had juſt enacted the law of the ſix articles, commonly called, the bloody ſtatute, ſhe was cruelly betrayed by her own huſband; and, upon his information, taken into cuſtody, and examined concerning her faith. The act above mentioned denounced death againſt all thoſe who ſhould deny the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; or, that the bread and wine
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:032623_0250_0FF3F3B4B4FD8958"/>
made uſe of in the ſacrament was not converted after conſecration into the REAL body and blood of Chriſt; or, maintain the neceſſity of receiving the ſacrament in both kinds; or affirm, that it was lawful for prieſts to marry; that the vows of celibacy might be brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; that private maſſes were of no avail; and that auricular confeſſion to a prieſt was not neceſſary to ſalvation. Upon theſe articles, ſhe was examined by the inquiſitor, a prieſt, the lord-mayor of London, and the biſhop's chancellor; and to all their queries gave proper and pertinent anſwers; but not being ſuch as they approved; ſhe was ſent back to priſon; where ſhe remained eleven days to ruminate alone on her alarming ſituation, and was denied the ſmall conſolation of a friendly viſit. The king's council being at Greenwich, ſhe was once more examined by chancellor Wriotheſley, Gardiner biſhop of Wincheſter, Dr. Cox, and Dr. Robinſon; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to convince her of her ſuppoſed errors, ſhe was ſent to the tower. It was ſtrongly ſuſpected, that Mrs. Aſkew was favored by ſome ladies of high rank; and that ſhe carried on a religious correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the queen. So that the chancellor Wriotheſley, hoping that he might diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that would afford matter of impeachment againſt that princeſs, the earl of Hertford, or his counteſs, who all favoured the reformation, ordered her to be put to the rack: but her fortitude in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and her reſolution not to betray her friends, was proof againſt that diabolical invention. Not a groan, not a word could be extorted from her. The chancellor, provoked with what he called her obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, augmented her tortures with his own hands, and with unheard of violence: but her courage and conſtancy were invincible; and theſe barbarians gained nothing by their cruelties, but everlaſting diſgrace and infamy. As ſoon as ſhe was taken from the rack ſhe fainted away; but, being recovered, ſhe was condemned to the flames. Her bones were
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:032623_0251_0FF3F3B6E08B40C8"/>
diſlocated in ſuch a manner, that they were forced to carry her in a chair to the place of execution. While ſhe was at the ſtake, letters were brought her from the lord-chancellor, offering the king's pardon if ſhe would recant. But ſhe refuſed to look at them; telling the meſſenger, that "ſhe came not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hither to deny her Lord and Maſter." The ſame letters were alſo tendered to three other perſons, condemned to the ſame fate; and who, animated by her example, refuſed to accept them. Whereupon the lord mayor commanded the fire to be kindled; and, with ſavage ignorance cried out, FIAT JUSTITIA, Let juſtice take its courſe. The faggots being light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe commended her ſoul, with the utmoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, into the hands of her Maker; and, like the great Founder of the religion ſhe profeſſed, expired, praying for her murderers, July 16, 1546, about the 25th year of her age.</p>
               <p>I do not know if all circumſtances are conſidered, whether the hiſtory of this, or any other nation, can furniſh a more illuſtrious example than this now related. To her father's will ſhe ſacrificed her own inclinations. To a huſband unworthy of her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe behaved with prudence, reſpect, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The ſecrets of her friends ſhe preſerved inviolable, even amidſt the tortures of the rack. Her conſtancy in ſuffering, conſidering her age and ſex, was equal, at leaſt, if not ſuperior, to any thing on record: and her piety was genuine and unaffected; of which ſhe gave the moſt exalted proof in dying a martyr for the cauſe of her religion, and liberty of conſcience. But who can read this example, and not lament and deteſt that ſpirit of cruelty and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity which is imbibed and cheriſhed in the church of Rome! a ſpirit repugnant to the feelings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and directly oppoſite to the conduct and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the great Author of our religion, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them: and, inſtead of delighting in the death of a ſinner, gave

his own life a ranſom for theirs. On the contrary, who that is not ſunk into brutality can ſee, without horror, a man, a prieſt, pretending to be influenced by the love and honor of God, torturing a woman whoſe youth and beauty might have diſarmed the moſt ſavage reſentment, and after often wearying himſelf in this diabolical ſervice, committing her to the flames, for not believing the groſſeſt abſurdities and impoſſibilities? Who can ſee animoſities, hatred and variance, encouraged and fomented between man and wife, and the one prompted and perſuaded to contrive and effect the death of the other, and not abandon a religion that juſtifies ſuch a practice?</p>

               <head>Noble Example of Virtue in <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SCIPIO the younger, when only twenty four years of age, was appointed by the Roman republic to the command of the army againſt the Spaniards. His wiſdom and valour would have done honour to the moſt experienced General. Determined to ſtrike an important blow, he formed a deſign of beſieging Carthagena, then the capital of the Carthagenian empire in Spain. His meaſures were ſo judiciouſly concerted, and with ſo much courage and intrepidity purſued, both by ſea and lend, that notwithſtanding a bold and vigorous defence, the capital was taken by ſtorm. The plunder was immenſe. Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand freemen were made priſoners: and above three hundred more of both ſexes, were received as hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

                  </gap>tter, a very ancient lady, the wife of Mandonius, brother of Indibilis, king of the Iler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes, watching her opportunity, came out of the crowd, and, throwing herſelf at the conqueror's feet, conjured him, with tears in her eyes, to recommend to thoſe who had the ladies in their keeping, to have regard to their ſex and birth. Scipio, who did
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:032623_0253_0FF3F3BA9554E830"/>
not underſtand her meaning at firſt, aſſured her that he had given orders that they ſhould not want for any thing. But the lady replied, "Thoſe conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are not what affect us. In the condition to which fortune hath reduced us, with what ought we not to be contented? I have many other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, when I conſider, on one ſide, the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of war; and, on the other, the youth and beauty of the princeſſes, which you ſee here before us; for as to me, my age protects me from all fear in this reſpect." She had with her the daughters of Indibilis, and ſeveral other ladies of high rank, all in the flower of youth, who conſidered her as their mother. Scipio, then comprehending what the ſubject of her fear was, "My own glory, (ſays he) "and that of the Roman people, are concerned in not ſuffering that virtue, which ought always to be reſpected, wherever we find it, ſhould be expoſed in my camp to a treatment unworthy of it. But you give me a new motive for being more ſtrict in my care of it, in the virtuous ſolicitude you ſhew in thinking only of the preſervation of your honor in the midſt of ſo many other objects of fear." After this converſation, he committed the care of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſome officers of experienced prudence, ſtrictly commanding, that they ſhould treat them with all the reſpect they could pay to the mothers, wives, and daughters of their allies and particular friends. It was not long before Scipio's integrity and virtue were put to the trial. Being retired into his camp, ſome of his officers brought him a virgin of ſuch exquiſite beauty, that ſhe drew upon her the eyes and admiration of every body. The young con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſtarted from his ſeat with confuſion and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and, like one thunder-ſtruck, ſeemed to be robbed of that preſence of mind and ſelf-poſſeſſion ſo neceſſary in a General, and for which Scipio was remarkably famous. In a few moments, having ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied his ſtraggling ſpirits, he inquired of the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:032623_0254_0FF3F3BCCAA9C838"/>
captive, in the moſt civil and polite manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her country, birth, and connections; and finding that ſhe was betrothed to a Celtiberian prince, named Allucius, he ordered both him and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive's parent's to be ſent for. The Spaniſh prince no ſooner appeared in his preſence than, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpoke to the father and mother, he took him aſide; and, to remove the anxiety he might be in on account of the young lady, he addreſſed him thus: "You and I are young, which admits of my ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you with more-liberty. Thoſe who brought me your future ſpouſe, aſſured me, at the ſame time, that you loved her with extreme tenderneſs; and her beauty left me no room to doubt it. Upon which reflecting, that if, like you, I had thought of making an engagement, and were not wholly engroſſed with the affairs of my country, I ſhould deſire that ſo honorable and legitimate a paſſion ſhould find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I think myſelf happy in the preſent conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do you this ſervice. Though the fortune of war has made me your maſter, I deſire to be your friend. Here is your wife: take her, and may the gods bleſs you with her. One thing, however, I would have you to be fully aſſured of, that ſhe has been among us as ſhe would have been in the houſe of her father and mother. Far be it from Scipio to purchaſe a looſe and momentary pleaſure at the expence of virtue, honour, and the happineſs of an honeſt man. No—I have kept her for you, in order to make you a preſent worthy of you and of me. The only gratitude I require of you for this ineſtimable gift, is, that you would be a friend to the Roman people." Allucius's heart was too full to make him any anſwer; but throwing himſelf at the General's feet he wept aloud. The captive lady fell into the ſame poſture; and remained ſo, till the father burſt out into the following words: "O divine Scipio! the gods have given you more than human virtue! O glorious leader! O wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:032623_0255_0FF3F3BF017C14C8"/>
youth! does not that obliged virgin give you, while ſhe prays to the gods for your proſperity, rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures above all the tranſports yon could have reaped from the poſſeſſion of her injured perſon?"</p>
               <p>The relations of the young lady had brought with them a very conſiderable ſum for her ranſom: but when they ſaw that ſhe was reſtored to them in a manner ſo generous and godlike, they intreated the conqueror with great earneſtneſs, to accept that ſum as a preſent; and declared, by his complying, that new favour would complete their joy and grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude. Scipio, not being able to reſiſt ſuch warm and earneſt ſolicitations, told them, that he accepted the gift; and ordered it to be laid at his feet: then addreſſing himſelf to Lucius, "I add," ſays he, "to the portion which you are to receive from your father-in-law this ſum; which I deſire you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as a marriage preſent."</p>
               <p>If we conſider that Scipio was at this time in the prime of life, unmarried, and under no reſtraint, we cannot but acknowledge, that the conqueſt he made of himſelf was far more glorious than that of the Carthagenian empire: and though his treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this captive prince was not more delicate and generous than what might juſtly be expected from a perſon endowed with reaſon and reflection; yet conſidering how few there are in his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances who would have acted as he did, we cannot but applaud his conduct, and propoſe him as a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able example to future ages. Nor was his virtue unrewarded. The young prince, charmed with the liberality and politeneſs of Scipio, went into his country to publiſh the praiſes of a victor ſo generous. He cried out, in the tranſports of his gratitude, "that there was come into Spain a young hero like the gods; who conquered all things leſs by the force of his arms, than the charms of his virtue, and the greatneſs of his beneficence." Upon this report, all Celtiberia ſubmitted to the Romans; and Allucius
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:032623_0256_0FF3F3C08CCC0040"/>
returned in a ſhout to Scipio, at the head of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred choſen horſe, to facilitate his future conqueſts. To render the marks of his gratitude ſtill more durable, Allucius cauſed the action we have juſt related to be engraven on a ſilver ſhield, which he preſented to Scipio; a preſent infinitely more eſtimable and glorious than all his treaſures and triumphs. This buckler, which Scipio carried with him when he returned to Rome, was loſt, in paſſing the Rhine with part of the baggage. It continued in that river, till the year 1665, when ſome fiſhermen found it. It is now in the cabinet of the king of France.</p>

               <p>GOING yeſterday to dine with an old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I had the misfortune to find his whole family very much dejected. Upon aſking him the occaſion of it, he told me that his wife had dreamt a very ſtrange dream the night before, which they were afraid portended ſome misfortune to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their children. At her coming into the room I obſerved a ſettled melancholy in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which I ſhould have been troubled for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded. We were no ſooner ſet down, but after having looked upon me a little while, "My dear, (ſays ſhe) turning to her huſband, you may now ſee the ſtranger that was in the candle laſt night." Soon after this, as they
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:032623_0257_0FF3F3C2B5E9FC98"/>
began to talk of family affairs, a little boy at the other end of the table told her, that he was to go into joining-hand on <hi>Thurſday: "Thurſday!</hi> (ſays ſhe) no child, if it pleaſe God, you ſhall not begin upon <hi>Childermas-day</hi>; tell your writing-maſter that <hi>Friday</hi> will be ſoon enough." I was reflecting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in myſelf on the oddneſs of her fancy, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any body would eſtabliſh it as a rule to loſe a day in every week. In the midſt of theſe my mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſhe deſired me to reach her a little ſalt upon the point of my knife, which I did, in ſuch a trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and hurry of obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at which ſhe immediately ſtarted, and ſaid it fell towards her.</p>
               <p>Upon this I looked very black; and obſerving the concern of the whole table, began to conſider myſelf, with ſome confuſion, as a perſon who had brought a diſaſter upon the family. The lady, however, recovering herſelf after a little ſpace, ſaid to her huſband with a ſigh, "My dear, misfortunes never come ſingle." My friend, I found, acted but an under part at his table, and being a man of more good nature than underſtanding, thinks himſelf obliged to fall in with all the paſſions and humours of his yoke-fellow: "do you remember, child, (ſaid ſhe) that the pigeon-houſe fell the very afternoon that our careleſs wench ſpilt the ſalt upon the table!" "yes, my dear (ſays he) and the next poſt brought us an account of the battle of <hi>Almanza.</hi>" The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may gueſs at the figure I made, after having done all this miſchief. I diſpatched my dinner as faſt as I could, with my uſual taciturnity; when, to my utter confuſion, the lady ſeeing me quitting my knife and fork, and laying them acroſs one another upon my plate, deſired me that I would humour her ſo far as to take them out of that figure, and place them ſide by ſide. What the abſurdity was which I had committed, I did not know, but I ſuppoſe there was ſome traditionary ſuperſtition in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:032623_0258_0FF3F3C4EF8DA520"/>
in obedience to the lady of the houſe, I diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I ſhall always lay them in for the future, though I do not know any reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>It is not difficult for a man to ſee that a perſon has conceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n averſion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by the lady's looks, that ſhe regarded me as a very odd kind of a fellow, with an unfortunate aſpect: for which reaſon I took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own lodgings. Upon my return home, I fell into a profound contemplation on the evils which attend thoſe ſuperſtitious follies of mankind; how they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us to imaginary afflictions, and additional ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which do not properly come within our lot. As if the natural calamities of life were not ſufficient for it, we turn the moſt indifferent circumſtances into misfortunes, and ſuffer as much from trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known the ſhooting of a ſtar ſpoil a night's reſt; and have ſeen a man in love grow pale and loſe his appetite, upon the plucking of a merry thought. A ſcreech owl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket has ſtruck more terror than the roaring of a lion. There is nothing ſo inconſiderable, which may not appear dreadful to an imagination filled with omens and prognoſtics. A ruſty nail, or crooked pin, ſhoots up into prodigies.</p>
               <p>I remember I was once in a mixed aſſembly, that was full of noiſe and mirth, when on a ſudden an old woman unluckily obſerved there were thirteen of us in company. The remark ſtruck a panic of terror into ſeveral who were preſent, inſomuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there were fourteen in the room, and that inſtead of portending that one of the company ſhould die,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:032623_0259_0FF3F3C72E0F0400"/>
it plainly foretold that one of them ſhould be born. Had not my friend found this experiment to break the omen, I queſtion not but half the women in the company would have fallen ſick that very night.</p>
               <p>An old maid, who is troubled with the vapours, produces infinite diſturbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours. I knew a maiden aunt of a great family, who is one of thoſe antiquated <hi>ſibyls,</hi> who forebode and prophecy from one end of the year to the other. She is always ſeeing appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hearing dead watches; and was the other day almoſt frightned out of her wits by the great houſe-dog, that howled in the ſtable at the time when ſhe lay ill of the tooth-ach.</p>
               <p>Such an extravagant caſt of mind engages multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, not only in impertinent terror, but in ſupernumerary duties of life; and ariſes from that fear and ignorance which is natural to the ſoul of man. The horror with which we entertain the thoughts of death, (or indeed of any future evil) and the uncertainty of its approach, fill a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind with innumerable apprehenſions and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, and conſequently diſpoſe it to the obſervation of ſuch groundleſs prodigies and predictions. For, as it is the chief concern of wiſe men to retrench the evils of life by the reaſonings of philoſophy, it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the ſentiments of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I ſhould be very much troubled were I endowed with this divining quality, though it ſhould inform me truly of every thing that can befal me: I would not anticipate the reliſh of any happineſs, nor feel the weight of any miſery, before it actually arrives.</p>
               <p>I know but one way of fortifying my ſoul againſt theſe gloomy preſages and terrors of mind; and that is, by ſecuring to myſelf the friendſhip and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Being, who diſpoſes of events, and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns futurity. He ſees, at one view, the whole
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:032623_0260_0FF3F3C8B9792A50"/>
thread of my exiſtence; not only that part of it which I have already paſſed through, but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity. When I lay me down to ſleep, I recommend myſelf to his care; when I awake, I give myſelf to his direction. Amidſt all the evils that threaten me, I will look up to him for help, and queſtion not but he will either avert, or turn them to my advantage. Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the death I am to die, I am not at all ſolicitous about it; becauſe I am ſure that he knows them both, and that he will not fail to comfort and ſupport me under them.</p>

               <p>I remember laſt winter there were ſeveral young girls of the neighbourhood ſitting about the fire with my landlady's daughters, and telling ſtories of ſpirits and apparitions. Upon my opening the door, the young women broke off their diſcourſe; but my landlady's daughter telling them that it was no body but the gentleman, (for that is the name I go by in the neighbourhood, as well as in the family) they went on without minding me. I ſeated myſelf by the candle that ſtood on a table at one end of the room; and pretending to read a book which I took out of my pocket, heard ſeveral dreadful ſtories of ghoſts as pale as aſhes that had ſtood at the foot of a bed, or walked over a church-yard by moon-light; and of others that had been conjured into the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> for diſturbing people's reſt, and drawing their curtains at mid-night; with many other old women's fables of the like nature. As one ſpirit raiſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I obſerved that at the end of every ſtory the whole company cloſed their ranks, and crowded about the fire. I took notice, in particular, of a
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:032623_0261_0FF3F3CAE6C9F650"/>
little boy, who was ſo attentive to every ſtory, that I miſtake if he ventures to go to bed by himſelf theſe twelve months. Indeed they talked ſo long, that the imaginations of the whole aſſembly were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly crazed, and I am ſure will be the worſe for it as long as they live. I heard one of the girls who had looked upon me over her ſhoulder, aſking the company how long I had been in the room, and whether I did not look paler than I uſed to do. This put me under ſome apprehenſions that I ſhould be forced to explain myſelf, if I did nor retire; for which reaſon I took the candle in my hand, and went up into my chamber, not without wondering at this unaccountable weakneſs in human creatures, that they ſhould love to aſtoniſh and terrify one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Were I a father, I ſhould take particular care to preſerve my children from theſe little horrors of imagination which they are apt to contract when they are young, and are not able to ſhake off when they are in years. I have known a ſoldier who has entered a breach, affrighted at his own ſhadow, and look pale at a little ſcratching at his door, who the day before had marched up againſt a battery of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. There are inſtances of perſons who have been terrified even to diſtraction at the figure of a tree, or ſhaking of a bull-ruſh. The truth of it is, I look upon a ſound imagination as the greateſt bleſſing of life, next to a clear judgment and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In the mean time, ſince there are very few whoſe minds are not more or leſs ſubject to theſe dreadful thoughts and apprehenſions, we ought to arm ourſelves againſt them by the dictates of reaſon and religion, <hi>to pull the old woman out of our hearts,</hi> and annihilate thoſe impertinent notions which we imbibed at a time when we were not able to judge of their abſurdity.</p>

               <p>I Have ſometimes heard it diſputed in converſation, whether it be more laudable or deſirable, that a man ſhould think too highly or too meanly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: it is on all hands agreed to be beſt, that he ſhould think rightly; but ſince a falliable being will always make ſome deviations from exact rectitude, it is not wholly uſeleſs to inquire towards which ſide it is ſafer to incline.</p>
               <p>The prejudices of mankind ſeem to favour him who errs by under-rating his own powers; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a modeſt and harmleſs member of ſociety, not likely to break the peace by competition, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after ſuch ſplendor of reputation as may dim the luſtre of others, or to interrupt any in the enjoyment of themſelves; he is no man's rival, and therefore may be every man's friend.</p>
               <p>The opinion which a man entertains of himſelf, ought to be diſtinguiſhed, in order to an accurate diſcuſſion of this queſtion, as it relates to perſons or to things. To think highly of ourſelves in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with others, to aſſume by our own authority that precedence which none are willing to grant, muſt be always invidious and offenſive; but to rate our powers high in proportion to things, and imagine ourſelves equal to great undertakings, while we leave others in poſſeſſion of the ſame abilities, cannot with equal juſtice provoke cenſure.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that ſelf-love may diſpoſe us to decide too haſtily in our own favour; but who is hurt by the miſtake? If we are incited by this vain opinion to attempt more than we can perform, ours is the labour, and ours the diſgrace.</p>

                  <pb n="264" facs="unknown:032623_0263_0FF3F3CF87EE51B8"/>But he who dares to think well of himſelf, will not always prove to be miſtaken; and the good effects of his confidence will then appear in great attempts, and great performances: if he ſhould not fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his deſign, he will at leaſt advance it ſo far, as to leave an eaſy taſk for him who ſucceeds him; and even though he ſhould wholly fall, he will fall with honor.</p>
               <p>But from the oppoſite error, from torpid deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency can come no advantage; it is the froſt of the ſoul which binds up all its powers, and congeals life in perpetual ſterility. He who has no hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, will make no attempts; and where nothing is attempted, nothing will be done.</p>
               <p>Every man ſhould, therefore, endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in himſelf a favorable opinion of the powers of the human mind; which are, perhaps, in every man greater than they appear, and might, by diligent cultivation, be exalted to a degree beyond what their poſſeſſor preſumes to believe. There is ſcarce any man but has found himſelf able, at the inſtigation of neceſſity, to do what in a ſtate of leiſure and deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he would have concluded impoſſible; and ſome of our ſpecies have ſignalized themſelves by ſuch atchievements, as prove there are few things above human hope.</p>
               <p>It has been the policy of all nations to preſerve, by ſome public monuments, the memory of thoſe who have ſerved their country by great exploits: there is the ſame reaſon for continuing or reviving the names of thoſe whoſe extenſive abilities have dignified humanity.

none ſeem to have been more exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the appellation of the Admirable CRICHTON; of whoſe hiſtory, whatever we may ſuppreſs as ſurpaſſing credibility, yet we ſhall, upon inconteſtible authority, relate enough to rank him among prodigies.</p>
               <p>Virtue, ſays <hi>Virgil,</hi> is better accepted when it comes in a pleaſing form. The perſon of <hi>Crichton</hi> was eminently beautiful; but his beauty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with ſuch activity and ſtrength, that in fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would ſpring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagoniſt; and he uſed the ſword in either hand with ſuch force and dexterity, that ſcarce any one had courage to engage him.</p>
               <p>Having ſtudied at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris</hi> in his twenty-firſt year, and affixed on the gate of the college of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a kind of challenge to the learned of that univerſity, to diſpute with them on a certain day; offering to his opponents, whoever they might be, the choice of ten languages, and of all the faculties and ſciences. On the day pointed, three thouſand auditors aſſembled, when four doctors of the church, and fifty maſters appeared againſt him; and one of his antagoniſts confeſſes that the doctors were defeated; that he gave proofs of knowledge above the reach of man; and that an hundred years paſſed without food or ſleep would not be ſufficient for the attainment of his learning. After a diſputation of nine hours, he was preſented by the preſident and and profeſſors with a diamond and purſe of gold, and diſmiſſed with repeated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Paris</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he made the ſame challenge, and had in the preſence of the Pope and Cardinals the ſame ſucceſs. Afterwards he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted at <hi>Venice</hi> an acquaintance with <hi>Aldus Manutius,</hi> by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city; he then viſited <hi>Padua,</hi> where he engaged in another public diſputation, beginning his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:032623_0265_0FF3F3D296548D80"/>
with an extempore poem in praiſe of the city and the aſſembly then preſent, and concluding with an oration equally unpremeditated in commendation of ignorance.</p>
               <p>He afterwords publiſhed another challenge, in which he declared himſelf ready to detect the errors of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all his commentators, either in the common forms of logic, or in any which his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſhould propoſe, of an hundred different kinds of verſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe acquiſitions of learning, however ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, were not gained at the expence of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which youth generally indulges, or by the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any accompliſhment in which it becomes a gentleman to excel: he practiſed in great perfection the arts of drawing and painting; he was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent performer in both vocal and inſtrumental mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic; he danced with uncommon gracefulneſs; and on the day after his diſputation at <hi>Paris,</hi> exhibited his ſkill in horſemanſhip before the court of <hi>France,</hi> where, at a public match of tilting, he bore away the ring upon his lance fifteen times together.</p>
               <p>He excelled likewiſe in domeſtic games of leſs dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reputation; and in the interval between his challenge and diſputation at <hi>Paris,</hi> he ſpent ſo much of his time at cards, dice, and tennis, that a lampoon was fixed upon the gate of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> directing thoſe who would fee this monſter of erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to look for him at the tavern.</p>
               <p>So extenſive was his acquaintance with life and manners, that in an <hi>Italian</hi> comedy, compoſed by himſelf, and exhibited before the court of <hi>Mantua,</hi> he is ſaid to have perſonated fifteen different cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in all which he might ſucceed without great difficulty; ſince he had ſuch power of retention, that once hearing an oration of an hour, he would repeat it exactly, and in the recital follow the ſpeak or through all the variety of tone and geſticulation.</p>
               <p>Nor was his ſkill in arms leſs than in learning, or
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:032623_0266_0FF3F3D4D4F98D78"/>
his courage inferior to his ſkill. There was a prize-fighter at <hi>Mantua,</hi> who, (travelling about the world, according to the barbarous cuſtom of that age, as a general challenger) had defeated the moſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted maſters in many parts of Europe; and in <hi>Mantua,</hi> where he then reſided, had killed three who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him. The Duke repented that he had granted him his protection; when <hi>Crichton,</hi> looking on his ſanguinary ſucceſs with indignation, offered to ſtake fifteen hundred piſtoles, and mount the ſtage againſt him. The Duke with ſome reluctance conſented; and on the day fixed, the combatants appeared: their weapons ſeemed to have been the ſingle rapier, which was then newly introduced into <hi>Italy.</hi> The prize-fighter advanced with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and fierceneſs, while <hi>Crichton</hi> contented himſelf calmly to ward off his paſſes, and ſuffered him to exhauſt his vigour by his own fury. <hi>Crichton</hi> then became the aſſailant; and preſſed upon him with ſuch force and agility, that he thruſt him thrice through the body, and ſaw him expire. He then divided the prize he had won, among the widows whoſe huſbands had been killed.</p>
               <p>The death of this wonderful man I ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to conceal, did I not know that every reader will inquire curiouſly after that fatal hour, which is common to all human beings, however diſtinguiſhed from each other by nature or fortune.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having received ſo many proofs of his various merit, made him tutor to his ſon <hi>Vincentia de Conzaga,</hi> a prince of looſe manners and turbulent diſpoſition. On this occaſion it was that he compoſed the comedy in which he exhibited ſo many different characters with exact propriety. But his honor was of ſhort continuance; for as he was one night in time of <hi>carnival</hi> rambling about the ſtreets with his guitar in his hand, he was attacked by ſix men maſked. Neither his courage nor ſkill at this exigence deſerted him; he oppoſed them with
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:032623_0267_0FF3F3D7B2A98B20"/>
ſuch activity and ſpirit, that he ſoon diſperſed them, and diſarmed their leader, who throwing off his maſk, diſcovered himſelf to be the prince his pupil. <hi>Crichton,</hi> falling on his knees, took his own ſword by the point, and preſented it to the prince; who immediately ſeized it, and inſtigated, as ſome ſay, by jealouſy, according to others, only by drunken fury and brutal reſentment, baſely thruſt him through the heart.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Admirable <hi>Crichton</hi> brought into that ſtate in which he could excel the meaneſt of mankind only by a few empty honours paid to his memory. The court of <hi>Mantua</hi> teſtified their eſteem by public mourning; the cotemporary wits were profuſe of their encomiums; and the palaces of <hi>Italy</hi> were adorned with pictures, repreſenting him on horſeback, with a lance in one hand, and a book in the other.</p>

                  <l>WHEN Spring came on with freſh delight,</l>
                  <l>To cheer the ſoul, and charm the ſight,</l>
                  <l>While eaſy breezes, ſofter rain,</l>
                  <l>And warmer ſuns ſalute the plain,</l>
                  <l>'Twas then, in yonder piny grove,</l>
                  <l>That Nature went to meet with Love.</l>
                  <l>Green was her robe, and green her wreath,</l>
                  <l>Where'er ſhe trod, 'twas green beneath;</l>
                  <l>Where'er ſhe turn'd, the pulſes beat</l>
                  <l>With new recruits of genial heat;</l>
                  <l>And in her train the birds appear,</l>
                  <l>To match for all the coming year.</l>
                  <l>Rais'd on a bank, where daiſies grew,</l>
                  <l>And violets intermix'd a blue,</l>
                  <l>She finds the boy ſhe went to find;</l>

                  <l>But all unfeather'd wait to fly.</l>
                  <l>When they met, the dame and boy,</l>
                  <l>Dancing graces, idle joy,</l>
                  <l>Wanton ſmiles, and airy play,</l>
                  <l>Conſpir'd to make the ſcene more gay;</l>
                  <l>Love pair'd the birds through all the grove,</l>
                  <l>And nature bid them ſing to love,</l>
                  <l>Sitting, hopping, fluttering, ſing,</l>
                  <l>And pay their tribute from the wing,</l>
                  <l>To fledge the ſhafts that idle lie,</l>
                  <l>And yet unfeather'd wait to fly.</l>
                  <l>'Tis thus, when ſpring renews the blood,</l>
                  <l>They meet in ev'ry trembling wood,</l>
                  <l>And thrice they make the plumes agree,</l>

                  <head>Conjugal Life.</head>
                  <l>YE wives and ye huſbands, who both wiſh to ſee</l>
                  <l>Your conjugal ſcenes from all ſkirmiſhes free,</l>
                  <l>In this doth the ſecret of harmony lie,</l>
                  <l>Ne'er begin a duet ev'n a half note too high.</l>
                  <l>Ye ladies tho' vex'd your mild ſpirits may be,</l>
                  <l>Yet, kindly beware of keen repartee;</l>
                  <l>For peace's ſoft boſom thoſe arrows muſt hit</l>
                  <l>Which doubly are pointed with anger and wit.</l>
                  <l>Ye huſbands of argument, chiefly beware,</l>
                  <l>That bane of good humour that frightens the fair,</l>
                  <l>Where reaſon's ſoft tones ſoon in paſſions are drown'd,</l>
                  <l>While happineſs trembles, and flies from the ſound.</l>
                  <l>Oh! both have a care of all haſty replies,</l>
                  <l>On hearing whoſe diſcord the bachelor cries,</l>
                  <l>(While ſnugly he ſmiles on himſelf and his cat)</l>
                  <l>'The ſharp notes of marriage are worſe than the flat.'</l>
                  <l>In uniſon ſweet let your voices agree,</l>
                  <l>While both are maintain'd in the natural key.</l>
                  <l>Thus love ſhall beat time with a conjugal kiſs,</l>
                  <l>And your ſkirmiſh be only the ſkirmiſh of kiſs.</l>
