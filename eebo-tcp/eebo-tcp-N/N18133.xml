            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE BLESSINGS OF AMERICA.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM xvi. 6.</bibl>
               <q>THE LINES ARE FALLEN UNTO ME IN PLEASANT PLACES; YEA, I HAVE A GOODLY HERITAGE.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these words the Psalmist celebrates the agreeable and advantageous situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he was placed by Divine Providence. It was such as administered to his earthly comfort, and tended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his eternal welfare.</p>
            <p>THE like manner of expression may, with propriety, be used by every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can; and it affords, on this auspicious day, a suitable and profitable subject for our meditation. By the choice of it, I shall, at least, avoid the beaten path of a minute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of events during our revolution; and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023504_0006_0FBFCD0ADFF601C0"/>
if the performance disappoint the hopes, or if some things be introduced which would, at any other time, be improper in the pulpit, a judicious and candid audience will readily excuse me.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT incurring the charge of local prejudices, illiberal aspersions of others, or unreasonable partiality to ourselves, we may say, that our country is highly favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; that the <hi>lines,</hi> which measure our inheritance, <hi>are fallen in pleasant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yea,</hi> that we <hi>have a goodly heritage.</hi> This will appear when we consider the natural advantages which we enjoy; the constitution of our civil government; and our religious privileges. Let us take a cursory view of each of these; and then attend to some reflections which the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, together with the occasion, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire.</p>
            <p>FIRST, The natural advantages of our country are many and great. The terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is extensive, the soil luxuriant, the climates and productions various. We
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023504_0007_0FBFCD0CD52C9010"/>
possess in abundance every thing necessary for our support, comfort and strength. The lofty mountains and the fruitful val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the waving forests and the spreading lawns, the magnificent rivers and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious harbours contribute to the delight and accommodation of the inhabitants. The means of exportation abroad, and of intercourse with one another, are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and easy.</p>
            <p>IN the diversity of the advantages which the States enjoy there is a resemblance to the division of the land of Canaan among the tribes of Israel. To Judah was given a country abounding with vines and pasture; to Asher, one plenteous in oil, iron and brass; to Zebulon and Issachar, such as was famous for sea-ports; and thus, were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed among them their respective gifts, which, while they needed not to depend on other nations, taught them the necessity of union among themselves, as conspiring to promote their common welfare. Is not the general description, which is given of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023504_0008_0FBFCD0E5406A9C8"/>
their country, equally, if not more applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our own? <hi>A land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil-olive, and honey; a land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> viii. 7. 8, 9.</note> He, whose <hi>the sea is,</hi> and whose <hi>hands formed the dry land,</hi> hath here lavished his bounty, and, as if on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, reserved the best for the latest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; he hath united, in this one, all the excellencies of the other parts of the earth.</p>
            <p>THOUGH much still remains to be done, yet the improvement of these advantages has been, for the time, uncommonly rapid. Less than two centuries ago, what was this now pleasant country? A dismal wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; the habitation of wild beasts, and of savage men. Where now the populous
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023504_0009_0FBFCD1640B08768"/>
city lifts its spires, the solitary wigwam stood; where commerce spreads its sails, was seen the bark canoe; and where the found of industry is heard, and all the arts of civilized life flourish, indolence, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and ignorance, held a gloomy reign. If our country has, so suddenly, risen into eminence, what may be expected when time has given it maturity, rendered its population complete, and called forth all its exertions? Then will it be rich, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and happy. Then will <hi>her wilderness</hi> become <hi>like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanks giving, and the voice of melody.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Isaiah</hi> V. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As we are not left to depend upon other countries for our necessaries and comforts, so our being removed at so great a distance from them, is no small advantage. We have thus, less temptation to invade, and are less liable to be invaded: we are in less danger of being infected with foreign vices,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023504_0010_0FBFCD18284280D8"/>
and involved in intrigues and wars. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, indeed, that desire of conquest, and love of domination, which have so long actuated the kingdoms of the world, and made man a scourge to man do not actuate our nation. Separated, by Providence, from the continual jealousies, and bloody dissensions of the old world, our endeavour is, to cultivate every useful art, to enjoy in peace, the blessings which Heaven hath bestowed, and to extend them to all within our reach. This is a more noble ambition than Romans everknew; a more just glory than to enlarge our dominion, or seek to build our advancement on the degradation of others.</p>
            <p>IT is cause of regret at this day, that the sword which had been sheathed, is now drawn against some of the Indian tribes. Who does not ardently wish, that peace may be speedily restored; that the natives of this land, instead of being extirpated, may exchange the hatchet for the book of divine knowledge; and that we may be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023504_0011_0FBFCD199E23C648"/>
brought to rejoice together as children of the same Almighty Parent, and partakers of the same common nature! Though it be ordered, in the course of events, that we possess their land, yet we owe them justice and charity; we owe them our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recover them from abasement, that so they may enjoy with us the desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inheritance.</p>
            <p>IN short, when we consider the manner in which this new world has been opened to us, its first settlement, the growing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its inhabitants, the great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges afforded, the prospects still in view, with every circumstance, may we not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress the supreme Ruler of the universe in these beautiful words of the Psalmist? <hi>Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> goodly cedars.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023504_0012_0FBFCD1C7ADBBBD8"/>
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Psalm,</hi> lxxx. 8—11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT all these natural advantages would be in vain, were we deprived of liberty. We could then neither improve, nor enjoy them. Oppression breaks the spirits of men, and sinks them into gross and stupid ignorance. Time was, when Demosthenes shook all Greece with the tempest of his eloquence; and when Cicero, in his flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strains, gained on the Roman Senate. Greece and Rome were then free. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is now gone, and their glory is no more. Time was, when there were seven churches in Asia, and pure religion beamed, where now ignorance and superstition brood, and where the Turk, dreaming of a Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan paradise, sleeps his life away. The inhabitants of these places seem, at present, to be a different race of men. Even the milk and honey of Canaan are long since converted into gall and wormwood. The finest country, when enslaved, is a region,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023504_0013_0FBFCD1F0E31DD88"/>
of darkness, poverty, and barbarity, in which human beings drag out a miserable existence.</p>
            <l>"What is life?</l>
            <l>"'Tis not to stalk about and draw fresh air</l>
            <l>"From time to time, or gaze upon the sun:</l>
            <l>"'Tis—to be free. When liberty is gone,</l>
            <l>"Life grows insipid, and has lost its relish.</l>
            <p>This leads me to remark,</p>
            <p>IN the second place, That we inherit <hi>pleasant places,</hi> on account of the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our civil government. This has not been imposed upon us by the will of a conqueror, nor received through necessity, but formally and deliberately chosen by ourselves. When obliged to separate from that empire to which we belonged, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular constitutions were framed by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral States, and articles of confederation for the government of the whole, on such principles as were then judged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the equality in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and consistent with public peace and tranquility.</p>

IT becomes us here, to acknowledge with gratitude, the peaceable and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous manner in which a change, in our national government, has been effected. Experience having shown the defects of the first, another, after long consultation, has been proposed and adopted; yea, amendments again to this have been offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and time, we trust, will bring it to as much perfection as human things will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. We have beheld a people, distant, and various in their habits, united beyond the most sanguine expectation; a constitution formed in the bosom of peace; received by all the States, after full and able discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in each; enforced by no other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons than reason and argument; no other thunder heard than the thunder of debate. Has God, then, at any time, interposed more remarkably for us? Do we not, every thing considered, stand single among all the nations of the earth? Other revolutions may have been more diversified and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, but, surely, none is more honorable
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023504_0015_0FBFCD27D4BEA758"/>
to human nature, and none so likely to produce such happy effects.</p>
            <p>As far as this constitution has been tried, its influence is found to be safe and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. It is a representation of the people from whom all legitimate government is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. It is a government of laws, not o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ergy; to secure and defend; to steer the happy medium between oppression and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness. It is calculated to encourage genius, and bring merit to view from the obscure walks of life. Titles and birth give no claim to rank or precedence; but a capacity for business, with learning, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and virtue, are the surest ways to rise to honor and preferment.</p>
            <p>IT is foreign, however, to my desig<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

celebrate the goodness of God, in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon us the blessing of liberty. How eligible does our situation appear, when we look around us in the world! Only a small part enjoys even the shadow of liberty. The great bulk of mankind are under the most galling and ignominious servitude. A few are exalted to more than men, and the rest made less, to the debasement and reproach of human nature. Surely the distinction in favor of ourselves deserves an honorable mention, and the highest praise is to be ascribed to the <hi>Father of lights, from whom every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CIVIL liberty is a blessing the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, because with it are connected the rights of conscience. Where slavery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails these are always infringed. In this country, as they are well understood, so they are preserved inviolate. This is</p>
            <p>THE last respect in which it appears that we have <hi>a goodly heritage.</hi> Here, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023504_0017_0FBFCD2B92729C48"/>
modes of faith, or worship are established. No undue preference is given to one denomination of religion above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Every one stands upon equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and can prove successful, only by the piety, virtue, learning, and liberality of its professors. Human establishments have always been made engines of state-policy; they have promoted hypocrisy and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: they have perpetuated error, and restrained that free spirit of enquiry which conduces to improvement.</p>
            <p>THE government which Jesus Christ hath instituted in his Church is distinct from the power which appertains to the kingdoms of this world, and it consists in inflicting spiritual pains; in admonitions, reproofs, censures, and exclusion from membership. The members of the Church, indeed, are also members of civil society, and subject to all its laws, so far as is consistent with a good conscience; but the great evil has been in the civil magistrate usurping the throne of Christ and exercising spiritual
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023504_0018_0FBFCD32AD302168"/>
dominion. The Church and the State, no doubt, mutually assist and support one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but they have, too often, been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully blended. The Church asks and needs no assistance except the protection of its rights; and it willingly yields to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government the surest support, by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing knowledge, and promoting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and peace among men.</p>
            <p>RELIGIOUS freedom banished from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other corner of the earth has erected her standard in these States, and kindly invites the oppressed from all quarters to repair hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Here are no fire and faggots, no pains and emoluments of any kind, to force these sentiments, or the other upon them. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion pure and undefiled solicits their regard. The heaven-born maid is not dressed or daubed with human inventions. She trusts to her native charms and asks a willing love.—Here is an asylum for you, our brethren of the old world, whose lives are embittered by the cruel impositions of men; the fruit of whose labours go to support

ANOTHER important reflection on this subject, and the last which shall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is, that the privileges conferred upon us call for our faithful and diligent improvement. Is our country pleasant and fertile? It is our duty to contribute to the advancement of agriculture, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce. Are we a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? It is our duty to support and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age government; to be obedient subjects; to diffuse knowledge among all classes of men, as being the most effectual safe-guard of liberty. Enlighten mankind and you cannot enslave them. Despotic govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes them ignorant and barbarous, and when thus reduced, they are neither able nor willing to break the yoke.</p>
            <p>To call to mind the natural equality of men, to keep alive the spirit of liberty, and to diffuse knowledge and happiness, have given rise to subordinate societies in free States; and these are held out as the great objects of that Society at whose desire I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress you to day. They are plainly and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023504_0029_0FBFCD57DDE42D08"/>
concisely expressed in these word; of their public constitution: "It shall connect in the indissoluble bonds of PATRIOTIC FRIENDSHIP, AMERICAN BRETHREN, of known attachment to the political rights of human nature, and the liberties of this country." Somewhat similar are the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and constitutional Societies in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, and which are at this day the watch-towers of liberty. May we not hope that these Societies will emulate one another, in preventing all sacrilegious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the altar of freedom, and that they will themselves be bright examples of order, decency, and virtue! It is to the honor of that Society, at whose motion we are convened, that under its direction and patronage a <hi>Museum</hi> has been established, to consist, not only of natural curiosities, but of all those writings, either at home, or abroad, which serve to furnish a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete history of this country in its various stages. Many of those curious and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tracts must have, otherwise, been lost. The laudable design of preserving them, is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023504_0030_0FBFCD5988FD1A08"/>
perfectly agreeable to the generous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Society, and indeed, to that public spirit which is so conspicuous in this great and flourishing city.</p>
            <p>ALLOW me only to add, that the name, which this Society has appropriated, affords to the mind a striking contrast of what this country once was, to what it now is; of its once barbarous, to its now civilized state; and if such an association of men have a tendency to introduce a national spirit and character, it will be so far use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for certainly it is the glory, and ought to be the ambition of every one, who makes his residence in this country, to be esteemed an AMERICAN.

though he sublimely rave, he raves in vain. No force of genius, no brilliancy of fancy, and no ornament of language can support his wretched cause. He and his abettors only hasten its downfal. The revolution in France is great—is astonishing—is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. It is, perhaps, not just to say, that the flame was kindled by us, but certainly we contributed to blow and increase it, as France will in other nations; until blaze joining blaze, shall illumine the darkest and remotest corners of the earth.</p>
            <p>IN return for the great and inestimable privileges which we enjoy, let us devote ourselves to the service of God, and be found in the practice of all righteousness. Virtue is highly necessary for the support of order and good government; and the Christian religion powerfully inculcates,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023504_0033_0FBFCD66D8D8AFF0"/>
and leads to the exercise of this virtue. Let us comply with its precepts, and pray for its universal spread and influence. Nothing would so conduce to our national prosperity and happiness. It would make us better citizens, and more disinterested patriots; more happy in ourselves, and more useful to all around us. Before I conclude this discourse, allow me then, as a Minister of the Lord Jesus Christ, to offer you salvation in his name; to remind you, that you must soon leave all terresti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al scenes, and enter upon an eternal and unchangeable state. Be entreated to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>the liberty wherewith Christ makes free;</hi> that so when the kingdoms of this world and the glory of them are no more; yea, when <hi>the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with servent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up,</hi> you may inherit a better country, and live immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal beneath a brighter sun and more ample <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:023504_0034_0FBFCD689DA9EEE0"/>
AND now, while we act on this first stage of our existence, may the Lord <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain peace for us!</hi> May we never hear the drum, the trumpet, and the clang of arms any more in battle; but may peace, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her train religion, knowledge, and liberty, forever dwell with us!</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" Haste thee, fair peace, thy soft'ning power renew,</l>
               <l>" Bless every clime, the old world and the new,</l>
               <l>" In friendly league unite each distant shore,</l>
               <l>" And bid mankind with anger burn no more.</l>
               <l>" Then pure religion's precepts shall prevail;</l>
               <l>" Impartial justice poise her balanc'd scale;</l>
               <l>" Bright liberty shall wanton in the breeze;</l>
               <l>" Innoxious pleasure, philosophic ease;</l>
               <l>" Commerce shall then expand without control,</l>
               <l>" Where coasts extend, or farthest occans roll.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>May wars <hi>cease unto the end of the earth;</hi> and <hi>God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,</hi> give to all nations, <hi>the light of the knowledge of his glory, in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi>

               <l>NOW elevate your hymns of joy,</l>
               <l>With sacred music let these arches ring,</l>
               <l>Patriots your breath employ,</l>
               <l>Your purest incense bring;</l>
               <l>For HE receives the grateful lay,</l>
               <l>Whose matchless all-controling sway,</l>
               <l>Kings, armies, empires, oceans, worlds obey:</l>
               <l>Hence kingdoms fall, while here republics rise</l>
               <l>Reason resumes her rights, dumb superstition dies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Since then from Heav'n fair Liberty descends</l>
               <l>Her bright'ning advent hail;</l>
               <l>'Tis GOD alone emits the high command—</l>
               <l>(His great behests fulfil!)</l>
               <l>See how the patriot-light'ning bends</l>
               <l>Oppression's haughty will;</l>
               <l>Wide rends her deep obscuring vail,</l>
               <l>While waking glory dawns on ev'ry land.</l>

               <l>When usurpation rais'd her head,</l>

               <l>When darkness o'er th' affrighted land was spread,</l>

               <l>Diffuse to earth's remotest bound,</l>
               <l>The blaze of science, and the smile of peace,</l>
               <l>'Till praise resound,</l>
               <l>Thro' ev'ry clime where human voice be sound:</l>
               <l>Advancing on the wings of light,</l>
               <l>Let Freedom still extend her golden chain,</l>
               <l>And while the nations hail th' auspicious fight,</l>
               <l>Commence the blest Immanuel's gentle reign.</l>

Then elevate your hymns of joy,</l>
               <l>With heav'n-taught music let the temple ring,</l>

               <l>Freedom selects the gratulating hour</l>
               <l>To shed her choicest bliss!</l>
