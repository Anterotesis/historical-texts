            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſince 'tis ſo, and the Adverſary will hearken to no Rule or Reaſon, and are entirely addicted to Violence and Oppreſſion; the Law and Light of Nature and of GOD, will allow, yea, it requires repelling of Force by Force.

The Example of <hi>Laiſh</hi> is written for our Admonition; <hi>Judges</hi> xviii. 27, 28. <hi>And they took the Things which</hi> Micah <hi>had made, and the Prieſt which be had, and came unto</hi> Laiſh, <hi>unto a People that were at quiet, and ſecure; and they ſmote them with the Edge of the Sword, and burnt the City with Fire: And there was no Deliverer, becauſe it was far from</hi> Zidon, <hi>and they had no Buſineſs with any Man.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>all Scripture given by Divine Inſpiration is profitable for Inſtruction;</hi> and that <hi>what ſoever was written afore-time, was written for our Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore take Occaſion from the Words of my Text, <hi>firſt,</hi> to characterize or deſcribe, and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> to excite the good Soldier.</p>
            <p>I am then, in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, to deſcribe, or give a brief Sketch of the Character of the good Soldier. And in general, he is One that is of good Courage, and when call'd hereto, plays the Man for his People, and for the Cities of his GOD. And if we come to Particulars, theſe following Things, I conceive, go to make up, and compleat the Character of a good Soldier.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He muſt be of a martial Genius, of a bold and heroick Spirit, and well furniſhed with military Knowledge or Skill in the Art of War.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007576_0009_102D7187B078C0A0"/>If Courage or Conduct be wanting, whether it be in the Officers or Soldiers, what Proſpect can there be of their copying the Example of <hi>Joab,</hi> or his Warriors? of their being a Safeguard and Defence to their Country, and thence anſwering the principal End and Deſign of their Inſtitution and Calling? 'Tis required in Soldiers, eſpecially in their Leaders and chief Officers, that they be well acquainted with what belongs to the Art-Military; that ſo they may be able, in the beſt Manner, to attack and oppoſe, battle, and rout, and vanquiſh the Enemy. One that is a Soldier ought to underſtand the Words of Command; the ſeveral Beats of that great warlike Inſtrument the Drum, together with the Language of the ſhrill high-ſounding Trumpet, that noble, reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and animating Sound: Soldiers ought to underſtand how to march regularly; keep their Ranks and Files; what are the proper Facings; how to make good the Ground; when to advance or ſtand, or turn the Sway of Battle; when to open or cloſe the grim Ridges of War, and how to make a regular, advantageous and ſafe Retreat, as there may be occaſion: They ought to be acquainted with the wiſeſt and beſt Methods of Encamping, of Entrenchment or Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Fortification, of erecting Batteries, Forts, Garriſens or Caſtles, of battering down or ſcaling Walls and Ramparts, and thence forcing the Enemy to ſurrender, and ſubmit themſelves. <hi>Joel</hi> ii. 7, 8, 9. <hi>They ſhall run like mighty Men; they ſhall climb the Wall like Men of War, and they ſhall march every one on his Ways, and they ſhall not break their Ranks, neither ſhall one thruſt another;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007576_0010_102D7C4212216738"/>they ſhall run to and fro in the City; they ſhall run upon the Wall; they ſhall climb up upon the Houſes; they ſhall enter in at the Windows.</hi> Knowledge and Underſtanding in theſe Things, will inſpire Courage; whereas the Want of it tends to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate, diſanimate, and render Men puſillanimous and cowardly; and Cowardice evermore cuts the Nerves and Sinews of adventurous Attempts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Furthermore, 'tis required in Soldiers, that they be not only Men of Courage and Conduct, of martial Accompliſhments, of Activity, and an enterprizing Genius; but that they be loyal to their King, and Lovers of their Country: Of this we have <hi>Joab,</hi> and his valiant Soldiers, for an Example.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Soldier ſhould be a Man of Religion, a Chriſtian Temper of Mind and Conduct, a pure Conſcience, an upright ſelf-approving Mind, Faith, and a good Life: This alſo contributes towards making them of good Courage, and prompting them to <hi>play the Men for</hi> their <hi>People, and for the Cities of their GOD.</hi> A ſtrict Regard to Diſcipline and good Order, Temperance, Sobriety, Mortification and Self-Denial, and good Decorum, is no ſmall Embelliſhment to the Character of them that are in the Militia, and wear the honorary Title of Soldiers, and tends to make them, under GOD, our <hi>Decus ac Tutamen,</hi> our Glory and our Defence. Faith and Religion in an Army, muſt needs have a great Tendency to engage the Divine Preſence with them, without which they can expect little Succeſs. This makes them <hi>ſtrong and very couragious, bolder than Lions, ſwifter than Eagles;</hi> now they <hi>wax valiant in Fight,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007576_0011_102D7C45BAC25FA8"/>and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens:</hi> Like David, <hi>run thro' a Troop, and leap over a Wall; purſue their Enemies, and overtake them; beat them ſmall as the Duſt, and tread them down as Mire in the Streets:</hi> Now <hi>One chaſes a Thouſand, and Ten put ten Thouſand to Flight.</hi> A ſtrict and ſacred Regard to Truth and Honeſty, Juſtice and Equity, in a Soldier, has a mighty Tendency to fill his Heart with Courage and Valour. A Soldier that is a Man of Religion, a devout Man, a Man of Prayer, a juſt Man, one that can rule his own Spirit, bridle and govern his Tongue, keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, and is ſober, chaſte and temperate in all Things, will not be aſham'd or afraid; but will <hi>ſpeak with the Enemies in the Gate;</hi> will not fear to look his Enemy in the Face, to ſtand Foot to Foot, and meaſure Arms with him; for he doth not <hi>fear Death with any Amazement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the true Knowledge of God, and Truſt in him, is one needful Qualification of a Soldier, is plain from <hi>Dan.</hi> xi. 32. <hi>The People that do know their GOD, ſhall be ſtrong, and do Exploits:</hi> The Oppoſite to theſe are ſuch as <hi>do wickedly againſt the Covenant,</hi> and may be corrupted by Flattery or Bribery, to ſerve the Worſt of Intereſts, to engage with the Vileſt of Men, to promote their wicked Deſigns, to join with Antichriſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating the greateſt Barbarities and Cruelties, under Pretences of Religion, thinking they are doing God Service, while they are killing his Children.</p>
            <p>Since it is evident, that the Calling and Buſineſs of Soldiers is what Chriſtianity allows, and gives
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007576_0012_102D7C47B688E830"/>Countenance to; ſince to be a Soldier, and fight the LORD's Battles, is not inconſiſtent with the Character and Life of a Chriſtian, every Soldier ought to be a Chriſtian, and in Behaviour as becometh Holineſs. He that, under the Light of Revelation, lacketh theſe Things, hath <hi>denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt directs all, and conſequently Soldiers, <hi>to take to 'em the whole Armour of God, to ſtand having their Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, and their Feet ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel, taking the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the World of God; praying always with all Prayer and Supplication, in the Spirit;</hi> and in the Exerciſe of theſe military Virtues, faithfully to employ themſelves fighting againſt not only <hi>Fleſh and Blood, but Principalities and Powers, and the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, and ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in high Places, till they have overcome thro' the Blood of the Lamb; are Conquerors, and more than Conquerors, thro' him that hath loved us.</hi> And to inſtruct us, that Soldiers ought to be Men of Piety and Virtue, muſt needs be the Deſign of the Spirit of Truth, in tranſmitting down to us, in the ſacred Records, the Examples of ſo many famous and renowned Warriors, who feared God and kept his Precepts, who <hi>thro' Faith ſubdued Kingdoms, quenched the Violence of Fire, eſcaped the Edge of the Sword, out of Weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in Fight,</hi> &amp;c. The Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Inſtance, the Friend of God, whoſe Victory, and triumphant Return from the Slaughter of the four Kings,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007576_0013_102D7C4994192440"/>accompanied with his ſmall but brave and gallant Train-band, is recorded to his immortal Honour; —the Example of <hi>David,</hi> the Man after God's own Heart, who made <hi>God his Truſt from his Youth,</hi> and was alſo <hi>a Man of War from his Youth,</hi> who <hi>through God did valiantly, and trod down his Enemies;</hi> —the Example of that pious young Hero King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who for the Sake of his People, and the Cities of his God, jeopardiz'd his Life, and even ſacrificed it in a Battle of the Warriors, attended with <hi>confuſed Noiſe, and Garments rolled in Blood.</hi>— And what ſhall I more ſay? for the Time would ſail me, to tell of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of <hi>Gideon,</hi> of <hi>Barak,</hi> of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and of <hi>Jephthe,</hi> and many others, whoſe ſignal Courage and wife Conduct, and remarkable Succeſſes, were undoubtedly in no ſmail Meaſure, owing to their Faith and Hope in GOD, and to their being under the governing Influence of Religion, fearing God, and keeping his Ways. And whoever conſiders the Directions given to the Soldiers by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> muſt be ſenſible, that this is one Thing requiſite to finiſh the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one that will be likely to <hi>play the Man,</hi> and act the Part of a good Soldier.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As Soldiers would be what they ought to be, and act in Character, they muſt be diſpoſed to obey their Leaders and commanding Officers. Murmurings and Mutinies among Soldiers, and Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witchcraft, muſt needs be an ill Omen, and have a dark, threatning and diſaſterous Aſpect upon the Succeſs of the Campaign. If Soldiers deſert their Poſt, or fly from their Colours, or deſpiſe to obey their Commanders; Defeat and Loſs of Victory, muſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007576_0014_102D7C4C02F69738"/>needs enſue: Nor is the Rebel ſafe; but is awfully expos'd to an untimely Death; to be like <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſuddenly chaſed out of the World, and driven into Darkneſs: He has juſt Ground to fear, that Vengeance will not ſuffer him to live; — that he ſhall be devoured with the Sword, or by ſome other Means be forced <hi>to deſcend to Hell, with all his Weapons of War;</hi>

Is not that written for our Admonition, <hi>Judges</hi> v. 15, 16, 17. <hi>For the Diviſions of</hi> Reuben <hi>there were great Thought; of Heart: Why abodeſt thou among the Sheep-folds, to bear the Bleatings of the Flocks? Why did</hi> Dan <hi>abide in the Ships?</hi> Aſher <hi>continued on the Sea-ſhore,</hi> &amp;c.—This their not joining their Brethren in the Expedition, had a Tendency to diſcourage their Hearts, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Hands, and prevent the Succeſs of their Enterprize; and therefore was a Thing highly criminal: And again, <hi>v.</hi> 23, <hi>Curſe ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>(ſaid the Angel of the Lord,) curſe ye bitterly, the Inhabitants thereof; becauſe they came not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi> A Rebel in an Army is no better. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 4. <hi>No Man that warreth entangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life; that he may pleaſe him who hath choſen him to be a Soldier.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007576_0015_102D7C4D90A8E098"/>
Thus I have given a brief Sketch of the Character of a good Soldier, and ſhewn what Qualifications they muſt have, in order to their <hi>playing the Men for their People, and for the Cities of their GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Thing propoſed, was to excite the Soldier thus furniſhed to his Work, to a due Diſcharge of his Duty;—which I now heartily do; tho' it was with much Reluctance I undertook this Work, conſcious to my ſelf how unequal I was to the Taſk, and that I am, of all my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the miniſterial Order, perhaps the moſt unſkillful in military Matters.</p>
            <p>And it may now be expected, that I do this in a particular Addreſs to the military Company, at the Requeſt of whoſe honourable COLONEL
<note n="†" place="bottom">Col NATHAN WHITING, of New-Haven.</note> I ſtand in this Place.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, We rejoice to ſee ſuch a Number who make ſo good a Figure, and ſuch a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Appearance, who have willingly offered yourſelves, and are inliſted into the Service of your KING and COUNTRY, and expect e'er long to go upon the intended Expedition, for the Defence of his Majeſty's Rights and Dominions in this our NORTH-AMERICA: My Heart is towards you, my Brethren and Friends, and I wiſh you <hi>a Bleſſing out of the Houſe of the LORD:</hi> GOD Almighty bleſs you, protect and proſper you; <hi>teach your Hands to war, and your Fingers to fight;</hi> give you Courage and Conduct, and make you the Terror of your Enemies, the <hi>Beauty of our Iſrael,</hi> our Safety and Defence: <hi>God by your Refuge and Strength, a very preſent Help in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007576_0016_102D7C4F299566A8"/>Trouble; the Lord of Hoſts be with you; the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>be your Refuge:</hi> Selah.</p>
            <p>And now, what an Honour will it be to you, and to us, if it ſhall appear that you have <hi>proved your Armour,</hi> and that each of you is <hi>like the Son of a King,</hi> like the Princes of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> for martial Skill, Valour and Proweſs? If you prove expert in War, <hi>wax valiant in Fight, and put to Flight the Armies</hi> of them who are the Aggreſſors, and are ſeeking a Quarrel againſt us; how will this heighten the Glory of your Company, and tend to endear and eternize your Memories? And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all of your Order and Profeſſion. Our Lives and Properties, our Religion and Liberty of Conſcience, lie at Stake, and we may expect e'er long to be deprived of 'em, by thoſe unreaſonable and wicked Men, that froward and perverſe Generation of Children, in whom there is no Faith, except Men of your Character and Improvement, except our Militia, our Men in Armour, are inſtrumental in the Hand of Providence, to prevent the impending and important Evil, and deliver us out of the Hands of them that would fain ſpoil us.</p>
            <p>With ſuch Views, we would hope you have put on your Harneſs, and we truſt you will be ambitious to merit the Encomium given of thoſe heroick and celebrated Warriors, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> i. 22. <hi>From the Blood of the Slain, from the Fat of the Mighty, the Bow of</hi> Jonathan <hi>turned not back, and the Sword of</hi> Saul <hi>returned not empty.</hi> The MOST HIGH has ſtiled himſelf a MAN OF WAR, to denote the Divine Agency in the Victories and Triumphs of his People over their Enemies:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007576_0017_102D7185F8F13988"/>And 'tis noted, that when the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> made War with the <hi>Hagarites,</hi> they were helped againſt them, becauſe the War was of GOD: The Cauſe you are call'd to engage in, is no doubt the Cauſe of GOD; and methinks you may hear the GOD of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying to you, <q>This Matter belongs to you, ariſe and do it, and I will be with you.</q> Since the Race is not always to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong; we hope you will all be greatly concerned to ſecure an Intereſt in the Favour of God, and engage the Divine Preſence with you: All of you have Reaſon to ſay as <hi>Moſes, LORD if thy Preſence go not with us, carry us not up hence;</hi> and to repeat the Prayer of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Wilt not thou, O GOD, go forth with our Armies! Give us Help from Trouble; for vain is the Help of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If GOD be with you, and on your Side, you may comfort yourſelves and one another, with theſe Words: <hi>Numb.</hi> xxiii. 8. <hi>How can they curſe, whom God hath not curſed? Iſa</hi> xli. 10. <hi>Fear thou not; for I am with thee; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee,</hi> &amp;c. In this Caſe, you may ſay, as that renowned Warrior, and Glory of his Time and Day; <hi>Tho' an Hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my Heart ſhall not fear; tho' War ſhould ariſe againſt me, in this will I be confident; the Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what Man ſhall do unto me; yea, tho' I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil; for thou art with me,</hi> &amp;c. Now you may humbly expect, that <hi>the Lord ſtrong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle, will break the Arrows of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007576_0018_102D7C5533C50188"/>the Bow, the Shield and the Sword of your Enemies,</hi> and crown you with Victory.

Infidelity, Profaneſs, Iniquity, Senſuality, Intemperance, Luxury and Debauchery, Lying, Stealing, profane Swearing, horrid Imprecations, helliſh Execrations, and Curſings, (but too common in Camps) theſe tend to make the Camp <hi>a Curſe,</hi> and to trouble it: <hi>Joſhua</hi> vii. 11, 22. This muſt needs provoke the holy ſin-hating GOD to ſtand afar, and remove from the Camp. If thoſe that ſtand in the <hi>Front,</hi> face the Artillery of Heaven, defy and dare Almighty Vengeance, and challenge divine Thunderbolts, by ſuffering their Tongue to be ſet on Fire of Hell, by ſetting their Mouths againſt the Heavens, belching out great ſwelling Words of Blaſphemy, and diſcharging frightful Vollies of Curſes, one after another, enough to aſtoniſh and make the Pillars of Heaven and Earth to tremble; and thoſe in the <hi>Rear</hi> are in this Way pouring forth the <hi>Poiſon of Dragons, and the cruel venom of Aſps;</hi> what can be expected, but that when they come to face Danger, and look Death in the Face in an Encounter,—their Hearts will <hi>meditate Terror, melt like Wax in the Midſt of their Bowels!</hi> having juſt Ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that God will now pour out upon 'em <hi>the Fury of his Anger, and the Strength of Battle; that the Sword will cut 'em off, and cat 'em up like the Canker-Worm;</hi> that God will viſit for theſe Things, and that his Soul will be avenged on ſuch an Army as this!
