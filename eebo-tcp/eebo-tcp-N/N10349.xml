            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AS this is the laſt day of the firſt Century, and compleats one hundred years ſince Wrentham was granted to be a town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I have been importuned by ſome to deliver a diſcourſe on ſo obſervable a period.</p>
            <p>I did at firſt decline it for ſeveral reaſons; the principal of which is, my being but very ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with matter for a work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of my being unacquainted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by private records, or particular traditional accounts, with the ſpecial circumſtances of the original and progreſs of this town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013136_0004_0F8EC48015440BC8"/>
From this is eaſily ſeen what a diſadvantage I am under to preach on the preſent occaſion. And tho' at the ſollicitation of ſome of you, I make the attempt; yet I fear, I muſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fail your expectations: there being no more than a few brief hints I can poſſibly give you, relative to this ſettlement.</p>
            <p>However, though we may not pretend ſo to trace the ſpecial circumſtances of the original and progreſs of this town, as from theſe alone to collect ſuitable and ſufficient matter for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and pious entertainment; yet we <hi>may</hi> from theſe, in connection with ſome of the ancient things of this country.</p>
            <p>And indeed it may not be improper; but both pertinent and profitable, on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to reflect on thoſe things which laid the foundation of our preſent eſtabliſhment, and from whence have ariſen <hi>this</hi> and all other towns and churches through the land.</p>
            <p>It has been the practice of God's people in all ages to commemorate the ancient things God hath done for them, and to improve them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious purpoſes.</p>
            <p>That this was practiſed by the pious and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Jews is evident from the book of pſalms, and divers other parts of ſacred writ, and <hi>particularly</hi> from the words of my text—"Theſe are ancient things."</p>
            <p>And though we may not ſo clearly ſee, at this diſtance of time, what religious purpoſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013136_0005_0F8EC480DD653520"/>
and mentioning thoſe ancient things, referred to in my text, might ſerve; yet we may be certain of <hi>this,</hi> that it was ſome how ſerviceable and is ſo ſtill to the church of God,—for "all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,—<hi>for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in righteouſneſs.</hi>"<note n="¶" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So then without taking any ſpecial notice of thoſe ancient things to which my text refers, I ſhall make uſe of the words to lead your tho'ts and meditations—to the original, or firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this country,—its riſe and progreſs—and particularly of this town.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall lead your thoughts back to the original or firſt ſettlement of this country, and ſay ſomething of the riſe and occaſion of it.</p>
            <p>Now in order to know the occaſion of our fore-fathers coming into this part of the world,—or the reaſon of their removing from the land of their nativity to ſettle on theſe American ſhores; let it be obſerved,—That at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reign of the popiſh Queen Mary in England, many of thoſe who were ſincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the reformation and in caſting off all the ſuperſtitions of Rome, being much alarmed at the furious ſtorm of perſecution which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended coming on, fled abroad for ſafety. And, having opportunity there to obſerve the worſhip and diſcipline of foreign churches, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them thought that theſe churches had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the reformation to a greater degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, than had been done in England.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013136_0006_0F8EC4816DA3CEB0"/>
Hence, upon their return home, at the happy acceſſion of the proteſtant Queen Elizabeth to the crown, they became very zealous for a more perfect reformation in the church of England, agreable to what they had ſeen in the proteſtant churches abroad. This is the party who were at firſt diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by that of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> or <hi>Diſciplinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and now uſually of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe good and conſciencious people, though far from being pleaſed with many things that were practiſed, and required of them, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them unſcriptural and rather the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men than the appointments of God; yet many of them thought it prudence for the preſent to continue in the communion of the eſtabliſhed church, and wait for better days: hoping for a further reformation, and that their diſcipline and worſhip might in time be brought nearer to the purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But after long and fruitleſs waiting, finding all attempts unſucceſsful for obtaining that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they ſo earneſtly deſired and prayed for, and being very hardly treated in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy times becauſe they could not ſubmit to all things impoſed on them, they were many of them hereby drove to a more open ſeparation from the things that were by law eſtabliſhed. And not being ſuffered peaceably to worſhip God according to the dictates of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in their native country, they ſought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Some removed into other parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and found that comfort in foreign churches which was denied them at home. Others ſought
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013136_0007_0F8EC482E7E82408"/>
a refuge from the ſtorm in ſome quiet receſs of America, "Here," as one ſays, "they hoped ſtill to enjoy the freedoms and privileges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh government and to enlarge the Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: Here they hoped to be the bleſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſpreading the goſpel of Chriſt among the natives: here they hoped to proſecute the deſign of a ſpiritual reformation and entail pure religion, with liberty of conſcience, as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt heritage, unto their children in ſucceeding generations."</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch excellent views as theſe our pious Anceſtors tranſplanted themſelves, families and eſtates into theſe remote regions of the earth. Late in the year 1620, arrived to America thoſe good people who laid the foundation of the moſt ancient Church and Colony of Plimouth.</p>
            <p>Sometime in June 1629 arrived at Salem,<note n="¶" place="bottom">The Indian name was Naumkeak, but now called Salem from that in Pſalm 72. 2.</note> that moſt ancient town of the Maſſachuſetts, the original ſettlers of that part of the country.</p>
            <p>In the ſummer of 1630 came over thoſe who firſt imbodied into church order at Charleſtown; but the greater part of theſe, not very well lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſituation, removed over to the other ſide of Charles-river and ſettled the town of Boſton.</p>
            <p>Theſe firſt ſettlers were few in number—our Fathers were then in a wilderneſs-condition; ſeeing nothing round them but uncultivated wilds
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013136_0008_0F8EC483C915F938"/>
and ſavage creatures; diſtant a thouſand leagues from their native country; enduring various hardſhips, wants and ſtraits.</p>
            <p>But this pious people thought nothing too much to be done and ſuffered, for the procuring thoſe happy goſpel privileges and religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which too many among us at this day make but little account of. And with great labour and fatigue, and no ſmall expence to themſelves (though none to the crown) was it that they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and ſettled this land.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the occaſion and beginning of the ſettlement of this country by the Engliſh.—And theſe are ancient things.</p>
            <p>We are in the next place to give ſome brief account of the growth and progreſs of it.</p>
            <p>Now this country flouriſhed under the ſmiles of heaven ſo remarkably, that it is thought ſcarce any hiſtory in the world affords a parallel. It has been remarked by thoſe who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to give us an account of the riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this country by the Engliſh, that ſeveral repeated attempts for the ſettlement of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh plantation in the bay of Maſſachuſetts, upon worldly views, proved abortive; though under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by gentlemen of conſiderable powers and eſtates, and attended with many ſervants. But it pleaſed God wonderfully to bleſs and diſtinguiſh thoſe who came here upon a religious account, and crown their noble enterprize with glorious ſucceſs. It was <hi>that</hi> God, who led the tribes of Iſrael through the ſea and the wilderneſs, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013136_0009_0F8EC48476F44C60"/>
whom the ſeas and the winds obey, that conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Fathers over the wide and hazardous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean—that prepared a ſanctuary for them in this obſcure corner of the earth, and gave them the land of the heathen for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We have heard with our ears; our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have told us theſe ancient things,—how God did drive out the heathen and plant them. They got not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſword, nor did their own arm ſave them, but his right hand, his holy arm, and the light of his countenance, becauſe he had a favor unto them. God's preſence with our Fathers was their ſhield, their ſtrength, and defence, and the ſource of all their proſperity, temporal and ſpiritual,—of their external and moral tranquility and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Through the influence of the Spirit of grace, they had not only the form but the power of religion among them: they were in general pious towards God and righteous towards men: And "godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is and of that which is to come."<note n="*" place="bottom">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note> And "righteouſneſs exalteth a nation,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 14. 34.</note> God bleſſed and increaſed them greatly.<note n="‡" place="bottom">For the above hiſtorical accounts, &amp;c. I have been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Prince'</hi>s chronology and the Rev. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Foxcroft'</hi>s hiſtorical and practical obſervations on the riſe and primitive ſtate of <hi>New-England;</hi> but chiefly to the latter: How free an uſe I have made of them may be ſeen by peruſing them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And hence aroſe in ſo ſhort a time ſo many ſettlements and plantations. The people broke forth on the right hand and on the left and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013136_0010_0F8EBA750624AD78"/>
themſelves on all ſides. The wilderneſs and ſolitary places became inhabited and the deſerts bloſſomed as the roſe. Towns were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and where there were hideous woods, fields ſoon appeared white unto harveſt.</p>
            <p>And this leads us, as was propoſed, to look back to the original plantation and ſettlement of <hi>this</hi> town and the churches in it;—to obſerve ſome of the ſteps of Divine Providence in <hi>our</hi> riſe, growth, and eſtabliſhment as at this day. I have been careful to obtain as ſuccinct and juſt an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe ancient things as I could, though not altogether ſuch an one as I ſhould have been glad to have done. However, what I have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected is as follows:</p>
            <p>This townſhip was originally contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of Dedham. We are told in the Rev. Mr. Dexter's century-ſermon—"that the town of Dedham was the 16th or 18th ſettlement from the firſt beginning of the country—and that the firſt inhabitants of that town came from ſeveral parts of England; few of them known to one another before they came over." And they are ſaid to have been a ſerious, godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and I ſuppoſe removed from England into theſe parts upon the ſame religious principles that others before them had done.</p>
            <p>From this place and people originated all, or moſt of the firſt ſettlers of this town.</p>
            <p>This place, as was ſaid before, being contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the limits of Dedham, ſundry of the inhabitants of that town, after they had been up

to take a view, obtained grants of land here.

            <p>In a few years after this plantation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, the proprietors applied to the town of Dedham to ſet them off; which they did March 27th, 1661. About twelve years after this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> October 15th, 1673, they petitioned the General Court to be e<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected into a townſhip by the name of Wrentham; which name, as I have been informed, was deſired becauſe ſome of them came from a town of that name in old England. And it appears from the ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of this town that their petition was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and they made a townſhip the very ſame day they applied to the Court for it:—and that their deſire was gratified as to the name. This was done about 53 years after the arrival of the firſt Fathers of this country, and ONE HUNDRED YEARS from this day.</p>
            <p>There were 16 families here when the town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was granted.</p>
            <p>That the firſt ſettlers of this place were in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a religious ſort of people, and that the truth and ways of God—mutual aſſiſtance and brotherly love were things regarded by them, ſome what appears from their petition to Court to be a townſhip: but more eſpecially from the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013136_0012_0F8EBA74E19503F0"/>
covenant of aſſociation which they entered into, in their infant ſtate: and upon the ſigning of which, as I ſuppoſe, they admitted others to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with them.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, before ever they were erected into a townſhip (tho' ſo few in number) they were careful to have the word of God regularly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and procured Mr. Samuel Man,<note n="§" place="bottom">Mr. Samuel Man, I am told, was born in Cambridge, and was graduated at Harvard College in the year 1665.</note> a young candidate, for this purpoſe: not being willing to live like the heathen tho' they dwelt in the wilderneſs. This worthy and pious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman continued to diſpenſe the word of God to them till March 30th, 1676; when the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were obliged to draw off by reaſon of an Indian war.<note n="‖" place="bottom">This was Phillip's war, an Indian Sachem or King at Mount-Hope, now Briſtol.</note> This was a little more than two years and an half after they had been made a townſhip.</p>
            <p>Through the preventing goodneſs of God and their ſeaſonable withdraw, no lives were cut off by the heathen. However, the enemy came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the town after they were gone, and burnt all their dwellings except two,<note n="†" place="bottom">What ſaved theſe two dwellings from the flames was their being infected with the ſmall-pox, of which the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by ſome means or other had gotten information.</note> if my informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been good.

               </note> And becauſe it ſeems to indicate ſomething of their pious and good temper of mind, I ſhall take the liberty of tranſcribing a few words, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—"We the ſubſcribers—having formerly had our reſidence in Wrentham, but by thoſe ſad and ſolemn diſpenſations of God's providence were removed: yet deſiring that a work for the honor of God and the good and comfort of ourſelves and ours might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain engaged in, and promoted at that place: therefore our purpoſe is to return thither, God willing," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So great was their veneration for Mr. Man, and ſo acceptable had been his labors among them, that it was their earneſt deſire he ſhould return with them. Accordingly they choſe and ſent a committee to treat with him about it. Mr. Man, as I have been informed, was then preaching at Milton, and already had a call to ſettle in the work of the miniſtry there, or Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton people were about to give him one. But ſo great was his affection for the people of Wren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, and ſo deſirous was he of that plantation's
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013136_0014_0F8EC487452E6E68"/>
going on, that he complied with their requeſt. Accordingly, he and divers of the inhabitants returned to Wrentham again,. Aug. 21ſt, 1680, four years and ſome months after they drew off on account of the Indian war.</p>
            <p>In the year 1681, the inhabitants of this Town agreed to erect an houſe for the public worſhip of God, before the year 1684. And probably between theſe dates the firſt meeting-houſe was built.</p>
            <p>Mr. Man continued diſpenſing the word to them, though not ordained over them, till the year 1692; in which year, on the 13th day of April, a Church was gathered here; conſiſting of ten members (including Mr. Man) who imbodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in church fellowſhip by ſolemn covenant. And Mr. Man was ordained over the church and congregation the ſame day.<note n="*" place="bottom">He preached his own ordination-ſermon, from 1 Cor. IV. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it were the difficulties they had to conflict with in their infancy, or what was the reaſon that it was ſo long after their incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before a church was gathered and Mr. Man ordained, I am not able to ſay: but it was more than eighteen years.</p>
            <p>In the year 1719, on May 22d, our church-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords ſay, "that the Rev. Samuel Man gave up the ghoſt, in the 72d year of his age." And by a private record put into my hands by one of the pariſh,—he died in the 49th year of his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013136_0015_0F8EC4876416A5C0"/>
faithful miniſtry; ſo it is expreſſed. But this muſt be underſtood as including all the time he preached in this place before his ordination: for from <hi>that</hi> to his death was but about twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven years.</p>
            <p>By what I have heard of him he was a man of good erudition and an accompliſhed preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, pious and faithful.<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the firſt men, if not the firſt, in this Province, and who was eſteemed a good judge of the powers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of men, ſaid of Mr. Man that "he was not only a very <hi>good,</hi> but a very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> man."</note> He lived greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his people and died greatly lamented by them.

            </p>
            <p>After the death of Mr. Man the church and congregation here were deſtitute of a paſtor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven months; when this breach was made up in the happy ſettlement of the Rev. Henry Meſſinger, who was ordained to the paſtoral office December 5th, 1719.</p>
            <p>About two years after his ordination, in the year 1721, the ſecond houſe for the public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God was built in this place, larger and more commodious than the former. Hither, to this ſecond erected houſe did all the tribes of the Lord, or in other words all the people in the town repair to worſhip, 'till Auguſt 29th, 1737: when by the good hand of God upon them they were ſo multiplied, proſpered and ſucceeded, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013136_0016_0F8EC48AD980F610"/>
they became two bands; for the people of the weſt part of the town, at their requeſt, were then ſet off into a diſtinct pariſh by themſelves. The brethren being diſmiſſed from this church here, were formed into a new church-body there, February 16th, 1738. And the Rev. Elias Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was unanimouſly called to ſettle in the work of the ſacred miniſtry among them on the 23d of March following: and was ſolemnly ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them on the 8th day of November, the ſame year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Meſſinger continued in this firſt pariſh, greatly labouring in word and doctrine, till it pleaſed the Sovereign Lord of life and death to put a period to his life and work nearly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note n="‡" place="bottom">He was confined but a few days, and I think preached the ſabbath, or the ſabbath but one before his death.</note> And when he was diſmiſſed from his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful labours here below, we truſt he was received to his glorious reward above; and that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable number of his flock and others will be his joy and crown in the day of Chriſt's appearing.</p>
            <p>He departed this life March 30th, 1750, in the 55th year of his age, and 32d year of his faithful miniſtry.<note n="§" place="bottom">He was a gentleman of unblemiſhed reputation, and highly eſteemed for his piety and virtue. He had the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a plain, faithful, affectionate, and profitable preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And though he was but of a ſlender, feeble conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he was abundant in labours among the people of his charge, and ſpared no pains for promoting the intereſt of the Redeemer and the good of ſouls. It is no wonder then, that when all the congregation ſaw he was dead they mourned for <hi>him,</hi> as Iſrael did for Aaron.</note>

After his deceaſe, the church and congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here were deſtitute near nine months, which brings down the time to the preſent ſettlement.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The preſent paſtor was ordained December 5th, 1750.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Rev. Elias Haven, paſtor of the weſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, was taken off from his miniſterial labours by bodily weakneſs, contracting a conſumptive habit, for ſeveral years, and was able to preach but very little during that time,<note n="¶" place="bottom">I think Mr. Haven preached but very ſeldom for five or ſix years or more before his death.—And I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it to the honor of that people, that they procured preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of that time at their own charge, or with but very little expence to their paſtor, and allowed him the whole, or moſt of his annual ſtipend, till he removed to that world where we truſt he is now reaping better than thoſe carnal things.</note> to the no ſmall afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his pariſhioners who were thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his excellent ſermons and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which they were very paſſionately fond of.</p>
            <p>After ineffectual endeavors for the recovery of his health by change of air, uſe of medicine, and an exact regimen, he fell a prey to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and departed this life Auguſt 10th, 1754, in the 41ſt year of his age and 16th of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. He was eſteemed a gentleman of good powers and abilities, happily gifted and well furniſhed and qualified, for the work of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry—A man of undiſſembled piety and virtue, and truly faithful in the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him by the great Head of the Church. During his long continued weakneſs he appeared to be far from an impatient ſpirit and temper,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013136_0018_0F8EC48CAB7A10E0"/>
and very much reſigned to the all-diſpoſing will of his heavenly Father. When the important hour of his departure drew near, he appeared calm and ſerene—Neither from his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor from any word or action, could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the leaſt perturbation or trouble of mind,—they rather indicated a divine tranquility and compoſure of ſoul. The king of terrors being thus diſarmed of his ſting, he ſeemed to welcome his approach, and to view him as a kind meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of peace, ſent from Him who is the Lord of death to ſet his ſoul at liberty from a world of ſin, cares, and ſorrows, to go to a world of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and everlaſting reſt.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he chearfully reſigned up his ſpirit into the gracious arms of his Redeemer, <hi>big</hi> with the hopes and expectations of entering into his Maſter's joy.—Nor have I ever found any that were diſpoſed to think that theſe were but the hopes of a ſelf-deceived hypocrite,—but all rather tho't them to be well founded, and that while he was lamented on earth, He in his better part was triumphing in the regions of bliſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">The author was perſonally acquainted with Mr. Haven,—had intimate converſe with him, and was with him not long before his death; therefore had opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſomething of the flame and temper of his mind dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his long weakneſs and at the cloſing ſcene.</note>

Ye yourſelves can witneſs not only to the purity of their doctrine, but how holily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably they walked before you in love.

                  <p>Both of theſe gentlemen left widows and iſſue, and each has a ſon in the miniſtry,—The Rev. James Meſſinger paſtor of the firſt church at Aſhford in Connecticut: And the Rev. Thomas Haven paſtor of the ſecond church at Reading in this province.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Meſſinger's widow ſometime after his deceaſe married Deacon Jonathan Simſon of Boſton, and after the deceaſe of her laſt huſband returned to Wrentham, and now remains a widow among us in an advanced age.

            <p>After Mr. Haven's deceaſe the weſt pariſh was vacant about ſix years, when the breach was made up in the happy ſettlement of the Rev. Caleb Barnum, who was ordained to the paſtoral office June 4th, 1760. He carried on the work of the Lord there,—faithfully performing the work of the miniſtry, 'till unhappy difficulties ariſing and increaſing among them ſo broke the harmony between him and a number of his pariſhioners, that he thought it his duty to aſk a diſmiſſion from his paſtoral relation to them. And (though with reluctance as to many if not as to the moſt of them) they yielded to his requeſt and he was honourably diſmiſſed March 6th, 1768.<note n="‡" place="bottom">The Rev.

            <p>I might add, that beſides thoſe in the miniſtry, this town and the churches in it have been favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many ſerious, godly, and uſeful perſons who have their names and memories yet alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. But not to dwell upon theſe things.</p>
            <p>How greatly hath God increaſed you! It has been obſerved to you that when this townſhip was granted there were but 16 families in it: and it is computed that there are now at leaſt 460 families, and 2600 ſouls. And it is thought that this firſt precinct contains more perſons than were in the whole town when the weſt pariſh was ſet off, about 36 years ago.<note n="§" place="bottom">Some among us are of the mind that there is a greater number of ſouls in the <hi>ſecond</hi> pariſh than there was in the whole town when that pariſh was ſet off.</note>

            <p>I need not tell you that this is the third houſe, in which we are now worſhipping, that has been built for God in this part of the town: nor yet that it is a much more elegant ſtructure than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the former.<note n="‖" place="bottom">This third meeting-houſe was finiſhed in the year 1766, and is a very comely, decent houſe: but ſome gentlemen are diſpoſed to think that there is one thing wanting in what is called the <hi>Belfry,</hi> which might give a greater propriety to that name, and be not only ornamental, but very convenient on many occaſions.</note>

            <p>Let us now endeavor to improve the ancient things we have been reflecting upon to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of religion and devotion. With ſuch a view as this it was, that God's people of old ſo often called to mind and reflected on the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent things God had done for his church many years, and centuries of years, after thoſe wonders were performed,—as their remarkable deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Egyptian bondage—the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous dividing of the red ſea for the ranſomed tribes to paſs through—their miraculous preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the wilderneſs forty years, when God fed them with manna and gave them of the corn of heaven, till their introduction and ſettlement in the land of Canaan, which prepared the way for their future eſtabliſhment and proſperity. God's people commemorated theſe and ſuch like ancient works of Divine Providence with a view to God's glory and their own ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

            <p n="1">1. Let what has been ſaid of the ancient things of this town and country ſerve to humble us, by conſidering the meanneſs of our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as to externals, yet the glory thereof as to ſpirituals, which ſpiritual glory is now very much loſt, as is thought, in the increaſe of our temporal comforts.

What will it avail us that we have, (or rather <hi>once</hi> had) a great name for religion, and have been ſpoken of as a people among whom ſobriety, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and godlineſs have flouriſhed above ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, if thoſe dignifying excellencies have taken wing! If our preſent character falls ſhort of our ancient one, and we have degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the virtues of our Anceſtors, we have greater cauſe for <hi>ſhame</hi> than for glorying in what we have been. How many among us in this place and through the land have corrupted their ways and forſaken the Lord God of their Fathers! And how are we ſtained with the moſt odious vices, ſuch as uncleanneſs, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, theft, violence, malice, ſtrife, profaneneſs,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013136_0024_0F8EC4946AADD7A0"/>
and others! As to profane language, though the hiſtories of this country will inform us, that in its firſt and pureſt times there was ſcarce a profane oath heard in the land, yet now how common, how <hi>very</hi> common is curſing and ſwearing among us! and this not only in our ſea-port towns, where it was once very much confined, but in our inland towns, and pariſhes, and, this vice like a contagious diſtemper, ſpreads through the provinces; ſo that even children in age are heard to take the tremendous name of God in vain, and to ſpeak the horrid and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dialect or language of hell. Awful degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy this!</p>
            <p>It is granted that there are many ſincerely pious and godly perſons in this land, and we hope a conſiderable number in this town, who in deſpite of all temptations and evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hold faſt their righteouſneſs—maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of devotion towards God, and juſtice towards men—ſhining thereby as lights in the world in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This I ſay we acknowlege to the glory of God, and bleſs Him for it. But then if we compare ourſelves in general with the firſt Fathers of this land (though we are far from pretending that <hi>they</hi> were perfect) how vaſtly ſhort do we come of their bright example! Does it not appear that we want their ardent love to God, his truths and ways—their peaceable, healing, loving, friendly, benevolent ſpirit?</p>
            <p>I am diſpoſed to think that ſome of the aged in Wrentham, and who are preſent in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, can remember when there was more
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013136_0025_0F8EC495151B2AF0"/>
peace, love, and friendſhip in this town than there is at this day—when the inhabitants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to regard and treat one another more like brethren—and contentious law-ſuits were ſeldom known among them.</p>
            <p>But to return. Do we not very much want their humility and ſelf-denial—their generous contempt of this world—their ſtrong faith and affecting views of the world to come! How many defects are there in the manner of our conduct—in the ſeriouſneſs of our deportment—in our chriſtian prudence, faithfulneſs, and diligence! Now all this ſhould ſerve to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let our reflections on the ancient things of this town and country excite us to give God the glory of his wonderful works in the days of our Fathers. It is certain God did great things and marvellous for them in their firſt plantation and ſettlement in this country, when it was a land not ſown, and poſſeſſed by cruel ſavages. Our Fathers ſaw the hand and work of God and were glad, and they gave glory to Him. They ſpake often one to another of theſe things to the praiſe of God and their mutual edification and comfort. And it becomes <hi>us</hi> the poſterity of thoſe good people who bore the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day, to ſpeak of them to the glory of God as well as they. God was pleaſed to viſit the natives of this land with a terrible ſickneſs (of what nature or kind we are not able to ſay) which cut off multitudes of them; and with waſting wars among themſelves, in which many periſhed before the arrival of the Engliſh into
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013136_0026_0F8EC495C2E6E798"/>
theſe parts, whereby room was made for them. And it pleaſed God in a very extraordinary manner to introduce and ſettle this ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people on this ſtrange and diſtant ſhore—to preſerve and eſtabliſh them, by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of kind and powerful providences, in the midſt of a great variety of diſtreſſing difficulties and dangers—and enable them to do what may now appear ſurpriſing to us, conſidering their circumſtances, in their infant ſtate and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is but reaſonable therefore that we ſhould give to God the glory of it.—Theſe works belong to the hiſtory of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which God would have known and read of all men; and juſtly expects that we ſhould praiſe him for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let our reflections on thoſe ancient things that have been mentioned, ſerve to make us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and reſigned to the will of God, under all our ſtraits and difficulties. The uncommon ſufferings and hardſhips our Progenitors endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their weariſome pilgrimage in this wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in their going into the woods to make new ſettlements, ſhould not only endear their memory to us, as we reap the fruits of their labours, but alleviate the preſſure of our own troubles and prevent all murmurs and complaints. What are our ſtraits and wants to what ſome of them had to encounter with! They were in perils by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in perils by their own country men, in perils by the heathen, in perils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the wilderneſs, in perils in the ſea—in wearineſs and painfulneſs, in watchings often, in hunger and thirſt, in faſtings often, in cold and nakedneſs. It may be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to us, my hearers, to think ſometimes of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013136_0027_0F8EC49672E484C8"/>
theſe things, eſpecially when our commons ſeem ſhort, and we think our fare courſe and hard, and begin to be impatient and uneaſy. It might be of uſe to check ſuch an ill temper at its firſt riſing, to conſider the ſtraits and difficulties of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who ſometimes had not a morſel of bread, but were obliged to dig up certain roots for their ſuſtenance: &amp; when they could procure theſe, &amp; a few ſhell-fiſh,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ground-Nuts and Clams,</note> they were contented and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, giving God thanks. And indeed we have reaſon to think that the firſt ſettlers of this town were far from affluent circumſtances. When they came up here, it was not with any hopes to enter into other men's labours and build on foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations already laid. No, they came expecting neither houſes prepared for their reception, nor gardens, fields, or orchards for their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—but a wilderneſs, where they expected to get their bread not only with the ſweat of their brows, but even with the peril of their lives on account of the heathen.<note n="§" place="bottom">I have been told they were obliged ſometimes to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their fire-arms into the field when they went to works and to the houſe of God when they went to worſhip.</note> We are not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they had the comforts of life in ſuch plenty as we have. They were obliged to rub very hard, as we ſay, to ſupport themſelves and families and procure what they left to you their children. So then if at any time you are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to murmur at your lot, and repine becauſe you are not in ſo plentiful circumſtances as ſome others—remember your Anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let our reflections on thoſe ancient, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable things God hath done for our Fathers,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013136_0028_0F8EC497834F8CA8"/>
ſerve to encourage our faith and hope in God, who is ſtill the ſame powerful and gracious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ever, and ready to appear for all thoſe who truly ſeek him.</p>
            <p>Our Fathers were many times brought into preſſing difficulties—ſometimes thick and dark clouds rolled over them—the aſpect of things appeared black and gloomy, but they truſted in God, and he ſoon diſſipated the threatening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. In <hi>their</hi> affliction <hi>He</hi> was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them. There was a time ſomething ſimilar to the preſent, when our Fathers were threatened, more than threatened, to be deprived of their civil liberties and privileges: but they called upon God in their trouble and He delivered them. And he is the ſame God ſtill, for he changeth not—as powerful, as good, and as kind as ever. Let us then ſeek and ſerve the God of our Fathers and truſt in his mercy, and we may hope that he will appear for <hi>us</hi> as he did for them, and ſtill ſecure to us our invaluable privileges.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let our reflections on the ancient things that have been mentioned remind us of the great errand of our Anceſtors into this wilderneſs—the ſpiritual and noble ends of that great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking which brought them over to America, and induced the firſt Fathers of <hi>this place</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſettle it. It was the advancement of the glory of God and their own ſpiritual intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the unmoleſted enjoyment of the pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and worſhip of God, that brought our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors into this quarter of the world. And you may remember it was obſerved that the firſt ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013136_0029_0F8EC497EA9CFB38"/>
of this town profeſſed that they had religion in their view, and that their deſire to do a work for the honor of God was one principal thing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to remove here and plant this place. Now, we ſhould purſue their glorious deſign and build on their foundation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let our reflections upon the piety and virtue of the ancient ſettlers of this country and town excite in us a care of imitating their pious examples. We ſhould be excited to this by a ſenſe of peculiar obligations lying on us, as we are the deſcendants of ſuch pious Anceſtors, whoſe names will be a reproach to us if we do not alſo inherit their virtues: and we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch an upbraiding expoſtulation as that in Jer. 2. 21. "Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine unto me?" Many were the prayers our godly Predeceſſors put up for us—ſolemn the charges, and very amiable the examples they have left us: all which will riſe up in judgment againſt us if we forſake the God of our Fathers.</p>
            <p>But to apply what has been ſaid more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to ourſelves the inhabitants of this town.</p>
            <p>Your Fathers, where are they? They are gone, long ago gone to their long home. But, thro' the kind indulgence of heaven and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies of our God, the children of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants continue, and their ſeed is eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: ſo that inſtead of the fathers are the children. And notwithſtanding this town, as well as other places, hath been under a variety
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013136_0030_0F8EC49999CFC9C0"/>
of diſpenſations, and God hath viſited you ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times with moral ſickneſſes, whereby many, both old and young, have been taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you—and ſome very uſeful perſons in town and church, and the mourners have gone about the ſtreets; yet God hath beſtowed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable kindneſſes upon us; and of late we have not had any times of great mortality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
            <p>We ſee how God hath increaſed us. Can we then ever juſtify our conduct if we caſt Him off? Shall we not be guilty of the greateſt ingratitude if we thus requite our own and our fathers God? Inſtead of doing this, let us follow our Fathers wherein they followed Chriſt. And whatever appears to have been commendable and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in their characters, when held up to view, let us endeavor to copy and imitate.</p>
            <p>They, we have heard, had ſuch a taſte and reliſh for the word of God preached, that they would not content themſelves without having it publicly and regularly diſpenſed unto them, even when there were no more than ſixteen families, and probably not ſo many.<note n="¶" place="bottom">Mr. Man preached with them a conſiderable time, if I miſtake not one or two years or more, before they were erected into a townſhip: and there being no more than ſixteen families when they were incorporated, it makes it greatly probable that there were not ſo many when Mr. Man came firſt to preach among them.</note> And now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that ſome who lived in Dedham and had rights of land here bore part of the charge that they were at in providing preaching among them, yet the weight of the expence muſt have
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013136_0031_0F8EBA7402970E30"/>
been heavy, there being ſo few to bear it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by all I can collect from the town records, they bore it <hi>chearfully,</hi> and choſe rather to pinch their bodies than ſtarve their ſouls—and to put themſelves to ſome temporal inconveniences than not to have the word of ſalvation preached unto them.</p>
            <p>Let us then after their example highly eſteem, give diligent attendance upon, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious improvement of all the means of grace.</p>
            <p>They were careful to ſet up religion in their families, and offered up their morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſacrifice of prayer and thankſgiving to God, with reading the holy ſcriptures. May we, all of us, follow them in this. And let there not be one prayerleſs family among us, nor one houſe wherein the written word of God is not daily read.</p>
            <p>Like them may we inſtruct our children and ſervants in the things of God and Chriſt, and in the duties of religion;—and ſet pious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples before them.</p>
            <p>And oh! that God would pour out his Spirit upon his ſervants and his bleſſing upon our off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring!—and by his Spirit and power turn the hearts, both of parents and children, unto the Lord God of our Fathers, and the diſobedient to the wiſdom of the juſt, to make ready a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prepared of the Lord!</p>
            <p>I would addreſs the young people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this town in the ſolemn language of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013136_0032_0F8EC49A5B404D98"/>
in his dying charge to his ſon. "And thou Solomon my ſon, know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind—if thou ſeek him he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for-ever."<note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Chron. 28. 9</note> You are, young people and children, <hi>particularly</hi> concerned in what has been delivered. It is agreable to the will of God that we ſhould acquaint you with theſe ancient things: Not indeed to amuſe you with ancient ſtories, but for your ſpiritual profit and advantage.</p>
            <p>Thus we find God commanding his people Iſrael to tranſmit the knowledge of what He had done for them, down to all their generations—that "one generation might praiſe his works to another, and declare his mighty acts—that the generation to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born: who ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and declare them to their children: that they might ſet their hope in God, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the works of God; but keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm 145. 4. and 78. 6, 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe purpoſes and ends we declare to you the ancient things God hath done for your Fathers in their day. And as they, in the firſt ſettlement of this town, had a view to you their deſcendants,—had a care that extended to the lateſt poſterity,—and ſought a godly ſeed: may you be concerned that you be ſuch a ſeed in reality!—ſuch every way as they wiſhed and prayed for! And let us your immediate parents have the comfort and joy of ſeeing you our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013136_0033_0F8EC49D19B75408"/>
walking in the truth;—and have this to refreſh our ſpirits before we quit theſe mortal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes, that we ſhall leave thoſe behind us, who will keep the ways of the Lord and not wickedly depart from our God.</p>
            <p>To the aged of this town let me ſay; as your venerable years entitle you to that reſpect and reverence from the riſing generation, which was paid to your Fathers by the younger ſort in their day; ſo if you would be in favor with God and honored by the youth, you muſt, like your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, be "ſober, grave, temperate, ſound in faith, in charity, in patience." And be <hi>ſhining</hi> examples of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>And as the firſt inhabitants of this town, by what I can collect from records and traditional accounts, ſtudied union among themſelves—liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in harmony, and like the builders of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſtrengthened one anothers hands for the good work they came here upon: let us imitate them in this, and all of us "follow after the things which make for peace, and things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with one may edify another." May the God of peace unite us all in the bonds of truth, holineſs and love! May He give us one heart and one way that we may fear him for ever; for the good of ourſelves and our children after us!</p>
            <p>In a word, let us begin our ſecond Century with new and better frames, tempers, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions than we have ever had, and make it our conſtant and zealous endeavor, to expreſs a grateful ſenſe of divine favours in the virtues and praiſes of a life devoted to God. This let
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013136_0034_0F8EC49D2C0495D0"/>
us do as a choſen generation, a peculiar people ſhewing forth the praiſes of him who hath called us out of darkneſs into the marvellous light and liberty of the goſpel—commanding our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and houſholds to keep the way of the Lord, that the Lord may abundantly bleſs us in all our generations.</p>
            <p>To conclude, May every one of us in this Aſſembly be formed by the Spirit of holineſs for the ſervice of God here, while we remain in the body; and for the full and compleat enjoyment of him in the world of ſpirits! And when that great and mighty Angel, ſpoken of in the book of the Revelation, ſhall proclaim that time ſhall be no longer,—ſtrike off the wheels of nature, and bid centuries and generations ceaſe to roll; may our ſouls be reunited to our raiſed bodies <hi>gloriouſly</hi> formed, and we, in body and ſoul, paſs into a ſtate of undecaying felicity; where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther days, nor years, nor centuries of years, but <hi>eternity</hi> will be the meaſure of the duration of our happineſs! Where, among other delightful exerciſes, we ſhall (very probably) with exalted ſtrains of rapture and devotion, trace the hiſtory of Divine Providence, and call to mind the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient things of the works of God for his church and people thro' all the generations of time—everlaſtingly celebrate the praiſes of him who is the Ancient of days for theſe his wonderful works to the children of men—and admire the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing diſplays of the wiſdom, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead in them all!</p>
