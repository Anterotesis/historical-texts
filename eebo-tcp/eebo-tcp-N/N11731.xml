            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UNDERSTANDING you are vaſtly fond of plays and farces, and frequently exhibit them for your own amuſement, and the laudable purpoſe of ridiculing your maſters (the <hi>Yankees,</hi> as you call'em) it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected you would have been polite enough to have favoured the world, or America at leaſt, (at whoſe expence you act them) with ſome of your play-bills, or with a ſample of your compoſition.</p>
            <p>I ſhall however not copy your churliſhneſs, but dedicate the following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future entertainment; and as the moſt of you have already acted your particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington, Bunker's-hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the very great applauſe of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho' not of the whole houſe, no doubt you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your poſteriors: And however ſome Whigs may cenſure you for your affected mirth (as they term it, in the deplorable ſituation you are now in, like hogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room) yet I can by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroiſm and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, to endeavour to make the beſt of a bad bargain, and laugh at yourſelves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and though you are deprived of the uſe of your teeth,

is no reaſon you ſhould be bereaved of the uſe of your tongues, your eyes, your ears, and your riſible faculties and powers. That would be cruel indeed! after the glorious and fatiguing campaign you have made, and the many ſignal victories obtained over whole herds of cattle and ſwine, routing flocks of ſheep, lambs and geeſe, ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hen-rooſts, and taking them priſoners, and thereby raiſing the glory of Old England to a pitch ſhe never knew before.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOLOMON ſaid, "Oppreſſion makes a wiſe man mad:" but what would he have ſaid had he lived in theſe days, and ſeen the oppreſſion of the people of Boſton, and the diſtreſſed ſituation of the inhabitants of Charleſtown, Falmouth, Stonnington, Briſtol, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, &amp;c Would he not have ſaid,
<q>The tongue of the ſucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirſt; the young children aſk for bread, but no man breaketh it unto them?</q>
               <q>They that did feed delicately periſh in the ſtreets; they that were brought up in ſcarlet, embrace the dung.</q>
What would he have ſaid of rejected petitions, diſregarded ſupplications, and contemned remonſtrances? Would he not have ſaid,
<q>From hardneſs of heart, good Lord, deliver us?</q>
What would he have ſaid of a freeborn people butchered—their towns deſolated, and become an heap of aſhes—their inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabonds—by the cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and wantonly waſting the people's wealth, to oppreſs them the more? Would he not have ſaid, it was oppreſſion and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the higheſt degree, exceeding the oppreſſion of the children of Iſrael? and, like Moſes, have cried out, let the people go? Would he not have wondered at our patience and long-ſuffering, and have ſaid, 'Tis time to change our maſter!—'Tis time to part!—And had he been an American born, would he not have ſhewed his wiſdom by adopting the language of independency? Happy then for America in theſe fluctuating times, ſhe is not without her Solomons, who ſee the neceſſity of hearkening to reaſon, and liſtening to the voice of COMMON SENSE.</p>

                  <p>Let their champion, Lord Wiſdom, groan, he is now become feeble and impotent, a meer cripple in politics; their Lord Patriot's ſquint has loſt its baſiliſk effect: and the bold Iriſhman may bellow the <hi>keenew</hi> till he's hoarſe, he's no more when compar'd to me than an Iriſh ſalmon to a Scotch herring: I care not a bawbee for them all. I'll reign in Britain, I'll be king of their counſels, and chief among the princes.</p>

                  <p>This Mocklaw is a curſed knowing dog, and I believe the father of Brazen; how readily he found an old act of parliament to my purpoſe, as ſoon as I told him I would make it worth his ſtudy; and the thoughts of a penſion will make him ſearch his old worm-eaten ſtatute books from the reign of king Arthur down to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time; how he raiſes objections too to make me think his mind is ever bent on ſtudy to ſerve me.

I have ſufficiently ſhewn my diſlike to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Preſs, by the examples I have frequently made (tho' too favourable) of ſeveral Printers, and others, who had greatly treſpaſſed, and if they ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, other meaſures ſhould be taken with them, which the laws will point out; and as to Lord Patriot, he's a fellow that has been outlaw'd, ſcandal-proof, little to be got by medling with him; I would adviſe to let him alone for the preſent, and humble America firſt.</p>

                     <p>I am very clear in it, pleaſ your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; there are numbers of men in this country who are ever ſtudying how to perplex and entangle the ſtate, constantly thwarting government, in ev'ry laudable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: this clamarous faction muſt be curbed, muſt be ſubdued and cruſh'd—our thunder muſt go forth, America muſt be conquered.

                     <p>I entirely agree with you, Mr. Brazen; my advice is, that Lord Boſton and Admiral Tombſton be immediately diſpatch'd to Boſton, with two or three regiments (tho' one would be more than ſufficient) and a few ſhips to ſhut up their ports, disannul their charters, ſtop their trade, and the puſillanimous beggars, thoſe ſcoundrel raſcals, whoſe predominant paſſion is fear, would immediately give up, on the firſt landing of the regulars, and fly before 'em like a hare before the

                     <p>And thus they'll drive liberty from out the land: but when a brave people, like the Americans, from their infancy us'd to liberty (not as a gift, but who inherit it as a birth-right, but not as a meſs of pottage, to be bought by, or ſold to, ev'ry hungry glutton of a miniſter) find attempts made to reduce them to ſlavery, they generally take ſome deſperate ſucceſsful meaſure for their deliverance. I ſhould not be at all ſurpris'd to hear of independency proclaim'd throughout their land, of Britain's armies beat, their fleets burnt, ſunk, or otherwiſe deſtroy'd. The ſame principle which Mr. Brazen ſpeaks of, that inſpires Britiſh ſoldiers to fight, namely the ferment of youthful blood, the high ſpirit of the people, a love of glory, and a ſenſe of national honour, will inſpire the Americans to withſtand them; to which I may add, liberty and property.—But what is national honour? Why, national pride.—What is national glory? Why, national nonſenſe, when put in competition with liberty and property.</p>

I am well pleaſed with their contents— all but the behaviour of the haughty Carleton—to fire upon a flag of truce, hitherto unprecedented, even amongſt Savages or Algerines—his cruelty to the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is cowardly, and perſonal ill treatment of General Montgomery is unbecoming a General—a Soldier—and beneath a Gentleman—and leaves an indelible mark of brutality—I hope General Montgomery, however, will not follow his example.</p>
