            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some of the Words and Exhortations of a Dying Youngman near Seventeen Years of Age who was an Aprentice to Jacob Usher of Philadelphia Carpenter his Name was William Fletcher Son of William Fletcher; Deceased.</head>
            <p>THe first time he was observed to open his mouth on this manner, his Mother was sitting by, and his heart being much overcome, he Expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus: Dear Mother I have ever been a bashfull Lad, but now the Lord hath loosened my Tongue, and now can I sing praises to his Holy name: Oh! how good hath the Lord been to me in this my visitation and hath Answered my Prayers; yea he hath answered my desire, for which my Soul shall praise his name forever. I have often desired that I might have my punishment in this Life that so I may Rest with the Lord hereafter; for I knew that I deserved punishment for my sins. Since I came to this place my Soul hath been much Bowed to see the Loosness, Pride, and vanity which is therein, both amongst those that Profess the Truth and others: But I pray thee O! Lord if it be thy will, pardon on all their Sins and reach them to do better; and if it be thy will let them have their punishment in this
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000950_0003_0FAD97C67284BD40"/>
life, that they may have peace with Thee here-after; not that I desire any should have the like Punishment as I have, though in my Extremity I can Praise the Lord for his mercyes towards me: Oh! Praises, Praises be to thy name O Lord! can my Soul say. Now I desire that all, both Old &amp; young may always live in the fear of the Lord while they are here, that so they may have peace with the Lord hereafter; and not that any may goe on and say, it is time enough, I will take my pleasure while I am young, and when I am Old, I will doe better; for they know not whether they shall live to be old: For many are taken whilst they are young. And he did advice the young People very much that they would live in the feare of the Lord, and his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were often to the Lord for them, that he would be pleased to pardon their sins, that so they might have peace with him hereafter; for said he the Lord will Pardon those that do forsake their Sins and do call upon him with their whole hearts, and that all have Sinned (as said the Apostle) and come short of the glory of God. And further he said if we are without Chastisements then are we Bastards and not Sons; wherefore he had often desired his Chastisements in mercy; not that he knew any gross Sin that he had commited; but somtimes he had played, and spoken vain words for which he was in secret reproved by the Spirit of the Lord: And that many times he did get into secret places and did pour out his Soul before the Lord, desiring that he would pardon his Sins, that he might have peace with him hereafter. And now (said he) the Lord hath answered my request, for which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000950_0004_0FAD97C691C33DC0"/>
my Soul shall praise his holy name. Oh! Praises, Praises be to thee O Lord! For thou hast and answered my Prayers, which I prayed to thee in secret; and now Lord I beseech thee, keep me in thy fear all the dayes, I have here to spend; that I may never offend thee; and I beseech thee O Lord! though thou Afflict me never so much; yet take not thy mercy from me. And he often Blessed and praised the Lord for his Afflictions, which were very great; yet in the midst thereof He would Sing Prayers to the Lord for his mercyes to him. One of his Brothers and his two eldest Sisters came to visit him, whom he did tenderly exhort, that they would live in the fear of the Lord all ways, that when they Dy. they may enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. At another time, being taken with an extraordinary Fit, he said to his Mother (several others being likewise in the Room) how do I ly? She answered, well Child, if it be for thy case; He Replyed, I think I am a Dying; but I know not well whether it be so or no; but I am so lifted up with the Power of the Lord; that I know not, whether I am in the body or out of the body; farewell dear Mother, farewell. And also to another that stood by, he said, farewell; and also said I hope to see you again in Heaven uttering many, precious exhortations which we cannot fully remember: And for near half an hour, singing Praises to the Lord in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner saying I never delighted in vain Singing; but now I can sing Praises to the Lord, feeling his mercies; and such singing I ever loved; For saith the Apostle
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000950_0005_0FAD97C751FE3B50"/>
admonish one another in Psalms, and Hymns and Spiritual songs; singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord, and hearing some talking in the room, he said, cannot yee wait upon the Lord with me one hour. Oh! how me thinks I see my Relations standing about me: O Praise the Lord with me! I beseech you. And uttering many more precious words often desiring the Lord would receive him, that he might be with the Lord in Heaven, when the Lord's will and pleasure is saying not my will but thine be done O! Lord; Then he called for a young Maid of the House, and when thee came he said, I have been much concerned for thee, though thou mayest think me a poor contemtable instrument to speak to thee; yet I have been much concerned for thee, desiring the Lord would change thy heart if it be his Heavenly will, and teach thee to do better; though thou mayest think thou wilt Repent when thou art old; yet thou art not sure to live one hour: Adding further, leave of thy vain Company and thy Pride and Lying-singing and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes, and obey thy mother and keep good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and fear the Lord, and he will Bless thee. Some of his Relations and Friends being by him he said how shall I Requite you for your kindness to me; his mother said, dear Child, we Expect none from thee, but I hope said he the Lord will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite you all: And further said, my Master an Mistress have been at much Charge and trouble with me, I have nothing to give them; but I Pray the Lord And a Blessing to their store; he desired that his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000950_0006_0FAD97C813E8BDA0"/>
dear love might be Remembred to all his Relations, Friends and neighbours; desiring that the Lord will keep them all in his fear. And many that came to visit him, he did Exhort to live in the fear of the Lord, for those that did so should enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and that those that did the contrary, should go to Hell. And that night after he came out of that Extraordinary Fit, he lifted up his hands and sung Praises to the Lord; and then uttered to us these verses:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>When in the Morning you do Rise,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lift up to God your hands and Eyes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And Praise his Name who did all night,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Keep you untill the morning light,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And then betimes see that you Pray,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>That God will keep you all the day,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>From those great dangers that befall,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To young to old both, great and small,</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>These verses (said he) I learnd not to say them vainely but to do According to them. Another time he said, I was accounted a dull foolish lad; but Blessed are those that are fools for Christ's sake. An other time when his heart was overcomed, he Praised the Lord, and said, every Son whom the Lord loveth he Chasteneth; and now can I say Abba Father Blessed and Praised be thy Holy name for thus Chastening me; often saying in his great Extreamity Oh! what a small matter is this to the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000950_0007_0FAD97C8D22B9C80"/>
torments of Hell. Surely this is for but a moment; but that will, be forever; but blessed be thy name O Lord! For tho' thou hast thus chastened me, I have cause to Praise thee in the midst of my Extremity, desireing often, that he might allwayes Praise his Holy name, even to the end; and that it might be his last words; which was measurably an severed: For litting up his hands, he Prayed to the Lord, that he would receive his Spirit: And so immediatly Expired the twenty-third Day of the Eleventh Month 1700. About the Eleventh hour in the forenoon.</p>

            <head>A Seasonable Account of The Christian Testimony and Heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Tudor Brain upon his Death Bed.</head>
            <p>OUR Dear Child, <hi>Tudor Brain</hi> was Born the first Day of the fourth Month, 1680. Was taken very Ill about the tenth Month, 1696. And from that time decayed daily falling into a very deep Consumption, till the day of his dissolution, which was the third Day of the tenth Month, 1697. And sixth Day of the Week, the second Hour in the Morning: Notwithstanding all Endeavours was used for his recovery at last Doctors advised his removing into the Country; no place pleasing him so well as Beehive in <hi>Essex</hi> it being a retired still place, where we often observed his retirement into the Grounds, and return with wet Eyes; which we apprehended, might proceed from his Distemper, or else fear of Death; but his frequent ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers were, <hi>He was no way afraid of Death,</hi> but willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed himself to the will of God, either for Life or Death: At several times being advised to prepare for his latter End, for if he Lived it would be well, and if he Died, it would be his Gain; his answer was, <hi>He was not Conscious of any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had done, that he should be afraid of appearing before God Almighty.</hi> After he came from School, he continued a very Sober, Dutifull and Obedient Child to us, Loving to his Brother and Sisters, Courteous, as well to Strangers as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, nay, so Circumspect over his nearest Relations, that if he perceived any Inclinations of Stubborness in them, he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000950_0011_0FAD97CBD304ED50"/>
would be both a Reprover and Admonisher; his Loving De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to all, drew Love and Respect from them that know him.</p>
            <p>It Pleased God, that the seventeenth Day of the ninth Month, he was taken so Ill, as not able to go out of his Chamber, and so continued, being Daily with a great Sense of God upon his Spirits, and would often Repeat a full Assurance of his Future Happiness, and often lay with Spiritual <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, saying, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly and receive my Soul:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating several such Expressions and Admonitions, which we did not so much mind, not thinking him to be so near his End: On the last Day of the neinth Month he call'd for a <hi>Bible,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to read, his Mother's answer was, Child thou art Weak, he said, he could read, and so read the seventeenth Chapter of <hi>John</hi> with Trembling Lips; when he came to the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Verse, he took particular Notice, and wept; on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Day of the thenth Month in the Morning, he fell very Ill, then we thought he was smitten with Death; several Loving Friends, as well then as before, came and visited him, with which he was very much refreshed and Comforted, saying, <hi>Oh Mother! how merciful is the Great God to me, that had put it in the Hearts of Good Friends to visit me, for there are Younger and Healthier Lads than I, that is gone before me a Poor Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Lad, be hath speared me, surely I shall never forget his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Oh! Glory, Glory and Praises; for they are thine for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;</hi> then sitting still a little, saith. <hi>Oh thou Merciful God, thou art Merciful, I can say, that I have found it so, that when I have had no breath I have sought thee, and it hath been given me:</hi> His Father and Mother hearing him, could not forbear Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he made answer, <hi>Wherefore are ye Troubled, my Dear Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000950_0012_0FAD97CC93354838"/>
               <hi>be not Troubled for me, for I am going to a better Place if it be the will of the Lord he can raise me, but if not his will be done; it may be he may spare me two or three Days he may have a greater Work for me to do.</hi> Turning his Eyes upon us, said, <hi>You are the Nearest in the World to me; but yet there is a Nearer that is above.</hi> Then sitting still a little, said. <hi>I can say that, in my younger Years, I have gone by my self down in the Meadows, and have Cried unto the Lord: But knew not where he was, and when I heard his Voice, I Trembled, and as I gave up, the Lord Jesus made himself known to me; then I knew what I sought for:</hi> He smiling, said <hi>Oh Mother! I will tell thee my Dream, I thought I was in a Fine Place, and one brought me a rare Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye, and there came another and took me away, and told me; there was better Dainties for me, and I was carried where the Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were; there was a great many would have gone, but they could not,</hi> and then he said, <hi>he thought his Dream was for his further good, and that there was a Pretty many Steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then sitting a little while, and fixing his Eyes upon the Chimney Piece, he said, <hi>Take away those Images, for they are to be trodden under foot:</hi> His Mother asked him what Images he meant? he answered, <hi>Those Lyons;</hi> so they were ordered to be taken away; then there was another Piece Of <hi>China,</hi> which had several Hands; then said he, <hi>take away that Piece that is Covered for it hath Eyes and seeth not, and Ears and heareth not.</hi>  Then that was taken away also; and there was a pair of Guilded Tea-Pots: After the others were taken away, he said <hi>You may take away the other things that are <hi>Guilded,</hi> and wash it off:</hi> And after they were taken away he was at Ease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000950_0013_0FAD97CD51EEB2C0"/>Then his Aunt, <hi>Elizabeth Brain,</hi> coming in, he further proceeded, being about twelve Hours before his Death, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Relations and Friends being there, weeping over him, he said, <hi>He was going out a little before us;</hi> his Aunt said <hi>Thou art so, and the Lord grant that we here may be so fitted, and prepared to go to the Place thou art going to; for we, many of us are Older than thee, and have more Sins to answer for; he said, Ye must Pray, and Hing, and Lean upon the Lord Jesus Christ, for it is of him, and through him, that we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Salvation, for without him ye can do nothing, for he Died for Sinners, and he is very Merciful to forgive for he hath forgiven me, Blessed be his Holy Name; altho' some be Hardned and Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, yet the Lord is very Merciful, he can forgive and may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but you that are in the Truth keep in the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he ceased a little while, and his <hi>Grandmother</hi> said, <hi>Oh Lord! That this Young Branch should be a Teacher unto us old Ones;</hi> his Mother and some others, desired that his Grandmother might walk out of the Room for fear of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing him, he hearing them, said, <hi>Give Liberty, give Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi> then sitting still a little while; said, <hi>The Young must go as-well as the Old;</hi> therefore said he, <hi>it was said,</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, that the Evil Day cometh not, in which thou shalt say, I have no Pleasure in them. The next that he said, was, <hi>I would not have you to be like the Foolish Virgins, that kept no Oyl in their Lamps; but keep ye Oyl in your Lamps, that ye may be ready, when the call cometh to slip in:</hi> Then sitting a little while still, he said, <hi>Death was very hard &amp; none knew it, but they that hath gone through it.</hi> For said he. <hi>There is nothing so much like Death as Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Breath:</hi> And said he, <hi>I have Prayed to the Lord at
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000950_0014_0FAD97CEAC2E7490"/>
Night going to Bed that he would give me Breath and Strength; as he hath done in a wonderful Manner thanks be to his Holy Name far I have gone into the Meadows when I was Young and cried but to whom I did not know; but the Lord hath made known himself to me; it is said</hi> faith he; <hi>Oh Death where is thy being and O Grave where is thy Victory? And there is one that hath made way through all, and it was said by one, they had sought the good Fight of Faith:</hi> This he said in a very Sweet quiet Frame of Spirit, and many other Sensible Expressions; which he spoke in his Weakness at other times in his <hi>Aunts</hi> hearing.</p>
            <p>Then he cried out, about two hours before he Died, <hi>Lord God be Merciful thou art Good, thou art Bountiful Lord have Mercy on me [Oh Death] come Lord Jesus have Mercy, thou Dyed for Sinners Glory to the God of Heaven, Oh! Praises to thy Name, Lord Jesus receive my Soul:</hi> He called for his Father, and when he came, he was asked whither he knew his Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he answered, <hi>Yea it is</hi> Benjamin Brain <hi>my Father,</hi> and then said, <hi>I have another Father,</hi> and then lay Glorifying God: Just before his departure he called out, <hi>Oh Mother! Do but see what a Swee Child there is upon the Bed, Oh! the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est that ever I saw,</hi> then he said, <hi>Lord wash me, Clean some! and I shall be Clean;</hi> lying still a little, he said, <hi>Oh! what a Glorious, Glorious Kingdom I am going to? There is Dainties enough: Lord Jesus thou bast pardoned me, Oh what a numerous Army hath God, he hath a great One!</hi> And so lay Singing and, Praising the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God until the last; and then Finished his Life like a Lamb, about two in the Morning, on the Third Day, of the Thenth Month, 1697.</p>

            <head>A Testimony given forth by Richard Manliffe, while the Lords Judgments were upon him, for his running out and forsaking the Way of the Lord, as professed and walked in by the People call'd Quakers; now made publick for a warning and caution to all who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof, not to slight the Reproofs of Gods Spirit in themselves, or Advice and Exhortation of his People.</head>
            <p>A Warning to Friends Children and Young People that profess the <hi>Truth,</hi> to be warned of <hi>Backsliding,</hi> and be sure, whatsoever you do, to take your Parents and Friends Councel and Advice; for if you <hi>backslide</hi> from <hi>the</hi> Lords <hi>blessed Truth,</hi> He will overtake you <hi>with his heavy Judgements:</hi> And so, dear Hearts, I desire you to take warning, and live in the <hi>Lords Truth</hi> whatsoever you do.
