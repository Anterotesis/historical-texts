            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But when Men are exhorted, to regulate their Lives by the ſacred Precepts of <hi>Religion,</hi> how apt are they to look upon it as a vain and impracticable Attempt; and complain that it offers Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Human Nature, by laying an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Reſtraint</hi> upon the Appetites of

Fleſh and Blood. To remove theſe ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Prejudices, the inſpired Scriptures ſet before us, the bright Cloud of antient Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who have <hi>ſhone</hi> as <hi>Lights</hi> a dark and degenerate World; and earneſtly invite us to be <hi>Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> And perhaps, nothing affords greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſerious Minds, than to find that Men of <hi>like</hi> Paſſions, placed in the <hi>ſame dangerous</hi> Circumſtances, and ſurrounded with <hi>equal</hi> Trials and Temptations, have, by the Aſſiſtance of divine Grace, bravely conquered the Difficulties of the Chriſtian Life, and <hi>ran with Patience the Race ſet before them.</hi> This ſhows us, that Religion is not a bare <hi>abſtracted Theory,</hi> contrived for the Entertainment of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Minds; but is an undoubted <hi>Reality,</hi> of which many of our Fellow-Creatures have felt the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Power in their Hearts; and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in an amiable and vertuous Conduct. This has the higheſt Tendency to encourage others, to imitate thoſe <hi>inſtructive Patterns,</hi> who in their Day were illuſtrious <hi>Ornaments</hi> of the Church, and diffuſive <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to Mankind. Upon this Account, the <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>eminent Saints,</hi> have always been eſteemed the moſt <hi>valuable,</hi> Part of Eccleſiaſtical

Hiſtory. In this Way, they have <hi>ſpoke</hi> to Survivors, even when ſleeping in the <hi>Silence of Death,</hi> and extended the Influence of their Piety, to diſtant Places, and thro' ſucceeding Ages.</p>
               <p>THERE is a <hi>public Honour</hi> due to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of diſhnguiſh'd Worth: Whilſt they <hi>live,</hi> we cannot publiſh their Vertues, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing <hi>them</hi> to the dangerous Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>ourſelves</hi> to the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a ſervile and deſigning <hi>Flattery.</hi> But when they are <hi>removed</hi> from this Stage of Vanity, and raiſed above the Cenſure or Applauſe of Mortals, we may <hi>ſafely</hi> propoſe their lovely Patterns, to the Attention and Imitation of Poſterity. And indeed, it would be an <hi>Injury</hi> to Mankind, to ſuffer their ſuperior Qualities, to <hi>lie buried</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Oblivion; and thoſe Names which God has dignified by his Grace, to periſh without any <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> When they are aſcended above theſe Regions of Guilt and Darkneſs, and are entered into the <hi>General Aſſembly of the Church of the Firſt-born,</hi> it becomes us who are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to this Vale of Tears, and fighting under the Banner of the Croſs, to <hi>perpetuate</hi> the Remembrance of their Vertues, and

ardently <hi>aſpire after</hi> that State of Purity and Perfection, to which they are advanced.</p>
               <p>ALL who had the Happineſs of Mrs. LLOYD's Acquaintance, will be ſo juſt as to acknowledge, that in the preſent Age there have appeared, but few more excellent Examples of <hi>genuine</hi> Piety, and <hi>extenſive</hi> Uſefulneſs. Her <hi>Friends</hi> will be pleaſed, to have thoſe extraordinary Qualities, placed in a proper Light, which rendered her their Delight and Admiration, while <hi>living,</hi> and will embalm her Memory, now ſhe is <hi>dead. Strangers</hi> to her, may alſo from a Peruſal of theſe Pages, be excited to deſpiſe the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Venities</hi> of Life; which are unworthy the Purſuit of a rational Creature; and to ſeek after thoſe <hi>Endowments,</hi> which add a <hi>real Dignity</hi> to Human Nature, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a ſuperior State of Exiſtence.</p>
               <p>THESE Conſiderations have determined me, tho' in all reſpects unequal to the Taſk, to give ſome Account of her <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Character.</hi> The Reader muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a pompous Detail of <hi>Facts,</hi> diverſified with a Variety of entertaining <hi>Incidents.</hi> — She maintained one uniform Tenor of <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> and diligent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006530_0011_10292F5AAB9A3F28"/>
Attendance to the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Common Life.</hi> She never affected a <hi>public Appearance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Decency of her Station; not interfered with Affairs, foreign to her Sex. This will neceſſarily cut ſhort the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Part of the following Performance. I ſhall principally enlarge upon her <hi>Character,</hi> which cannot, without the extremeſt Injuſtice, be confined in a very narrow Compaſs.</p>
               <p>MRS. LLOYD was born at BOSTON, in NEW-ENGLAND. <hi>May</hi> 1681, of a good Family; being the only Child of Mr. <hi>John Clarke</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mary Atwater.</hi> Her <hi>Father,</hi> a Commander of a Veſſel, was, in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, carried into Captivity by the <hi>Corſairs</hi> of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who to this Day infeſt the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diteranean</hi> Sea, and are the <hi>common Enemies</hi> of the trading Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe Barbarians generally uſe thoſe who are ſo unfortunate as to fall into their Hands, with the greateſt <hi>Cruelty:</hi> But Capt. <hi>Clarke</hi> being a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Addreſs, met with uncommon <hi>Civility,</hi> and was exempted from that <hi>ſervile Drudgery</hi> to which moſt of their Priſoners are condemned. Here he was ſeized with that fatal Diſtemper, the <hi>Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Pox,</hi> of which he died in a few Days. — Her <hi>Mother</hi> was a Woman of ſuperior Piety
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006530_0012_10292F5E6C221880"/>
and, good Senſe, and lived to the Age of Sixty three, in Honour and Uſefulneſs. She was endued, with great Prudence; managed her houſhold Affairs with the juſteſt Eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and ſupported the Afflictions of Life with Patience and Reſignation. She was familiar with the Thoughts of Death, even in her higheſt Health, and made it her <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Buſineſs</hi> to prepare for that important Event. When ſhe felt its firſt Approaches, ſhe received it not as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Terrors,</hi> but as a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> —the Angel of her Deliverance. <q>The Bleſſed Day, (ſays ſhe) is come, which I have been ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and preparing for.</q> — And in a few Hours expired in the greateſt Tranquility and Peace.</p>
               <p>THIS Gentlewoman, after Capt, <hi>Clarke</hi>'s early Departure, continued ſeveral Years a diſconſolate Widow. Afterwards ſhe married Mr. <hi>John Coney</hi>; who always treated Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi> with the Affection and Tenderneſs of a <hi>Father.</hi> Under his Roof, ſhe enjoyed all the Opportunities ſhe could deſire, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in Knowledge and Vertue; and to obtain thoſe <hi>other Qualifications,</hi> which were ſuitable to her Sex and Character. She had <hi>equal</hi> Advantages with his <hi>own</hi> Children:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006530_0013_10292F6105398E10"/>
I have often heard her ſay, that if at any Time a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> was made, it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in her Favour. She always ſpoke of this <hi>uncommon Generoſity,</hi> with the greateſt Thankfulneſs, and paid this worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, while he <hi>lived,</hi> all the Offices of <hi>Filial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Piety.</hi> After his <hi>Death,</hi> ſhe never mentioned his Name, without ſome <hi>ſingular</hi> Mark of Gratitude and Reſpect.</p>
               <p>IN this agreeable Situation, Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi> paſſed the Days of her Youth; and by her vertuous, obliging Behaviour, recommended herſelf to the good Opinion of all who knew her. The <hi>Royal Preacher</hi> tells us, that <hi>Childhood and Youth are Vanity</hi>; and <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Obſervation</hi> ſhows, that this <hi>beautiful</hi> Seaſon of Life is generally laviſhed away in <hi>Amuſements,</hi> if not ſpent in an entire <hi>Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of God, and the great End of our Being. But perhaps, never was any Perſon freer from the <hi>common Follies</hi> incident to Youth, than Mrs. <hi>Lloyd.</hi> The Principles of the divine Life, ſeemed to diſplay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the <hi>firſt Dawning</hi> of Reaſon. She often ſaid, that ſhe never knew the Time, when ſhe began to be ſerious. From her very <hi>Infancy,</hi> ſhe diſcovered a deep Abhorrence of every Vice, and an earneſt Solicitude to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006530_0014_10292F6286E77C90"/>
devote herſelf to the Service of her Maker. From a <hi>Child,</hi> ſhe read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with unuſual Delight,— obſerved her ſtated Hours of <hi>Retirement,</hi>— and took Pleaſure to <hi>aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate</hi> herſelf with Perſons of Eminence in Religion.</p>
               <p>BUT, not with ſtanding the Happineſs of an unblemiſhed Youth; She, in the early Years of Life, fell under a deep Conviction of her Guilt and Miſery; and was, for many Months, anxiouſly ſolicitous for her immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Welfare. She found no <hi>Reſt,</hi> but at the Footſtool of ſovereign and unmerited Grace; — no <hi>Safety,</hi> but in a fiducial Application, to the Merits and Mediation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All her Days, ſhe had the higheſt Reliſh for thoſe Doctrines, which have the moſt appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Tendency to <hi>humble</hi> the <hi>Pride</hi> of human Nature,—<hi>exalt</hi> the Riches of divine <hi>Grace,</hi>—and aſcribe the entire Glory of Salvation to a crucified Redeemer.</p>
               <p>THE Beauty, of her Perſon,—the Spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of her Wit, — the Charms of her Converſation, but above all, the <hi>unfeigned Piety</hi> which crowned her other Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſoon procured her many Admirers. She had ſeveral advantageous Offers, of a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006530_0015_10292F64F8EC0198"/>
Settlement in the <hi>married</hi> Life. She fixed her Choice upon the Revd. Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Pemberton,</hi> Paſtor of a flourſhing <hi>Church</hi> in BOSTON; and one of the moſt celebrated Preachers of his Age. To this Gentleman ſhe was married in the Year 1701. They lived together with mutual Delight and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, till the Year 1717; when their Marriage Relation was diſſolved, by the Death of Mr. <hi>Pemberton.</hi> They had ſeven Children: <hi>Three</hi> of which died in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; <hi>Four,</hi> thro' the good Providence of God, yet ſurvive. May we be <hi>Heirs</hi> of that Grace which ſo eminently reſided in our <hi>departed Parents,</hi> and follow them in their exemplary Courſe of Vertue!—Then, we ſhall ſhortly <hi>meet</hi> them again, in that bleſſed World, where will be no more Sorrow, Seperation, or Death!</p>

ſhow, he had all the Qualifications requiſite to conſtitute a great and a good Man.

He died in the full Aſſurance of Faith, in <hi>triumphant</hi> Views of eternal Felicity. This was the Language of his <hi>faultring</hi> Tongue, in his expiring Moments, <q>I thank God, who hath given me a good Hope thro' Chriſt. Notwithſtanding my many Infirmities, both in public and private; thro' his Grace I have been enabled to be ſincere and upright before him. And I can now look for an Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens, when this Houſe of my earthly Tabernacle is diſſolved. And this Hope is built only on the Merits of Chriſt, who hath ſuffered ſo much for me; who died, and is riſer again, and lives for ever, to make Interceſſion for me. And upon this Foundation is built, my Hope for my ſelf, my Family, my Church, and the whole Iſrael of God: And I thank God, who hath enabled me, in a dying Hour, to expreſs this my Hope.</q>

                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006530_0017_10292F6AF734ACD8"/>THIS Loſs muſt doubtleſs be very heavy to <hi>Her,</hi> who for many Years had been united with him, in the moſt <hi>delightful</hi> Society, and <hi>reſin'd</hi> Friendſhip. Her tender and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Nature, was ready to ſink under the ſevere Trial. But, ſhe was enabled to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God, in the <hi>Height</hi> of her Affliction; and exhibit to all around, an inſtructive <hi>Example</hi> of Chriſtian Patience, and profound Submiſſion, to the Will of her heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>IN her Widowhood, as ſoon as her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit, ſhe entered upon a <hi>retired</hi> Scene of Life; that ſhe might with greater Freedom, converſe with Heaven, and inſpect the Education of her <hi>Children</hi>; who were now left under her immediate Direction. Perhaps, none ever manifeſted a more ſolicitous Concern for the Felicity of their <hi>Offspring,</hi> than Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi>; or, more inceſſantly <hi>travelled in Birth, that Chriſt might be formed in them.</hi> She lodged many an ardent <hi>Petition</hi> in the Court of Heaven, on their Behalf; and daily recommended them to the Grace of our Almighty Saviour. She requeſted nothing for them, with a <hi>paſſionate</hi> Importunity, but a Union to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their <hi>living Head</hi>; and an Admiſſion into

the Number of his redeemed People. She rejoiced, to ſee them increaſe in Knowledge,—appear with a juſt <hi>Decorum,</hi> upon the Stage of Life,—and comfortably ſettled in the World. But ſhe knew, theſe were <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>precarious</hi> Advantages, inſufficient to ſatisfy the <hi>boundleſs Appetites</hi> of an intelligent and immortal Spirit. To obtain for Herſelf, and Poſterity, the Favour of an <hi>unchangeable</hi> GOD, and an Intreſt in that <hi>everlaſting Covenant, in all Things well ordered and ſure,</hi> was the Height of her Ambition. If this was ſecured, ſhe was perſwaded they would be happy in <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity,</hi>—in <hi>Sickneſs</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi>—in <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> Therefore, ſhe inſtilled into their tender Minds, <hi>the good Knowledge of the Lord</hi>: And as they grew up to Years of Diſcretion, by the moſt gentle and <hi>attractive</hi> Methods of Perſwaſion, ſtrove to engage them to dedicate their Youth, to the Service of God; and ſedulouſly to avoid thoſe <hi>Irregularities,</hi> by which the <hi>Morning</hi> of Life, is ſo frequently <hi>darkned</hi> and defiled.</p>
               <p>SHE continued a Widow ſeveral Years; employing her Time, in Exerciſes of <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>—the neceſſary Cares, of her <hi>Family,</hi>—and the Offices of <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> Afterwards, ſhe married <hi>Johns Campbell,</hi>

               <p>AFTER a ſuitable Interval, ſhe married <hi>Henry Lloyd,</hi>

                  <hi>Village,</hi> in the Province of NEW-YORK. With him ſhe lived in uninterrupted Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Friendship, upwards of twenty Years. She now entered upon a Scene of Life entirely <hi>new.</hi> Hitherto ſhe had dwelt in a <hi>populous</hi> Town, among her Relations, and ſurrounded with a large and delightful Acquaintance. But upon her Marriage with Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> ſhe removed into a diſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to the retired <hi>Solitudes</hi> of a rural Life. She accommodated herſelf to this <hi>Change</hi> of Circumſtances, with great Propriety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and in the calm <hi>Retreat,</hi> enjoyed the Bleſſings of Peace and Plenty, and an Opportunity of improving, in thoſe devout Exerciſes, which had always been the Joy and Solace of her Life. But tho' ſhe was, in a great Meaſure, removed from the Society and Amuſements of the World, yet, ſhe did not fly its important and neceſſary Buſineſs.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006530_0020_10292F71B36C0060"/>
In her, Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> found an agreeable <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,</hi>—his <hi>Children,</hi> an affectionate <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>—his <hi>Servants,</hi> an indulgent <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>—, his <hi>Tenants,</hi> a kind and beneficent <hi>Friend</hi>; who <hi>rejoiced</hi> in their <hi>Proſperity,—ſympathized</hi> with them, in their <hi>Sorrows,—relieved</hi> them, in their <hi>Wants,</hi>—and was never eaſy, but when performing fome charitable and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Action. She ſoon became acquainted with the <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi> and engaged in them with Alacrity and Vigour. She ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged a numerous Family, with the exacteſt <hi>Economy</hi>; and treated Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Children with the ſame Tenderneſs and Affection, as if they had been her own.</p>
               <p>So amiable a Conduct, muſt certainly highly, <hi>endear</hi> her, to all who were ſo happy as to be related to her. Accordingly, the Family, in which her Lot was now caſt, ſhowed her <hi>uncommon</hi> Reſpect; and were ſenſible, that in her, they received a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>extenſive</hi> Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>IN this ſolitary, but pleaſant Retirement, ſhe managed her Time in the moſt uſeful Manner; looking well to the Affairs of her Houſhold, and ſpending her remaining Hours, in Prayer, Meditation, and other religious Exerciſes;</p>

                  <hi>DEATH,</hi> ſhe kept continually in View; and ſo <hi>numbered her Days,</hi> as to prepare for that <hi>deciſive Moment,</hi> on which is ſuſpended an Eternity of Happineſs or Miſery. Her conſtant Concern, was to <hi>act</hi> her Part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Stage</hi> of Life, well; to the Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of her Judge; and to <hi>finiſh her Courſe with Joy.</hi> She was naturally of a tender and delicate Conſtitution; but was favoured with an <hi>unuſual</hi> Degree of Health, for a Woman of her advanced Years. For ſome Time before her Death, ſhe perceived a <hi>Feebleneſs</hi> of Nature, gradually increaſing upon her; and often ſaid. <q>The <hi>Lamp</hi> of Life is almoſt <hi>expired!</hi>
                  </q>—but ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her Activity, and Sprightlineſs of Temper. She ſpoke of <hi>Death</hi> with an Air of Pleaſure; and ſeemed to wait, with earneſt, Deſire, a peaceful Diſmiſſion to eternal Reſt. The Day before ſhe died, ſhe was in good Health; and in the Evening, ſupped and converſed with her family and Friends, with her <hi>accuſtomed</hi> Chearfulneſs. She retired, and ſpent ſome Time in reading the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hervey</hi>'s Meditations; — a Book ſhe greatly admired for its <hi>ſublime</hi> Thoughts, <hi>elevated</hi> Piety, and <hi>ſplendid</hi> Diction. There is ſomething ſo <hi>ſtriking</hi> in ſome of the <hi>laſt</hi> Lines ſhe read in that admirable Performance;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006530_0022_1028DCDCFB48A6A8"/>
and ſo ſurprizingly <hi>adapted</hi> to the Scenes of Providence, which were before her, that I cannot forbear tranſcribing them. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>O! how <hi>thin</hi> is the <hi>Partition</hi> between this World and another! How <hi>ſhort</hi> the <hi>Tranſition</hi> from Time to Eternity! The Partition, nothing more than the Breath in our Noſtrils; and the Tranſition may be made in the Twinkling of an Eye. The Eyes of that Sublime Being,—who ſits upon the Circles of the Earth, and views all its Inhabitants with one comprehenſive Glance,—even now behold many Tents in Affliction: Such Affliction, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed The <hi>Egyptians</hi> in that fatal Night, when the deſtroying Angel ſheathed his Arrows in all the Pride of their Strength.—Some, ſinking to the Floor from their <hi>eaſy Chair</hi>; and deaf even to the moſt piercing Shrieks of their diſtracted Relations.—Some, giving up the Ghoſt as they are reclined, in all alone, under the <hi>ſhady Arbour,</hi> to taſte the Sweets of the flowery Scene.—Some, as they ſail, aſſociated with a <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> along the Silver Stream, while Wine and Muſic flow around: Some <hi>intercepted,</hi> as they are returning Home; and ſome <hi>interrupted,</hi> as they enter upon an important Negotiation.</q>
                  </note> She went to Bed, at her wonted Hour, without any <hi>apparent Symptoms</hi> of approaching Diſorder; and ſoon fell into a calm Sleep. About two o'Clock, ſhe awaked; and in a few Minutes, complained that ſhe wanted Breath; and aſked for a <hi>Doſe</hi> of <hi>Elixir,</hi> which uſed to relieve her in her Faintneſs. It was ready at Hand, and brought immediately: She drank

it down, and that Moment expired,—without a Groan or Struggle; <hi>Novenrber</hi> 10. 1749. Thus, ſhe paſſed from the <hi>gentle Slumbers</hi> of Nature, to the <hi>final Sleep</hi> of Death:—At once, changed a dark and diſordered World, for the tranſporting Abodes of Light and Joy;—without experiencing thoſe melancholly Scenes of Sickneſs and Pain,—the uſual <hi>Attendants</hi> of a dying Bed!</p>
               <p>A SUDDEN <hi>Death</hi> is the Object of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Dread. And certainly, nothing can be a more affecting Spectacle than to behold <hi>gay unthinking Creatures,</hi> removed in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the <hi>tumultuous Hurries</hi> of the World, and the <hi>defiling Pleaſure</hi> of Sin, to the <hi>enlightned Tribunal</hi> of God; where they muſt receive an <hi>irrevocable</hi> Sentence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Deeds done in the Body.</hi> With the <hi>faſteſt</hi> Reaſon, do the greateſt Part of Mankind pray, <q>From ſudden Death, good Lord, deliver us;</q> for t'hey waſte their Days in a fatal Forgetfulneſ of their latter End: And if the <hi>mortal summons</hi> ſurprizes them unawares, it ſurely finds them unprepared for the momentous Change.

               <p>WHAT can be more deſirable, than to be removed at once, from the <hi>fading</hi> Comforts of Earth, to the <hi>unwithering</hi> Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!—One Hour, proſtrate at the <hi>Footſtool</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi>; groaning under a body of Sin and Death;—the next, ſtanding before the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; adorned with the ſhining Glories of complete Salvation!—One Moment in the Boſom of our <hi>earthly Friends</hi>;—the next, united to the <hi>bliſsful Society</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>general Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect</hi>!—Glorious Tranſition!—not to be <hi>deplored</hi> as a <hi>Misfortune</hi>; but <hi>congratulated</hi> as a diſtinguiſhing <hi>Happineſs</hi>!—When we have finiſhed our appointed Time upon Earth, and we are ready for a Removal to an everlaſting Habitation, it is a Favour to be delivered from the <hi>common Agonies</hi> of diſſolving Nature, and excuſed the ſad <hi>Solemnity</hi> of bidding Adieu to out Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Friends.</p>
               <p>BESIDES what may be learned of Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Character, from the proceeding Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; Juſtice to her <hi>uncommon Merit</hi>; and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006530_0025_10292F7EF8E458A8"/>
a Regard to the <hi>Edification</hi> of Survivors, demand that I enlarge a little farther, on thoſe various Excellencies, which rendered her ſo <hi>uſeful</hi> in Life, and ſo much <hi>lamented</hi> at Death.</p>
               <p>HER <hi>Aſpect</hi> way lovely, ſerene and pleaſant. She ſpoke in a graceful Manner, in ſoft and flowing Language. The Politeneſs of her Addreſs, the Vivacity of her Converſatiorn, joined to the Benevolence of her Diſpoſition, captivated all Companies; and made Perſons of every Rank, fond of cultivating her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantance.</p>
               <p>HER <hi>intellectual Faculties</hi> were vaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common Level: A penetrating Underſtanding; a ſprightly Fancy; a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Memory; a clear and happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, raiſed her above the greateſt Part of the Sex; more than any of thoſe <hi>glittering Diſtinctions,</hi> upon which they are apt inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately to doat.</p>
               <p>But, Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi> was ſenſible that the Charms of Wit and Beauty, if not improved in the Service of Heaven, only render Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more exquiſitely baſe and miſerable. It was therefore her moſt ſolicitous Care, to have her Breaſt <hi>animated</hi> with the Love and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006530_0026_10292F81788A3670"/>
Fear of God; and her Life <hi>governed</hi> by the Precepts of Religion. And perhaps, few ever acted more <hi>uniformly</hi> under is influence, than the Perſon we are ſpeaking of. She thought, ſpoke, and lived, as One that <hi>ſet the Lord always before</hi> her, and retained an abiding Senſe of his Love. She began the Day with God, and roſe early that ſhe might have a calm <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Opportunity for the Offices of Devotion. No <hi>Hurry</hi> of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,—no <hi>Diverſion</hi> of Company,—no <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of Life, were ſuffered to exclude her <hi>ſtated Hours</hi> of Meditation and Prayer: Theſe, ſhe attended, not as an appointed' <hi>Taſk</hi> impoſed upon her; but always returned to them, with Eagerneſs, as the moſt <hi>refreſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>honourble</hi> Employment. How ſhe improved her Time, is fully known only by HIM to whom thoſe ſacred Hours were conſecrated. Her private <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> plainly ſhow, they were ſpent in the moſt pious and profitable Manner;—adoring the AUTHOR, of her Being,—reſigning herſelf afreſh to the SAVIOUR of Mankind,—meditating on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subjects,—ſtrengthening her Reſolutions to live to God, and the Deſigns of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,—and earneſtly imploring the almighty Aids of the Spirit; without which ſhe was ſenſible, ſhe could do nothing <hi>ſpiritually</hi> good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006530_0027_10292F861B58D2F0"/>HER Piety was not confined to the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> but directed, animated and ſupported her, thro' all the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of the Day. To obey the <hi>Comamds</hi> of her Maker,—to ſubmit to the <hi>unerring Diſpoſals</hi> of Heaven,—to maintain a happy <hi>Serenity</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> amidſt the various Viciſſitudes of Life,—to reſiſt the <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Allurements</hi> of an enſharing World,—was her conſtant unremitted Endeavour:</p>
               <p>SHE <hi>read</hi> much;—but had not <hi>Taſte</hi> for any Thing, but what had an evident Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make Mankind <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better.</hi> Books of <hi>meer Amuſement,</hi> ſhe ſeldom cared to meddle with, eſteeming Time too precious, to be triſled away is Vanity. Treatiſes of <hi>practical Divinity,</hi>ſhe read with a <hi>peculiar</hi> Reliſh. Thoſe Writings, which were beſt calculated to inſpire her with a <hi>humble Senſe</hi> of the Vileneſs and Corruption of Human Nature; and give her <hi>exalted Views</hi> of the wonderful Love of God, in the myſterious Work of Redemption,—were what, ſhe <hi>principally</hi> valued and ſtudied. But above all, the BOOK of GOD, was that in which ſhe took the greateſt Delight. This ſhe made here her conſtant, <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Couſellor,</hi>—the <hi>Guide</hi> of her Youth,—the <hi>Companion</hi> of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006530_0028_10292F88F97CE370"/>
her Solitude,—and the <hi>Support</hi> of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age. She read the ſacred Pages, and other religious Tracts, not ſo much to encreaſe her <hi>ſpeculative Knowledge,</hi> and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Inclinations of an <hi>inquiſitive Mind</hi>; as to learn the ſelf-denying Myſteries of the Croſs of CHRIST,—<hi>detach</hi> her Affections from the <hi>Creature,</hi> and <hi>unite</hi> them more vigorouſly to the ORIGINAL SOURCE of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Lord's Day</hi> was indeed to her, an holy <hi>Sabbath</hi> of <hi>Reſt</hi>; entirely <hi>conſecrated</hi> to the Exerciſes of Piety, Devotion, and Charity. She retired from the unneceſſary Affairs of Life; and took Care that her <hi>Domeſtics</hi> might not be encumbered with Buſineſs, but have Leiſure to pay their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to that BEING, whom <hi>all Ranks</hi> of Men are <hi>equally</hi> bound to adore and obey. No <hi>trifling</hi> Diſourſe,—no <hi>unprofitable,</hi> Amuſements were permitted in her Preſence. A chearful and compoſed <hi>Gravity,</hi>—a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Solemnity,</hi> appeared in all her Conduct, on the <hi>Chriſtian Sabbath</hi>; except ſhe found a convenient Occaſion, to introduce a <hi>Converſation</hi> upon religious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for the Inſtruction and Edification of the Company. Thoſe <hi>ſacred Hours</hi> were

               <p>WHILE ſhe lived in BOSTON, no flight Indiſpoſition,—no Inclemencies of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, detained her from the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>Saints.</hi> And after her Removal into the Country, tho' the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Workſhip</hi> was ſeveral Miles diſtant from her Abode, ſhe gave her conſtant Attendance, unleſs the Weather was ſo tempeſtuous, as evidently to endanger her Health, and thoſe who waited upon her. How ſhe behaved in the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, was viſible to Multitude, who were at once <hi>reproved</hi> and <hi>edified</hi> by her humble and reverent <hi>Example.</hi> There was nothing careleſs and negligent, or formal and affected in her Behaviour, during divine Service. She joined in the <hi>publick Prayers</hi> with Fervency and Devotion; and attended to the <hi>pious Inſtractions,</hi> deliver'd from the Pulpit, with the cloſeſt Appication. 'Throughout the whole Solemnity, ſhe was all <hi>Ear</hi>!—all Attentions! Her Eyes were fix'd, and Heart intent upon the important

Tranſaction. A <hi>careleſs</hi> Look,—an <hi>inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive</hi> the Negligence,—<hi>a ceremonious</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance; ſhe eſteemed the <hi>higheſt Abſurdity</hi>; when appearing in the more <hi>immediate</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Maker, and hearing <hi>the Words of eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SHE was a conſtant <hi>Communicant</hi> from her Youth; and expreſſed the higheſt Veneration for that <hi>ſolemn Inſtitution,</hi> which our bleſſed Lord recommended to his Church with his dying Breath. She received the confecrated Elements, with an ardent Deſire after that <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> by which alone, our Souls can be preſerved in ſpiritual Health and Vigour. The lively <hi>Image</hi> of a crucified <hi>Savour,</hi> and the aſtoniſhing <hi>Wonders</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> to apoſtate Sinners, exhibited in that Ordinance, made the moſt <hi>affectionate</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon her Heart; and often filled her with Tranſports of <hi>grateful</hi> Joy.</p>
               <p>But tho' Mrs. <hi>Lloyd</hi> appropriated much of her Time to <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Retirement,</hi> yet ſhe made this no Excuſe, to exempt her from the <hi>common Duties</hi> of Life. She <hi>deſcended from the Mount,</hi> with a ſerene Compoſure, and chearful Diſpoſition, to engage in every neceſſary Employment

                  <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> ſhe accounted <hi>peculiarly</hi> criminal in thoſe, whom GOD has <hi>diſtinguiſh'd</hi> with a larger Share, than common, of the Gifts of Nature and Providence. The Buſineſs of every Day was proſecuted in its <hi>proper Seaſon</hi> with a <hi>Livelineſs</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> that animated and encouraged all around her. She thought it no Burden, but <hi>Privilege,</hi> to fill up every <hi>vacant</hi> Space, with ſomething that mighty be <hi>improving</hi> to herſelf, or <hi>inſtructive</hi> to others. Her conſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Duties of Religion, created no <hi>Diſtance</hi> or <hi>Reſerve</hi> in her Behaviourſ Her Converſation was eaſy, natural, and pleaſant. She was <hi>chearful</hi> without <hi>Levity,—grave</hi> without <hi>Affectation</hi>—condeſcending to the <hi>meaneſt,</hi>—obliging and helpful to ALL.</p>
               <p>IT has been objected to Perſons <hi>eminent</hi> in Religion, that they are apt to be <hi>ſevere</hi> in their Cenſures; and take an <hi>ill-natur'd Pride</hi> in reflecting upon the Conduct of others. This, whenever it appears, is a <hi>great Blemiſh</hi> to Religion; and an unfailing Evidence, that the Perſons to whom it is juſtly imputed, have made but a <hi>ſuperficial</hi> Progreſs in the Chriſtian Life, and are under the <hi>predominant</hi> Influence of a proud ſelf-righteous Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006530_0032_10292F932C758FB0"/>Mrs. LLOYD was <hi>remarkably</hi> diſtant from any Thing of this Nature. She knew the Chriſtian Doctrine was deſigned, not only to <hi>enkindle</hi> in our Breaſts, a <hi>ſacred Flame</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> to God; but to <hi>inſpire</hi> us, with Sentiments of <hi>univerſal Benevolence</hi> to Mankind. The Sanctity of her Life, was adorned with the <hi>tendereſt</hi> Condeſcention to the Weakneſs and Infirmities of others: She <hi>enlarged,</hi> with Pleaſure, upon their <hi>Vertues</hi>; and made the <hi>handſomeſt Apologies</hi> for their unguarded <hi>Follies.</hi> Nothing but <hi>abandon'd</hi> Vice could provoke her to ſpeak with <hi>Severity</hi>; and thro' an <hi>Exceſs</hi> of Charity would fain diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>praiſe-worthy</hi> even in the <hi>worſt</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters: An <hi>Air</hi> of <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> appeared in her Countenance, whenever an ill-natur'd or envious <hi>Reflection</hi> was made in her Preſence. With all the <hi>Warmth</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the <hi>abſent,</hi> tho' perhaps a diſtant Stranger. To ſport with the Reputation of our Neighbour,—to expoſe and aggravate his Faults, ſhe eſteem'd the moſt <hi>ungenerous</hi> Conduct;—not only a direct Oppoſition to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; but a plain Violation of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>civil Society.</hi> When Scandal and Detraction were the Subject of Converſation, where ſhe was obliged to be preſent; ſhe always teſtified her Diſpleaſure;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006530_0033_10292F9629C9C4E8"/>
either with an <hi>open Rebuke,</hi> or, where this was improper, with a melancholly and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Silence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HER <hi>ſuperior</hi> Knowledge,—<hi>communicative</hi> Diſpoſition,—and <hi>conſtant</hi> Good-Nature, made her Converſation highly agreeable. She talked upon every innocent and uſeful Subject with great Sprightlineſs and Freedom; but could never bear a <hi>prophane</hi> Jeſt, or <hi>malicious</hi> Satire, tho' cloathed in the <hi>faireſt</hi> Dreſs, and adorned with the Charms of Wit and Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>RELIGION was her <hi>favourite Topic,</hi> which ſhe introduced upon every proper Occaſion, and endeavored to ſet in an <hi>amiable</hi> Lights, in order to recommend it, to the Eſteem and Affection of all her Acquaintance. She had a deep Senſe of the <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery,</hi> that attend a <hi>vicious State</hi>; and was earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to reſcue all, to whom ſhe had Acceſs, from its uneaſy and <hi>diſgraceful</hi> Bondage. She ſpoke in the moſt elevated Language of the <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>redeeming</hi> Grace; and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an ALL-SUFFICIENT SAVIOURS, with all the Beauties of Perſwaſion and Eloquence. None came into her Company, but ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inſpire them with a <hi>Deteſtation</hi>

of <hi>Vice,</hi> and aſſiſt them in the <hi>Practice</hi> of the ſublimeſt Degrees of <hi>Piety: Out of the good Treaſure of</hi> her <hi>Heart,</hi> ſhe <hi>brought forth Things new and old,</hi> for their Inſtruction and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. She was attended to with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Delight; and few left her Company, without ſenſible <hi>Regret.</hi> She poſſeſſed in Perfection the happy Art of turning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, from Things of a <hi>triſling</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Nature, to thoſe that were <hi>important</hi> and <hi>profitable.</hi> She eaſily aſcended from the <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Hevaven</hi>—from the <hi>Flowers</hi> of the <hi>Field,</hi> to the <hi>Beauties</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>—from the <hi>common Tranſactions</hi> of Life, to the <hi>momentous Affairs</hi> of Eternity:—From the daily Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Providence, ſhe formed inſructive Leſſons of Prudence and Piety.</p>
               <p>SHE had no Taſte for thoſe <hi>Diverſions,</hi> in which the faſhionable and polite Part of Mankind too often ſpend the moſt valuable Part of their Time. In the Exerciſes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, ſhe found a <hi>perpetual Spring</hi> of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime and ſatisfying Pleaſures, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt <hi>Support</hi> under the <hi>unavoidable</hi> Trials and Afflictions of Life. A firm Perſwaſion of the everlaſting <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>—an unſhaken Truſt in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our almighty Saviour,—the Teſtimony of a <hi>good Conſcience</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:006530_0035_10292F9B41B685B8"/>
—and a joyful Expectation of <hi>heavely Happineſs,</hi> inclined her to look down with a generous <hi>Diſdain</hi> on all he aſſuring Vanities of the World; and to aſpire after Nothing but the higheſt Degrees of Preparation for the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THO' ſhe was naturally of a <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> Temper; yet ſhe kept her <hi>Paſſions</hi> under the moſt abſolute Command, and was always ſerene, compoſed, and chearful. Thoſe diſpleaſing Accidents, which often raiſe a <hi>ſudden Tempeſt</hi> of Anger, even in the Breaſt of good Men, hardly ever <hi>ruffled</hi> the <hi>Tranquility</hi> of her Mind. Upon the greateſt <hi>perſonal</hi> Provocations, ſhe never allowed an <hi>indecent</hi> Word; nor betrayed an <hi>unjuſtifiable</hi> Reſentment. If ever ſhe expreſſed herſelf with Warmth and Vehemence, it was in the Cauſe of Heaven and flow'd from a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable</hi> Zeal againſt Opinions and Practices, which ſhe thought <hi>deſtructive</hi> to pure and undefiled Religion.</p>
               <p>NOT that ſhe was inflamed with a bitter Spirit, aginſt Perſons of <hi>different</hi> Sentiments in Religion. She loved good Men of all Perſwaſions; and reverenced real Religion, in whatſoever Communication ſhe found it. All
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006530_0036_10292F9DABC69AA0"/>
who were animated with the <hi>Love of God,</hi>—maintain'd the <hi>eſſential Truths</hi> of Chriſtianity and adorned their Profeſſion by an <hi>holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> ſhe embraced with a cordial Reſpect, without Regard to <hi>Party</hi>-Names, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</p>
               <p>SHE was a warm Advocate for what are generally ſtiled the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> She was firmly perſwaded, they had the greateſt Tendency, to exalt the Glory of God; and afforded the higheſt Encouragement to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing apoſtate Sinners; and were upon all Accounts calculated to promote the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Holineſs of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, She therefore openly appeared in their Favour, and defended them when miſrepreſented and oppoſed by Perſons of a different Way of thinking. But ſhe had too deep a Senſe of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of human Nature, and the Strength of the <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Education, raſhly to pronounce an Anathema meerly on the Account of a <hi>Diverſity</hi> of Opinion, in theſe myſterious Points. Her Zeal againſt <hi>Error</hi> was accompanied with a Tenderneſs to the <hi>Erroneous.</hi> She treated their Perſons, with Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they might be <hi>brought to the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Truth</hi>!</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:006530_0037_10292FA104B2B2A0"/>CHARITY was her darling Vertue, which ſhe exerciſed. with peculiar Delight and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and deſired as ſhe had Opportunity, <hi>to do good unto all Men.</hi> Her benevolent Spirit was not <hi>circumſcribed</hi> within the Bounds of any divided Communion; but <hi>extended</hi> to all Mankind, without Diſtinction of, Parties. It ſeemed her <hi>uninterrupted Study,</hi> to perform generous and beneficent Actions to all, within the Circle of her Acquaintance,—even beyond her Ability. She knew no other Uſe of <hi>Money,</hi> but to aſſiſt her Friends in their Difficulties, and relieve the Poor in their Indigence. She was always <hi>uneaſy,</hi> if any left her Houſe, without receiving ſome <hi>valuable</hi> Token of her Kindneſs. To do obliging Things, was the <hi>genuine Propenſity</hi> of her Soul, and one of the moſt <hi>refin'd Pleaſures</hi> of her Life. The Value of the Gift, was <hi>heightned</hi> by the kind <hi>engaging</hi> Manner in which it was conferr'd. Her Generoſity was never <hi>extorted</hi> by <hi>Importunity,</hi> nor <hi>diſpenſed</hi> with <hi>Regret.</hi> Miſery and Want always excited her compaſſionate Regard; and engaged her to uſe her <hi>utmoſt Efforts</hi> to remove them. She joyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced every Opportunity to <hi>diffuſe</hi> Happineſs to all around her; and in the Peace and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of her Mind, experienced the Truth
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006530_0038_10292FA2861A87D0"/>
of that <hi>Maxim</hi> of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>It is more bleſſed to</hi> give <hi>than to</hi> receive. She condeſcended to the <hi>loweſt Offices,</hi> that ſhe might do good to Mankind; viſited the Poor in their Sickneſs; provided for their Support; and by her wiſe religious <hi>Counſels</hi> aſſiſted them to make a ſuitable Improvement of their Affliction.</p>
               <p>NO Wonder ſuch <hi>Aſſemblage</hi> of <hi>Vertues,</hi> ſo many lovely Qualities, rendered her the Delight of her Fiends; and overwhelmed them with Grief, at her ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Removal. Tho' ſhe had paſſed the Threſhold of Old Age; yet the <hi>Regularity</hi> of her Conduct, her <hi>exact Temperance</hi> in Diet, and the <hi>Vivacity,</hi> of her Temper, which continued to the laſt; encouraged us to hope for a much longer Enjoyment of ſo valuable a Life.</p>
               <p>I AM, ſenſible, than in this Account to do Juſtice to her Memory, I have fallen much ſhort of what her <hi>extraordinary</hi> Merit deſerves. Her Friends will be able to add many <hi>beautiful Particulars,</hi> to thoſe here enumerated. I have given a faint, but <hi>true Reſemblance</hi> of her Character and Conduct; tho' not with that Life and Propriety, which the Excellency
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006530_0039_10292FA50A1E7FF8"/>
of my Subject requires. We value the <hi>Pourtrait</hi> of a departed Friend, if <hi>like</hi> the Original, tho' not drawn by the moſt <hi>ſkillful</hi> Hand.</p>
               <p>I SHALL only add a few Words relating to the following <hi>Papers.</hi> They were all written for her own <hi>private</hi> Uſe; and undoubtedly never deſigned for <hi>public</hi> View. But when upon her lamented Death, they fell into my Hands, I thought them <hi>too valuable</hi> a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be <hi>concealed</hi> from the World. I have therefore ſelected, ſuch of her Manuſcripts, as I imagined, might be of <hi>moſt general</hi> Uſe; and am perſwaded they will afford Inſtruction and Delight to a ſerious and devout Mind.</p>
               <p>THE Reader muſt not expect any <hi>labour'd</hi> Criticiſms, <hi>deep</hi> Reaſonings, or <hi>rhetorical</hi> Flouriſhes. It cannot be expected, that a Gentlewoman, who was daily buſied in the Cares of a numerous Family, could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>ſcholaſtic</hi> Niceties, and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Refinments</hi> of Method and Stile. The following Collection ſpeaks the <hi>undiſguiſed</hi> Language of her Heart. She talks of divine Things, in that familiar and affecting Manner, in which they appeared to her, in her devout, Retirements. They contain ſome of the ſecret

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> MY ever glorious and gracious God, and heavenly Father in Jeſus Chriſt! I read in the ſacred Oracles of Truth, that Thou didſt <hi>ſo love the World, as to give thine only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life</hi>;—and that <hi>this Life is in thy Son</hi>—Thou haſt alſo borne Teſtimony, that JESUS <hi>is</hi> thy <hi>beloved Son, in whom</hi> thou

art <hi>well pleaſed</hi>;—that thoſe who <hi>believe thy Teſtimony have ſet to their Seal, that God is true;—but they that believe not, have made God a Liar.</hi> I therefore importunately pray, That thou wouldeſt beſtow on me, <hi>that Faith by which the Juſt do live</hi>; and all thoſe divine and heavenly Qualifications, which are the certain <hi>Conſequence,</hi> and beſt <hi>Evidence,</hi> of my Union to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; in <hi>whom all the Promiſes are Yea and Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this, and whatſoever elſe, is requiſite to my preſent and future Happineſs, muſt proceed from thee, <hi>who art the Author and Finiſher of our Faith.</hi>—For thou haſt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That none can come to the Son, but thoſe whom the Father draws: And none can know the Father, but thoſe to whom the Son doth reveal him.</hi> I deſire therefore, in the Name and Strength, of my glorious and exalted Advocate and Redeemer, humbly to plead with Faith and Fervency, for the efficacious and all-conquering Drawings of thy holy Holy Spirit; that I may indeed obtain a ſaving Knowledge, <hi>of the thee, the living and true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O MY GOD! wilt thou be graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Chriſt's Sake, <hi>to ſend forth thy Light

and thy Truth, to lead me into all Truth,</hi> and enable me, at this Time, to make a faithful and ſincere Enquiry, whether my Faith be true and ſaving? whether indeed <hi>Chriſt is formed in me</hi>? May I be enable now, and at all Times, ſo to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> as my tend moſt for thy Glory and the Salvation of my own Soul. May I never think, ſpeak, or write, any Thing, but what I receive from thee, and is agreeable to thy holy Will.</p>
                  <p>I DESIRE to have my whole Dependance upon thy glorious Majeſty, to enable me always to ſee divine Truths in a proper Light, and <hi>to work within me the whole good Pleaſure of thy Grace, and the Work of Faith with Power.</hi> All this, and whatever elſe is needful for me and mine, and the whole Iſrael of God, I humbly beg for Chriſt's Sake:—To whom, with thy glorious Majeſty, and the bleſſed Spirit of Grace, the Comforter, be rendered, the Kingdom, Power, Glory and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, now and evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>

conſequently whether I am by divine Grace; <hi>united</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi>; by Virtue of which Union alone, I can live ſpiritually and eternally. An <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Faith, which is only conveyed to me by my Reaſon and Underſtanding, I know is not ſufficient; <hi>for the Devils believe and tremble,</hi>—My En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry then muſt be, what is a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith; and whether I have been made the happy Subject of this Faith. An hiſtorical and rational Faith, is indeed requiſite as a <hi>Means,</hi> in order to the obtaining a ſaving Faith: For I read, <hi>that Faith comes by hearing;—how can we believe on him of whom we have not heard</hi>?

                  <p>EVERY one <hi>that cometh unto God, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that be is, and that be is the Rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> That there is a God, a Supreme Being, the great Creator, and Lord Proprietor of all Things, not only the Light of Nature, and the Dictates of Reaſon, but my very <hi>Senſes,</hi> inform me. For <hi>the inviſible Things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen; being underſtood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006530_0046_10292FB826E96148"/>
But that the <hi>Book,</hi> in Which I find all theſe glorious Doctrines ſo plainly and ſtrongly aſſerted, is a <hi>Revelation</hi> from Heaven, my <hi>Reaſon</hi> very much aſſiſts me in the Belief of: So that the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, with much Juſtice and Propriety, ranks Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with <hi>unreaſonable Men.</hi> For altho' the ſublime Miſteries of the Goſpel, are in themſelves ſo infinitely beyond the <hi>Ken</hi> of human Reaſon; nor could ever be diſcovered by the dim Light of Nature; yet they are ſo plainly and convincingly <hi>conveyed</hi> to us in the ſacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and attended with ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> an Evidence of their divine Authority, as is ſufficient to obtain the Belief of every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and <hi>unprejudiced</hi> Perſon.</p>
                  <p>IN this bleſſed Book I find an Account of the <hi>Creation,</hi> which not only may <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but my very <hi>Senſes,</hi> inform me is true.

GOD.—But <hi>how,</hi> or in <hi>what Manner,</hi> this Promiſe was to be accompliſh'd, neither Men nor Angels dare ſo much as have gueſs'd,—without <hi>divine Revelation.</hi> But the ſacred Oracles of Truth, inform me, <hi>that God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that all who believe in him, ſhould not periſh, but have Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>—This I believe upon the Authority of the Word of God. That JESUS CHRIST is this invaluable Gift, I have the Teſtimony of the great God himſelf, who by an audible Voice from Heaven, declar'd <hi>him, his beloved Son, in whom he is well pleas'd.</hi>—Upon this <hi>ſingle</hi> Evidence I may ſafely venture my ALL, for Time and Eternity.

                  <p>As to the moral Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion, I am well aſſured, that had PLATO, SENECA, and all the Maſters of Reaſon of the Heathen World, ſeen that glorious <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi>; thoſe excellent Precepts contain'd in our Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount, they would have ſaid, that their Author was <hi>divine,</hi> and theſe Writings inſpired.</p>
                  <p>THUS the great and glorious God, is pleas'd to deal with us as <hi>reaſonable Creatures</hi>; and by Means and Inſtruments, conveys to us ſpiritual Truth: But after all, the ſublime Myſteries of the Goſpel, cannot be ſavingly comprehended, in this Way alone: The Line of Reaſon is too ſhort, to teach thoſe unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable Depths, <hi>which Angels themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to look into.</hi> It is the mighty Power of God which produces in us that Faith, <hi>which is unto Salvation.</hi>

in the Courſe of my Education, I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the Holy Scriptures in my <hi>own Language</hi>; and have always enjoy'd the Means of Grace to help me in my Chriſtian Race:—But if God had not, of his infinite Grace, ſent forth a <hi>divine Ray</hi> of Light and Life, to enable me to receive JESUS, with my whole Soul, in all his Offices, for all his Benefits,—<hi>Wiſdom, Righteouſneſ, Sanctification, and enternal Redemption</hi>; it is moſt certain, that the higheſt Degrees of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Knowledge, and all the <hi>extenal.</hi> Means of Grace, would have proved <hi>ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> to my Salvation.—It is the Work of God to encline me to believe in Chriſt. No Power ſhort of the which created the World at firſt, <hi>could create me anew in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>;—and nothing ſhort of a new Creation, will prove effectual to my Salvation. It is a transforming Act of Faith that unites us to Chriſt, and gives a Title to that precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> MY GOD! <hi>thou haſt taught me from my Youth: and hitherto I have declar'd thy wondrous Works: Now alſo when I am old and grey Headed, O God forſake me not; until I have ſhewed thy Strength unto this Generation, and thy Power to every one that is to come.</hi>

Way to preſerve us from every hurtful and deadly Evil,—to obtain the Peace and Pleaſure upon Earth, and Eternal Happineſs in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>To prove this Propoſition, I will firſt conſider the meer <hi>moral Man,</hi> who has nothing elſe in View, but the Honour and Advantage of this Life.—This Man is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>juſt</hi> in his Dealings, <hi>generous</hi> to his Friend, <hi>charitable</hi> to the Poor, kind and <hi>beneficient</hi> to all, as far as his Circumſtances will admit.—He is careful to hurt Body by Word or Deed; he walks is the ſtraight Path of Truth and Integrity, in his Commerce with his Fellow Creatures; and governs himſelf by the Rules of moral Vertue, in all his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Conduct; in eating, drinking, ſleeping, Recreation,<hi>&amp;c.</hi> obſerves the Laws of Sobriety and Temperance. That this Man has a juſt Claim to the Honour, Eſteem and Affection, of all that converſe with him; I ſuppoſe none will deny. O how many <hi>Advantages</hi> does he receive from his amiable Behaviors!</p>
                  <p>HIs kind and generous Diſpoſition, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and neceſſarily advaces his,Credit; and for ehe moſt part he: experiences the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of thoſe Texts,—<hi>He that watereth,

ſhall alſo be watered himſelf. There is that ſcattereth, and yet encreaſeth. The liberal Soul deviſeth liberal Things, and by liberal Things be ſtands.</hi> While the <hi>Miſer</hi> is abhorr'd both by God and Man; and often feels the Force of thoſe Words: <hi>There is that with-holdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to Poverty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>STRICT <hi>Juſtice</hi> in all our Tranſactions with Mankind, is the readieſt Way to enlarge our Buſineſs, and by that Means to encreaſe our Eſtates; while the <hi>fradulent</hi> Dealer, is in the utmoſt Danger of being detected and ruin'd. A ſteady. Integrity in our whole Conduct, is upon all Accounts, moſt eaſy and honourable. <hi>Truth</hi> wants no Contrivance or Invention; but, like a perfect <hi>Beauty,</hi> looks beſt, at the neareſt Approach:—It will bear the Teſt of the moſt critical Inquiry, and ever comes off with univerſal Applauſe. Even the moſt proſtigate, have a ſecret <hi>Reverence</hi> for that, which they have not the <hi>Honeſty</hi> to practiſe. Whereas the inſincere and fallacious, when diſcovered, are the Objects of publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and avoided by all that know them.</p>
                  <p>THAT Temperance in eating, drinking; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contribute to the Health of the Body, and the Strength and Brightneſs of the intellectual
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:006530_0064_10292FE9714A06D8"/>
Faculties, is a Truth, to which the Experience of all Ages bears Teſtimony. <hi>Epicurus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who knew no other Religion than <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> lived principally upon Herbs, and the pure Water of the Books. And nothing can be more ſelf-evident than, that a <hi>clear Head,</hi> and an <hi>healthy Body,</hi> is eſſential to the Comfort and Enjoyment of the preſent Life. The dear-bought Experience of the Licentious, ſhews, that <hi>Intemperance</hi> in its own Nature, hath a Tendency to break the firmeſt Conſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and is attended with a melacholly Train of Sorrows and Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>IF we conſider thoſe Vertues, which may be properly ſtiled Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi>—Humility, Patience, Self-denial, and Forgiveneſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; theſe Vertues alſo carry their own Reward with them, by eſtabliſhing the Mind in Tranquility and Peace: While Pride, Envy, Wrath, and Revenge, embitter the Spirits, corrode the Vitals, and devour every eaſy Thought.</p>
                  <p>I THINK then it is evident, beyond all Contradiction, that the Precepts of moral Vertue, with thoſe additional Improvements, which are made to them by the Goſpel of Chriſt, are to all Intents and purpoſes calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to advance the Honour, Intereſt Peace
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006530_0065_10292FEC0CF703F8"/>
and Pleaſure of Mankind; ſo that every one that is under the Government of his Reaſon, would chooſe to live in the Practice of them, upon the Principles of <hi>Self-love,</hi> altho' he had no other Motive.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, that theſe moral Vertues are truly excellent and lovely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo eſſential to the Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that all Pretences to it, in a Neglect of theſe, is a fatal Deluſion; and theſe vain Profeſſors, muſt expect no other Sentence from the Mouth of their ſupreme Judge than that, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT when theſe Vertues proceed <hi>only</hi> from the Principles of <hi>Self-love,</hi> they are eſſentially defective. The true Chriſtian,—the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Man, is animated with nobler Motives and Deſigns. <hi>Love</hi> to God, the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, and <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, the Saviour of Mankind, are the vital Springs of his Obedience to the Laws of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the meer moral Man is <hi>compaſſing himſelf about with Sparks of his own enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling,</hi> and ſatisfied with his own Goodneſs; the real Chriſtian has been made to ſee, that he has nothing that he can properly call his

own, but Pollution and Deformity; and nothing to expect from God, upon his own Account, but Deſtruction and Miſery. He is taught by the illuminating Influence of divine Grace, to renounce all Self-dependence, and wait at the Footſtool of a ſovereign GOD, for Deliverance from all the Wretchedneſs of the Apoſtacy. By this hie is prepared to receive the compaſſionate Offers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and thankfully to commit himſelf into the Hands of an Almighty Saviour: And when once he is perſwaded, <hi>by the Drawings of the Father, to come to Chriſt,</hi> as his living LORD and HEAD, to ſay in the Language of Appropriation, MY LORD, AND MY GOD then, and not till then, can he perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Obedience. For 'tis by Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the <hi>Life-giving</hi> JESUS, that we are enabled to do any Thing ſpiritually Good; and we remain his poor dependant Creatures to the End of Life.</p>
                  <p>How happy are the Effects that flow from an Union with him! The humble Soul finds Light, Life and Strength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to anſwer all his Wants; to triumph over all his Difficulties. Amidſt all the all Darkneſs, Troubles and Temptations of this tempeſtuous Region, he has a ſafe Retreat,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006530_0067_10292FF3364376D8"/>
an unfailing Defence. The Soul finds a Reſt in God, and taſtes <hi>that Peace, which paſſes all Underſtanding.</hi> He finds by happy Experience, that <hi>Wiſdom's Ways are Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all her Paths Peace.</hi> That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our bleſſed Saviour, is accompliſhed in his Behalf; <hi>He that loveth me, him will my Father honour.</hi> Theſe are not vain <hi>Amuſements,</hi> but ſubſtantial <hi>Realities</hi>; which lay a ſolid Foundation for preſent Comfort, and give undoubted Aſſurance of future Felicity. They <hi>behold the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Glaſs of the Goſpel</hi>; and by this Means, <hi>are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THESE diſtinguiſh'd Perſons will all ſet their Seal to the Truth of this Propoſition; that the Chriſtian Religion, is every way calculated to promote the Welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and when reduced to Practice, under the Influence of Faith and Love, is the only ſure Way to preſerve us from every, hurtful and deadly Evil; to obtain true Peace and Pleaſure upon Earth, and eternal Happineſs in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>JUSTLY does Doctor <hi>Leighton,</hi> in one of his Letters ſay;—<q>Thorns grow every
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:006530_0068_10292FF502F7AC90"/>
where, and from all Things here below; but to a Soul tranſplanted out of it ſelf into the Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> Peace grows every where too, from him who is our Peace; and whom we ſhall find to be the more ſo, the more entirely we live in him, by being dead to the World, to Fleſh and Self, and all Things beſides him.</q> O! when ſhall it be?</p>
                  <p>INEXPRESSIBLE is the Benefit of this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation: New Life begun, and ſuch a Life as is certainly progreſſive, even to Life eternal. For, altho' by the unerring Wiſdom of the great Head of the Church, <hi>the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites are yet left in the Land,</hi> for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Tryal of his faithful People; yet they are really and eſſentially, upon all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the only happy Perſons. I ſhall mention ſome few Inſtances, which will be evident to all ſuch as have, by ſupernatural Grace, been made Partakers of this thrice happy Change.</p>
                  <p>As they have been convinced of the Vanity of all Creature Enjoyments, ſo they have been lead by a divine Attraction, to God the, boundleſs OCEAN of all poſſible Good; and in him enjoy a compleat and independent Hapineſs. All the Comforts of this Life
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:006530_0069_10292FF81A7CF9B0"/>
come with a double Sweetneſs, as proceeding from their heavenly Father, and conveyed thro' the Channel of the new Covenant.—They have a ſacred Aſſurance that all Things are theirs, whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> or Things preſent, or Things to come;—<hi>All Things are yours,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>and ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OH! how inexpreſſibly great, are the Bleſſings contain'd in theſe few Lines. If the true Believer meets with bitter <hi>Afflictions</hi> of various Sorts, he is divinely taught to know how juſt and reaſonable it is, that he ſhould be <hi>made Partaker of the Fellowſhip of Chriſt's Sufferings.</hi>—If in Circumſtances of diſtreſſing <hi>Poverty</hi>; the remembers the Son of God <hi>had not where to lay his Head</hi>; and was obliged to work a Miracle to anſwer the Demands of the publick <hi>Tribute.</hi> — If the Billows of <hi>Adverſity</hi> riſe ſo high, that in the Extremity of Diſtreſ, he is ready to ſay, <hi>the Waters are come into my Soul; I ſink deep in the Mire, where there is no ſtanding</hi>; then he is enabled <hi>to look to the Rock, that is higher than he:</hi> And by Faith goes into the Garden, where our bleſſed Saviour was in ſuch an <hi>Agony, that he ſweat great Drops of Blood, and ſaid, My
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:006530_0070_10292FFC9DDFFAD0"/>
Soul is ſorrowful even unto Death.</hi>—If at any Time, he meets with <hi>reproachful</hi> Treatment from thoſe whom he has laid under the higheſt Obligations; he takes a Turn in his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with Jeſus Chriſt, to the <hi>Judgment-Hall,</hi> where he was abuſed, not only by the worſt of Men, but forſaken of his own peculiar Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples: From thence he aſcends the Mount of <hi>Calvary,</hi> where this divine Perſon ſuffered a cruel Death, and which was worſe than all, endured the Hidings of his Father's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>HATH the Lord Jeſus Chriſt done and ſuffered all this for me! and ſhall I think much to ſuffer and Affliction, that he ſhall ſee meet to lay upon me!—"No ſurely!" will be the Language of every humble Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Let me rather <hi>rejoice in Tribulation</hi> or Weakneſs, that the Strength and Grace of Chriſt may be manifeſted in me.</p>
                  <p>How happy a Cure is an Intereſt in Chriſt, for all thoſe malignant Paſſions, which are ſo Deſtrutive to the Peace and Purity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature! Whence do theſe Diſorders ariſe, but from the Miſapplication of the Paſſions and Affections, thoſe powerful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of the Soul, which are polluted and depraved by Sin. But no ſooner are we united to Chriſt, but our Nature is changed;—the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:006530_0071_10292FFE205B8608"/>
Conſtitution of the Soul is altered;—Life is began;—Holineſs is our Element;—and Sin the Averſion of the renewed Mind.</p>
                  <p>Now he underſtands that ſeeming Paradox, when St. <hi>John</hi> ſays in one Place, <hi>He that is born of God cannot ſin</hi>; and again in the ſame Chapter; <hi>If we ſay, we have no Sin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> The regenerate Soul cannot ſin, with Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; it croſſes the Grain of the new Nature: And yet he cannot ſay, he hath no Sin; for he feels the Remains of Corruption, which makes him often complain with St. <hi>Paul: O! wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this Body, of Sin and Death!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Deſire of the Mind, no longer wander after a Variety of Vanities and Follies, but are fix'd upon God, the only Centre of Reſt,—the only adequate Portion of an imnmortal Soul. In Conſeqence of this, that impetuous Thirſt after Happineſs, which is implanted in the Breaſts of all Men, is rectified: So that while the natural Man, is always ſeeking the Living among the Dead, and enquring, <hi>who will ſhew me any</hi> worldly <hi>Good</hi>;— the Heaven-born Spirit, cries out, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon me, ſo will I rejoice more than when Corn and Wine are increaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:006530_0072_10293000EFE39520"/>THAT which Bread is to the Hungry, Water to the Thirſty, Reſt to the Weary, <hi>that,</hi> and infinitely more, art thou, O my God! to my Soul. Thou art my Strength in Weakneſs, — my Light in Darkneſs, — my beſt Friend in the Abſence of all others,—my beſt Company in the cloſeſt Solitude,—my ſatisfying Portion in all Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Even Death it ſelf, cannot deprive the true Believer of his Happineſs; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes it. While in the World, Grief and Sorrow, which in the carnal Mind, often work Death, in the ſpiritual Man, produce Life and Peace. He finds more true Comfort, in mourning for Sin, than in all the carnal Pleaſures which the World can give.</p>
                  <p>UPON the whole then, I think it evidently true, that the Chriſtian is the only happy Perſon in this World; and as to the Future, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath nor heard, nor hath it entered into the Heart of Man, to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> And as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Advantages of Religion, are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly great here and hereafter; ſo the Madneſs and Miſery of Irreligion, are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly dreadful, both in this World and the Next.</p>

Are not theſe certain Indications, of a divine Birth,—a new Creation; which could not be produced by any other Hand than that which at firſt created all Things. And I deſire to depend upon the ſame Almighty Power, to finiſh that Work which thou haſt begun. And as I received all from thee, ſo I owe all to thee, and deſire to dedicate all to thee, renouncing all Dependance upon myſelf, truſting entirely to the Strength and Grace of the Redeemer. I deſire more conſtantly and uninterruptedly, to lift up my Soul to thee, by conſtant ejaculatory Aſpirations; and to commit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thee, as <hi>Wax</hi> to the <hi>Seal,</hi> that thou wouldeſt form me into thy own Reſemblance, and fit me for the Service and Enjoyment of thy Self: As I deſire to depend upon thee for Strength, ſo I deſire to truſt only in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for Juſtification.</p>

                     <p>I DESIRE, O my God! to acknowledge with the higheſt Thankfulneſs and Gratitude, thy unparalell'd and condeſcending Grace, to ſinful and rebellious Mankind. That when by Sin, he had affronted the infinite Majeſty of Heaven, and cauſed thee to withdraw thy favourable Preſence from him; yet that thou who art the KING OF KINGS, ſhould contrive to reſtore the human Race again to thy Favour, and art inviting us to the moſt intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with thy ſelf: Knocking at the Door of our Hearts; demanding Admittance,

                     <p>THE Terms of our entertaining ſo divine a Gueſt, are the moſt advantageous, that can be imagined.

                     <p>AND if the Conditions are ſo advantageous, What is the Bleſſing it ſelf!—Here, O my Soul! I am loſt in a Croud of Thoughts; I have no Words adequate to my Conceptions, and my Conceptions fall infinitely ſhort, of the Excellency of the Subject they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about. If I conſider the wide Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Sin hath brought upon our Frame, which from a beautiful Habitation of the moſt High, is turned into a Receptacle of every baſe and unclean Luſt: How juſtly may <hi>my Head be Waters,</hi> and my Eyes Fountains of Tears, to weep for the affecting Alteration!

Horro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes hold of me, becauſe of the Wicked, that forſake thy Law.</hi> As to my ſelf, upon the ſricteſt Search, I think I can ſay, that the Remains of Sin in me, are the greateſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den I feel, and the only Thing that makes Life bitter to me. If the Abſence of the glorious God be ſo dreadful, how inconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably reviving muſt be the Return of this bleſſed Inhabitant!</p>
                     <p>To approach unto thee, O my God! is all my Happineſs, in the Preſent and future World: May I therefore never admit, any Thing into my Heart and Memory, that ſhall be affronting to thy bleſſed Spirit! May I always endeavour by every Means, <hi>to lift up the Doors of my Soul,</hi> and invite the Preſence of this ſacred Gueſt. It is thy Demand, <hi>Son give me thy Heart:</hi> Give me Power, I beſeech thee, unfeignedly to obey thy Voice. Favour me with thy unerring Guidance, to lead me in that Way, which is for the Glory, of thy Name, and the Salvation of my Soul; for my dear Redeemer's Sake: To whom, with the Father, and Holy Spirit, be aſcribed all Honour and Glory Dominion and Power, <hi>Amen.</hi>
