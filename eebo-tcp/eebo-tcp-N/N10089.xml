            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AS you allow me the honour of your correſpondence, I may not omit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you with ſo remarkable an event as the withdraw of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the cuſtoms and moſt of the other officers under them from the town on board the Romney, with an intent to remote from thence to the caſtle.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the 10th a ſloop belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. Hancock, a repreſentative for Boſton, and a wealthy merchant, of great influence over the populace, was ſeized by the collector and comptroller for a very notorious breach of the acts of trade, and, after ſeizure, taken into cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the officer of the Romney man of war, and remov'd under command of her guns. It is pretended that the removal and not the ſeizure
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012818_0003_0F90908997DAA4C8"/>
incenſed the people. It ſeems not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial which it was—A mob was immediately rais'd, the officers inſulted, bruis'd and much hurt, and the windows of ſome of their houſes broke; a boat belonging to the collector burnt in triumph, and many threats utter'd againſt the commiſſioners and their officers: no notice being taken of their extravagance in the time of it, nor any endeavours by any authority except the governor, the next day to diſcover and puniſh the offenders; and there being a rumour of a higher mob intended monday (the 13th) in the evening the commiſſioners, <hi>four of them,</hi> thought themſelves altogether unſafe, being deſtitute of protection, and remov'd with their families to the Romney, and there remain and hold their board, and next week intend to do the ſame, and alſo open the cuſtom-houſe at the caſtle. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor preſs'd the council to aſſiſt him with their advice, but they declin'd and evaded calling it a bruſh or ſmall diſturbance by boys and negroes, not conſidering <hi>how much it muſt be reſented in England</hi> that the officers of the crown ſhould think themſelves obliged to quit the place of their residence and go on board a King's ſhip for ſafety, and all the internal authority of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince take no notice, of it—The town of Boſton have had repeated meetings, and by their votes declared the commiſſioners and their officers a great grievance, and yeſterday inſtructed their repreſentatives to endeavor that enquiry ſhould be made by the aſſembly whether any perſon by writing or in any other way had encouraged the ſending troops here, there being ſome alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reports that troops are expected, but have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012818_0004_0F90915AC04B9B78"/>
not taken any meaſures to diſcountenance the promoters of the late proceedings; but on the contrary appointed one or more of the actors or abettors on a committee appointed to wait on the governor, and to deſire him to order the man of war out of the harbour.</p>
               <p>Ignorant as they be, yet the heads of a Boſton town-meeting influences all publick meaſures.</p>
               <p>It is not poſſible this anarchy ſhould laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Mr. Hallowell who will be the bearer of this tells me he has the honour of being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally known to you. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more full account.</p>

               <p>IT is very neceſſary other information ſhould be had in England of the preſent ſtate of the commiſſioners of the cuſtoms than what common fame will bring to you or what you will receive from moſt of the letters which go from hence, people in general being prejudiced by many falſe reports and miſrepreſentations concerning them. Seven eighths of the people of the country ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the board itſelf to be unconſtitutional and cannot be undeceived and brought to believe that a board has exiſted in England all this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and that the board eſtabliſhed here has no
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012818_0005_0F90915BA8262320"/>
new powers given to it. Our incendiaries know it but they induſtriouſly and very wickedly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the contrary. As much pains has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in prejudice the country againſt the perſons of the commiſſioners and their characters have been miſrepreſented and cruelly treated eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince their confinement at the caſtle where they are not ſo likely to hear what is ſaid of them and are not ſo able to confute it.</p>
               <p>It is now pretended they need not to have withdrawn, that Mr. Williams had ſtood his ground without any injury although the mob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet his houſe, &amp;c. There never was that ſpirit raiſed againſt the under officers as againſt the commiſſioners, <hi>I mean four of them.</hi> They had a public affront offered them, by the town of Boſton who refuſed to give the uſe of their hall for a public dinner unleſs it was ſtipulated that the commiſſioners ſhould not be invited. An affront of the ſame nature at the motion of Mr. Hancock was offered by a company of cadets. Soon after a veſſel of Mr. Hancock's being ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the officers were mobb'd and the commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were informed they were threatned. I own I was in pain for them. I do not believe if the mob had ſeized them, there was any authority able and willing to have reſcued them. After they had withdrawn the town ſignified to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor by a meſſage that it was expected or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they ſhould not returp. It was then the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral voice that it would not be ſafe for them to return. After all this the ſons of liberty ſay they deſerted or abdicated.</p>
               <p>The other officers of the cuſtoms in general either did not leave the town or ſoon returned to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012818_0006_0F90915D33006968"/>
it. Some of them ſeem to be diſcontented with the commiſſioners. Great pains have been taken to increaſe the diſcontent. Their office by theſe means is rendered extremely burdenſome. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they do is found fault with, and yet no particular illegality or even irregularity men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. There is too much hauteur ſome of their officers ſay in the treatment they receive. They ſay they treat their officers as the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners treat their officers in England and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no greater deference. After all it is not the perſons but the office of the commiſſioners which has raiſed this ſpirit, and the diſtinction made between the commiſſioners is becauſe it has been given out that four of them were in favor of the new eſtabliſhment and the <hi>fifth was not.</hi> If Mr. Hallowell arrived ſafe he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you many circumſtances relative to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction which I very willingly excuſe myſelf from mentioning.</p>
               <p>I know of no burden brought upon the fair trader by the new eſtabliſhment. The illicit trader finds the riſque greater than it uſed to be, eſpecially in the port where the board is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly held. Another circumſtance which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the prejudice is this; the new duties hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to take place juſt about the time the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners arrived. People have abſurdly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected the duties and board of commiſſioners, and ſuppoſe we ſhould have had no additional duties if there had been no board to have the charge of collecting them. With all the aid you can give to the officers of the crown they will have enough to do to maintain the authority of government and to carry the laws into execution.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012818_0007_0F90915DC5541AF0"/>
If they are diſcountenanced, neglected or fail of ſupport from you, they muſt ſubmit to every thing the preſent oppoſers of government think fit to require of them.</p>
               <p>There is no office under greater diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than that of the commiſſioners. Some of my friends recommended me to the miniſtry. I think myſelf very happy that I am not one. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would have been incompatible with my poſt as chief juſtice, and I muſt have declined it, and I ſhould do it although no greater ſalary had been affixed to the chief juſtices place than the ſmall pittance allowed by the province.</p>
               <p>From my acquaintance with the commiſſioners I have received a perſonal eſteem for them, but my chief inducement to make this repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you is a regard to the public intereſt which I am ſure will ſuffer if the oppoſition carry their point againſt them.</p>

               <p>I WAS abſent upon one of our circuits when Mr. Byles arrived. Since my return I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him your obliging letter of 31ſt July.

It is not ſtrange that meaſures ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taken to reduce the colonies to their former ſtate of government and order, but that the national funds ſhould be affected by it is to me a little myſterious and ſurprizing. Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of government abſurd enough ſpread thro' all the colonies; but I cannot think that in any colony, people of any conſideration have ever been ſo mad as to think of a revolt. Many of the common people have been in a frenzy, and talk'd of dying in defence of their liberties, and have ſpoke and printed what is highly criminal, and too many of rank above the vulgar, and ſome <hi>in public poſts</hi> have countenanced and encouraged them untill they increaſed ſo much in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and in their opinion of their importance as to ſubmit to government no further than they thought proper. The legiſlative powers have been influenced by them, and the executive powers intirely loſt their force. There has been continual danger of mobs and inſurrections, but they would have ſpent all their force within ourſelves, the officers of the Crown and ſome of the few friends who dared to ſtand by them poſſibly might have been knock'd in the head, and ſome ſuch fatal event would probably have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012818_0009_0F90915F56785D78"/>
brought the people to their ſenſes. For four or five weeks paſt the diſtemper has been growing, and I confeſs I have not been without ſome apprehenſions for myſelf, but my friends have had more for me, and I have had repeated and frequent notices from them from different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>one of the laſt I will incloſe to you.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See the following Letter.</note> In this ſtate of things there was no ſecurity but quitting my poſts, which nothing but the laſt extremity would juſtify. As chief juſtice for two years after our firſt diſorders I kept the grand juries tollerably well to their duty. The laſt ſpring there had been ſeveral riots, and a moſt infamous libel had been publiſhed in one of the papers, which I enlarged upon, and the grand jury had determined to make preſentments, but the attorney-general not attending them the firſt day, Otis and his creatures who were alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and frightned exerted themſelves the next day and prevailed upon ſo many of the jury to change their voices, that there was not a ſufficient number left to find a bill. They have been ever ſince more enraged againſt me than ever. At the deſire of the governor I committed to writing the charge while it lay in my memory, and as I have no further uſe for it I will incloſe it as it may give you ſome idea of our judicatories.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were in this ſtate, news came of two regiments being ordered from Halifax, and ſoon after two more from Ireland. The minds of people were more and more agitated, broad hints were given that the troops ſhould never land, a barrel of tar was placed upon the bacon, in the night to be fired to bring in the country when the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012818_0010_0F90915FF98D69E8"/>
troops appeared, and all the authority of the government was not ſtrong enough to remove it. The town of Boſton met and paſſed a number of weak but very criminal votes; and as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor declined calling an aſſembly they ſent circular letters to all the towns and diſtricts to ſend a perſon each that there might be a general conſultation at ſo extraordinary a criſis. They met and ſpent a week, made themſelves ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and then diſſolv'd themſelves. after a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage or two to the governor which he refuſed to receive; a petition to the King which I dare ſay <hi>their agent</hi> will never be allow'd to preſent, and a reſult which they have publiſhed ill-natured and impotent.</p>
               <p>In this confuſion the troops from Halifax ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. I never was much afraid of the people's taking arms, but I was apprehenſive of violence from the mob, it being their laſt chance before the troops could land. As the proſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge became more certain their courage abated in proportion. Two regiments are landed, but a new grievance is now rais'd. The troops are by act of parliament to be quartered no where elſe but in the barracks untill they are full. There are barracks enough at the caſtle to hold both regiments. It is therefore againſt the act to bring any of them into town. This was ſtarted by the council in their anſwer to the governor, which to make themſelves popular, they in an unprecedented way publiſhed and have alarmed all the province; for although none but the moſt contracted minds could put ſuch a conſtruction upon the act, yet after this declaration of the council nine tenths of the people ſuppoſe it juſt.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012818_0011_0F90916344396BC0"/>
I wiſh the act had been better expreſs'd, but it is abſurd to ſuppoſe the parliament intended to take from the King the direction of his forces by confining them to a place where any of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies might think fit to build, barracks. It is beſides ungrateful, for it is known many that this proviſion was brought into the bill after it had been framed without it, from meer favor to the colonies. I hear the commander in chief has provided barracks or quarters, but a doubt ſtill remains with ſome of the council, whether they are to furniſh the articles required, unleſs the men are in the province barracks, and they are to determine upon it to day.</p>
               <p>The government has been ſo long in the hands of the populace that it muſt come out of them by degrees, at leaſt it will be a work of time to bring the people back to juſt notions of the nature of government.</p>

               <p>THE great eſteem I have for you in every point of light, perhaps renders my fears and doubts for the ſafety of your perſon greater than they ought to be; however if that is an error, it certainly reſults from true friendſhip, naturally jealous. Laſt night I was informed by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my acquaintance, who had his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from one intimate with and knowing to the infernal purpoſes of the ſons of liberty as they falſely ſtile themſelves, that he verily believ'd, from the terrible threats and menaces by thoſe catalines againſt you, that your life is greatly in danger. This informant I know is under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to you and is a man of veracity. He expreſs'd himſelf with concern for you, and the gentleman acquainting me with this horrid cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, aſſured me he was very uneaſy till you had notice. I ſhould have done myſelf the honor of waiting on you but am neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The duty I owed to you as a friend and to the public as a member of ſociety, would not ſuffer me to reſt till I had put your honor upon your guard; for tho' this may be a falſe alarm, nothing would have given me greater pain, if any accident had happen'd, and I had been ſilent. If poſſible I will ſee you to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and let you know further into this black affair.</p>

               <p>I AM juſt now informed that a number of the council, perhaps 8 or 10, who live in and bear this town, have met together and agreed upon a long addreſſ or petition to parliament, and that it will be ſent by this ſhip to Mr. Bollan to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Mr. Danforth who is preſident of the council told the governor upon enquiry, that it was ſent to him to ſign, and he ſuppoſed the reſt of the council who had met together would ſign after him in order, but he hath ſince found that they had wrote over hiſ name <hi>by order of council,</hi> which makes it appear to be an act of council. This may be a low piece of cunnihg in him, but be it as it may, it's proper it ſhould be known that the whole is no more than the doings of a part of the council only, although even that is not very material, ſince, if they had all been preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the governor's ſummons the meeting would have been irregular and unconſtitutional, and ought to be diſcountenanced and cenſured. I ſuppose there is no inſtance of the privy council's meeting and doing buſiness without the king's preſence or ſpecial direction, except in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees upon ſuch buſineſs as by his majeſty's order has been reſerv'd to them by an act of council, and I have known no inſtance here without the governor until within three or four months paſt.</p>
               <p>I thought it very neceſſary the circumſtances of this proceeding ſhould be known, tho' if there be no neceſſity for it. I think it would be beſt it ſhould not be known that the intelligence comes from me.</p>

               <p>YOU have laid me under very great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the very clear and full account of proceedings in parliament, which I received from you by Capt. Scott. You have alſo done much ſervice to the people of the province. For a day or two after the ſhip arrived, the enemies of government gave out that their friends in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were increaſing, and all things would be ſoon on the old footing; in other words that all acts impoſing duties would be repealed, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners board diſſolved, the cuſtoms put on the old footing, and <hi>illicit</hi> trade be carried on with little of no hazard. It was very fortunate that I had it in my power to prevent ſuch a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation from ſpreading through the province. I have been very cautious of uſing your name, but I have been very free in publiſhing abroad the ſubſtance of your letter, and declaring that I had my intelligence from the beſt authority, and have in a great meaſure defeated the ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in raiſing and attempting to ſpread ſo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a report. What marks of reſentment the parliament will ſhow, whether they will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the province in general or particular perſons, is extremely uncertain, but that they will be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſomewhere is moſt certain, and I add, becauſe <hi>I think it ought to be ſo,</hi> that thoſe who have been moſt ſteady in preſerving the conſtitution and oppoſing the licentiouſneſs of ſuch as call themſelves ſons of liberty will certainly meet with favor and encouragement.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012818_0015_0F9091679C01CCC0"/>This is moſt certainly a criſis. I really wiſh that there may not have been the leaſt degree of ſeverity beyond what is abſolutely neceſſary to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

               <p>The laſt veſſel from London had a quick paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. We expect to be in ſuſpense for the three or four next weeks and then to hear our fate. I never think of the meaſures neceſſary for the peace and good order of the colonies without pain. There muſt be an abridgment of what are called Engliſh liberties. I relieve myſelf by conſidering that in a remove from the ſtate of nature to the moſt perfect ſtate of government there muſt be a great reſtraint of natural liberty. I doubt whether it is poſſible to project a ſyſtem of government in which a colony 3000 miles diſtant from the parent ſtate ſhall enjoy all the liberty of the parent ſtate. I am certain I have never yet ſeen the projection. I wiſh the good of the colony when I wiſh to see ſome further reſtraint of liberty rather than the connexion with the parent ſtate ſhould be broken; for I am ſure ſuch a breach muſt prove the ruin of the colony. Pardon me this excurſion, it really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſtate of mind into which our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed affairs often throws me.</p>

               <p>I am very ſorry that the colonies give you ſo much employment, and it is impoſſible to ſay how long it will be before things ſettle into quiet among us. We have ſome here who have been ſo buſy in ſomething the late diſturbances, that may now think it needful for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to keep up the ſpirit. They have plumed themſelves much upon the victory they have gamed, and the ſpport they have ſince met with; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> celebrated the 14th of that month, as the firſt anniverſary commemoration of what they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012818_0018_0F909169BA2C49C8"/>
had done at the tree of liberty on that day the year before. Here a number of reſpectable gentlemen as they inform us now met, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other toaſts drank general Paoli, and the ſpark of liberty kindled in Spain, I am now ſpeaking of a few individuals only, the body of the people are well diſpoſed, yet when you come to ſee the journal of the houſe of repreſentatives the laſt ſeſſion, I fear you will think that the ſame ſpirit has ſeized our public counſels. I can however fairly ſay thus much in behalf of the government, that the laſt houſe was packed by means of a public proſcription juſt before the election, of the greateſt part of thoſe who had appeared in the preceding ſeſſion in the ſupport of government: their names were publiſhed in an inflammatory news-paper, and their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made to believe they were about to ſell them for ſlaves. Writs are now out for a new aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but I cannot anſwer for the choice: I hope however that the people in general are in a better temper; yet the moderate men have been ſo browbeaten in the houſe, and found themſelves ſo inſignificant there the laſt year, that ſome of them will voluntarily decline coming again. I think this looks too much like a deſpair of the common-wealth, and cannot be juſtified on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic principles.</p>
               <p>The election of counſellors was carried the laſt year as might have been expected from ſuch an houſe. The officers of the crown and the judges of the ſuperior court were excluded. And I hear that it is the deſign of ſome who expect to be returned members of the houſe this year to make ſure work at the enſuing election of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,

by excluding, if they can, the gentlemen of the council (who by charter remain ſuch 'till others are choſen in their room) from any ſhare in the choice, tho' they have always had their voice in it hitherto from the firſt arrival of the charter. If the houſe do this, they will have it in their power to model the council as they pleaſe, and throw all the powers of government into the hands of the people, unleſs the governor ſhould again exert his negative as he did the laſt year.</p>
               <p>You have doubtleſs ſeen ſome of the curious meſſages from the late houſe to the governor, and can't but have obſerved with how little decency they have attacked both the governor and the lieutenant governor. They have alſo in effect forced the council to declare themſelves parties in the quarrel they had againſt the latter in a matter of mere indifference. In their meſſage to the governor of the 31ſt of January they have explicitly charged the lieutenant governor (a gentleman to whom they are more indebted than to any one man in the government) with "ambition and luſt of power", merely for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a compliment to the governor agreeable to ancient uſage, by attending him to court and being preſent in the council chamber when he made his ſpeech at the opening of the ſeſſion, at which time they go on to ſay, "none but the general court and their ſervants are intended to be preſent", ſtill holding out to the people the ſervants, of the crown as objects of inſignificance, ranking the ſecretary with their door-keeper, as ſervants of the aſſembly; for the ſecretary with his clerks and the door-keeper are the only
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012818_0020_0F90916E689A0EE8"/>
perſons preſent with the aſſembly on theſe occaſions.</p>
               <p>The officers of the crown being thus leſſen'd in the eyes of the people, takes off their weight and influence, and the balance will of courſe turn in favor of the people, and what makes them ſtill more inſignificant is their dependance on the people for a neceſſary ſupport: If ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were left to the goodwill of the people, yet nature ſhould be ſure of a ſupport. The governor's ſalary has for about 35 years paſt been pretty well underſtood to be a thouſand pound a year ſterling. When this ſum was firſt agreed to, it was very well; but an increaſe of wealth ſince hat brought along with it an increaſe of luxury, ſo that what was ſufficient to keep up a proper diſtinction and ſupport the dignity of a governor then, may well be ſuppoſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for the purpoſe now. The lieutenant governor has no appointments as ſuch: the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taincy of Caſtle-William which may be worth £. 120 ſterling a year is looked upon indeed as an appendage to his commiſſion, and the late lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant governor enjoyed no other appointment: he lived a retired life upon his own eſtate in the country, and was eaſy. The preſent lieutenant governor indeed has other appointments, but the people are quarrelling with him for it, and will not ſuffer him to be eaſy unleſs he will retire alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecretary may have ſomething <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

have had no more than £.250 ſterling per annum in fees, perquiſites and ſalary altogether, which is not the one half of his annual expence.</p>
               <p>The crown did by charter reſerve to itſelf the appointment of a governor, lieutenant governor and ſecretary on the deſign of this was without doubt to maintain ſome kind of balance between the powers of the crown and of the people; but if officers are not in ſome meaſure independent of the people (for it is difficult to ſerve two maſters) they will ſometimes have a hard ſtruggle between duty to the crown and a regard to ſelf, which muſt be a very diſagreeable ſituation to them, as well as a weakening to the authority of government. The officers of the crown are very few, and are therefore the more eaſily provided for without burdening the people: <hi>and ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion I look upon as neceſſary to the reſtoration and ſupport of the King's authority.</hi>

               <p>I AM this moment favored with your very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging letter by Capt. Jarvis of the 2d March, which I have but juſt time to acknowledge, as this is the day given out for the ſhip to ſail. I wrote you the end of February in reply to your letter of the 28th December, that of the 12th February which you refer to in this of the 2d of March is not yet come to hand. You lay me, ſir, under the greateſt obligations as well for the intereſting account of public affairs which you are from time to time pleaſed to tranſmit me; as for your ſteady attention to my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> concerns. I ſhall always have the moſt grateful ſenſe of Mr. Grenville's intentions of favor alſo, whether I ever reap any benefit from them or nor. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a proper ſupport afforded to the king's officers,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012818_0024_0F909171FA3473A0"/>
the reſpect due to government will of courſe fail; yet I cannot ſay whether under the preſent circumſtances, and conſidering the temper the people are now in, an additional proviſion for me would be of real benefit to me perſonally or not. It has been given out that no perſon who receives a ſtipend from the government at home, ſhall live in the country. Government here wants ſome <hi>effectual</hi> ſupport: No ſooner was it known that the lieut. governor had a proviſion of £.200 a year made for him out of the revenue, than he was adviſed in the Boſton Gazette to reſign all pretenſions to a ſeat in council, either with or without a voice. The temper of the people may be ſurely learnt from that infamous paper; it is the very thing that forms their temper; for it they are not in the temper of the writer at the time of the publication, yet it is looked upon as the ORACLE, and they ſoon bring their temper to it. Some of the lateſt of them are very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, I will not trouble you with ſending them, as I imagine they ſomehow or other find their way to you: But I cannot but apprehend from theſe papers and from hints that are thrown out, that if the petition of the Houſe to his Majeſty and their letters to divers noble Lords ſhould fail of ſucceſs, ſome people will be mad enough to go to extremities. The commiſſioners of the cuſtoms have already been openly affronted, the governor's company of Cadets have come to a reſolution not to wait on him (as uſual) on the day of General Election the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> inſtant if thoſe gentlemen are of the company. And the Town of Boſton have paſſed a Vote that Faneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il-Hall (in which the governor and his company
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012818_0025_0F909172C4496598"/>
uſually dine on that day) ſhall not be opened to him if the commiſſioners are invited to dine with him. A liſt of counſellors has within a few days paſt been printed and diſperſed by way of ſneer on Lord Shelburne's letter, made up of king's officers; which liſt, the writer ſays, if adopted at the next general election may take away all grounds of complaint, and may poſſibly prove a healing and very ſalutarv meaſure. The lieutenant governor is at the head of this liſt, they have done me the honor to put me next, the commiſſioners of the cuſtoms are all in the liſt except <hi>Mr. Temple,</hi> and to compleat the liſt, they have added ſome of the waiters. I never thought 'till very lately that they acted upon any <hi>ſettled plan,</hi> nor do I now think they have 'till of late; a few, a very few, among us have planned the preſent meaſures, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been too weak to ſubdue their turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirits. Our ſituation is not rightly known; but it is a matter worthy of the moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

               <p>I HAVE your very obliging favor of the 4th of October. I find myſelf conſtrained as well by this letter as by my ſon and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spooner's letters ſince, to render you my moſt ſincere thanks for the very polite notice you have taken of them; and I pray my moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful compliments to the good lady your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe friendly reception of them at Non-ſuch has, I find engaged their warmeſt eſteem and reſpect—He hath wrote us that he had a proſpect of ſucceeding in the buſineſs he went upon; but the laſt letter we had was from her of the 23d of November, acquainting us that he had been very ill, but was getting better. She writes as a perſon overcome with a ſenſe of the kindneſs they had met with, in a place where they were ſtrangers, on this trying occaſion.</p>
               <p>You have heard of the arrival of the King's troops, the quiet reception they met with among us was not at all ſurprizing to me.—I am ſorry there was any occaſion for ſending them. From the addreſs of the Gentlemen of the Council to General Gage, it might be ſuppoſed there was none. I have ſeen a letter from our friend In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſoll with this paraphraſe upon it—"We hope that your Excellency obſerving with your own eyes <hi>now</hi> the troops are among us our peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet behavior, will be convinced that that wicked G— r B—d told a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in ſaying, We were not ſo before they came."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012818_0027_0F909176D25E6098"/>I have given you the ſenſe of a ſtranger on a ſingle paragraph of this addreſs, becauſe I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected my own opinion of it, 'till I found it thus confirm'd—If you have the news-papers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the addreſs, your own good ſenſe will lead you to make ſome other remarks upon it, as well as to trace the influence under which it ſeems to have been penned. The diſturbers of our peace take great advantage of ſuch aids from people in office and power—The lieutenant governor has communicated to me your letter containing an account of the debates in parliament on the firſt day of the ſeſſion: We ſoon expect their deciſion on American affairs, ſome I doubt not with fear and trembling—Yet I have very lately had occaſion to know, that be the determination of parliament what it will, it is the determination of ſome to agree to no terms that ſhall remove us from our old foundation. This confirms me in an opinion that I have taken up a long time ſince, that if there be no way to take off the original incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, they will continue to inſtill their poiſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of the people through the vehicle of the BOSTON GAZETTE.</p>
               <p>In your letter to the lieutenant governor you obſerve upon two defects in our conſtitution, the popular election of the Council, and the return of Juries by the Towns. The firſt of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from the Charter itſelf; the latter from our provincial Laws. The method of appointing our Grand Juries lies open to management. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſes, nominates them at our town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; by this means one who was ſuppos'd to be a principal in the Riots of the 10th of June laſt, was upon that Jury whoſe buſineſs it was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012818_0028_0F9091782894E2B0"/>
into them: But the provincial legiſlature hath made ſufficient proviſion for the return of Petit Juries by their act of 23d Geo. 2d, which requires the ſeveral towns to take liſts of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons liable by law to ſerve, and forming them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two claſſes, put their names written on ſeparate papers into two different boxes, one for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior court and the other for the inferior: And when veniries are iſſued, the number therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired are to be drawn out in open town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no perſon to ſerve oftner than once in three years—The method of appointing Grand Juries appears indeed defective; but if the other is not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be imputed to the times rather than to the defect of the laws—that neither the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries nor the Petit Juries have of late anſwered the expectations of government.</p>
               <p>As to the appointment of the council, I am of opinion that neither the popular elections in this province, nor their appointment in what are called the royal governments by the King's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus, are free from exceptions, eſpecially if the council as a legiſlative body is intended to anſwer the idea of the houſe of lords in the Britiſh le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. There they are ſuppos'd to be a free and independent body, and on their being ſuch the ſtrength and firmneſs of the conſtitution does very much depend: whereas the election or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the councils in the manner before mentioned renders them altogether dependent on their conſtituents. The King is the fountain of honour, and as ſuch the peers of the realm derive their honours from him; but then they hold them by a ſurer tenure than the provincial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors who are appointed by mandamus. On
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012818_0029_0F909178CF294190"/>
the other hand, our popular elections very often expoſe them to contempt; for nothing is more common, than for the repreſentatives, when they find the council a little untractable at the cloſe of the year, to remind them that May is at hand.</p>
               <p>It may be accounted by the colonies as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to admit of any alterations in their charters, as it is by the governors in the church to make any in the eſtabliſhment; yet to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance as near as may be to the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſome alteration is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It is not requiſite that I know of, that a counſellor ſhou'd be a freeholder; his reſidence according to the charter is a ſufficient qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that provides only, that he be an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of or proprietor of lands within the diſtrict for which he is choſen: whereas the peers of the realm ſit in the houſe of lords, as I take it, in virtue of their baronies. If there ſhould be a reform of any of the colony charters with a view to keep up the reſemblance of the three eſtates in England, the legiſlative council ſhou'd conſiſt of men of landed eſtates; but as our landed eſtates here are ſmall at preſent, the yearly value of £. 100 ſterling per annum might in ſome of them at leaſt be a ſufficient qualification. As our eſtates are partable after the deceaſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, the honour could not be continued in families as in England: It might however be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the appointee <hi>quam diu bene ſe geſſerit,</hi> and proof be required of ſome mal-practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſuſpenſion or removal. Bankruptcy alſo might be another ground for removal. A ſmall legiſlative council might anſwer the purpoſes of government; but it might tend to weaken that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012818_0030_0F9091799B70A0B0"/>
levelling principle, which is cheriſh'd by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent popular conſtitution, to have an honorary order eſtabliſh'd, out of which the council ſhou'd be appointed. There is no way now to put a man of fortune above the common level, and exempt him from being choſen by the people into the lower offices, but his being appointed a juſtice of the peace; this is frequently done when there is no kind of expectation of his undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truſt, and has its inconveniences. For remedy hereof it might be expedient to have an order of Patricians or Eſquires inſtituted, to be all men of fortune or good landed eſtates, and appointed by the governor with the advice of council, and enroll'd in the ſecretary's office, who ſhou'd be exempted from the lower offices in government as the juſtices now are; and to have the legiſlative council (<hi>which in the firſt inſtance might be nominated by the Crown</hi>) from time to time fill'd up, as vacancies happen out of this order of men, who, if the order conſiſted only of men of landed eſtates, might elect, as the Scottiſh peers do, only reſerving to the King's governor a negative on ſuch choice. The King in this caſe wou'd be ſtill acknowledged as the fountain of honour, as having in the firſt inſtance the appointment of the perſons enroll'd, out of whom the council are to be choſen, and finally having a negative on the choice. Or, the King might have the immediate appointment by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus as at preſent in the royal governments. As the gentlemen of the council would rank above the body from which they are taken, they might bear a title one degree above that of eſquire. Beſides this legiſlative council, a privy council
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012818_0031_0F90917A713A7290"/>
might be eſtabliſh'd, to conſiſt of ſome or all of thoſe perſons who conſtitute the legiſlative coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and of other perſons members of the houſe of repreſentatives or otherwiſe of note or diſtinction; which wou'd extend the honours of government, and afford opportunity of diſtinguiſhing men of character and reputation, the expectation of which wou'd make government more reſpectable.</p>
               <p>I wou'd not trouble you with theſe reveries of mine, were I not aſſured of your readineſs to forgive the communication, although you could apply it to no good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spooner ſent me a pamphlet under a blank cover, intituled, "<hi>the ſtate of the nation</hi>". I run over it by myſelf before I had heard any one mention it, and tho't I cou'd evidently mark the ſentiments of ſome of my friends. By what I have ſince heard and ſeen, it looks as if I was not miſtaken. Your right honorable friend I truſt will not be offended if I call him mine— I am ſure you will not when I term you ſuch— I have ſettled it for a long time in my own mind that without a repreſentation in the ſupreme le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, there cannot be that union between the head and the members as to produce a healthful conſtitution of the whole body. I have doubted whether this union could be perfected by the firſt experiment. The plan here exhibited ſeems to be formed in generous and moderate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and bids the faireſt of any I have yet ſeen to be adopted.

               <p>I HAVE been in this city for ſome time paſt executing (with others) his Majeſty's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for ſettling the boundary between this province and that of New-Jerſey. I left Boſton the 11th July, ſince which my advices from London have come to me very imperfect: but as my friend Mr. Thompſon writes me that he had drawn up my caſe and with your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid it before the D. of Gra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012818_0033_0F90917C855D0FE8"/>
needful once more to mention this buſineſs to you.</p>
               <p>There was a time when I thought the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of government might have been eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; but while it's friends and the officers of the crown are left to an abject dependance on theſe very people who are <hi>undermining it's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> and while theſe are ſuffered not only to go unpuniſhed, but on the contrary meet with all kind of ſupport and encouragement, it cannot be expected that you will ever again recover that reſpect which the colonies had been wont to pay to the parent ſtate. Government at home will deceive itſelf, if it imagines that the taking off the duty on glaſs, paper and painter's colors will work a reconciliation, and nothing more than this, as I can learn, is propoſed in Ld. H's late cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular letter. It is the principle that is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; the combination againſt importation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to tea, although it comes cheaper than ever, as well as to the other forementioned articles. In Virginia it is extended lately to wines; and I have heard one of the firſt leaders in theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Boſton ſay, that we ſhould never be upon a proper footing 'till all the revenue acts from the 15th Charles 2d were repealed. Our aſſembly in the Maſſachuſetts may have been more illiberal than others in their public meſſages and reſolves; yet we have ſome people among us ſtill who dare to ſpeak in favor of government: But here I do not find ſo much as one, unleſs it be ſome of the King's ſervants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs here leads me to aſſociate with the beſt. They univerſally approve of the combination againſt importing of goods from Great-Britain,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012818_0034_0F90917D4D76A3D8"/>
unleſs the revenue acts are repealed, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me little leſs than aſſuming a negative on all acts of parliament which they do not like! They ſay expreſly, we are bound by none made ſince our emigration, but ſuch as for our own convenience we chooſe to ſubmit to; ſuch for inſtance as that for eſtabliſhing a poſt-office. The Bill of Rights and the Habeas Corpus Acts, they ſay are only declaratory of the common law which we brought with us.</p>
               <p>Under ſuch circumſtance as theſe, why ſhould I wiſh to expoſe myſelf to popular reſentment? Were I to receive any thing out of the revenue. I muſt expect to be abuſed for it. Nor do I find that our chief juſtice has received the £.200 granted him for that ſervice; and yet the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have this year withheld his uſual grant, moſt probably becauſe he has ſuch a warrant from the crown.</p>
               <p>With regard to my negociations with Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I did in conformity to your opinion make an apology to Mr. Secretary Pownall for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning it, and there ſubmitted it. I hear it has been ſince talk'd of; but unleſs I could be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one ſhape or other of £.300 per annum, with the other office, I would not chuſe to quit what I have. I have no ambition to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, if I am only to be held up as a mark of popular envy or reſentment. I was in hopes before now through the intervention of your good offices to have received ſome mark of favor from your good friend; but the time is not yet come to expect it through that channel! I will
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012818_0035_0F90917FDFBDBF68"/>
however rely on your friendſhip, whenever you can with propriety appear in forwarding my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or preventing any thing that may prove injurious to it.</p>
               <p>If Mr. R. has intereſt enough to obtain the ſecretary's place, I ſhall upon receiving proper ſecurity think myſelf in honor bound to ſecond his views, though I have none at preſent from him but a conditional note he formerly wrote me. If he is not like to ſucceed, and my ſon Daniel could have my place, I would be content unleſs affairs take a different turn to reſign in his favor, whether adminiſtration ſhould think proper to make any further proviſion for me or not. And yet I never thought of withdrawing myſelf from the ſervice, while there appeared to me any proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of my being able to promote it.</p>
               <p>If I have wrote with freedom, I conſider I am writing to a friend, and that I am perfectly ſafe in opening myſelf to you.</p>

               <p>I Wrote you a few days ago, and did not then think of troubling you upon any private affair of mine, at leaſt not ſo ſuddenly; but within this day or two, I have had converſation with Mr. Oliver, ſecretary of the province, the deſign of which was my ſucceeding to the poſt he holds from the crown, upon the idea, that proviſion would be made for governor Bernard, and the lieutenant governor would ſucceed to the chair, then the ſecretary is deſirous of being lieutenant governor, and if in any way, three hundred pounds a year could be annexed to the appointment. You are ſenſible the appointment is in one department, and the grant of money in another; now the preſent lieutenant governor has an aſſignment of £. 200 a year upon the cuſtoms here; he has not received any thing from it as yet, and is doubtful if he ſhall; he has no doubt of its lapſe to the crown, if he has the chair; if then by any intereſt that ſum could be aſſigned to Mr. Oliver as lieutenant governor, and if he ſhould be allowed (as has been uſual for all lieutenant governors) to hold the command of the caſtle, that would be another £100. This would compleat the ſecretary's views; and he thinks his public ſervices, the injuries he has received in that ſervice, and the favorable ſentiments entertained of him by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may lead him to theſe views, and he hopes for the intereſt of his friends. The place of ſecretary is worth £.300 a year, but is a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012818_0038_0F9091829BDEA0D8"/>
provincial grant at preſent, ſo that it will not allow to be quartered on: And as I had view upon the place when I was in England, and went ſo far as to converſe with ſeveral men of intereſt upon it, tho' I never had an opportunity to mention it to you after I recovered my illneſs—I hope you will allow me your influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and by extending it at the treaſury, to facilitate the aſſignment of the £. 200 a year, it will be ſerving the ſecretary, and it will very much oblige me.—The ſecretary is advanced in life, tho' much more ſo in health, which has been much impaired by the injuries he received, and he wiſhes to quit the more active ſcenes; he conſiders this as a kind of <hi>

I will mention to you the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are acquainted with my views and whoſe favourable approbation I have had. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Pownall, Mr. John Pownall, and Dr. Franklin.—My lord Hillsborough is not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it—I have ſince I have been here, wrote Mr. Jackſon upon the ſubject, and have by this veſſel wrote Mr. Mauduir. I think my character ſtands fair—I have not been without application to public affairs, and have acquired ſome knowledge of our provincial affairs, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our many free converſations in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I am conſidered here as on government ſide, for which I have been often traduced both publickly and privately, and very lately have had two or three ſlaps. The governor and lieutenant governor are fully acquainted with the negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and I meet their approbation; all is upon the idea the governor is provided for, and there

ſhall by any means be a vacancy of the lieut. go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's place. I have gone ſo far, as to ſay to ſome of my friends, that rather than not ſucceed I would agree to pay the ſecretary £.100 a year out of the office to make up £.300, provided he could obtain only the aſſignment of £.200—but the other propoſal would to be ſure be moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. I ſcarce know any apology to make for troubling you upon the ſubject; the friendſhip you ſhowed me in London, and the favourable expreſſions you made uſe of to the lieut. governor in my behalf encourage me, beſides a ſort of egotiſm, which inclines men to think what they wiſh to be real.

            </opener>
            <p>I AM now withdrawn to my little country villa, where, though I am more retired from the buſy world, yet I am ſtill inveloped with uneaſy reflections for a turbulent, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, ungrateful continent, and the oppoſition I have met with in my indefatigable endeavours to ſecure our property in this colony, but hitherto without ſucceſs.—The times are ſo corrupted and the conflict of parties ſo predominant, that fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is blind, or ſhuts her eyes to the moſt evident truths that croſs her deſigns, and believes in any abſurdities that aſſiſts to accompliſh her purpoſes under the proſtitution and proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an infatuated government.—Judge then, my dear Sir, in what a critical ſituation the fortunes of we poor Europeans muſt be among them.</p>
            <p>We have not been able to recover our property for years paſt, how great ſover our exigencies may have been, unleſs we ſoothed them into a compliance:—We are unwilling to enter into a litiſconteſtation with them, becauſe the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their iniquitous courts of juſtice are ſo great, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has convinced us we had better looſe half, to obtain the other quietly, than purſue compulſary meaſures:—We are alſo afraid to apply to a Britiſh Parliament for relief, as none can be effectually adminiſtrated without a change of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a better adminiſtration of juſtice introduced; and was it known here, that we made ſuch application home, not only our fortunes would be in greater jeopardy, but our lives endangered by it before any ſalutary regulations could take place.—We are ſenſible of the goodneſs of the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but how far, or in what ſpace of time our grievance, as a few individuals, might weigh againſt the influence of a charter government, we are at a loſs to determine.</p>
            <p>In 1761, I arrived in America, which circumſtance you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably remember well:—With great induſtry, caution and circumſpection, I have not only reduced our demands, and regulated our connections in ſome meaſure, but kept my head out of a HALTER which you had the honor to grace. (Pray Doctor how did it feel? The ſubject is ſtale, but I muſt be a little funny with you on the occaſion.) Much ſtill remains to be done, and after all my beſt endeavours, my conſtituents, from a moderate calculation, cannot looſe leſs than £.50,000 ſterling, by the baneful conſtitution of this colony, and the corruption of their courts of judicature. <hi>It is really a very afflicting and melancholly conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under a deep ſenſe of the infirmities of their conſtitution; the innovations which they have gradually interwoven among
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012818_0041_0F909184C1E20288"/>
themſelves; and ſtimulated by every act of forbearance, lenity and patience, we have indulged our correſpondents until de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges of bankruptceys have enſued, inſolvent acts liberated them from our juſt demands, and finally, had our indiſputable accounts refuſed admiſſion for our proportion of the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, untill colony creditors were firſt paid, and the whole abſorbed. We have had veſſels made over to us for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of debts, and after bills of ſales were executed, carried off in open violence and forced by Capt. Snip-ſnap of Mr. No-body's appointment, and when we ſued him for damages, recovered a louſe. We have in our turn been ſued in our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and condemned <hi>ex parte</hi> in large ſums for imaginary da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, for which we can neither obtain a trial, nor redreſs. They refuſe us an appeal to the King in Council; the money muſt be paid when their executions become returnable; and were we to carry it home by way of complaint, it would coſt us two or three hundred pounds ſterling, to proſecute, and after all, when his Majeſty's decrees comes over in our favour, and refunding the money can no longer be evaded, I expect their effects will be ſecreted, their body's releaſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent act, and our money, both principal, intereſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences irrecoverably gone.—Is not our caſe grievous?—We have in actions founded upon notes of hand, been caſt in their courts of judicature.—We have appealed to his Majeſty in Council for redreſs, got their verdicts reverſed, and obtained the King's decrees for our money, but <hi>that is all;</hi> for although I have had them by me above twelve months, and employed two eminent lawyers to enforce them into execution conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the colony law, yet we have not been able to recover a ſingle ſhilling, though we have danced after their courts and aſſembly's above THIRTY DAYS <hi>in vain</hi> to accompliſh that purpoſe only: Conſider my dear Sir, what expence, vexation, and loſs of time this muſt be to us, and whether we have not juſt cauſe of complaint.</p>
            <p>We have alſo in vain waited with great impatience for years paſt, in hopes his Majeſty would have nominated his Judges, and other executive officers in every colony in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which would in a great meaſure remove the cauſe of our complaint.—Nothing can be more neceſſary than a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation in this, and conſtituting it a regal government; and nothing is of ſuch important uſe to a nation, as that men who excel in <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> ſhould be encouraged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the buſineſs of government: But the iniquitous courſe of their courts of juſtice in this colony, deter ſuch men from ſerving the public, or if they do ſo, unleſs patronized at home, their wiſdom and virtue are turned againſt them with ſuch malignity, that it is more ſafe to be <hi>infamous</hi> than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned.—The principal exception I have met with here, is James Helmes, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was choſen Chief Juſtice by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly at laſt election.—He accepted his appointment, diſtinguiſhes himſelf by capacity and application, and ſeems neither afraid nor aſhamed to adminiſter impartial juſtice to <hi>all,</hi> even to the native and reſiding creditors of the mother country.—I have known him grant them temporary relief by
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012818_0042_0F90918578591450"/>
writs of error, &amp;c. when both he and they were overruled by the partiality of the court; and in vain, though with great candour and force, pleaded with the reſt of the bench, that for the honour of the colony, and their own reputation, they ought never to pay leſs regard to the decrees of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in Council, becauſe the property was determined in Great Britain, than to their own. I have alſo heard him with <hi>reſolution and firmneſs,</hi> when he diſcovered the court to be <hi>immoderately partial,</hi> order his name to be inroled, as diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the verdict.—For ſuch honeſty and candour, I am perſuaded he will be depoſed at next election, unleſs they ſhould be ſtill in hopes of making him a convert.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it was in my power to prevent every American from ſuffering for the cauſe of integrity, and their mother country; <hi>

Or is it become faſhionable for vice to be countenanced with impunity, and every trace of virtue paſt over unnoticed! God forbid.</p>
            <p>The colonies have originally been wrong founded.—They ought all to have been regal governments, and every executive officer appointed by the King. Untill that is effected, and they are properly regulated, they will never be beneficial to themſelves, nor good ſubjects to Great Britain.—You ſee with what contempt they already treat the acts of Parliament for regulating their trade, and enter into the moſt public, illegal, and affronting combinations to obtain a repeal, by again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the Britiſh merchants and manufacturers, and all under the cloak of <hi>retrenching their expences,</hi> by avoiding every <hi>unneceſſary ſuperfluity.</hi> Were that really the caſe, I am ſure I would, and alſo every other Britiſh ſubject, eſteem them for it; but the fact is, they obtained a repeal of the ſtamp act by mercantile influence, and they are now endeavouring by the ſame artifice and fineſſe to repeal the acts of trade, and obtain a total exemption from all taxation.—Were it otherwiſe, and they ſincerely diſpoſed to ſtop the importation of every unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuperfluity, without affronting the Britiſh Legiſlation, by their public, general, and illegal combinations, they might accompliſh their purpoſes with much more <hi>decency,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it more effectually by the acts of their own Legiſlation, impoſing ſuch duties upon their importation here, <note n="*" place="bottom">I mean foreign growth, or fabrications; but if on Britiſh, it would be more pardonable in their preſent ſyſtem.</note> as might either occaſion a total prohibition, or confine the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to particular individuals that can afford to buy, by which meaſure, they would alſo raiſe a conſiderable colony REVENUE and eaſe the poorer inhabitants in the tax they now pay:—but the temper of the country is exceedingly <hi>fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and prone to ſedition; they are growing more <hi>imperious, haughty,</hi> nay <hi>inſolent</hi> every day, and in a ſhort ſpace, unleſs

wholſome regulations take place, the ſpirit they have kindled, and the conceptions of government they have imbibed, will be more grievous to the mother country than ever the oſtraciſm was to the Athenians.</p>
            <p>A bridle at preſent, may accompliſh more than a rod here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; for the malignant poiſon of the times, like a general peſtilence, ſpreads beyond conception; and if the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament are too late in their regulations, neglect meaſures ſeven years, which are eſſentially neceſſary now, ſhould they then be able to ſtifle their commotions, it would only be a temporary extinction, conſequently, every hour's indulgence will anſwer to no other purpoſe than enable them in a more effectual manner to ſow ſeeds of diſcenſion to be rekindled whenever they are in a capacity to oppoſe the mother country and render themſelves independent of her.</p>
            <p>Have they not already in the moſt public manner ſhewn their oppoſition to the meaſures of parliament in the affair of the late ſtamp act? Don't they now with equal violence and audacity, in both public papers and converſation, declare the parliamentary regulations in their acts of trade to be illegal and a mere nullity?—What further proofs do we wait for, of either their good or bad diſpoſition? Did you ever hear of any colonies, <hi>in their infant ſtate,</hi> teach the ſcience of tyranny, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into rules,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Committee to the Sons of Liberty, &amp;c.</note> over every ſubject that diſcountenanced their meaſures in oppoſition to the mother country, <hi>in a more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner than they have done theſe four years paſt?</hi> Have they not made uſe of every ſtroke of policy (in their way) to avail themſelves of the dark purpoſes of their independence, and ſuffered no reſtraint of conſcience, or fear, not even the guilt of threatening <hi>to excite a civil war,</hi> and <hi>revolt,</hi> if not indulged with an unlimited trade, without reſtraint; and Britiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, without expence? For that is the Engliſh of it.—Is this their true, or miſtaken portrait? SAY.—If it is their true one, ought not ſuch pernicious maxims of policy? Such wicked diſcipline? Such ingratitude? Such diſſimulation? Such perfidy? Such violent, ruthleſs and ſanguinary councils, where a Cleon bears rule, and an Ariſtides cannot be endured, to be cruſhed in embryo? If not, the alternative cannot avoid producing ſuch a government, as will ere long throw the whole kingdom into the utmoſt confuſion, endanger the life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and property of every good ſubject, and again expoſe them to the mercileſs aſſaſſination of a rabble.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that in all political diſputes, eſpecially in America, a man may ſee ſome things to blame on both ſides, and ſo much to fear, which ever faction ſhould conquer, as to be juſtified in not intermedling with either; but in matters of ſuch vaſt importance as the preſent, wherein we have ſuffered ſo much,—ſtill deeply intereſted, and by which the peace and tranquility of the nation is at ſtake; it is difficult to conceal one's emotions from a friend, and remain a tranquil ſpectator
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012818_0044_0F909189ADB57E08"/>
on a theatre of ſuch chicanery and colluſion, as will inevitably (if not checked, and may ſooner happen than is imagined by many) chill the blood of many a true Briton.</p>
            <p>It may be true policy, in ſome caſes, to tame the fierceſt ſpirit of popular liberty, not by blows or by chains, but by ſoothing her into a willing obedience, and making her kiſs the very hand that reſtrains her; but ſuch policy would be a very unſuitable potion to cure the malady of the preſent times. They are too much corrupted; and already ſo intoxicated with their own importance, as to make a wrong uſe of lenient meaſures,—they conſtrue them into their own natural rights, and a timidity in the mother country. They conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a little bigger than the <hi>frog</hi> in the <hi>fable,</hi> and that Great Britain can never long grapple with their huge territory of 15,000 mile frontier, already populous, and increaſing with ſuch celerity, as to double their number once in <hi>twenty-five years.</hi>—This is not perfectly conſonant with my idea of the matter, though ſuch calculation has been made; and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to be erroneous, yet, as they believe it, it has the ſame evil effect, and poſſeſſes the imaginations of the people with ſuch a degree of inſanity and enthuſiaſm, as there is hardly any thing more common than to hear them boaſt of particular colonies that can raiſe on a ſhort notice <hi>an hundred thouſand fighting men, to oppoſe the force of Great Britain;</hi> certain it is, they increaſe in numbers by emigration, &amp;c, very faſt, and are become ſuch a body of people, with ſuch extenſive terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as require every bud of their genius and diſpoſition to be narrowly watched, and pruned with great judgment, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways they may become not only troubleſome to Great Britain, but enemies to themſelves.—Now is the critical ſeaſon.—They are like ſome raw giddy youth juſt emerging into the world in a corrupt degenerate age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A parent, or a guardian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is therefore ſtill neceſſary; and if well managed, they will ſoon arrive to ſuch maturity as to become obedient, dutiful children; but if neglected long, the rod of chaſtiſement will be ſo much longer neceſſary as to become too burthenſome, and muſt be dropt with the colonies — They almoſt conſider themſelves as a ſeparate people from Great Britain already.</p>
            <p>Laſt month while I was attending the General Aſſembly, the Governor ſent a written meſſage to the lower houſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his intentions of a reſignation at the next election, aſſigning for reaſons the fumes in the colony and party ſpirit were ſo high, and that bribery and corruption were ſo predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, that neither <hi>life, liberty</hi> nor <hi>property</hi> were ſafe, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Now Sir, whether the Governor's intentions as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in this open, public declaration, was real, or <hi>feign'd</hi> to anſwer political purpoſes; it ſtill evinces their decrepid ſtate; the proſtitution of government; and melancholy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every good ſubject: For it cannot be ſuppoſed by any candid inquiſitor, that a declaration of that nature and form would, if not true, been delivered by a Governor to a whole legiſlative body, in order to emancipate himſelf. If this truth is granted, and this allowed to be their unhappy

ſituation, how much is it the duty of every good man, and what language is ſufficient to paint in an effectual manner, this internal imbecility of an Engliſh colony (in many other reſpects favourably ſituated for trade and commerce, one of the ſafeſt, largeſt, and moſt commodious harbours in all America, or perhaps in all Europe, acceſſible at all ſeaſons, ſituated in a fine climate, and abounding with fertile ſoil)— in the maternal bowels of compaſſion, in order that ſhe may ſeaſonably, if ſhe thinks it neceſſary to interpoſe, regulate, and wipe away their pernicious CHARTER, rendered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious by the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I have tired your patience with a ſubject that muſt give pain to every impartial friend to Great-Britain and her colonies.—When I took up my pen,—I only intended to have communicated the out-lines of ſuch of my perplexities (without diping ſo far into political matter) as I thought would atone for, or excuſe my-long ſilence, and excite your compaſſion and advice.</p>
            <p>Our friend Robinſon is gone to Boſton to join the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners. My compliments to Collector Stuart.—May I aſk the favour of you both to come and eat a Chriſtmas din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with me at Batchelor's Hall, and celebrate the feſtivity of the ſeaſon with me to Narraganſet woods. A covey of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, or bevy of quails, will be entertainment for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector and me, while the pike and pearch ponds amuſe you. Should buſineſs or pre-engagements prevent me that pleaſure, permit me to aſk the favour of your earlieſt intelligence of the proceedings of parliament; and of your opinion whether our caſe is not ſo great as to excite their compaſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition were it known. This narration, together with your own knowledge of many of the facts, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the colonies in general, will refreſh your memory, and enable you to form a judgment. Relief from home ſeems ſo tedious, eſpecially to us who have ſuffered ſo much, like to ſuffer more, and unacquainted with their reaſons of delay, that I am quite impatient.</p>
            <p>About twelve months ago, I received from three gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in London (in truſt for ſeveral others) exemplified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for a balance of above twenty ſix thouſand pounds ſterling, moſtly due from this colony, not fifty pounds of which ſhall I ever be able to recover without compulſive mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and what is ſtill worſe, my lawyer adviſes me from all thoughts of proſecution, unleſs a change of government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues. I am therefore obliged to ſend them his opinion (in juſtification of my own conduct) in lieu of money ten years due. Poor ſatisfaction! Our conſolation muſt be in a Britiſh Parliament. Every other avenue is rendered impregnable by their ſubtilty, and degeneracy, and we can no longer depend upon a people who are ſo unthankful for our indulgences, and the lenity of their mother country I wiſh you the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments of the approaching ſeaſon, and a ſucceſſion of many happy new-years.</p>

               <p>BY Mr. Byles I am favoured with your moſt obliging let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſecond of Auguſt laſt, for which together with your extraordinary civility to Mr. Byles I truly thank you: I could not really think of ſuch a perſon going from hence without ſhewing him to you, as a Parſon or Miniſter of his way and turn of thinking may be conſidered as of the comet kind here, which leads me to ſay ſomewhat abruptly if not improperly to you, that it ſeems to me here as if the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Scotland had conſpired to diſtinguiſh all the firebrand incendiary preachers of this country with plumes of honorary degrees and titles, which in truth are only ſo many mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the friends of Great-Britain or lovers of letters, who cannot help being touched and chagrined at the too frequent profuſion of honor and titles conferred from Scotland upon the leading preachers of ſedition. I wiſh this affair of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proſtitution from my native country may induce you to ſpeak of it to ſome of that nation with whom I know you are intimate, that may think of preventing it for the future.</p>
               <p>As to Boſton, the great theatre of action, I have been ſilent for ſome time paſt only for want of certain intelligence, as every day generally produced new rumours without any or much foundation in truth—but ſince the arrival of the two regiments with Col. Dalrymple all has been quiet there. I now flatter myſelf that meaſures of vigour will be purſued and maintained here, and I impatiently wiſh to hear that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012818_0047_0F90918B7A9A1EF8"/>
your friend is in power and confidence again, but that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a point I have much expectation, deſire and faith in. As you have expreſſed heretofore to me inclination of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proceedings of the Rhode-Iſland Aſſembly reſpecting compenſation to the ſufferers in the riot of Newport, I now trouble you with a copy of my letter of this day to the Lords of the Treaſury, which mutatis mutandis, is the ſame with that alſo to the Earl of Hilſborough of the ſame date with a copy of the narrative and letter to Lord Shelburne.</p>
               <p>MY LORDS,</p>
               <p>AGain I preſume upon troubling your Lordſhips with as ſhort an account as may be written of what has very lately paſſed in the General Aſſembly of Rhode Iſland colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in reference to their granting of a compenſation to the ſufferers from the riot of Newport 1765, as reſolved on in the Britiſh Parliament and very graciouſly recommended from His Majeſty to the Governor and Company of that colony by his principal Secretary of State.</p>
               <p>Tired out and greatly mortified with a long courſe of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fruitleſs and a very expenſive attendance upon the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, I had reſolved above a year ago to ſolicit them no more: but at the interceſſion of my fellow ſufferer Mr. Howard, Chief Juſtice of North-Carolina, I was again prevailed upon to go to Newport in September laſt, where and when the Aſſembly then met and I had ſufficient influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to engage the Speaker of the Houſe of Deputies to move ſeveral times for reading a petition of Mr. Howard's, with an eſtimate of his loſs ſolemnly ſworn to and authenticated by a Notary Public<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with every neceſſary preſcribed form. The Speaker alſo urged upon the Houſe becauſe of my attending from another colony upon that account only, but the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would neither conſent to hear Mr. Howard's petition nor receive his eſtimate.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this refuſal a meſſage was ſent from the Upper Houſe of Magiſtrates requeſting the Lower Houſe to enter now upon the riot of Newport by immediately impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the High Sheriff to impannel a Jury of Inquiſition to aſcertain and repair the loſs of Dr. Moffat, Mr. Howard and Mr. Johnſon, but the Houſe of Deputies could not liſten nor agree to any part of this propoſal from the Upper Houſe.</p>
               <p>About the middle of laſt month I wrote a moſt reſpectful letter to the Governor of Rhode Iſland and incloſed to his Honor the eſtimate of my loſs in the Newport riot ſworn to before and atteſted by a Magiſtrate here requeſting the favor of the Governor to lay the ſame before the enſuing Aſſembly, The Governor writes on the ſeventh of this month
<q>that at the laſt ſeſſion of Aſſembly he preſented my eſtimate and read my letter in a great committee of both Houſes of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly but could not prevail to have it conſidered then;</q>
and adds
<q>that he will endeavour to bring it in again next February.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Under the ſtrongeſt impreſſions of aſſurance the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Rhode Iſland never will recompence the ſufferers
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012818_0048_0F90918C57F3E5A0"/>
in the riot of Newport, may I again preſume to implore your Lordſhips interpoſition and influence to obtain a recompence for the ſufferers in Rhode Iſland from ſome more effectual and certain channel than that of depending any longer upon the duty or juſtice of the General Aſſembly in that colony. And my Lords may I yet rather preſume in writing to your Lordſhips to add that by endeavouring to reſtore in ſome meaſure what I loſt in that riot I am now ſadly ſenſible that I have not overvalued the ſame in my eſtimate, as alſo that if I am not compenſated by the intereſt, generoſity and equity of your Lordſhips, I can never expect to be poſſeſſed of half the value I then loſt as the Office of a Comptroler here I now hold, has but a very inconſiderable ſalary with ſmall perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites.</p>

               <p>In my laſt letter which I hope you have received, as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed it to the care of your brother, I then touched upon Sir William Johnſon's being here ſome weeks in queſt of health, and of the pleaſure Mr. Stewart and I enjoyed with him; as alſo that Lord Charles Grenville Montague was here on paſſant with his Lady; and I alſo then intimated to you our happineſs in Mr. Harriſon the Collector of Boſton having accepted Mr. Stewart's warm invitation to come here after the very flagrant riot at Boſton, on which he had been ſo greatly inſulted, abuſed and hurt, who came here with his lady, ſon and daughter, and ſtaid a fortnight; when we planned and regulated all theſe colonies into a ſyſtem which I could wiſh to ſee effected. Since which Mr. Stewart has vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Mr. Harriſon at Boſton at the time when Mrs. Harriſon with their ſon and daughter failed for London as a place of perfect ſafety and liberty. Mr. Harriſon's ſon is capable and promiſing, but was cruelly uſed by the mob of Boſton, which will I hope induce Mr. Harriſon's friends or rather the friends of government to provide ſuitably for ſo young a ſufferer. I could not eaſily within the compaſs of a letter to you ſay the pleaſure I have felt in obſerving the ſtrict union and friendſhip that ſubſiſts and is now rivetted between Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and Mr. Stewart upon principles of the trueſt honor and virtue both of whom well underſtand and ſincerely wiſh the true intereſt of Great-Britain and all her colonies, eſpecially in the cardinal articles of legiſlation and government, as alſo in the ſubaltern or leſſer points of taxation and revenue from which objects no attachments, connections or views will or ever can ſway the one or the other. As I have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to write to you with a plainneſs and freedom which I flatter myſelf has not been diſagreeable ſo therefore I would further ſay of Mr. Stewart that he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rried in an opulent, popular and commercial family, ſome of whom perhaps may be ſuppoſed to have more oblique intereſt than may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with regulation or a due ſubmiſſion to the laws of Great-Britatn, ſo it is with a peculiar and very ſenſible ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that I can aſſure you his ſpirit, addreſs and conduct in ſo nice a ſituation deſerves the greateſt praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012818_0049_0F90918D13B3A7C8"/>
as it has perhaps been or may be very influential on ſome of the beſt among them, even to a better way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting. By the incloſed you will know that Mr. Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art now writes to Mr. Grenville, and mention ſomewhat of his application for leave of abſence from the Treaſury Board, which I only wiſh him to ſucceed in becauſe I think Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and him really the moſt capable perſons here to throw light upon many tranſactions here which cannot be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in letters or any written repreſentation to ſatisfaction or proper advantage. If Mr. Stewart obtains leave to return home I ſhall be unhappy enough by his abſence. Two years are now elapſed ſince I came here, a great part of which has been ſpent in anxiouſly wiſhing for the Genius of Britain to awake and vindicate her ſupreme juriſdiction and authority impiouſly queſtioned and denied in colonies ſo very lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from hoſtile incurſions and encroachments, but I believe the time is now come, and I rejoice in its approach.

                  <salute>SIR.</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN November laſt I wrote you from New London, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in that letter a copy of what I had written to the Lords of the Treaſury and the Earl of Hilſborough, relative to the compenſation of the ſufferers in the riot of Newport 1765. I hope and very much wiſh that letter may have come to your hand, becauſe in it you will ſee how ſtricly and ſoon I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your counſel in making affidation to the eſtimate of my loſs, which as I apprehended made not the leaſt impreſſion nor could make upon the General Aſſembly of Rhode-Iſland, becauſe there was not I believe a Member in either Houſe that did not think and believe my loſs exceeded the eſtimate frequently laid before them to no purpoſe. I thank you therefore for the kind and good advice which I inſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and which I think has finiſhed this long and tedious tranſaction on this ſide of the Atlantic, which has not only been ineffectual but attended with much trouble and expence to me. How or in what light it may be now conſidered by Adminiſtration or Parliament I cannot at this time and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance judge, far leſs determine. Sometimes I flatter myſelf that a reſolve of the Britiſh Senate will not be allowed to be thus ſcorned and trampled upon; at other times I deſpond and think the object too ſmall for attention; and as there were but three ſufferers in Rhode-Iſland colony, two of whom to my great pleaſure and triumph are now amply and very honorably provided for, I ſometimes imagine that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation may drop and be forgot, and indeed if it was not for the confidence which I have in you and ſome others in the Houſe of Commons, I ſhould certainly deſpair of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and which upon recollection I muſt acknowledge as criminal in a very great degree, becauſe of its having been
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012818_0050_0F90918DB94DA998"/>
reſolved on in the Parliament of Great-Britain that ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers ſhould be compenſated: And I am not conſcious that I have omitted, delayed or neglected any part of my duty in the courſe of negotiating it here in America.</p>
               <p>A few days ago I came here chiefly to ſee and enjoy my friend Collector Harriſon, that we might open boſoms to one another upon the great ſcene and field of affairs in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the face of which is only altered apparently here from the arrival of the King's troops and ſhips, which have indeed reſtored a very certain ſecurity and tranquility, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented if not put a final period to their moſt peſtilent town-meetings. There is nor can be no real alteration in the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſpoſition of the prime diſturbers—This is but an interval or truce procured from the dread of a Bayonet—The ſpecifical and catholic remedy derived from and founded in an acknowledgment of the Britiſh ſupremacy and legiſlation over America manifeſted under the exerciſe of a more firm, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and conſiſtent plan of civil government, muſt come from the decrets of the Britiſh Parliament, otherwiſe the country, and particularly New-England, will ſoon and forever be in perpetual anarchy and diſobedience. The anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the few here that are well affected to government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the troops and ſhips was very great, and in my opinion will be greater if vigorous, ſalutary and proper meaſures are not adopted in Parliament.</p>
               <p>All here ſeem anxious and impatient to know the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and temper of the Britiſh Parliament, and what is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unaccountable if not incredible, the ſons of liberty here ſo called are elevated with hope and aſſurance that their claims and pretenſions will be received and recognized as they affect to phraſe it, but if I err not, this preſumption of hope may have ariſen or been cheriſhed in a great meaſure by ſome viſits of an officer of high military rank from New-York to ſome of the moſt popular and violent ringleaders here, and I wiſh that I could ſay to you that the moſt miſchievous here had not been countenanced alſo by a perſon of another and very different ſtation.</p>
               <p>I and that in conſequence of and under an apprehenſion of unſettled, unſafe times here, Mr. Harriſon has thought it beſt that Mrs. Harriſon, his ſon and daughter, ſhould go to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as a place of true liberty and ſafety, and as I hope they will be arrived before this reaches you, and as I formerly mentioned to you Mr. Harriſon's ſon as a young ſufferer very roughly handled upon the 10th of June, ſo if you incline to ſee and diſcourſe him for intelligence or any other motive, Mr. Hallowell of this town can eaſily bring him to you.</p>
               <p>If any thing remarkable occurs here during my ſtay I ſhall not fail to write to you again.</p>
