            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE occaſion, my chriſtian friends, which calls us together this day to the houſe of God, is equally important and joyous; and the obſervance of this day by the whole people of united America, in public expreſſions of gratitude to God for important national bleſſings, exhibits to the imagination a moſt magnificent and intereſting ſcene.</p>
            <p>To aid us in contemplations ſuited to the occaſion, I have ſelected the paſſage of Scripture which has now been read.</p>
            <p>It may be applied, perhaps, with as ſtriking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to the preſent circumſtances of the inhabitants of this country, as it ever could be to thoſe of any people, ſince its original application, by the ſacred penman, to the ſituation of the children of Iſrael, at a time of great proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:029830_0004_0FE2776BE9184F38"/>
In the Preſident's proclamation for this day, we have a repreſentation of the preſent condition of the United States, which remarkably correſponds, in its leading features, with the elegant and ſublime deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription in the text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He maketh peace,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>in thy borders.</hi> The Preſident, in the preamble to the proclamation, ſpeaks of <q>our exemption hitherto from foreign war, and an increaſing proſpect of the continuance of that exemption.</q> The Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>He hath ſtrengthened the bars of thy gates.</hi> The Preſident takes notice of <q>the great degree of internal tranquility we have enjoyed, and the recent confirmation of that tranquility, by the ſuppreſſion of an inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſo wantonly threatened it.</q> And parallel to the words of the text, <hi>He hath bleſſed thy children within thee, and filleth thee with the fineſt of the wheat,</hi> are thoſe of the proclamation, which remind us of <q>the happy courſe of our public affairs in general, and the unexampled proſperity of all claſſes of our citizens.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On account of ſuch important public bleſſings, the children of Iſrael are called upon to expreſs their gratitude to God. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O Jeruſalem, praiſe thy God, O Zion!</hi> And in <q>circumſtances which ſo peculiarly mark <hi>our</hi> ſituation with indications of the divine beneficence towards us,</q> we are reminded in the proclamation of our <q>duty as a people, with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029830_0005_0FE2776D734A91C8"/>devout reverence, and affectionate gratitude, to acknowlege our many and great obligations to Almighty God, and to implore him to continue and confirm the bleſſings we experience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That we may know the extent of our obligations, and have feelings awakened anſwerable to them; let us now take a particular view of that ſtate of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, which, at this day, marks the condition of the United States; the general outlines of which are ſo juſtly ſketched in the proclamation.</p>
            <p>The baſis of all our public happineſs are certainly the <hi>conſtitutions of government</hi> under which we live; which, in a degree perhaps never before experienced in any country, "unite, and by their union eſtabliſh, liberty with order."</p>
            <p>In other countries, <hi>liberty</hi> has uſually languiſhed under a ſyſtem of corruption, or been cruſhed beneath the arm of arbitrary power; or elſe the <hi>ſocial order</hi> has become the victim of faction; and <hi>liberty</hi> has degenerated into a licentiouſneſs, more dreadful in its operation, and more oppreſſive in its effects than any other ſyſtem of tyranny.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution of the United States, and thoſe of the ſeveral ſtates which compoſe the Union, are formed on purely republican principles. They were the deliberate act of the people,—intended to ſecure their rights, by guarding, on the one hand, againſt encroachment and oppreſſion by perſons inveſted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029830_0006_0FE2777B31E48D70"/>with civil power; and, on the other, againſt the numberleſs evils, which muſt reſult from a relapſe into licentiouſneſs and diſorder. And they happily embrace the two great objects of government,—ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of rights to individuals, and of ſtrength, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and order to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Under theſe conſtitutions every man enjoys perfect ſecurity, and feels an honeſt independence, while he conducts conſiſtently with the general good, and does not contravene the rights of others. The pooreſt member of the community is conſcious of a perfect equality with the richeſt, in reſpect to the protection of his perſon, and the ſecurity of his property. And not only ſo, but, under the conſtitution of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth with few exceptions, and under that of the United States without any, he is taught to feel his importance as a member of the body politic, by his having an equal voice in the election of perſons to hold the moſt important offices of government, and by being himſelf, equally with others, eligible to the firſt offices.</p>
            <p>It is a great excellency of our government, that our rulers are from among ourſelves; and that they do not derive their ſtations from birth, or any adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious circumſtances, but are raiſed to office by the ſuffrages of the people; that they enjoy no heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſtinction, or right of domination; that they are ſervants of the people,—accountable to them for
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029830_0007_0FE2777CD63447C8"/>their conduct in the offices in which they are placed by their voice, and liable to be diſplaced, if they are found to neglect their duty, or betray their truſt.</p>
            <p>Our conſtitutions of government, under which all enjoy equal rights, by having equal protection of perſons and ſecurity of property, and by being equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented in the adminiſtration, are the glory of our land, and the admiration and envy of the friends of freedom in other countries. Imperfections they doubtleſs have in common with all other productions of human wiſdom; yet ſuch is, notwithſtanding, their intrinſic excellence and real importance, that the contemplation of them this day may with the greateſt propriety fill with ſatisfaction <hi>our</hi> hearts, who are ſo deeply intereſted in them, and our lips with praiſe to the benign Author of all good: inaſmuch as they lay the foundation of all our civil and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal advantages, and are the ſource of moſt of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and domeſtic felicity.</p>
            <p>Next to the glorious fabric of our government, "the preſervation of our peace foreign and domeſtic," by which we continue to enjoy its bleſſings, lays claim to a tribute of gratitude to the <hi>God of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order juſtly to eſtimate the bleſſing of peace foreign and domeſtic at the preſent day, and in the preſent poſture of affairs, it is neceſſary for us to lend our attention to the circumſtances which have, for ſome time, endangered its exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:029830_0008_0FE2777E64739E88"/>
Several circumſtances, in the courſe of two years paſt, have concurred to embarraſs our internal affairs, and to render our ſituation with foreign nations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely delicate and critical.</p>
            <p>The war, which has been carried on with ſo much zeal and obſtinacy between France and ſeveral of the European powers combined againſt her liberties and independence, could not, from the nature of the thing, be unintereſting to this country. Having our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo lately, made a glorious and ſucceſsful ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice in the cauſe of liberty, it was natural for us to rejoice to ſee the principles of freedom extending their influence. And we could not but behold with peculiar ſatisfaction the ardent and reſolute exertions for freedom in a large and powerful nation with which we were in alliance; and which had long groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under as refined and ſyſtematic deſpotiſm, as, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ever exiſted in the world.—And, proportioned to our ſatisfaction in the efforts made by the French nation to ſhake off the fetters of ſlavery, and recover their freedom, was our indignation at the unprovok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unreaſonable interference of a wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination in her internal concerns. And as ſincerely as we lamented the exceſſes, which, till lately, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the glorious cauſe in which France was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and as much as we deteſted the ſanguinary meaſures purſued by a faction within her; the American people had diſcernment enough to know,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029830_0009_0FE2777FF0D6F1E8"/>that theſe exceſſes were not to be attributed to the cauſe in which ſhe was engaged; and they had can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour enough to trace them to their true ſource. They knew that great convulſions were inevitable in ſo great a revolution, and that violent meaſures were to be expected in the exertions of a people, who were engaged with zeal and reſolution in cruſhing an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and eſtabliſhed tyranny; and ſtill felt the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reſentment againſt thoſe, who had been the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their oppreſſion, and who, they naturally ſuppoſed, were wiſhing to prolong it. They were aware, befides, that the open invaſion of France by the combined powers, and their ſecret intrigues in the heart of the country, by exaſperating the friends of the revolution, by ſowing jealouſies and diſtruſt among the leaders of it, and fomenting faction in every form through the nation, were the principal cauſes, to which were to be imputed the ſhocking ſcenes, which caſt a deep ſhade over the dawn of freedom in that country.</p>
            <p>The American people, in general, have wiſhed well to the cauſe of the French, through every ſtage of the revolution; at the ſame time that they had to lament it ſhould be the occaſion of ſo much incidental miſery, and ſuch ſhocking ſcenes of wanton cruelty and injuſtice.</p>
            <p>This partiality of the Americans to the cauſe of the French, expreſſed perhaps by individuals too
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029830_0010_0FE2778BDC3396D8"/>ſtrongly and pointedly for a neutral power, operated as an encouragement to them to employ every effort to engage us to take an active part in their cauſe; at the ſame time it awakened the jealouſy of ſome of the combined powers, and might probably be one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the unfriendly and hoſtile mode of treatment adopted toward us by the Britiſh court.</p>
            <p>Thus were we expoſed to the attempts of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to draw us into the war, which through the arts of an intriguing miniſter had nearly proved effectual; while by another we were provoked by various inſults, and by acts of robbery, outrage, and hoſtility chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to unſheath the ſword.</p>
            <p>To defeat the views and fruſtrate the expectations of thoſe, who wiſhed us to take part with them in the war, in ſuch a manner as to preſerve at the ſame time their friendſhip and confidence; and to ſupport our national conſequence with thoſe, who had groſsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted and injured us, without drawing the ſword to reſent the inſult, and ſeek ſatisfaction for the injury; required in our government more wiſdom and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and more coolneſs and moderation united with firmneſs, than generally fall to the lot of men, to whom are entruſted the affairs of nations.</p>
            <p>And the difficulty of conducting in ſuch a manner as to avoid taking a ſide in the European war was increaſed by ſeveral inauſpicious circumſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:029830_0011_0FE2778D71561C98"/>
There were ſome men among us ſo regardleſs of the common good, and entirely under the influence of ſelfiſh views, as to rejoice in the proſpect of war, from the hope of riſing to wealth by the calamities of their country. There were with us, as there are in all countries, men who are impatient of the linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proceſs of induſtry and regular buſineſs to make their fortune. To ſuch men war preſents the moſt faſcinating proſpects. Having, before their eyes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of enormous eſtates very eaſily and rapidly amaſſed, in the courſe of the late revolution in this country, by privateering, and various kinds of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which war, and its conſequence, a general derangement of affairs, never fail to preſent; they dream of nothing but war and revolution: and nothing will ſatisfy their avaricious deſires, till by war they can be furniſhed with an eaſy and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious way of riſing to opulence; or by producing internal confuſion, and effecting a change in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, they can avail themſelves of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral convulſion and ſhift of property to ſecure an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhare to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Characters of this deſcription abounded in every part of the Union; and they were not deficient in exertions, nor very ſcrupulous in their meaſures, to engage others with them in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>They were joined by all the reſtleſs, ambitious, and diſappointed perſons, who, having abilities
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029830_0012_0FE2778F00E74320"/>which rendered them dangerous, but wanting thoſe virtues which beget reſpect and confidence in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, had been defeated in their ambitious and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring views by the good ſenſe and caution of the people. Stimulated at once by ambition, chagrin and refentment, theſe men were ready to join in a meaſure, which furniſhed ſo alluring a proſpect of producing a revolution in government, or changing the preſent order of things in ſuch a manner, as to give them an opportunity of riſing to eminence and diſtinction.</p>
            <p>Some were advocates for war from an opinion that the national honour required it. Some, becauſe they cheriſhed an old grudge againſt Great-Britain, and, without attending well to the probable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the meaſure, were ready to ſeize on any opportunity to manifeſt their reſentment. And ſome there were, who thought this country obliged, either by treaty or by the principle of gratitude, to engage actively with France in her conteſt againſt the enemies of her freedom and independence.</p>
            <p>It happened unfortunately that within the United States were many citizens deeply indebted to Britiſh merchants. A rupture with Great-Britain preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain proſpect of either an entire extinction of thoſe debts, or at leaſt a delay of the term of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.— And we cannot but lament that the language employed, and meaſures propoſed by ſome influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029830_0013_0FE27792B31E5D60"/>members of Congreſs were ſuch, as to expoſe them to the ſuſpicion of acting under the influence of this conſideration. Candour, however, and a regard to the honour of our country would lead us to hope, that no man, entruſted with a ſhare in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our national concerns, would adviſe to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures obviouſly tending to involve the whole country in a ruinous war, for the ſake of relieving ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, in the ſtate to which he belonged, from the neceſſity of paying their juſt debts.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral characters and deſcriptions of men which have been mentioned, beſides their own direct exertions, had their ſeveral ſpheres of influence; and being joined in their meaſures by the diſorderly, the diſcontented, the enemies of the Federal Government, and thoſe who were diſaffected on account of its general operation, or particular parts of its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, they conſtituted a very formidable faction in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The more effectually to accompliſh their purpoſes, they inſtituted ſocieties in imitation of the jacobin clubs in France; and in order to ſtrengthen their party and carry into effect their deſigns, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to meaſures which muſt have ſunk a good cauſe into diſrepute,—a bad one it rendered infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. By ſeditious and inflammatory publications they endeavoured to poiſon the public mind,—to deceive the people,—to excite their jealouſy, and rouſe their paſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:029830_0014_0FE2779DED944620"/>
The enemies of peace and order were greatly aided in their deſigns, by finding, in ſeveral parts of the Union, printers of news-papers, who regarded ſo little their duty to the public, as to devote their preſſes to the cauſe of ſedition, and to ſuffer falſehood, ſlander, and miſrepreſentation to flow copiouſly in thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which ſhould have been ſacredly employed as the vehicles of public inſtruction and political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. In thoſe papers they defamed and abuſed public characters,—they miſrepreſented and cenſured the meaſures of government,—they endeavoured to caſt an odium on the moſt meritorious officers of government on account of their moſt meritorious actions, and thus to deſtroy the public confidence in them. They abuſed the Preſident for exerting his conſtitutional authority in order to preſerve our peace. They vilified and traduced thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs, who advocated moderate and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific meaſures; holding them up to public deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as lukewarm patriots, as being under Britiſh influence,—friends to Great-Britain, and enemies to their country. Their ſpeeches they mutilated, and handed ſcraps of them to the public in ſuch a form, and ſo detached from their connection, as entirely to pervert their meaning, and convey ſentiments which were never entertained by their authors.</p>
            <p>By the circulation of thoſe papers, ſuſpicions were ſown among the people, the public ſentiment was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029830_0015_0FE2779F79BE8C08"/>miſled, and the public feelings agitated. And the ſpirit of diſorder, uneaſineſs, and oppoſition, by which the public tranquility was threatened in every part of the Union, in one part of it actually broke out in avowed oppoſition to the laws, and open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the government.</p>
            <p>Theſe, which I have mentioned, are ſome of the leading circumſtances, which have operated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb our internal tranquility,—threatened to ſhake the fabric of our government—thus endangered our freedom, and rendered it difficult for the friends of peace, in the adminiſtration of government, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our country from being entangled in the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean war.</p>
            <p>Amidſt all theſe obſtacles to the continuance of peace and tranquility, through the wiſe and ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meaſures adopted by the Preſident, and the faithful exertions of the friends of peace and order in Congreſs, ſupported by the concurrence of public ſentiment, and accompanied with the ſmiles of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we yet enjoy the bleſſing of peace; and a fair proſpect, which is daily brightening, that we ſhall continue to enjoy it under circumſtances highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, and conſiſtent with public faith and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honour. Rejoicing in the continuance of peace, and the check, which has been given to a ſpirit of diſorder and inſurrection; we have reaſon to bleſs the day, when the friends of peace and advocates of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029830_0016_0FE277A10A039D28"/>moderate meaſures prevailed over thoſe, who, by raſh and violent proceedings, would have precipitated our country into a ruinous war. And we have the further ſatisfaction of ſeeing, that the leaders of faction are loſing their influence,—that the honeſt and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning citizens, who had been duped by their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, and betrayed into their meaſures, begin to be undeceived,—and that the ſocieties, which had arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly uſurped the prerogative of the people, and were endeavouring to dictate to their repreſentative government, and to controul its meaſures, are faſt dwindling into inſignificance.</p>
            <p>To the continuance of peace, the ſuppreſſion of inſurrection, and the triumph of order it is chiefly owing, that this country is, in other reſpects, in ſo flouriſhing a condition.</p>
            <p>It requires but little diſcernment and only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon attention to perceive, that the unexampled proſperity of the ſeveral claſſes of our citizens, our rapid improvement in agriculture and manufactures, the ſurpriſing increaſe of our commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the prodigious acceſſion of wealth and ſtrength to the community at large, and the eaſy circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the inhabitants in general, of every claſs, are chiefly owing to that regular courſe of things, which ſeveral years peace, a good government, and internal tranquility have produced. And nothing is more certain, than that all theſe marks of proſperity muſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029830_0017_0FE277A2986C3E38"/>receive a check, and ſome of them perhaps be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annihilated, were we to engage in a war with any of the European powers, or were our government to be materially ſhocked by faction.</p>
            <p>There never was a time heretofore when this country was in ſo flouriſhing a condition, and made ſo reſpectable a figure abroad, as it does at this day. Among many other evidences of our increaſing wealth, power, and importance, it is particularly worthy of our preſent notice, that notwithſtanding the long and expenſive war by which we purchaſed our independence, the reſources of the United States are ſuch, as to enable them to pay, with a great deal of eaſe, the intereſt of the public debt; and that the preſent debates in Congreſs, on the reduction of the public debt, diſcover to us that there is ability in the nation and a diſpoſition in our government, by a pretty rapid proceſs to ſink the principal. It is highly honorary to the United States, and a ſource of conſolation to the citizens; that, while other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, already burdened with debt to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their reſources, are yet madly plunging into the moſt ruinous wars to add to their embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is the enlightened policy of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to avail itſelf of the preſent proſperity to relieve the country of exiſting debt, and, if poſſible, to avoid the neceſſity of increaſing it, and to prolong that peace and proſperity, which furniſh the only hope of its final extinction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:029830_0018_0FE277AFC6C5F2A0"/>
The ſucceſs, which has attended the late negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the court of Great-Britain, furniſhes anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proof of our national reſpectability. We have authentic, though not official notice, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy Extraordinary, lately ſent by our Supreme Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive to the Britiſh court, on buſineſs of the moſt intereſting nature, has effected the deſign of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This ſucceſs, while it evinces that our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is of ſome importance in the eſtimation of other powers, we have reaſon to hope and expect, will contribute much to our future proſperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>To enumerate the marks of private proſperity would lead me beyond the limits of a ſermon. It is, beſides, unneceſſary. They are ſeen and felt by all the inhabitants of our land. That people in general of nearly every claſs and occupation enjoy a ſtate of unuſual proſperity; that the means of a comfortable ſubſiſtence were never more than now within the reach of all; that induſtry and enterprize in every line of life are highly encouraged—that they receive a ſure and ample reward—and that this reward is well ſecured to him who earns it, are facts ſo obvious, that they can neither be overlooked nor conteſted.</p>
            <p>Equally certain it is, that we live under a mild and free government; as mild and free as we can bear—a government, under which each individual has given up as few of his natural rights, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029830_0019_0FE277B1E0535460"/>with the ſecure poſſeſſion of the reſt in a ſtate of ſociety.</p>
            <p>For all theſe public bleſſings and marks of private proſperity, which diſtinguiſh our condition as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and as individuals, let the juſt tribute of our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thanks aſcend this day, as an acceptable ſacrifice, to that God, by whoſe providence we enjoy them all.</p>
            <p>And while, with hearts deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of our obligations, we unitedly praiſe the Lord for theſe indications of divine benignity; piouſly noticing the footſteps of a kind providence in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concerns: the proclamation directs us, <q>at the ſame time humbly and fervently to beſeech the kind Author of theſe bleſſings graciouſly to prolong them to us, and to imprint on our hearts a deep and ſolemn ſenſe of our obligations to him for them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While we hold in juſt eſtimation the patriotic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of thoſe men, who were inſtrumental in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and eſtabliſhing the happy government under which we live, as well as of thoſe who have been the means of preſerving to us the great bleſſing of peace, and promoting our proſperity; let us yet always bear in mind, that, in effecting theſe bleſſed ends, they were but the inſtruments of that providence, which rules over all; and that our firſt acknowlegements are due to <hi>the Father of lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift.</hi>

This direction of the Preſident to expreſs a pious ſenſe of dependence on the great Governor of the world is peculiarly ſeaſonable at the preſent day, when we are in ſo great danger of imbiding the athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic ſentiments ſo openly avowed and publicly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by a nation, with which we have cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and conſtant intercourſe.</p>
            <p>The French people, as was naturally to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their zeal to deſtroy every veſtige of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tyranny and ſuperſtition, have gone to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable exceſs on the other extreme. They have too evidently confounded government with tyranny, and religion with ſuperſtition. We are not however to imagine, as has been too haſtily believed by ſome, that the French are become a <hi>nation of atheiſts.</hi>—Yet it is certain that a very conſiderable proportion of the nation have exploded all religion; and, in ſome of their moſt public and ſolemn acts, their government has virtually rejected the doctrine of a God govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world by his providence. While we put a candid conſtruction on the preſent infidelity and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion of the French, attributing it to their zeal to exterminate all ſuperſtition; and while we hope and believe that, ere long, they will vibrate back again to ſome rational ſyſtem of religion, we cannot be too careful to avoid the contagion of their preſent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Next to acknowleging the hand from which our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029830_0021_0FE277B71641CCB8"/>bleſſings flow, it is neceſſary for us <q>rightly to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their immenſe value.</q> If we eſtimate our public bleſſings according to their worth, we ſhall never be willing to ſacrifice them to private intereſt, party prejudices, national pride, paſſion, or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It will be our wiſh to prolong them to the lateſt period, and to preſerve them unimpaired.</p>
            <p>We are directed to pray, that God would <q>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from the arrogance of proſperity, and from hazarding the advantages we enjoy by deluſive purſuits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nations are apt to grow arrogant and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they become rich and powerful; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly to engage in deſtructive wars, which ſerve to exhauſt the treaſures, and waſte the ſtrength of the country, to contaminate the morals of the people, and, by a certain proceſs, to corrupt their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and undermine their liberties. They will ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice the lives and property of the inhabitants to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pride and reſentment; and, inſtead of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reconcile differences with other nations by fair negociation, will bring the heavieſt calamities on the country, by appealing to the ſword for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion on the moſt trifling occaſions.</p>
            <p>Another danger to which we are expoſed by proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity is, that, as we increaſe in wealth, we ſhall progreſs in luxury; that diſtinctions in ſociety will be marked by ſtronger lines, as we depart from that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029830_0022_0FE277C11DB3F160"/>mediocrity of condition, which, as yet, very much diſtinguiſhes the ſituation of the inhabitants of this country; and that, as inequality of condition gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally increaſes, we ſhall gradually loſe our republican ſentiments and manners, and with them our repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican form of government. God forbid this ſhould ever be the caſe! But certainly there is a natural tendency toward it, which it requires ſome care both in the Government and in the people to guard againſt.</p>
            <p>The body of the people, eſpecially in the middle and lower walks of life, muſt cheriſh the republican virtues. They muſt be diſtinguiſhed by induſtry, frugality, and temperance; ſo as to maintain their individual freedom and independence, and prevent the wealth, and with it the power of the community, from ſettling into the hands of a few.</p>
            <p>And the Government would do well to ſet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an example of republican plainneſs and frugality. Were perſons in high office in government to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance by their example the introduction of luxury, extravagance, and diſſipation, it might have conſiderable influence on the manners of ſociety at large. They may further ſubſerve eſſentially the public good by purſuing regular and uniform mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the adminiſtration of government; by a fixt and permanent policy; and by holding up as few objects of ſpeculation as poſſible, which ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the exertions of patient induſtry, by enabling
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029830_0023_0FE277C2B1783710"/>enterprizing individuals, and often the leaſt uſeful members of the community, to acquire large fortunes without induſtry, and without purſuing any regular buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Preſident's caution againſt deluſive purſuits, which endanger the advantages we now enjoy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of certain commercial regulations propoſed in Congreſs for the purpoſe of promoting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſt of the country. Upon thorough examination of their nature and tendency it appeared that they muſt, in the iſſue, have operated extremely to our diſadvantage. This being the caſe, the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them with the expectation of their promoting our advantage muſt have proved a very deluſive purſuit.</p>
            <p>It reminds us of the vigorous effort afterward made, by taking advantage of the general indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the depredations made on our commerce by the Britiſh in the Weſt-Indies, to ſtir up the people and the government to acts of hoſtility in return. Beſides the numberleſs incidental calamities of war, the expoſure of the lives and property of the citizens, ſuch a meaſure muſt have brought on us, it muſt have been the occaſion of increaſing beyond all calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion our public debt, and in equal proportion aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our public burdens.</p>
            <p>A more deluſive purſuit can ſcarcely be imagined, than that of plunging a nation in war to obtain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029830_0024_0FE277C44710F9A8"/>for injuries, which, if obtained, would pay but an inconſiderable part of the probable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the war. Eſpecially where any hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of an amicable adjuſtment of difficulties by negociation.</p>
            <p>It leads us again to think of the clamours, daily made againſt our government by perſons, who would make the people believe it too ariſtocratic in its form and oppreſſive in its operation.</p>
            <p>Under our preſent government, where each man is fairly reprefented, where all, except in a very few caſes of incapacity, are alike candidates for office, and every public officer is ſubject to the law, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his conduct in office, there is as much freedom and equality as can exiſt with ſocial order. Every attempt to leſſen the confidence of the people in their public ſervants, to ſpread diſcontent and jealouſy, to foment a ſpirit of faction, to excite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection or oppoſition to the meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all miſrepreſentations of the deſigns and meaſures of men in office, have a certain tendency to undermine and deſtroy, inſtead of increaſing, the freedom of the people. This the leaders of faction know. But they have popular themes of declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which to deceive the people; and they have it in their power, by diſguiſing well their real views, to delude into their meaſures many honeſt and firm friends to <hi>liberty with order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:029830_0025_0FE277C5D711BF18"/>
Equally unfriendly to the continuance of liberty and equal rights are the popular ſocieties eſtabliſhed in this country as checks on our government. Whatever may be their pretences to democratic principles, they conſtitute a dangerous ariſtocracy. They are inconſiſtent with any permanent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they tend to keep a country in a ſtate of perpetual revolution. In the hiſtory of France for three years paſt we have melancholy evidence, that they put it in the power of a few popular and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious individuals to controul the operations of the repreſentatives of the people, and in effect to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the whole power of the government.</p>
            <p>A ſpirit of jealouſy is the ſoul of a republican government. By watching faithfully the meaſures of government, the people have it in their power to keep in office thoſe men who ſerve them with ſidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and purſue meaſures promotive of the general good, and to diſplace thoſe who do not.</p>
            <p>But this is a ſervice they can only perform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is not capable of being delegated to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. They can neither with propriety nor ſafety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt it in the hands of men they do not know; men who have nothing to recommend them to public confidence, but their own high pretenſions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted patriotiſm and concern for the liberties of the people—pretenſions, which none but their own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety have acknowleged, and which we do not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029830_0026_0FE277D1E1B3D2A8"/>know that they have ever ſupported by actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions for the public good.</p>
            <p>While, as friends to order, we reprobate all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of men for the purpoſe of oppoſing, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing, or controuling the operations of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or influencing elections; as friends to liberty, we ſhould cheriſh a ſpirit of jealouſy, and earneſtly wiſh that all might be vigilant in guarding their rights, and in preventing the corruption of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and checking its tendency toward deſpotiſm.</p>
            <p>The prayer of David reſpecting thoſe, who were combined againſt him and oppoſed his wiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſeems peculiarly applicable to the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt our Federal Government. <hi>Slay them not, leſt my people forget; ſcatter them by thy power, and bring them down.</hi> It is not to be wiſhed that oppoſition ſhould be wholly extinguiſhed. It would be an unfavourable ſymptom. It would denote a political lethargy. But it is deſirable that it ſhould be prevented from riſing to exceſs, and, by powerful combinations of men, ſhaking the fabric of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A little fermentation gives a proper anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vigour to the body politic; but, carried to exceſs, it produces convulſions, which threaten diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>Again. We are not to expect the continuance of our preſent advantages, unleſs we <q>merit it by not
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029830_0027_0FE277D3F4461098"/>abuſing them, by our gratitude for them, and by a correſponding conduct as citizens, and as men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall be guilty of abuſing our advantages, if, as a nation, or as individuals, we become vain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and inſenſible of our obligations; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and licentious in our manners, regardleſs of the principles of piety and morality, and inattentive to religious obligation and ſocial duties. And we ſhall deſerve to loſe our excellent government and the freedom it ſecures, if we ever become, on the one hand, ſo inattentive to our rights, as to allow the government to become oppreſſive; or ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing men, on the other hand, to amuſe us with the idea of more perfect freedom, ſo as to undermine the principles of our excellent conſtitution, and by their inſidious manoeuvres to excite diſcontent, and produce a revolution.</p>
            <p>While our primary and principal view, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving with fidelity our national advantages, and making <q>our conduct as citizens and as men, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to them,</q> is to ſecure and perpetuate thereby our individual intereſt and the common good of our country; it is natural and juſt for us to make it a ſecondary conſideration, at a time when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of Europe oblige ſo many to quit their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countries and ſeek a ſecure and peaceful retreat abroad, <q>to render this country a ſafe and propitious aſylum to the unfortunate of other countries:</q>

            <p>While we again pray, <q>that true and uſeful knowlege may be extended among us, and that habits of ſobriety, order, morality and piety may be diffuſed and eſtabliſhed,</q> let us accompany our prayers with the moſt zealous and faithful exertions to promote theſe deſirable ends.</p>
            <p>As long as the inhabitants of this country ſhall be attentive to the ſubject of education, extending pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic advantages, as is now done in this and ſome of the other ſtates in the union, to the children of every claſs of citizens; and as long as we ſhall be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the general prevalence of the habits of <hi>ſobriety, order, morality and piety,</hi> there can be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our loſing the bleſſings of freedom and good government. But, certain it is, theſe bleſſings will be no longer ours, when thoſe habits ſhall be loſt, and the general extenſion of the means of education ſhall be neglected. We ſhall always have a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuited to our character. Freedom and order can be ſupported only in an enlightened and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous community. Ignorance and vice require the ſeverer diſcipline of arbitrary power. And it is their natural tendency to introduce it.</p>
            <p>When we extend our view to other countries, in many of them we meet with ſtriking evidences of the juſtice of this laſt remark. We find that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029830_0029_0FE277D715A3EEA8"/>and ſuperſtition, and a prevalence of bad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are the ſupport of deſpotic power.</p>
            <p>Our ſatisfaction in contemplating the flouriſhing condition and bright proſpects of the United States is checked, when we contraſt with it the calamities of other nations, which are either oppreſſed by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power, involved in the miſeries of deſtructive war, or ſtruggling with faction at home and conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with foes abroad in the cauſe of liberty.</p>
            <p>Enjoying ourſelves the ſweets of peace, freedom, ſocial order, and proſperity, and ſympathizing in the ſufferings of thoſe to whom theſe bleſſings are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, let it be our fervent and devout prayer to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, <q>that all the bleſſings we poſſeſs or aſk for ourſelves, may be imparted to the whole family of mankind.</q>
