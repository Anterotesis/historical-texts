            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TRUTH</hi> is a Pearl of intrinſic Value. Every Breaſt admitting it becomes its welcome Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It refuſes not to dwell with Beggars, Kings, or any Claſs of Men, who receive it; and may accompany a Malefactor, a joyful Companion to the Gallows; and from ſurrounding Spectators of his Infamy and Death, raiſe him to meet the Plaudit of the general Aſſembly, and a welcome Life eternal. It may be compared to a chaſte Virgin, of heavenly Birth, and immortal Charms, upon whoſe Forehead is deep engraved, <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed againſt all unrighteouſneſs of Men,</hi> yet ſtill wears an inviting Aſpect to all Sorts of Men, while pointing out how that Wrath has been ſatisfied for Men of every Character. She patiently bears Inſults and Reproaches, but ſtill is jealous of her own Honour, and that of her Family, and cannot admit the intruding Hands of Ruffians. Her juſt Reſentment riſes againſt it, denouncing the Vengeance of Heaven. She ſcorns all cringing and fawning. In ſincere Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſhe levels ſharp-pointed Arrows at the Conſcience, to wound deeply, but not without the kind Purpoſe of conveying a ſalutary Balſam.</p>
            <p>Whether the Lineaments of her Features, attempted in the following Pages, be copied after thoſe already drawn by the Finger of God in the ſacred Pages, is not left to the Deciſion of unconcerned Spectators, who do not find themſelves deeply intereſted, nor thoſe who ſuppoſe Gain is Godlineſs—nor thoſe who contend for Victory, but is ſubmitted to the Judgement of thoſe to whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the Truth commends itſelf in the Sight of God. And if any Thing be found not conformable to the Faith once delivered to the Saints, let it be rejected, and meet with deſerved Contempt.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A conciſe View of the Doctrine—Men generally uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain where to look for Truth—falſe Direction given the Mind by its Wiſh—by Parents—Teachers—the Public—the Great—ancient Fathers, &amp;c.—An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Standard of Truth—Unity and Force of Scripture—its Effects—its open Way of Speaking, and what Uſe made of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>UNIVERSAL Salvation is a doctrine which would make every heart leap for joy that could fully believe it; and there is no man living without a natural reliſh for that perfect ſecurity about the next world, which a belief of it would inſpire. If it were poſſible to manufacture truth and evidence, would not every perſon be employed in making a doctrine true, which to all intents involves his own perſonal happineſs beyond the grave? This doctrine is held to be cloſely connected with that grand arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the chriſtian faith, the imputed righteouſneſs. It gives trouble to many to find all their claims upon their Maker, in preference to other men, boldly ſet at nought by the advocates of this doctrine; and to ſee themſelves placed in the ſame point of light with dying criminals, and to find that no righteouſneſs is made account of but that of one perſon only, Jeſus Chriſt. And all the ſtriking things they ſay, about the grandeur of his character, loſe their luſtre with them, becauſe they think them ſaid to ſuperſede their own worth.</p>
               <p>Far be it from us to object to the compleat and entire ſufficiency of that righteouſneſs, for all thoſe whom it reſpected; and may they be covered with ſhame who object to it! And if ſuch was the high will of Him who can do what he will with his own
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019452_0005_0FABA486E87ECA70"/>
that this righteouſneſs ſhould reſpect every one of the human race, then let no man move his tongue againſt this doctrine. However, when this is round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, and conſequently that all will be ſaved, however deſirable it would be to join, the mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils, as from a dangerous leap, and whiſpers that this is extending beyond the limits which God has ſet, and doing violence to the divine teſtimony. And it is difficult to conceive, that the advocates for this doctrine are at all times free from a faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind. Whether this ſhrinking from what the mind would fain graſp ſhould be attributed to deceit may ſoon appear.</p>
               <p>It is well known that many men are in ſuch doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and confuſion about what is truth, that they know not where to look for an infallible conductor, to guide them in determining about any point of doctrine advanced. It is not aſide from the preſent deſign to point out both falſe guides, which often miſlead, and an infallible ſtandard of truth alſo, which may be firmly relied on in man's laſt extremity.— A man's faith often riſes not from real evidence but deceitful influence, both in things of this life, and another. A belief of his future proſperity in this world, and of a long life, frequently turns out in fact to be a falſe belief. Something foreign from genuine evidence influenced to it. The wiſh of his heart was chiefly concerned. The ſame leads many to believe and proclaim their own integrity, when their neighbours cannot believe it. It leads oppoſite contending parties to believe they are right in many caſes, whereas a by-ſtander may ſee that ſelf-intereſt ſways their belief. So the wiſh and inclination may be deeply concerned in leading a man to believe thoſe doctrines of religion, which will make his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation eaſy in ſociety here, and flatter him with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proſpect of happineſs hereafter. A belief riſing from the wiſh can make nothing true; and as it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019452_0006_0FABA487A0855528"/>
often proves falſe in this world, ſo it may in the next, into which we cannot at preſent look.</p>
               <p>As a man receives a turn to error from his own heart, ſo he often does from his connexions in ſociety.</p>
               <p>The tye between parents and children is great; and the little ones early look to them as guides al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infallible in all matters; and their belief and practice is ſhaped after them. They grow up with their parents manners, and with their parents reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The innumerable contradicting ſects of this preſent generation had their birth from the ſame ſects of the laſt, who formed their children in a belief of what they themſelves believed; and the children drew in their ſentiments as they drew milk from the breaſt, without a ſtronger argument than this, it is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their parents ſay ſo. This argument has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal ſway among Pagans, Mahometans, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Proteſtants; and its influence has run through all ages. The Chriſtians deliverance from it is pointed out 1 Pet. i. 18, 19. 'Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, ſilver and gold— from your vain converſation, received by tradition from your fathers.'</p>
               <p>Public teachers often miſlead men in their belief. This will readily be admitted as to Pagan and Popiſh prieſts; but when one looks nearer home, the eye is beclouded. Theſe teachers grow out of every ſect as their proper ſoil, and probably no ſect will be deſtitute as long as they hold up ſufficient rewards. Thoſe who have money to hire ſeldom want for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. Such veneration for them as men of God, is often ſo impreſſed in childhood, as never to be ſhaken off by many even in the lateſt period of life. How well placed the truſt every where put in them is, might be ſtrikingly manifeſted by a hiſtory of them in all parts of the globe, not only among Pagans, but even thoſe called Chriſtians. Nay, one need not look far to ſee how many oppoſite winds of doctrine
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019452_0007_0FABA4885E093D50"/>
iſſue from their mouths; and in how many oppoſite paths they ſeverally conduct their admirers.</p>
               <p>The opinion of the public where one happens to live, often miſleads men. They naturally fall in with that which is connected with the eſteem of their neighbours; and beſides, the opinion of many ſeems to give a ſanction to one's own opinion, and make it appear ſomehow ſacred. This brings to mind the proverb. <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei.</hi> The voice of the people is the voice of God <note n="*" place="bottom">If this proverb be true, the God of whom it is ſpoken changes as much as the Camelion, and aſſumes as many ſhapes as Proteus.</note>. A man feels ſtrong when multitudes are of his ſide in opinion, and if he departs from them he is apt to feel weak, and to be daſhed out of countenance. It is no hard thing to prove the multitude generally upon the ſide of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. A man travelling round the globe, will find public opinion changing, more than the climates he paſſes through. The inſpired language is, 'Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.—Though hand join hand, the wicked ſhall not go unpuniſhed.'</p>
               <p>Some confide in ancient fathers, who lived near the apoſtles, and are miſled that way. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the goſpel began even in their days, and grew continually after, till that man of ſin was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, the ſon of perdition, whoſe coming was after the working of ſatan: 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—13. This prophecy has been verified by the event. Theſe fathers were more and more employed in modelling the goſpel, to ſhape with the religion of the nations; adding Pagan maxims, traditions, &amp;c. In ſhort, they carried their point, and got Chriſtianity grafted upon Paganiſm, and it partook of its root and ſap, and bore its fruit; as it has ever ſince remained, even unto this day. Theſe fathers were oppoſed to each other, and each one was orthodox to himſelf and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox to his oppoſer. Who ſhall tell us which of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019452_0008_0FABA489315E7D20"/>
them was right? parents, teachers, or the public, or who? As to getting any aſſurance from them of what is indeed truth, we may as well let their volumes lie piled together in duſt, as expect to find it by earneſtly turning them over in peruſal.</p>
               <p>Some lay ſtreſs upon, and are miſled by great men. But ſhould princes, ſtateſmen, generals, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and divines, ſo called, be conſulted about truth, there is no more agreement among them than among the unlearned and ignorant; a proof beyond contradiction, that though they may be ſkilful guides in matters of this life, there is not the leaſt depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them in the concerns of another. And thus it is written, 'I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent.' 1 Cor. i. 19.</p>
               <p>By ſuch fallacious guides are men led in all parts of the world; and a perſon looking beyond his own ſect pronounces all the reſt infatuated. But when he views his own ſect concerned, the argument returns with its whole force; and if ſtripped of the opinion of his own parent, teacher, party, &amp;c. he feels as if robbed of every dependance in religion; which ſhews him to be of the ſame ſtamp, and equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated with all the reſt. It may then be ſaid, theſe dependancies are deceitful, and they may be all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed together, proclaiming their own fallacy in the ear of conſcience. It may be added, that ſome men, ſenſible of the general infatuation, have diſſented from their neighbours, and raiſed a cry for human reaſon; but as they differ, and are oppoſed in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it may be concluded that they are no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by deceit than the reſt.

Do any wiſh to hold conference with their departed relatives; or to conſult with Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, upon doubtful matters? Or to hear the voice of God from heaven? They may imagine this would give a quick deciſion to every doubtful point<note n="†" place="bottom">When ſuch intercourſe was held, men had doubts, and it was painful, as both the hiſtory of Iſrael and the hiſtory of Jeſus on the earth ſhew.</note>. But we are not deſtitute of them. Their ſound hath gone into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world, and have come nigh to us in their journey; ſo that one may conſult Jeſus, and his Apoſtles, with freedom; and enquire of the ſupreme God, ſpeaking by them, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Let it not be vainly imagined, that there is a deficiency in the oracles of God. Their compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is thus expreſſed, 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. 'All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for doctrine, &amp;c. that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works.' Could full credit be given to theſe words, one would not need further atteſtation to prove them compleat. They were intended as a compleat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of God's mind to man. He framed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men in all their variety, and well knows in what words his meaning will be beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and what manner of addreſs is beſt ſuited to anſwer his purpoſe. To ſay they are not a compleat addreſs to the conſcience of all ſorts of men muſt be a high reflection upon their author. With what darkneſs, and inconſiſtency, do little emmets of a day, venture to charge the words of the living God. In attempting to explain his words, they accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them to their own luſts, or ſome pre-conceived opinion; they put their confuſed, inconſiſtent ideas as part of divine truth; and then charge all their own darkneſs to the ſcriptures, wiping themſelves clean. They ſpeak not without a ſignificant mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019452_0010_0FABA48A9DF937C0"/>
nor ſo abſtruſely as to be underſtood by the learned only; for wayfaring men, though fools, may underſtand them, without the aid of Jewiſh or Chriſtian doctors. This was fact at firſt, that fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came at the ſimple meaning, which haughty doctors overlooked and deſpiſed, and it may be fact ſtill. God ſpeaks not here words of uncertain ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, which may mean a thing or its oppoſite, as is reported of Pagan oracles, and is true of many religious doctors. It is ſaid, 1 Cor. xiv. 7, 8.— 'Even things without life giving ſound, except they give a diſtinction in the ſounds, how ſhall it be known what is piped or harped? For if the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the battle.<note n="‡" place="bottom">If ſcripture be compared to a pipe or harp, are its founds not diſtinguiſhed? or if to a trumpet doth it give an uncertain ſound?</note> The Apoſtle in this chapter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers five words ſpoken plain to the underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten thouſand otherwiſe. This neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that ſcripture itſelf ſpeaks plain to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. To ſuppoſe one part of the ſcriptures is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or weakened by what is ſaid in another, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a high charge againſt their author. Inſtead of this one part ſupports and ſtrengthens another, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an harmonious conſiſtency. And if any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit be given to their teſtimony about themſelves, they are able without human aid to make wiſe to ſalvation, 2 Tim. iii. 15. This is the utmoſt that can be craved.<note n="§" place="bottom">Some apprehend danger of periſhing for lack of viſion, if they have no clergyman to preach among them. To ſuch the preaching of the Apoſtles recorded in the Bible is an inſipid tale. But by this, fooliſh as it may ſeem, God ſaves them that believe.</note> 'They are able to build up and give an inheritance among the ſanctified.' Acts xx. 32. 'They, like the rain ſent down which waters the earth and cauſes it to bring forth for man's ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, return not void, but accompliſh all that God pleaſes.' Iſa. lv. 10, 11.</p>

But when men had this opportunity, their complaint was the ſame that it is now about the ſcriptures; 'How long doſt thou make us to doubt; tell us plainly.' John x. 24. And if Jeſus was now to be ſpoken with, what would aſking further information imply, but that there was a fault in thoſe inſtructions which he had already determined to be fully compleat? And would it not have the appearance of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Should a nobleman expreſs his thoughts to his ſervants, knowing them ſufficiently plain for their underſtandings, and leave them in writing for their peruſal, what would running to him for further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions imply, but that thoſe already given were inſufficient, and he who gave them to blame.</p>
               <p>That there is a perfect agreement of the ſcripture teſtimony in all its parts, is ſtrikingly manifeſt, by the genuine effect of it, upon the real believers of it at firſt, which correſponded like the impreſſion to the ſeal. See Acts iv. 32. 'And the multitude of them who believed were of one heart, and of one ſoul.' Acts ii. 1. 'They were all with one accord in one place.' 46. v. 'And they continuing daily with one accord in the temple.' v. 12. 'And they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.'<note n="‖" place="bottom">We are led to think of a muſical inſtrument, whoſe ſtrings are in perfect concord.</note> 1 Cor. i. 10. 'Now I beſeech you brethren, that ye be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joined together, in the ſame mind and the ſame judgement.' Rom. xv. 6. 'That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, &amp;c.' <note n="¶" place="bottom">The meaning of hereſy was then a breach of this oneneſs of ſentiment, but now it is what men pleaſe to call it.</note> Any thing that roſe oppoſite to this was cruſhed in the birth. A church is compared to the human body, which made up of ſeveral members is yet one, and each member has a fellow feeling with the reſt. See 1 Cor. xii. Of this union moſt who are called
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019452_0012_0FABA48C2387DEF8"/>
churches now have not a diſtant idea. And ſtudents in divinity may be ever learning and never be able to come to the knowledge of this truth. But leaving them at their ſtudies, it may be boldly affirmed, that the union of the firſt churches in the truth, and love for its ſake, was ſuch, that the force of men and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils combined could not break it; and many loved not their lives to the death. The certain cauſe of this unity of belief was the unity of the words of Jeſus and his Apoſtles, which produced this unity among believers as its correſponding effect. The ſame words are now recorded in the ſcriptures, a certain proof this, that there is a perfect unity of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, in thoſe ſcriptures which men raſhly charge with inconſiſtency and contradiction.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony of ſcripture appeared forcible alſo by its effect. The goſpel came to them not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance; cauſing joy in much affliction, and turned men from idols to ſerve the living God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, 1 Theſſ. i. See alſo 2 Cor. x. 4, 5. 'The weapons of our warfare are mighty, through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth itſelf againſt the knowledge of God; and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.' Here we naturally think of artillery raiſed againſt a ſtrong fortreſs, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling it all to the ground, effecting a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat conqueſt. Again read Heb. iv. 12. 'The word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing to the dividing aſunder of ſoul, and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, &amp;c.' What words can more pungently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs its ſharp penetrating force. The effect upon Paul, the murderers of Jeſus, the Epheſians, and indeed all, appeared fully to anſwer theſe deſcriptions of its force. Jeſus ſaith, John v. 25. 'The hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019452_0013_0FABA48CDB955338"/>
voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.' Its force upon living men is here repreſented the ſame that it will be hereafter upon the ſleeping duſt. However feeble the ſcriptures now appear, as their Lord once did, yet hereafter they will be known to be the ſame powerful voice which ſaid at firſt, Let there be light, and at laſt will command life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe in their graves; and that their effect upon every believer of them diſcovered the ſame power, Eph. i. 19, 20, and ii. 5. Theſe ſcriptures are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as judging men at the laſt day. John xii. 48, 'Then thoſe who have hurt the two witneſſes, the old and new teſtament, muſt be killed after this manner, by fire iſſuing out of their mouth.' At their cloſe we have the judgement of thoſe that add to, or take from their teſtimony. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. Where is the complaint now that there is no where to look for truth?</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BEFORE we proceed to the deciſive teſtimony of ſcripture in this matter, a fact or two may be mentioned, which appears in oppoſition to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. That the contrary doctrine is generally profeſſed at this day is fact as their formulas ſhew; and hiſtory ſhews it to have been ſo from early ages. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, it may be obſerved, that had the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles indeed held the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, it appears impoſſible that the contrary doctrine ſhould have ſuch a ſpread in the world; becauſe this doctrine is ſo agreeable to the taſte of all men, that no period can be found between the Apoſtles days and the preſent, when they would have parted with it. Had any perſon attempted to lead them to it, all profeſſors would have riſen up againſt him, as attempting to rob them of the richeſt jewel in their cabinet, their higheſt ſecurity for another world. Let it alſo be obſerved, that Chriſtianity was early made a tool of ſtate by Conſtantine, which manifeſts that profeſſors then held to a future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019452_0017_0FABA49FA90023B8"/>
for rulers judge it neceſſary to hold up terrors of religion beyond this life, to enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from their ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But not to enlarge here, the proper appeal is to the holy ſcriptures, the living oracles of God; and it muſt appear to every perſon not under the entire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the firſt reaſoner againſt, and ſoftner of the rigour of the divine threatning, who early ſaid, 'Ye ſhall not ſurely die;' that the ſcriptures do ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this point, that ſome men will ſuffer puniſhment beyond the grave, as fully as words can expreſs. This is ſtrongly implied and expreſſed various ways.</p>
               <p>The appellations given to all that ſhall be ſaved collectively ſhew that they are only a part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The word (EKKLESIA) Church, ſignifies a body of men called out from amongſt others; the word (EKLEKTOI) Elect, ſignifies men choſen out from among others. And the whole ſcripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhews them to be perſons called, and choſen out of the world, as theſe names import. Noah's family in the old world, and Lot's in Sodom, were types of them. The Patriarchs, the Jews, and the Chriſtians, were kept diſtinct as being called out of the world. The diſtinction of the Jews from the reſt of mankind is pointed out, Lev. xx. 26. 'Ye ſhall be holy unto me, for I the Lord am holy, and have <hi>ſevered</hi> you from other people, that ye ſhould be mine.' Deut. vii. 6. 'The Lord thy God hath choſen thee, to be a ſpecial people unto himſelf, above all people upon the face of the earth.' They were allowed no connexion in religion with other nations. If they mingled with them, learned their works, intermarried, went after their gods, or truſted in their princes, they were viewed as deeply guilty. The leaders informed Ezra, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites had not ſeparated themſelves from the nations, but the holy ſeed had mingled themſelves with other people in marriage: Upon which he rent his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, plucked off his hair, and ſat down aſtoniſhed;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019452_0018_0FABA4A05EF7C3D0"/>
and then fell upon his knees, making deep confeſſion of guilt: <note n="*" place="bottom">Could we ſuppoſe one Jewiſh Univerſaliſt preſent, what would he think of ſuch conduct.</note> See 9th chapter. Nehemiah alſo ſaw Jews which had married wives of other nations, and he contended with them, and curſed them, and plucked off their hair, &amp;c. Neh. xiii. 23—25. and it is called a great evil, 27 v. Their truſting in other nations inſtead of God their protector is ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Their going to Egypt to ſtrengthen themſelves in the ſtrength of Pharaoh, and truſting in the ſhadow of Egypt, is declared to be to their ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, Iſa. xxx. 3. Their affinity both with Egypt and Aſſyria is mentioned, Jer. ii. 18. and the plain language of it declared to be this, viz. 'I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go.' 25 v. The ſame is expoſed as abominable whoredom, Ezek. xvi. So that to be otherwiſe than entirely diſtinct from all other nations was highly provoking to God.</p>
               <p>The Jews to this day retain traces of the ancient diſtinction which God eſtabliſhed between them and the nations, and in them now we ſee a faint picture of what took place when that nation was the church of God.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction did not teach them the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, but beſpoke the oppoſite. They were ever taught what is expreſſed, Eph. ii. 12. 'That the nations were aliens from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.' The nations were viewed by them as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of God's vengeance, Pſal. lxxix. 6. 'Pour out thy fury on (GOIM) the nations <note n="†" place="bottom">The word heathen is commonly ſuppoſed to mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from nations; but they are the ſame in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal language. The ſame might be obſerved of the word Gentiles. It is well known how poliſhed nations glory over ſavages, calling them heathen.</note> that have not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019452_0019_0FABA4A121D39778"/>
known thee,' compared with Jer. x. 25. See alſo Pſal. lix. 8. and cxlix. 7. Mic. v. 15, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>When the goſpel church ſucceeded in place of the Jewiſh, it pleaſed God to collect his people out from the reſt of that abandoned nation, to break down the partition, which till that time ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jews and the nations, Eph. ii. 14. and to take out of the nations a people for his name. But they are no ſooner gathered both from the Jews and Gentiles, than a line of diſtinction ariſes between them and all the reſt of mankind, fully as great as that which had been before between Jews and the reſt of mankind. And they are called collectively a nation, Mat. xxi. 43. 'The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.' So Peter ſays to ſtrangers of various countries collectively, 'Ye are a holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.' 1 Pet. i. 1. and ii. 9. God was the King of this nation, and however diſperſed, they were united under his juriſdiction. As to the reſt in a lump, they were ſubject to Satan, the prince of the power of the air, the god of this world. Eph. ii. 2. and 2 Cor. iv. 4. Their entire diſtinction appears in their firm union together, and ſuffering for the truth unto the death, being undivided in their belief, or love for the truth's ſake; while they kept at the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from communion with others, and checked every thing which looked that way. They ſtood faſt in one ſpirit, ſtriving together for the faith of the goſpel, in nothing terrified by adverſaries which was an evident token of perdition to others, and of ſalvation to themſelves, Phil. i. 27, 28. On the other ſide ſtood men of all nations, hating them mortally, both for the truth they held and that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love it raiſed in them. Hence followed ſevere ſufferings unto death among the diſciples. A few paſſages may be thrown together for further illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Acts ii. 40. 'Save yourſelves from this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation.' Acts xix. 9. 'He departed ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019452_0020_0FABA4A1E6A7B8B0"/>
the diſciples.' 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. 'Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, and touch not the unclean things, and I will receive you and be a father, &amp;c.' 1 Cor. x. 20. 'The things which (ETHNEE) the nations ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to devils not to God; and I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with devils.' 2 Tim. iii. 5. 'From ſuch turn away.' Rev. xviii. 4. 'Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.' Such commands were exemplified by ſtriking fact in thoſe days, which ſhewed them (though diſperſed) to be one body fully as diſtinct from the world as the Jews had been. So that in the one Chriſtian nation as well as the Jewiſh thoſe words were verified, Numb. xxiii. 9. 'Lo the people ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be reckoned among the nations.' <note n="‡" place="bottom">This diſtinction has been long ſince thrown down, which opened the flood-gates to all manner of error about the Chriſtian doctrine and practice, as might be eaſily ſhewn.</note> Now why does God enjoin ſuch a diſtinction and ſeparation, if all are objects of mercy? If all men are brethren in Jeſus, why is this breach among brethren in the family of God, upon whom unity and love are ſo ſtrongly enjoined? This ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration beſpeaks ſome men diſtinguiſhed from others as to forgiveneſs, as they are diſtinguiſhed from the firſt ſinners, the devils. Agreeable to this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the diſciples only are addreſſed as partakers of ſalvation: See Gal. i. 4. 'Who gave himſelf for our ſins.' 1 Pet. ii. 24. 'Who bare our ſins in his own body.' 1 Theſſ. v. 9. 'For God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.' <note n="§" place="bottom">Many religious doctors, either from ignorance or deſign, burying out of ſight the above diſtinction, without fear apply ſuch expreſſions to whole pariſhes, and thereby draw much reſpect, and unite large congregations, in eſteem for them as godly men, for all love to be complimented about having a ſhare in good things beyond the grave, and return the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in eſteem. Both the Jews and Chriſtians were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hated for it. Yea, and all that will maintain it ſhall fall under the ſame hatred, agreeable to 2 Tim. iii. 12.</note> Such language is confined
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019452_0021_0FABA4A4A558E9C0"/>
only to the ſaints in ſeparation from the world, as any one doubtful may ſee by looking to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the epiſtles and elſewhere. The practice of Univerſaliſts may ſpeak whether they leave out this diſtinction, and together with it the obſervance of all things whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt commanded, or not.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. The above ſeparation is brought to a cloſer point of view in the commanded diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a church; ſee Mat. xviii. 15—19. Here in caſe of treſpaſs, the offended is ordered to ſpeak to the offender alone; if repentance does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to take one or two more, and if ſtill unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to tell it to the church; and if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican—'Verily, what ye bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven, &amp;c.' In caſe of an eſtabliſhed character in wickedneſs it is thus ordered 1 Cor. v. 11. 'Not to keep company if any man, called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, &amp;c. with ſuch a one no not to eat.' And 13 v. It is ordered to put away from their body a wicked perſon, whom he before declared ſhould be delivered to Satan, for the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit might be ſaved, &amp;c. Here the line of diſtinction comes near, and ſevers members from their body, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Theſe commands are firmly believed by moſt now called Chriſtians of no great force, as their practice ſhews. But how ſacred are all the inſpired words? If we leſſen their force, why <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And in this ſolemn act of a church, gathered in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the purpoſe, an idea of the future judgement of God is ſtrongly impreſſed, unleſs the end be reached, viz. the deſtruction of fleſhly luſts, that the ſpirit
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019452_0022_0FABA4A5202CB1C0"/>
may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus. Had the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation been held at that time there was nothing fearful held up to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's conſcience beyond the grave; and no force in the whole tranſaction as done on earth, or ratified in heaven; and it tended not to the ſpirits being ſaved, for by this doctrine the man would be ſaved, whether it had any effect or not; and it was a ridiculous farce in religion. Should a company of Univerſaliſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to theſe indiſpenſible commands, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency would their appear in their doctrine and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? And might not each of them ſay, when he had finiſhed the ſolemn act, as in Prov. xxvi. 19. 'Am not I in ſport?' ſpoken of him who deceiveth his neighbour. There was ſomething ſtriking about the church of God, both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian form, which, like the cloud between the Iſraelites and Egyptians, afforded cheering light to ſome, but darkneſs and horror to others. The church is the light of the world, and ſome were drawn by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving light, but others were diſmayed, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them like a dark cloud of threatning aſpect. See Pſ. xlviii. 1—7. After a deſcription of her glory, having God in the midſt of her, 'tis added. 'For lo the kings aſſembled, they paſſed by together! They ſaw it and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and haſted away; fear took hold upon them, and pain as of a woman in travail.' Song vi. 10. She is ſaid to 'look forth as the morning, and yet to be terrible as an army with banners; ſhe had nothing ſightly as to worldly appearance, like her Lord!' Yet as they were diſmayed even when they went to take him, John xviii. 6: So there was ſomething of the ſame diſmay among the perſecutors of the diſciples. The perſecutors of Stephen ſaw ſomething about him that ſtruck them with awe, Acts vi. 15. Felix, though a governor, who had Paul's life at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, could not forbear trembling before his priſoner. Had he not collected from Paul's reaſoning and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019452_0023_0FABA4A59CC470E0"/>
a ſtrong idea of a grand diſtinction among men in the next world, it may be preſumed he had not been forced thus to tremble, out of character as it might ſeem. To mention no more, when they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch, it is ſaid, and of the reſt durſt no man join himſelf to them. Thus ſtriking was the appearance of the church of God, and from beholding her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fears of future wrath ſeized her enemies.</p>
               <p>Again, the enmity eſtabliſhed between God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the world confirms the above mentioned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and ſtands oppoſed to the doctrine of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Salvation. Gen. iii. 15. 'I will put enmity between thee, and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed.' This was ſoon manifeſt in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Adam, and afterwards in the families of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs. It may be ſeen in the Egyptian's hot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Iſrael, and in the ſong of triumph on account of their deſtruction, Exod. xv cap. It appeared in Amelek oppoſing the travels of Iſrael, Exod. xvii c. which occaſioned theſe words, 'The Lord hath ſworn that the Lord will have war with Amelek from generation to generation.' King Saul was charged to cut them off without mercy; and for ſparing Agag, &amp;c. the kingdom was rent from him. Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek is a ſtanding type of all the enemies of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We read Jer. xii. 9. 'Mine heritage is unto me as a ſpeckled bird, the birds round about are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her.' The Apoſtle gives a ſummary view, Gal. iv. 28. 'Now we brethern as Iſaac was, are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of promiſe; but as then he that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now;' and adds, 'the ſon of the bond woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free.' This enmity has been drawn out in real life wherever a church of God has appeared, and was ſtrikingly ſeen among the firſt diſciples. The Lord ſays, he is come to ſet fire on earth, to ſend a ſword and diviſion, and to ſet a man

But far be it to ſuppoſe this.</note> pointing to the diviſion his doctrine would make among men, and informs the diſciples, that they ſhall be hated of all men for his ſake. We find ſuch expreſſions as theſe, 'Marvel not if the world hate you—whoſoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.' <note n="*" place="bottom">The Jews by their unſociableneſs in religion got the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Genus hominum inviſum diis.</hi> A kind of men hateful to the gods.

Had the boaſted modern charity been in thoſe days, with her flexibility, we may preſume ſhe would have eſcaped ſuch cenſure.</note> The Apocalypſe ſhew that this enmity will not ceaſe till the end. We may in that hiſtory of the future ſee a pretended ſpouſe of Jeſus, adorned with tinſels of this world, and drunk with the blood of ſaints on one ſide; and upon the other the Lamb's ſpouſe wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through tribulation after her Lord, while the ſouls under the altar cry, how long Lord doſt thou not avenge our blood?</p>
               <p>Now does this enmity ever maintained from the beginning of Geneſis to the laſt of Revelations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token Univerſal Salvation, or agree with modern univerſal charity plead for by the Univerſaliſts and moſt others? Is there a feature in the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion that bears reſemblance?

Iniquity and falſhood are vipers which ſhe cannot foſter in her boſom. The purer her flame the more vehement her oppoſition, to that which oppoſes the truth her heart's delight. The enmity above was agreeable to her nature, and loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, that all men are not brethren in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>The diſtinction of heaven's favourites from the world is confirmed in the ixth of Romans compared with the xith cap. The Apoſtle mentions his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs for his countrymen the Jews, who were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from the olive tree, and under wrath. And leſt any ſhould think the ancient promiſes to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his ſeed were failing by the rejection of his fleſhly ſeed, he ſhews the thought to be groundleſs, becauſe they are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael; i. e. the true Iſrael are not ſtrictly confined to thoſe born after the fleſh. For illuſtration he goes to the root, ſhewing Iſaac was ſelected to partake of the promiſe while Iſhmael was left; and not only ſo, but in Iſaac's family too, even before the twins were born, the divine love made a diſtinction, having reſpect to one but not to the other. For the children being not yet born neither having done no good or evil, that ſtand, &amp;c.—It was ſaid, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated. The Apoſtle is aware that men will think that God is unrighteous, and ſo he ſtates their objection 14th verſe, which he repels with MEE GEENOITO (far be it) and gives an anſwer ſufficient for all thoſe who contend with their maker to hear, viz. He ſaith to Moſes, 'I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will, &amp;c.' Then he introduces Pharaoh as raiſed up to declare God's power and name abroad, and adds 18th verſe. 'Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.' He ſuppoſes another objection formed 19th verſe, 'Thou wilt then ſay unto me, why doth he yet find fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?' The preſumption of the objector he thus repels 20—25 ver. 'Nay but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay unto him who form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel to honour and another to diſhonour? What

if God willing to ſhew his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction. And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, even us, whom he hath called not only EKS IOUDAIOON <hi>(out of)</hi> the Jews, but alſo EKS ETHNOON <hi>(out of)</hi> the Gentiles. The diſtinction then which is begun in this world is by the Apoſtle carried out into the next, and appears there in veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, upon whom God there ſhews his wrath and power united; and on the other ſide veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory, in whom the riches of his glory will be made known. And who the laſt are we are particularly informed, Us whom he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the Jews, and out of the Gentiles, and ſo cannot be all the Jews and all the Gentiles. This paſſage ſtands firm againſt all who object againſt God's diſtinguiſhing his favorites at his pleaſure. They may ſee their own objections ſtated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Apoſtle, which confirm his meaning beyond contradiction, to the confuſion of all who would break his thread of reaſoning here. Agreeable to this, ſee Rom. xi. 7. 'Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, and the reſt were blinded.' 2 Theſ. ii. 11—13. 'God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who believe not the truth—but we are bound to give thanks for you brethren—becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen <note n="†" place="bottom">Some charge the God whoſe character is drawn by the Apoſtle with being a reſpecter of perſons. The intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach he can wipe off. He declares he is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and explains what he means by it, viz. That in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men are accepted (without diſtinction of Jews from Gentiles) who by the word declaring peace by Jeſus, are led to fear him, and work righteouſneſs, Acts x. 34—37; and that there is no rank or ſort of men having preference above another. Col. iii. 22, 25, compared with xi. At the ſame time he declares he has mercy on whom he will, and hardens whom he will. And this Jeſus thanks his Father for, Mat. xi. 25. If man finds fault he is poorly able to carry the conteſt through.</note> you to ſalvation, &amp;c.'</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:019452_0027_0FABA4A98D4406D0"/>What the Apoſtle teſtifies of God's favours being beſtowed according to his pleaſure agrees with what the Lord declared when entering upon his public miniſtry; he as it were opened his commiſſion from the prophet Eſaias, applying theſe words to himſelf: 'The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the goſpel to the poor—de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to the captives—and the acceptable year of the Lord.' Luke iv. 17—20. The whole aſſembly were delighted, and all eyes were faſtened upon him, and they thought of ſome claim to the benefit. But he reminds of one widow only that received it in a great drought, and one leper only in the days of Elijah and Eliſha, and theſe perſons not of Iſrael, while many widows and lepers were neglected in Iſrael. The Jews well underſtood him, pointing out a diſtinction made among men as to the favours of heaven, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the ſequel, Wrath took the place of their delight, they thruſt him out of the city to caſt him down a precipice headlong. A parallel to this we have John vi. 25, to the end, where many who were at firſt well pleaſed upon making known that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of heaven were of God's good pleaſure without any claim, they fled from him till he turns to the twelve, 'Will ye alſo go away.' Theſe paſſages conſpire to throw their joint light together as it were into a focal point, manifeſting with radiancy, that God's high pleaſure diſtinguiſhes ſome men from others as to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The ſame diſtinction is held up in a different view, Rev. xiii. 8. 'All ſhall worſhip him whoſe names are not written in the ſlain Lamb's book of life.' Chap. xx. 15. 'Whoſoever was not written in the book of life was caſt into a lake of fire.' Chap. xxi. 27. And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing
<pb n="29"
                      facs="unknown:019452_0028_0FABA4AA27DD5A50"

that defileth, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life.' No proof is here needed that ſome men's names are written in that book and others are not, and the former ſhall enter heaven and the latter be caſt into a lake of fire. This is according to the mere pleaſure of God, and was done from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture preſents it alſo in another view, and that is, that God gave Jeſus ſome of mankind and not others. John xvii. 2. 'As thou haſt given him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.' Verſe 6. "I have manifeſted thy name to the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world.' They are diſtinguiſhed from the world, who are ſaid 14th verſe, to hate them. Verſe 9. 'I pray for them, I pray not for the world.' See alſo 8, 12, 19, 24, verſes. In Chap. v. 37. 'tis ſaid, 'All that the father giveth me ſhall come to me.' Verſe 40th, 'And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.' John x. 15. 'I will lay down my life for the ſheep.' Verſe 26th, 'But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep.' If theſe do not force men to ſee a diſtinction, what will do it? But it is objected, that the Lord ſays, 'Other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold.' John x. 16. 'Tis true, and adds, 'They ſhall hear my voice,' where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who do not hear his voice.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words, John xvii. 9, may draw particular notice, 'I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me.' There is not a petition in this prayer that looks as if he prayed for all mankind, but it is confined to a number, taken out of the world, and hated by them. But what is more, his expreſs declaration, 'I pray not for the world,' decides the matter. They who can evade the force of it now, could do it if it had been repeated ever ſo many times. In this ſolemn prayer and the diſcourſe that went before it, the Lord expreſſes bowels of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019452_0029_0FABA4B5DCF78700"/>
to the diſciples, and his language is the very image and picture of that heart which was going freely to bleed for them; and if it was to bleed for all mankind, is it poſſible he ſhould ſay, I pray not for the world, but for thoſe whom thou haſt given me? This prayer preceding his agony, is doubtleſs of the ſame ſpirit with the interceſſion he now makes at the Father's right hand. We cannot ſuppoſe that he now takes in that petition which he before rejected, ſo as ſay now I pray for the world. Aaron was a type, and when he entered into the holy place, upon his breaſt plate, and upon his heart, were written the names of thoſe for whom he appeared there. And what names were they? Names of the Egyptians and Amalekites, &amp;c. No. Exod. xxviii. 29, 'Aaron ſhall bear the names of the children of Iſrael in the breaſt-plate of judgement upon his heart when he goeth into the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.' It cannot be ſuppoſed, without violence, that the Egyptians, Amalekites, &amp;c. had any intereſt in what he tranſacted. So Jeſus the anti-type bears only the names of the true Iſrael, whom the Father had given him out of the world. And we cannot, without like violence, ſuppoſe that the world at large have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in what he tranſacts for his people in heaven. So that all the expreſſions which point out his near connexion with his people, and the bleſſings ariſing from it, reſpect only thoſe whom the Father gave him out of the world. Theſe make the church purchaſed with his own blood, and are the body of which he is head, are members of his body, of his fleſh, and his bones, are the temple of the living God, in which he dwells, are the branches united to him the vine, are married to him. Theſe ſimilitudes point out not a connexion between him and all mankind, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only thoſe the Father gave him. God ſaid not to Babylon as he ſaid to Iſrael, I am married to you, The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſaints at Rome being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Jeſus Chriſt, he does not ſay, all Rome, or all

The church of the Theſſalonians are ſaid to be in God the Father and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their perſecuting country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mentioned, 1 Epiſt. ii. 14. are not ſaid to be in God the Father and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Nor were any of the Theſſalonians, except the church, or that ſmall company called out from among them, to whom the goſpel came not in word only but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 Epiſt. i.</p>
               <p>The ſame idea of deſtinction among men is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the direction given by the ſpirit, calling them to preach the goſpel in one place, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go to another. They were forbid to go into Bithynia, Acts xvi. 7, and are called to go into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, 9, 10, verſes, and commanded to ſpeak with boldneſs in another for this reaſon, 'I have much people in this city,' Acts xviii. 9, 10. And we find in all ages, and at this day, the preaching of Jeſus and the Apoſtles is by the providence of God carried to one place and not to another. Grand kingdoms at this preſent time are deſtitute of the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and we muſt conclude, that God has not a people among them.</p>
               <p>We find moreover, that where the goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſelect number only are taken out as the favorites of heaven, as the fact every where ſhews in the new teſtament. When the Apoſtle turned from the Jews to preach to the Gentiles, Acts xiii. 48, it is ſaid, 'As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.' It is a plain violation of text, and it makes a diſtinction to ſay, all theſe Gentiles were ordained to eternal life, or that all believed.</p>
               <p>The goſpel was not only publiſhed where God had a people, but it was believed by them, and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them from the reſt as being the only heirs of ſalvation. The goſpel ever went forth with theſe legible characters upon its front, 'He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.' Faith and ſalvation are connected in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019452_0031_0FABA4C3D0187BC0"/>
as faith and being healed were in the days of Jeſus. The paſſages that connect faith and ſalvation are too numerous to repeat, and are obvious to thoſe who look into the Bible. It may be aſked, what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for connecting faith at all if all men are ſaved? It is loſt labour, and the words are but wind, if unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſaved. If we ſhould invert the expreſſions in many inſtances they would ſpeak agreeable to the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation. Mark xvi. 16, muſt be read thus, he that believeth <hi>not</hi> ſhall be ſaved. And we muſt underſtand a great part of ſcripture to mean the oppoſite to what it expreſſes. Indeed one is led to think of neceſſity for a new edition of the Bible, to make its language plain to common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and turning its negatives into affirmatives; and its affirmatives into negatives.</p>
               <p>A few paſſages only may be mentioned which connect faith with juſtification and ſalvation. The Apoſtle of ſet purpoſe undertakes to ſhew how men are brought into favour with God. He ſhews there is not one righteous, that all the world are guilty, and every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and draws this firm concluſion, Chap. iii. 20. 'Therefore, by the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight.' Man being thus effectually ſhut out from the divine favour by guilt, and ruined forever as to any thing he can do himſelf; a ſupernatural way of acceſs is laid open by the Apoſtle. And it deſerves attention how far, and for whom it is opened 21, 22, verſes, 'But now the righteouſneſs of God without the law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the law and the prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all <hi>them that believe.</hi>' Here the grand door of hope is thrown open for the guilty, and the conveyance of an all-ſufficient righteouſneſs to them who are deſtitute, is declared; but it is as certainly declared to be by faith unto them who believe, as it is declared that ſuch a righteouſneſs is revealed at all. To ſay that the

righteouſneſs of God is manifeſted which is not by faith, but is unto all who do not believe as well as thoſe who do is a perverſion of the ſcripture in a capital point. This is a door of man's opening and not God's. The Apoſtle confirms what he has been ſaying here in the 4th chapter 5th verſe, 'To him who worketh not but believeth in him who juſtifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.' Here again, while works are diſcarded ſalvation comes to the believer, and is confined to him, yea his faith is counted for righteouſneſs as Abraham's faith was verſe 22. If this be God's way of counting, then he that has faith has righteouſneſs, and he that has not faith hath no righteouſneſs, and without righteouſneſs perſonal or imputed no perſon can be juſtified, for heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſs away, than one jot or tittle of the law ſhall fail<note n="‡" place="bottom">Some ſay that thoſe who do not believe before death will believe afterwards, and be ſaved.

As it is preſumed, that no perſon was cured in the wilderneſs but what ſaw the brazen ſerpent, ſo none can be ſaved but thoſe that believe. It is ſaid,

'He is lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.' Believing and not believing are in three paſſages ſet in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to each other, and ſalvation is connected with the former, and damnation with the latter, Mark xvi. 16. John iii. 18, and 36. In the laſt it is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrongly, 'He that believeth not the ſon ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.' Men can if they pleaſe, becauſe ſentence againſt them is not executed ſpeedily, have their hearts fully ſet to bring all the words of their Maker to nought, and make them of leſs force than the words of children, madmen or knaves.</p>
               <p>The ſcriptures connect repentance with ſalvation, and impenitence with damnation. Repentance and remiſſion of ſins were firſt publiſhed in his name, Luke xxiv. 27. Acts ii. 38. Acts xi. 18. When Jeſus told the Jews, who ſuppoſed that they whoſe blood Pilate mingled with their ſacrifices, and they upon whom the tower fell, were greater ſinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuffered theſe things, that they were not greater, and that they ſhould periſh likewiſe except they repented. He does not mean that they ſhould have a tower fall upon them too, or ſuffer a violent death, for he rejects the idea of being greater ſinners on account of ſuffering ſuch things. He muſt mean periſhing under the wrath of God beyond the grave. If there be no puniſhment for men hereafter what can be meant by the ſecond death, Rev. ii. 11. Leaving thoſe who chuſe to look up a meaning in their own imaginations; every ſober man will attend to the meaning in ſcripture, Rev. xxi. 8.

               </argument>
               <p>WHEN Jeſus ſent his Apoſtles forth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the good news, he tells them to ſhake off the duſt of their feet againſt thoſe that did not hear their words; and declares with a verily, 'That it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for them, Mat. x. 15. Are they then equally heirs of ſalvation with thoſe who believe their words? How will it be more tolerable, if neither of them will ſuffer any thing? This agrees with the woes denounced upon Chorazin, Bethſaida and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, xi. Chap. 21—24. When the Jews blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, Paul teſtifying, that Jeſus was Chriſt, he ſhook his raiment, and ſaid, 'Your blood be upon your heads.' Does he mean by this, that they ſhould come to a violent death, as Chriſtians did at that time more than any other men? No. It points to the ſecond death, the ſame which Moſes refers to when prophecying of the great prophet Jeſus being raiſed up, he ſays, 'He that will not hearken to him ſhall be deſtroyed.' Deut. xviii. 15. compared with Acts iii. 22, 23. When the Apoſtle ſpoke weeping, of many profeſſors who were taking their good things in this life, Phil. iii. 18, 19. for their God was their belly, and they minded earthly things, he declared their end was deſtruction. The mind of every ſober man is forcibly conſtrained to think of a deſtruction beyond this life. The Apoſtle, 2 Cor. v. 11. having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that every one muſt appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

While ground of ſtrong confidence was ſuggeſted, through the propitiation, ſtrong fears alſo of the coming wrath were inculcated, and they fled for refuge, to lay hold of the hope ſet before them.

Their religion will not bear the touch ſtone of ſelf-denied obedience after all their boaſting.

               <p>The Lord argues from his own ſufferings, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his final enemies, Luke xxiii. 31.

                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:019452_0037_0FABA4C84923EB88"/>The ſecond coming of Jeſus is ſpoken of as the joy of his people and the terror of his final enemies. While he comes to give reſt to the former he appears in flaming fire, taking vengeance upon the latter, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction, ſee at large, 2 Theſſ. i. 7—11. Sudden deſtruction will come upon them when crying peace and ſafety, Chap. v. 3. 'And thus they will be taken as fiſhes in a net, or birds in a ſnare,' Eccle. ix. 12. 'And it will be as in the days of Noah and Lot, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <note n="*" place="bottom">If one ſays there will no deſtruction of any men, when he comes, he gives his Maker the lye, who ſays it ſhall be as it was then when the flood came and deſtroyed them all.</note> overtook them in the midſt of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.' Luke xvii. 26—30. Thus temporal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were types of future deſtruction, as much as temporal ſalvations were types.</p>
               <p>The Lord fairly delineates (and he well knew) the unſeen world in a parable, Luke xvi. 19—ult. where the beggar from diſtreſs was tranſported to happineſs; but he who had received his good things in his life time, dyed and was buried. And what follows after his death? 'And in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments, and cries for a drop of water to cool his tongue,' which is denyed; and he informed he has already received all his comforts, and of an impaſſable gulph fixed between him and the bleſſed. Now if all men are ſaved, this is not ſo much as a parable or repreſentation, but is a mere farce and fiction.</p>
               <p>The apoſtolic weapons, which produced mighty conqueſts in thoſe days, are ſaid to have in readineſs to revenge all diſobedience when the obedience of ſaints is fulfilled, 2 Cor. x. 6. Let it not be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this is aſcribed to their weapons ſince Jeſus ſays, John xii. 48. 'The word that I have ſpoken ſhall judge him at the laſt day.' See alſo, Rev. xi. 5. Where the two witneſſes, the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are repreſented as deſtroying their enemies by
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019452_0038_0FABA4C8E4CA2AC8"/>
fire, burſting from their mouth. Theſe have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to revenge all diſobedience, but are waiting for for the completion of the obedience of the ſaints. This agrees with the reply to the ſouls under the altar, crying, how long doſt thou not avenge our blood? viz. that they ſhould reſt yet for a little ſeaſon until their fellow ſervants alſo, that ſhould be killed as they were ſhould be fulfilled. When what is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt is accompliſhed, and they have had their courſe through every part of his body, the church, then the arrows will fly ſuddenly from the ſtring, and wrath blaze upon them that know not God, and obey not the goſpel.</p>
               <p>In Luke xiii. 23. one puts this queſtion to Jeſus, 'Lord, are there few that be ſaved?' Does not this imply the queſtion, that has been attended to? May we not expect a deciſive anſwer? Can we ſuppoſe the anſwer of any man living can be more relied on? Shall we dare to aſk whether he knew, or if he did, whether he was willing to deceive about it? The enquirer took it for granted, that ſome would not be ſaved, which ſentiment Jeſus does not repel, nor charge him with having contracted thoughts; but immediately infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon his mind, that many will periſh, 24—28. 'Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.' 'When once the maſter of the houſe hath riſen up and ſhut the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquity, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, &amp;c.' See agreeing with this, Mat. vii. 22, 23. The para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the virgins, Mat. xxv. 10—12. The parable of the tares, and of the net, Mat. xiii. 42, 50. But what need of turning to many paſſages? Jeſus ſpeaks in direct reply to the queſtion, and if all men but one upon earth ſhould ſay contrary, he would have ground ſufficient to tell them they were all liars, and he has
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:019452_0039_0FABA4D92714FD58"/>
the word of one of more weight than them all. One might go on to fill whole pages with mere quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without any remarks, it would rather be tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The ſcriptures already quoted in ſundry ways and divers manners, in doctrines, in diſcipline, in practice, and expreſs declarations, plainly ſhew it will be the unhappy lot of ſome men to be damned. And though the thought be painful, and each one may fear how it will be with himſelf; yet it muſt be ſaid, that they ſtand together as a ſtrong bulwark not to be overthrown. If giddy mortals avail themſelves of that freedom of expreſſion, which is not unbecoming the God of heaven to uſe, and catch up ſcattered texts, where the word all is uſed, and determine greedily, that every individual of mankind will be ſaved. They are unlearned and unſtable, and wreſt the ſcriptures to their own deſtruction. It might as well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that God's ſpirit was poured out upon every individual of mankind, upon the day of Pentecoſt, becauſe Peter ſays, this is that which was ſpoken by the prophet Joel, viz. 'I will pour out my ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fleſh;' or that every individual is included in what is ſaid. Acts iv. 21. 'All men glorified God for that which was done;' though the ſame paſſage informs, that the rulers threatened, and ſought to puniſh them.

So the Apoſtles preached, and

                      facs="unknown:019452_0042_0FABA4E87A559030"

ſo they believed. This was not only impreſſed in the firſt inſtant, but ſtrongly enforced ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They muſt infallibly conſider this preſent evil world reſembling Sodom, and God's choſen or church fleeing from approaching deſtruction, as Lot's family from Sodom, ſee Heb. vi. 18. 'We —who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.' Could they have a diſtant idea, that the word all reſpected the world at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The univerſal expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt infallibly be underſtood to mean the whole redeemed body made up of Jews and Gentiles, Greeks, Barbarians, bond and free, &amp;c. in every age, and them only. To underſtand it further would be contrary to their firſt impreſſions, and all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they heard, and all the diſcipline and practice they ſaw, and every thing about the profeſſion. This grand collection of all ſorts makes a world, though choſen out of the world, and a general view of them is given Rev. v. 9. and Rev. vii. 1—10. 'Though collected out of nations are a nation.' 1 Pet. ii. 9. 'And are the glory and honour of the nations.' Rev. xxi. 26.</p>
               <p>Why do not men eager to catch hold of the word all in this caſe, and extend it to every individual, do the ſame with ſuch paſſages as theſe! Mark i. 37. 'All men ſeek for thee.' John iii. 26. 'The fame baptizeth and all men come to him.' John xii. 19. 'The world is gone after him;' To do it in this caſe does not ſo much oppoſe the united force of truth as in the preſent caſe. The reaſon is, they have not ſo ſtrong a temptation from the wiſh of the heart.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to ſee that men who know not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God ſpeaking in the ſcriptures, nor the ſame authority in the firſt churches, the living epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:019452_0043_0FABA4E92A48E7C8"/>
wherein that word was drawn out in real life; nor their reigning ſentiments and awful diſcipline in ſeparation from the world, who form the looſeſt ideas both of that word and of churches, will have dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their paths, and ſtumble at ſuch expreſſions. But could they for once realize the appearance of the churches in Judea, with thoughts and hearts in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtriking terror into the hearts of their enemies, it would daſh in a moment their readineſs to apply the word all to thoſe who know not God, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not the goſpel.</p>
               <p>The church of the living God is a medium through which truth is ſeen. 'It is the light of the world.' Mat. v. 14. It is called the pillar and ground of the truth. We may then view it as a beacon, a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the eſtabliſhment of truth upon earth. Her light is derived from the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and like the moon ſhe reflects it upon the world. And as an epiſtle of Chriſt the mind of Chriſt was read in her conduct, as well as in what was written in the Bible. Thoſe formerly who looked through this medium received very different impreſſions, from thoſe who look through the medium of what are now called churches, which bear no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; and fail in the firſt inſtance of being a body gathered in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeparated from the world, and exerciſing the appointed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. As the firſt churches might be called a living comment upon the ſcriptures, and impreſſions of truth were taken from them, in connexion with the written word; ſo men at this day are led in their underſtanding about the meaning of ſcripture, by the deceitful comment in what are called churches; and as theſe are broken, divided, and oppoſed; no wonder it is all confuſſion among them as among the Babel builders formerly.</p>
               <p>A text or two may be added to thoſe mentioned before, ſhewing the certainty of future puniſhment; one is Mark ix. 43—49. The Lord here directs to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019452_0044_0FABA4E9E59114A8"/>
part with a hand, foot or an eye, that offends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is better to enter life without them than to go into hell with them. And he repeats five times that the fire is not quenched, and three times that the worm dieth not. If any one will turn to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and read it deliberately he may be aſked theſe queſtions when he has done. Does the Lord call to the loſs of any earthly enjoyment in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life? Does he labour a point? What point does he labour? Is it Univerſal Salvation? Or is it the doctrine of damnation? Or is he full of words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing to the purpoſe, and making much ado about nothing? Who dare ſay he is holding up a bugbear to terrify his friends to part with their neareſt enjoyments in life, and that they like fools took him to be in earneſt, ſo as loſe even life it ſelf afterwards.</p>
               <p>One text more may he conſidered. In the 25th chapter of Matthew, the final judge (though then in abaſement) lays open the tranſactions of the laſt day to his friends; and informs that when ſeated upon his throne all nations ſhall be gathered, and he ſhall ſeparate them from one another, placing ſome on his right hand and others upon his left; and ſhall addreſs himſelf to the one, Come ye bleſſed, &amp;c. and then to the other, Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, &amp;c. and in 46th verſe, it is ſaid, Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous into life eternal. See the ſame iſſue of that day Rev. xx. 15. The meaning that firſt preſents itſelf is, that ſome men are appointed to happineſs at that time, and others to miſery.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, that the ſeparation here means only a ſeparation of crimes from perſons. Anſwer; nations are gathered and he ſeparates them one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and as they are a collection of perſons it muſt be, that he ſeparates perſons from one another. And the ſufferers of this puniſhment are ſaid to wail and gnaſh their teeth, verſe 30th of this chapter, and Mat. xiii. 42, 50, which cannot be applicable to crimes,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019452_0045_0FABA4EAA107FE60"/>
they being not the ſubjects of pain or action. Such trifling evaſions are not uſed where men's worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is at ſtake. Men do not take ſuch liberty in conſtruing the words of a law book. A man would make himſelf ridiculous that ſhould do it. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the laws declare, that any perſon guilty of murder ſhall be put to death. A man is brought upon trial, full evidence appears againſt him, and he is brought in guilty, by the verdict of a jury. Upon this the judge riſes up to pronounce ſentence, that he ſhall be hanged, till he is dead; but the priſoner's attorney gets up and informs his honour of a miſtake which he labours under, and ſays, it is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law to hurt men, or that they ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in perſon but ſimply to purge their crimes, and therefore that the meaning of the law cannot reach farther than that his client ſhould be hung in effigy, and he prays that the perſon himſelf might be ſet at liberty. Should a plea like this be made at the grand court hereafter, one <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> of how much avail it will be to a diſcharge.</p>
               <p>Others have ſaid, that thoſe upon the left hand are devils. Anſwer, if ſo then devils are part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions gathered at that time, and are the part which is ſeparated. And a reaſon of their ſentence is that they fed not the leaſt of the brethren of the judge, when hungry, did not cloathe, &amp;c. It is difficult to conceive how the devil can do this. Can any man think this to be the great article of charge againſt the devil? Does this appear from ſcripture to be the leading feature of his guilt. If it ſhould be admitted, might it not be ſuppoſed, that ſome of them will do it to eſcape the ſentence, for they do not love pain.

Does one wiſh to ſee many doctrines in a connected chain throwing their joint light into one point, or to ſee the whole appearance, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and practice entirely concurring and enforcing the evidence, or to have peremptory declarations of the puniſhment of ſome men, and to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated over and over. Does he wiſh for a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what paſſes in the unſeen world from one well acquainted there,—or what paſſes at the general judgement, and what is the iſſue of the day,—or to have the queſtion plainly put to Jeſus and plainly anſwered,—or to find the ſcripture ſpeaking of it throughout, he has them all conſpiring together and affording as bright evidence as they give upon any point, and indeed as great as words can give. But if men wiſh to have the natural meaning of words deſtroyed, that they may embrace a darling opinion; or to have the rock removed out of its place for them, this is unreaſonable, and has been often wiſhed in vain. The divine law and all the divine words muſt remain, fixed upon a firm baſis, and heaven and earth will ſooner paſs away than one jot or tittle of them fail.</p>
               <p>It is true there are a few words recorded in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which as we commonly take up language, ſpeak full according to the ſpirit of this doctrine, as Gen. iii. 4. 'Ye ſhall not ſurely die.' Mich. iii. 11. 'No evil can come to us.' Deut. xxix. 19. 'I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart. Rev. xviii. 7. 'I ſit a queen, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.' Information is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at the ſame time who they are ſpoken by, viz. the ſerpent, the falſe prophets, and the whore of Babylon. And though they have been held as ſweet by many for ages, yet they have held them ſo with more of a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hand, than they do now. A perſon is now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened, and with ſeeming ſecurity may behold God riſing in vehement wrath againſt them when they are mentioned, as in the following verſe, Deut. xxix. 20.

and perfect will of God—becomes more acquainted with the grand relief; has his confidence confirmed, and enjoys thoſe conſolations which are by Chriſt Jeſus, and will be crowned with eternal glory. His faith iſſues not in mere empty talk, but the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it are drawn out viſibly in his practice; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in his obſervance of that new commandment of love, left by the dying Lord to his dear diſciples, by which he ſignifies they ſhall be known to be his, in diſtinction from the reſt of mankind, John xiii. 34, 35. This neceſſarily ſuppoſes them united in ſeparation from the world,—ſtriving together for the faith of the goſpel—continuing ſteadfaſtly in the apoſtles doctrine—fellowſhip—breaking of bread and prayers—aſſembling every Lord's day for that purpoſe—loving each other with a cordial affection for holding that truth which makes them hateful to the world—miniſtering to their wants, thus laying up treaſure in heaven—rebuking in caſe of offence, and obſerving the diſcipline—jointly attending to every thing commanded, without making any void —patiently ſuffering as companions together for the truth's ſake. And ſo every branch of the ancient practice, and the apoſtolic contention, is revived in one body, of which Jeſus is the head, and they mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of him, and one another, which ſhews their faith working by love, and made perfect by works, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to James ii. chapter. As a plant riſes from a ſeed, ſo practice riſes from the faith, and manifeſts them to be heirs of ſalvation, ſee 1 Theſſ. i. 4—ult. and ii. chap. 13, 14.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE goſpel brings glad tidings of great joy for all ſorts of ſinners, even the chief. While it gives a deadly ſtab to the heart, it conveys a life-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing balſam. It preſents a broad foundation of hope to one in the broadeſt view of his guilt, and quiets the conſcience of man, when fearfully looking for judgement, and fiery indignation. Hence joy comes to priſoners that were appointed to death by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law. Great ſatisfaction ariſes from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merciful declarations, he that believeth ſhall be ſaved—if any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink—him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out, &amp;c. A perſon is then conſtrained practically to regard thoſe words, Mat. xvi. 24. 'If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me:' and to cleave to the Lord with purpoſe of heart, in obſerving all things commanded, which is a trial of the reality of his faith. In this way he proves what is that good, acceptable,
<pb n="50"
                      facs="unknown:019452_0049_0FABA4F52C0B1DB0"

to lead to the ancient ſeparation, diſcipline, and ſelf-denied obſervance of all things, commanded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with fear and trembling, and carry through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings unto death. This practice inſtead of riſing out of that belief, is a contradiction to it; and it might as well be expected to ſee a bramble buſh bearing grapes, as to ſee this practice growing out of that faith. The very mention of ſuch fruits may poſſibly occaſion the diſdainful ſmile; but it may be boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that goſpel faith and ſuch practice are as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected as body and ſpirit: and if men trifle with the doctrines or commands of God, whoſe voice will judge the world, it is done at no ſmall riſque.</p>

The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt decide that point. And if the branches of love before mentioned connected with a contention for the faith once delivered to the ſaints be fruits, not only this doctrine, but the whole doctrine of the Chriſtian world muſt tumble in ruins. Not but that they may ſeem to hold ſome things which look like truth, but a little leaven leavens the whole maſs, and a little poiſon makes a wholſome draught fatal.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture ſays, beware of men, and its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is emphatical, as the attention is called up to one teacher alone, even Chriſt. Though he be not bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, he as certainly ſpeaks in the ſcripture as if he were. There is no where elſe to go then but to the ſcriptures, which contain the words of eternal life. As to men, their deceit is cloaked under the moſt plauſible and kind appearances, and one had

need beware of them, as of the devil himſelf. It is ſaid, 2 Pet. ii. 1—4. 'There were falſe prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people (i. e. the Jews) as there ſhall be falſe teachers among you;' pointing to the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of them in all ages. He ſays alſo they ſhall bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, <note n="‡" place="bottom">They get good bread here, therefore this deſtruction is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave.</note> and their damnation ſlumbereth not. Though it be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it is wide awake. Turning to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one ſees their plauſible character. They were gathered round the two kings, 2 Chron. xviii. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmoothly, but Ahab tells Jehoſhaphat, 'As to Micaiah, did I not tell thee he would not prophecy good, but evil; and he has a priſon and bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction appointed him. Of theſe teachers we read, Ezek. xiii. 10.

In the xxiii. chapter of Jeremiah, their character is largely deſcribed, their language is, 'The Lord hath ſaid, ye ſhall have peace, and no evil ſhall come upon you, &amp;c.' ſee at large. As plauſibility marked their character under the law, ſo it did under the goſpel, Rom. xvi. 18. 'By good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple,' i. e. thoſe not taught of God. Paul in the ſame ſpirit with the true prophets ſays, in oppoſition to them all, Gal. i. 10. 'For if I yet pleaſed man, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.'</p>

               <p>It is natural for men to fancy it will be well with them when this ſhort life ends. This is manifeſt from the ſavage who has victuals, cloaths and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, buried with him, that he may be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in a viſionary hunting world of happineſs; to the raptured philoſopher who fancies, that his ſpirit will be waſted on wings divine into unknown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful regions, and like the bee he ſhall ſip delicious draughts from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

They think of feaſting upon nectar and ambroſia, and of being tranſported from ſtar to ſtar through the wide univerſe.</note> This bias to fancied happineſs appears as ſtrong in thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe the Bible, and yet in works deny it as any men whatever. So they caſt off from themſelves the terrible threatenings, which ſtill they reckon will fall on ſome others. <note n="‖" place="bottom">How flow men are to admit a truth which is againſt them, often appears in one in a conſumption.</note>

               <p>It would be endleſs to point out the various grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their hope, and the ſeveral foundations they build it upon. Men are more engaged to get a hope that is ſtrong, than to ſee whether it is fixed upon a rock or the ſand. That a ſlight foundation ſerves, appears in two armies engaged in battle, where on both ſides multitudes think that their fall in battle is meritorious, and will give ſome claim to ſalvation. This is not confined to ſavage ignorance, but is the caſe in poliſhed nations. Not merely among men of low underſtanding, but thoſe of rank. Not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among Papiſts, but Proteſtants too. Nor can it be ſuppoſed that Britain, France, or America could boaſt over others in this reſpect.</p>
               <p>To ſome this foundation appears weak, therefore they may have recourſe to ſomething that is more
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:019452_0052_0FABA4F76A50DED8"/>
plauſible. It may be a general belief of ſcripture whether they underſtand what it contains or not. Morality in ſociety—attendance upon the religion of their country—or pariſh—eſteem of their miniſter and paying his tax to him—veneration for dead ſaints, or it may be experience of a change of hearts to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceit of themſelves, or ſome good action—or good wiſh, or ſome thing elſe. Hope founded ſome how is a ſtaff that moſt men walk with. This bias to get a hope has at laſt led men the fatal length to believe, that all men will be ſaved in the face of all God's threatenings.</p>
               <p>Men have had ample employ in cutting out vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes of religion to fit the policy of kingdoms or the taſte of the public where they happen to live. Barely to enumerate the ſects called Chriſtian, would be tedious, much more ſo to lay open their ſeveral opinions. It may be preſumed none have riſen ſince the firſt departure from the faith, that have more texts ſtanding full faced againſt them than the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſts; or that are put to a greater ſhift to keep up any plauſibility. The ſhift made, that thoſe on the left hand are crimes, or devils, and not men is the maſter piece of all evaſions. And if the credit of wit be allowed them here, or a deep inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to human nature, as to what ſcheme of religion might take with the human mind, yet it muſt be ſaid it will turn againſt themſelves in the end, even as it is with the fallen angels, who are not accuſed of want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Satan was the firſt reaſoner upon the words of God, and the ſtep he took was to lead Eve to queſtion the truth and force of them; then finding by her anſwer, that ſhe was deviating from the form of words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her, and wavering about them, he purſues his advantage, and aſſerts 'Ye ſhall not ſurely die.' And ſince that day, he goes about ſeeking whom he may devour, leading men to queſtion, whether God hath ſaid this and the other thing (taking off the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019452_0053_0FABA4F83A439A88"/>
force of his words) and to hold looſe the form of ſound words delivered them; and to doubt whether the curſes will fall on them, though they walk in the imagination of their hearts. It was not uncommon to fancy an eſcape before, but now the concluſion is drawn fully as bold as at firſt, that no man ſhall ſurely die.</p>
               <p>The intrepidity with which ſome who hold this doctrine may leave this world, is no certain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it is true. Deiſts, Pagans, Papiſts, and every ſect, have thought they had got evidence of the truth of their reſpective ſchemes from the boldneſs with which ſome of their followers have died. But a madman's firm belief that he is a king, does not make it evident that he really is ſo. A man going to the gallows may firmly believe there is an eſcape for him, but this alters not his real ſituation. It is ſaid Pſalm Lxxiii. 4. 'There are no bands in <hi>their</hi> death,' who yet are ſaid 19th verſe, to be brought into deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in a moment.</p>
               <p>Many perſons think this doctrine falſe, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how it could ever gain ground in oppoſition to ſuch a multitude of plain texts, who yet have had a hand in its production. It is a child of their beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though they are ſorry for its birth, and neither parent, nor child, are fond of owning each other. This may: ſeem a ſtrange inſinuation. But 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they bury out of ſight the ancient diſtinction of the church from the reſt of mankind, and its diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and with them the eſtabliſhed enmity, and the ſire Jeſus came to ſend on earth, while they hold up both in doctrine and practice, that the work of Jeſus had reſpect to all men.

was broke their churches crumble to duſt. There cannot be the appearance of conſiſtency in this, unleſs Jeſus be ſuppoſed to die for all, and all will be ſaved. And it is thought to be the height of religion to have what is called univerſal charity, which is indeed paving a broad ſtreet for moſt, or all to walk to heaven in. Not only this, but the force of ſcripture is beaten down, and it is made to give place to traditions, platforms, creeds, &amp;c. that the Bible is not thought ſufficient to ſupport any doctrine without the helping ſhoulder of ſome great divine, or number of divines ſo called. Nay it is become a common jeſt book to collect expreſſions from, to give a high ſeaſoning to wit and mirth. What more could any wiſh for, to nullify all its threatenings? What more to lead to the thought that Jeſus died for all, and that all will be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Damnation has been conſidered as a mere bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to frighten children, before publiſhing this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, not only by thoſe who toſſed it from their tongues in profane oaths, but thoſe who preached its terrors to get money. Thoſe who have wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this doctrine, have not dared to lay open the root of the ſcripture doctrine, as ſtanding againſt it, becauſe it would be againſt their own religion.

               <p>We may now take a brief view of revolutions in the Chriſtian profeſſion. In the Apoſtles days, the churches, which were in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, looked forth as the morning, clear as the ſun, fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners. The evidence of the ſufferings of Jeſus with the glory following, burſt into their minds and captivated their hearts. They joyfully quitted their hold of this world, and partook of his ſufferings, looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of him who gave himſelf to redeem them from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, zealous of good works. Theſe works they conſidered as an evidence that their faith was unfeigned, and ſo ſhould be crowned with ſalvation. Their faith and works both were hateful to the world, and drew upon them heavy ſufferings; but the hope of future glory raiſed their ſpirits, and ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from heaven ſupported them. The human mind without divine ſupport ſhrinks from ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Thus many at that day varied a little (as it might ſeem) to eſcape diſtreſs, ſee Gal. vi. 12. This deviation continually increaſed afterwards, agreeable to 2 Theſſ. ii. 7—12. Herein were fulfilled 2 Tim. iii. 1. and 1 Tim. iv. 1. When it was conſiderably advanced, profeſſors caſt a favourable eye towards the morality and maxims of nations, adding tradition, philoſophy, &amp;c. to their profeſſion; ſo that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between the church and world was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leſſened. The world failed not to return the compliment, and ſoon got ſo favourable an idea of Chriſtianity, that it was noticed by the great, and the Emperor of the world introduced it as the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religion of the Roman empire. Conſtantine loaded the Elders, or Biſhops with wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and hiſtory informs, that a general corruption followed among them. Though this was manifeſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:019452_0056_0FABA559A1254A60"/>
to all men, yet the world continued to laviſh its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and increaſe their grandeur, till upon the fall of the weſtern empire, and its being divided among ten kings they all yielded ſubmiſſion to the firſt Biſhop, and in this the prophecy, Rev. xvii. 12, 13. was fulfilled. This was within five hundred years from the Apoſtles days. This haughty pontiff had ſway for ages, over princes and ſubjects, requiring an implicit faith in what he declared to be the mind of God, while the ſcriptures were locked up out of ſight; and at the ſame time the greateſt barbarities were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon thoſe who could not ſwallow his dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and this under pretence of zeal for God. Mean while the groſſeſt vices ran through the whole body of the clergy, and the groſſeſt opinions were preached by them, and believed by the people.</p>
               <p>A ſenſible check was given to his career in the 16th century, by Luther, Calvin, and others, who boldly exclaimed againſt the corruptions of the church of Rome, cauſed the ſcriptures to be publiſhed, and ſeemed to revive the contention for the faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the ſaints. But theſe contenders inſtead of diſappearing in this world, and becoming united with a poor and afflicted people truſting in the name of the Lord; willingly admitted princes to take up their cauſe and ſupport it by their power. Thus it became a cauſe of the kingdoms of this world, inſtead of a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church of Chriſt in ſeparation from the world as at the beginning. So that Chriſtianity was brought into a ſtate reſembling what it was in the days of Conſtantine. The followers of theſe reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have been relaxing more and more from any thing about them, which had any appearance of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic doctrine; and have been much divided, and no ſmall quarrellings raiſed among them. But at laſt tired with quarrels and perſecutions, and each party being gravelled with what another could lay before his conſcience from the ſcripture, they have in general been taking a new turn about religion. While mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes

                  </gap> they would call the faith once deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to the ſaints. This they ſuppoſe is amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by the good opinion they can admit of every ſect and denomination. It has become an approved proverb, that men do not think alike, and do not look alike, ſuppoſing that there is no more evil in having a different belief <note n="*" place="bottom">According to Paul, belief is counted for righteouſneſs, Rom. iv. 5.</note> than a different face: or in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which makes God's word of no effect, or makes him a lyar. So it is commonly thought, if a perſon be what ſociety calls a good member of it, he will be ſaved let his belief be what it will. This emboldens men in any ſentiments, even in the denial of revelation.</p>
               <p>While men are thus ſhewing mutual complaiſance to each other, we may beſure they will take liberties with the word of God. Its divine origin is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubted by men who yet make a decent obeiſance to the public religion. Some not ſo prudent boldly reject ſome parts of it as fancy dictates. And to the bulk of people, the moſt of it is of ſo doubtful ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as to loſe all force. The paper, print, and cover may have a ſhadow of reſpect, but as to the contents, this is too deep to be underſtood, that is figurative—that is doubtful—that is indifferent, and the other is contradictory; ſo that taking it all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether it is the moſt unmeaning, inſignificant book that was ever written.—And beſides this they have erected a tribunal, upon which human reaſon is ſeated as judge, before whom the words of God muſt be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and tried, and thoſe only will be allowed to paſs which ſhe allows can be comprehended, and do not claſh too much with intereſt and eaſe. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then there be gods many and lords many. There are alſo ſentiments many, which could they be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

and fairly expoſed would indeed excite the idea of Babel or Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Thus we have contraſted with the reception of truth at firſt, the reception it has met with from the nations, when they have meddled with it: While they fail not of loading its betrayers and murderers with honour, one while it is itſelf locked up in priſon faſt, another time it is let out to be bandied about like a foot ball, or to uſe another ſimilitude, to be cut up into ſhreds, and have its force demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>Among the firſt believers the divine teſtimony tore down reaſonings, took the heart by ſtorm, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated every thought to the obedience of Chriſt. But on the contrary now, the ſcriptures receive the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, are ſtormed by men, and captivated to ſupport their evil reaſonings, and countenance their wicked affections and luſts.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian nations, ſo called, boaſt of ſuperiority over other nations (whom they call heathen) as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan nations glory over them, and the Chineſe boaſt, looking with contempt upon both. After all the boaſting of Chriſtian nations they are much the ſame they were before they adopted Chriſtianity, only they have new names about religion, and the gods. It is ſaid that the Roman ſenate talked of enrolling Jeſus among the gods. However that be, the name of Jeſus is only enrolled among the nations. Not to enlarge upon the battles that have been fought in his name while the earth was made ſlippery with blood. The Spaniards carried his name into South-America, and under it, not only diſpoſſeſſed the trembling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives but cut them in pieces and covered the earth with millions of their carcaſes.

it is not uncommon to invoke his name to give a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to earneſt purſuits after this world, and hoarding up treaſures by extortion.</p>
               <p>As to nations they may be compared to vaſt col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of water moving in a ſteady courſe down their channel, that cannot be diverted or turned back. The introducing Chriſtianity, never turned their ſtream the contrary way, but inſtead of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perverted and mingling it is carried down ſtream. It was not the intent of Jeſus to do more than to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect out of the nations a people for his name. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the high boaſts of Chriſtian nations, there is the ſtrongeſt ground to believe, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the character of both clergy and laity have a ſtrong reſemblance round the whole globe; and that there is not more difference in their religion than in their looks or dreſs.</p>
               <p>Two things may be mentioned, wherein all the nations agree.</p>
               <p n="1">I. They all imagine that human worth is of ſome avail towards making peace with their Maker. The church motto in diſtinction is, He is our peace— The Lord our righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Worldly intereſt is a main point with all the nations. Mat. vi. 32. 'For after all theſe things do (ETHNEE) the nations ſeek.'</p>
               <p>In oppoſition, the reigning ſentiment of the true followers of Jeſus is thus enforced, Luke xii. 33. 'Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourſelves bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the heavens, &amp;c.' Though Chriſtian nations are well agreed in the two principal points mentioned, yet in ſome others which are called circumſtantials they differ. Thus religion may aſſume a different garb in different ages or places. Sometimes ſhe appears in a more ſtrait and forbidding dreſs, ſometimes more looſe and inviting. To cut ſhort, univerſal benevolence, or charity, ſo called, is agreeable to the preſent taſte of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. She caſts a pleaſant eye (however diſaffected)

However ſhe cannot quite conceal her diſguſt at a ſtrenuous maintenance of the ſimple truth. But ſtill ſhe cries, wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leads to the Elyſian fields, and many there be that go thither. This dame with her ſiſter Univerſal Redemption have at laſt found a companion in this doctrine, by whom they are made perfect and compleat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their laſt poliſhing, ſo that unmoleſted they may pride themſelves in their charms, revel in enjoyment of their wiſhes, and bid defiance to God's ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, election, juſtification by faith, ſelf-denial, and fears of damnation, which before occaſionally gave them diſquiet.</p>
               <p>Finally, the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, leads to the moſt undiſturbed enjoyment of a dream, which men indulged before; though they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

It is probable, this doctrine will prevail, and contribute much to that quiet men will be in when Jeſus returns from heaven, 1 Theſſ. v. 3.

The reader muſt note, that all theſe ancient writers are here produced, not merely for not mentioning theſe words, but becauſe they treated profeſſedly of ſuch ſubjects as required the aſſiſtance of this text, and many of them of the context, and next verſe. And they could never have omitted it on any other reaſon, but this, that they had it not in their Bibles, for above 700 years.</p>
            <p>"It may reaſonably be inquired, if there be any more evidence for this text ſince the reformation? Luther and Bullinger would not put this text in any editions of the Bible. Our old Bibles in Henry VIII's and Edward VI's time had had theſe words in ſmall letters, and ſometimes in a parentheſis. In Queen Elizabeth's Bible I find the ſame."</p>
            <p>"Now, methinks, here is pretty large ſtock of evidence, and as much as one can well require, for a negative, to ſhow, that this verſe was not originally any part of the New-Teſtament, and one need have very <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>peremptory</hi> teſtimonies to the contrary, to make him ſo much as heſitate in the matter."</p>
