            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is obvious to me, when Men propoſe a Scheme to effect any Matter of Moment, they ſhould not only conſider that Thing in its firſt Appearance, but ought judiciouſly to conſider what may be the Conſequence thereof, and That not only in ſome Particulars, but in the largeſt Extention the Caſe will admit of; and if, after ſufficient Inſpection, they have Reaſon to believe the preſent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit may be attended with a Load of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to either private or publick Affairs, and thoſe Inconveniences to over-ballance the Juſtneſs that in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation might be annexed to the preſent Purſuit; that then it ſhould be laid aſide, and not carried into Execution.</p>

            <p>IN order to fix the Reader's Mind the more intent upon the preſent Diſcourſe, I ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> conſider who deſerves that Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(Caeſar.)</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Shall make it appear an Act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Juſtice, to render thoſe Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Men have found it neceſſary, in moſt Ages of the World, to appoint one Head or Ruler over them, according to the ſettled Bounds of Nations; this being done by the Conſent of the Whole, it lays them under an actual Acknowledgment to his Sovereignty, under which, Methods have been formed, not only to eſtabliſh him in that Dignity, but to protect his ſacred Perſon to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Under which Sanction, the Superior and Inferior are inſeparably bound to each other, the one to command, the other to obey, except in religious Matters, we are to <hi>render unto God the Things that are God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007635_0004_102D96F7C6A5E780"/>Men of that Claſs have been eſtabliſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers Appellations, according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Affairs, or the Judgments of People, in their different Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, unto whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that Time was tributary. The Word <hi>Caeſar,</hi> juſtly applied at that Time, ſignified Chief Ruler, or King, and hath a juſt Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation to our preſent Sovereign GEORGE, King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider what are the Things that belong to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> In the firſt Place I ſhall ſhew, that when a King aſcends the Throne, he, by Conſent, is bound in the moſt ſolemn Manner, by Oath, to defend the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges belonging to the Crown, both civil and religious; and not only at Home, but it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends unto the furthermoſt Parts of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. And the whole lieth under an equal Claim to his Protection.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, who act in Conjunction with the King, repreſent the Nation, and are choſe by thoſe that have a Right to chuſe them; they are choſe by the Majority, which may, in that Caſe, be deemed the Whole.</p>
            <p>They are alſo bound, by ſolemn Oath, to be faithful Subjects, to diſcharge their Truſt as by Law appointed, or as Neceſſity may require; therefore what they do, his Majeſty agreeing therewith, may juſtly be termed an Act of the whole Nation, and layeth an abſolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on every Subject to act conſiſtent with himſelf, agreeable to the moſt ſolemn Ties he is under; this formeth a good Government;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007635_0005_102D96FA9BABA228"/>
and it is impoſſible for any Government, either civil or religious, to be ſupported without a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Contribution of Money to defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that will neceſſarily accrue in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof.</p>
            <p>Under which Conſideration, the King and Parliament have made Laws, which are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole Realm; Laws that are not grievous, but eaſy to be borne; Laws that lay an equitable Taxation on the Whole, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligeth every One to bear his proportionable Share.</p>
            <p>It is an actual Agreement between a King and his Subjects; they are bound in the moſt ſolemn Manner that Mankind are capable of, to <hi>render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's,</hi> whenever they are lawfully called thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is an undeniable Debt, contracted at our Birth, and but juſt and honeſt in us to hold ourſelves in Readineſs to diſcharge it as the Payments become due, which will be to <hi>render Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom is due, Tribute to whom Tribute is due.</hi> I ſhall conclude the ſecond Part with ſaying, that he who is thus found in the Diſcharge of his real Duty, not only <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's,</hi> but <hi>unto God the Things that are God's, viz.</hi> a good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I conclude by this time we ſhall agree, that our preſent Sovereign is the Perſon to whom Tribute is due, and that we his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Subjects are the Perſons, under the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ties, obliged to pay it, and can by no Means (under a Cloak of Juſtice) ſkreen our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007635_0006_102D96FF352BD4E8"/>
from <hi>rendering unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, in order to put the Thing in an obvious Light, I ſhall begin, as I think, at the Foundation, and conſider the preſent Situation of Affairs in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> reſpecting his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty King GEORGE, who rules theſe Nations, under the indiſputable Title of Heir to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and who, in the moſt ſolemn Manner, by Oath, hath bound himſelf, both to God and Man, to protect the Proteſtant Religion, and to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the Encroachments of perfidious Enemies.</p>
            <p>This being the real Situation of our preſent King, I am neceſſarily led to enquire, how or in what Manner he may be rendered capable of diſcharging that ſo weighty an Affair, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hearty Aſſiſtance of his Subjects; and at this critical Juncture, when a potent Enemy threatens an Invaſion, and gladly would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the beſt of Kings, and involve the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a general Maſſacre. But to return, As the King is bound by Oath, he conſcientiouſly believes, with Thouſands more, that it is his abſolute Duty (both in the Sight of God and Man) to defend himſelf by Force of Arms; and as the Situation of Things appear at this Time, it ſeems as tho' it were morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſucceed in other Terms, for by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from Home it appeareth, that our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have (ſince they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ill Diſpoſition of the <hi>French,</hi> their reſtleſs Enemies) raiſed large Sums of Money
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007635_0007_102D970151B829D0"/>
for the King's Uſe, which Monies being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to Military Purpoſes, the ſeveral Sums being raiſed by Tax, Men of every Claſs pay it with Chearfulneſs; they <hi>render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's,</hi> well knowing it to be their Duty to obey God, and honour their King; this very Money, which is raiſed by Tax, is now, and hath been for twelve Months paſt, applied in building Ships of War, in raiſing Forces both for Sea and Land, in purchaſing Artillery, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on purpoſe for Defence, the Conſequence of which will be ſhedding of Blood, unleſs the Enemy keep their Diſtance.</p>
            <p>And altho' this be the very Caſe, I find not one Scrutineer among them; the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the Subjects obey; under which Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy there is a pleaſant Harmony. In which Situation I ſhall leave them unto the Protection of Him who never fails to reward thoſe who conſcientiouſly obey his Commands, which are, <hi>Render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the Things that are God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now take a View of my native Land, where I expect to find Things of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Character, that may occaſion me to make particular Remarks thereon, which, if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Nature of the Caſe, I hope to be excuſed; my Deſign is genuine; it is with a View to prevail upon all Men to <hi>pay Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom is due, Tribute to whom Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute is due.</hi> In the firſt Place, I ſhall undeniably make it appear, that our Governor and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007635_0008_102D9703D3809D60"/>
in this Province, repreſent the King and Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> becauſe they are fixed Miniſters here, with the ſame Powers of Legiſlature to manage the King's Affairs in this diſtant Colony; their Authority is firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Act of Parliament; and if what they do appears to be ſubordinate to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> it is as firm and binding to us, and ought with as equal Juſtice to be obeyed, as though the King himſelf commanded.</p>
            <p>And altho' the Laws here are not verbatim with the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in every Caſe, yet that reſpecting the Legiſlative Power, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Parliament; under which Act, there is a Method preſcribed for us to chuſe a lawful Number of Men, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Whole; and they being of our own chuſing, what they do reſpecting the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is our own Act; for, in the firſt Step, we come under the Sanction of Law, becauſe all are prohibited, and have no Vote, who are not poſſeſſed of an Eſtate to the Value of <hi>Fifty Pounds,</hi> this being a particular Paragraph of Law which every Voter appealeth to for Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under which he acknowledgeth that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and directly engageth himſelf, under Sanction of Oath, to be a faithful Subject to his King, becauſe we are a Body Corporate, and every Perſon, thus ſituated, a real Member of that Body, and will inevitably remain as ſuch, unleſs he refuſe to pay Tribute unto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> I alſo conſider, that our Governor and Aſſembly are bound, by ſolemn Oath or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, to be faithful Subjects to their King
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007635_0009_102D970702600458"/>
and are placed as Guardians to the Province; for which Reaſon, I hope we may allow that it is their particular Buſineſs to make all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Inſpection into the State of the Province, by which Means they may probably be capable of guarding againſt impending Danger.</p>
            <p>I query, Whether this be not their real Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And if ſo, I query, How they may be able to effect it, without our Aſſiſtance? And in what Manner do we aſſiſt, unleſs it be in paying Tax? And how inconſiſtent do thoſe appear with themſelves, in refuſing to pay Tax; do they conſider what a Train of Contradictions they are heaping on their own Heads? In the firſt Place, they have entered into a Contract with their King, and in that have laid an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon themſelves to be faithful Subjects, and at the ſame time refuſe to pay him his juſt Dues; this is no other (in the Body Corporate) but that they are doing a Thing, and at the ſame time are not doing that Thing.—They are willing to pay the King his Dues, but at the ſame time are not willing to pay the King his Dues. Theſe are plain Contradictions, and as plain Truths.</p>
            <p>Are any ſo weak as to imagine this Province can remain under a good Conſtitution, and no Taxes levied? I think not, by Men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe: Well, if that be the Caſe, I ſhall aſk one Queſtion, which is, Under what Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation could the preſent Act have been ſet forth in, more agreeable to the ſeveral Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of People in this Province, under which Appellation divers Taxes have been le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007635_0010_102D97091DE726C0"/>
and the Money paid (I believe) without one Prick of Conſcience, until this critical Juncture; in which (perhaps) there never was more Need of Money to be raiſed, nor was there ever more Need of ſhewing Loyalty to a King, or of maintaining Amity among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when we are threatened by a potent Enemy Abroad; while we have ſuffered ſo many irreparable Damages from a barbarous and ſavage Enemy at Home?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now recite an infallible Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in order to encourage the well-diſpoſed Part, the Subſtance of which, I think, may well ſerve for a Touchſtone, by Virtue of which every Scrutineer may try his uncommon Conſcience; <hi>Matt.</hi> xvii. 24. <hi>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute Money, came to Peter and ſaid, Doth your Maſter pay Tribute? He ſaith, Yes. And when he was come into the Houſe, Jeſus prevented him, ſaying, What thinkeſt thou, Simon? Of whom do the Kings of the Earth take Cuſtom or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute? of their own Children, or of Strangers? Peter ſaith unto him, of Strangers. Jeſus ſaith unto him, then are the Children free. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, leſt we ſhould offend them, go thou to the Sea, and caſt an Hook, and take up the Fiſh that firſt cometh up; and when thou haſt opened his Mouth, thou ſhalt find a Piece of Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I look upon this as an infallible Precedent to every true Believer in CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not only his aſſenting to a Thing, but it is doing that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007635_0011_102D970AC09B0B68"/>
Thing; it is not only his Advice to <hi>Peter</hi> to give, but ſaith, <hi>Go, give this for me and thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Tribute or Tax, was paid under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who was at that Time car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a War, the Conſequence of which is always ſhedding of Blood.</p>
            <p>But might not JESUS have ſhewed a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon wherein he was not taxable? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Text, when he aſketh <hi>Simon, Of whom do the Kings of the Earth take Cuſtom or Tribute, of their own Children, or of Strangers? Peter ſaith, of Strangers; Jeſus ſaith unto him, then are the Children free.</hi> This meaneth, that as he himſelf was the Son of God, who was and is the King and Ruler of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and unto whom every Part belongs, was in Reality, and abſolutely exempt from paying Tax; and altho' this was the very Caſe, there was no Heſitation on it; no, he ſaith to <hi>Peter, Notwithſtanding, leſt we ſhould offend them, go and give unto them for me and thee.</hi> Obſerve, this was all acted under an Heathen Emperor, which is far from being the Caſe with us; for we have not only a Chriſtian King, but perhaps the beſt of Kings that ever ſway'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Scepter.—A King, whoſe ſuperior Virtues, and tender Indulgence towards his Subjects, is too little regarded by that Claſs of Men.—But no Wonder, when Men refuſe to make CHRIST their Example, and will not do what he hath poſitively commanded them to do; I ſay I do not wonder that thoſe Men refuſe to obey a Chriſtian King. I ſhall inſpect into the Nature of the Caſe, by Query, and examine whether
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007635_0012_102D9710283DAE78"/>
there be any real Cauſe, or good Foundation, for this unlook'd for Scruple of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether CHRIST, meaning the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, who is from all Eternity to all Eternity, did not know as well what would be Man's Duty to the End of the World, as at that Juncture?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether he would in Reality do any Thing which might be made a Precedent, and whether Men receiving it as ſuch, did not act the Chriſtian Part?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether CHRIST rendering unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things that were <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, will not juſtify us, if we do the like?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it hath not in itſelf the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inconſiſtency, for CHRIST, when perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Earth, to do a Thing, and in the ſame Diſpenſation (by his Spirit) forbid his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to do that Thing?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether Mens Conſciences ought to be a Director to us, when it is evident that they are not dictated by the Spirit of CHRIST?</p>
            <p n="6">6. And whether we ought to abandon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon, and ſacrifice our brighteſt Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to confide in the particular Humour of two or three Self-conceited Men?</p>
            <p>I ſhall aſk this Queſtion, Did you ever read the Hiſtory of the Perſecutions under the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Emperors? If you have, I would have you to read them the ſecond Time, where perhaps you may find a near Emblem; you may ſee the very Riſe of Apoſtacy, and what was the firſt Step to the ſo much lamented De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion; you may ſee, that Men, inſtead of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007635_0013_102D9711C30909E0"/>
Religion, practiſed Superſtition; you may ſee, that Men, who ſhould have honoured God, rather honoured themſelves; you may ſee, that Men, who ought to have allowed the ſole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to God, proclaimed themſelves infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            <p>I ſhall offer the Reaſons for the laſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, reſpecting the Declenſion of the Church; the firſt Motion was Superſtition; Men valuing themſelves upon their own Judgments, by which Means they under-valued their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſtill believed that they themſelves grew better and wiſer.</p>
            <p>Under which grand Opinion of Self, they were repeatedly laying Injunctions upon the Church (and that at firſt) in trivial Matters chiefly; by which Means they loſt the Power of true Religion, and ſet up Forms in the Room thereof; and thoſe Forms ſo prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, I am of Opinion, there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe; a Word to the Wiſe may be enough. Therefore, it is Wiſdom for all Claſſes of Men to particularly guard againſt this impending Danger.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, I adviſe the Clergy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a better Opinion of the Laity than of themſelves; and the Laity to think of the Clergy juſt as they are.</p>
            <p>Self-righteouſneſs and Bigotry hath been the greateſt Enemies that ever a militant Church have had, and have ever been uſeleſs in Affairs of State.</p>
            <p>But when they creep into the Church, they are much of the Nature of a Peſtilence, they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007635_0014_102D9713FB413080"/>
infect almoſt the Whole, and the chief Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the Clergy pretend to more than other Men; more Knowledge and more Experience; and to confirm it, in ſteps the Bigot, and ſaith, Amen. And when thus met, there is a Conference, in which there may be a narrow Inſpection, perhaps, not only in Church but State Affairs.</p>
            <p>In one of theſe Conſultations (I think) it was, that the Bill, for granting Money for the King's Uſe, was conſidered.</p>
            <p>But obſerve, the Council at that Time was but very ſmall; however, after a Deliberation upon it, up ſtands a Clergyman, and giveth his Opinion concerning the Bill then lying before them, which was to this Purport, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Clergyman.</speaker>
               <p>I have conſidered the Tenor of this Bill, which is for granting <hi>Sixty Thouſand Pounds</hi> for the King's Uſe, and do not find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free to pay the Tax, but ſhall ſuffer a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on my Goods.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Biggot.</speaker>
               <p>No, nor I neither; though I have thought nothing about it, until juſt now; I want to be informed why we may not pay it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerg.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell thee; the Act ſpecifies it in ſuch a promiſcuous Manner, that I cannot be free to pay. I own, they have pointed out two particular Articles, unto which I can freely pay my Tax, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the diſtreſſed Inhabitants, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing our Alliance with the friendly <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bigot.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yes, ſo can I pay towards thoſe two thou mentioned very freely; but I do not
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007635_0015_102D9718C441DBE8"/>
think I can pay the other, though I do not know rightly what it means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerg.</speaker>
               <p>I'll inform thee; it is that Part which is mentioned for the King's Uſe; becauſe, thou knows, we are principled againſt War, both offenſive and defenſive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bigot.</speaker>
               <p>No, by no Means; I would not have any Hand in carrying on a War: But can we refuſe to pay Tax? It ſeems to me as if the King's Dues were the moſt reaſonable of all Taxes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerg.</speaker>
               <p>Hold, hold! thou doth not conſider the Conſequence; for we ſuppoſe there may be an <hi>Indian</hi> War, and if ſo, ſome of the Money will doubtleſs be converted to that Uſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bigot.</speaker>
               <p>Alack-a-day! true enough; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once entered my Mind; poor weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are; was it not for your conſtant Care over us, I doubt we ſhould not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the many Temptations we are daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with; but I rejoice that there are a few faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ones that ſtand for this ſo juſt a Cauſe. Pay it! no, I'll never pay it, without thee pays it firſt.—Yet I find ſome Uneaſineſs, which creates a Doubting, whether we may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Aſſembly, in thus refuſing to pay, when they have made a Law, and by that Law commanded us to pay; I want to be reſolved in this Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Clerg.</speaker>
               <p>I believe I can readily reſolve that Query: In the firſt Place, as I juſtly obſerved, they are Men of our own chuſing, and the Majority of the Houſe of the ſame Religion that we are; and as they thought fit to lay this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007635_0016_102D971A77D810F8"/>
Burden upon us, I think we may with much more Freedom refuſe to comply.—Before we break up, I would juſt obſerve, that we who are preſent (tho' but few in Number) have heard, verbatim, the ſtrongeſt Objections we are able to make, with the Reaſons why we make them; I ſay, I would be well pleaſed that we ſhould uſe ſome Endeavours to inſinuate our Opinions into the Minds of others, for I am perſwaded it would take with the Minds of many good honeſt People.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bigot.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall uſe my utmoſt Endeavour to perſwade all I can; there is ſuch, and ſuch, and many more, that I know would be of our Way of thinking, if they did but know your Minds.—And as to the Reaſons that have been offered, I am fully perſwaded they are ſo ſtrong, and well-grounded, that we may always refuſe to pay Tax upon the like Footing.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>It was not long after the Adjournment of this Council, that their Minutes came under the Notice of a Freethinker, who, on a ſerious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, thought proper to make a Reply, which he hath done unto every Paragraph ſeparately, and are as followeth:</p>
            <p>Paragraph 1. <hi>I have conſidered the Tenor of this Bill, which is for granting</hi> Sixty Thouſand Pounds <hi>for the King's Uſe; and do not find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free to pay the Tax; but ſhall ſuffer a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on my Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> For my Part, I am not able to fix a Meaning to that Paragraph; for if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as the King's Dues, he muſt alſo have conſidered, that it was his Duty to pay it;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007635_0017_102D971C712D0510"/>
and if he did not think it the King's Dues, he ought to have rendered his Reaſons why.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place I ſhall obſerve, that Taxes, Duties, and Aſſizes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the ſole Revenues of the Kingdom, that I know of, and by which the whole Realm is ſupported, reſpecting the Affairs of State; theſe are the King's Dues, fixed on him by Law; and every Voter hath a Hand in making theſe Laws, therefore, I ſay, it is as reaſonable to withhold the one, as the other, and the Whole, as any Part.</p>
            <p>Yet, in my Opinion, there may be a more formidable Argument found (at times) againſt paying of Duty, than againſt paying Tax, for this Reaſon, becauſe Goods on which the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is laid, by reaſon of dull Markets, are ſold for little, if any, Advance more than the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we cannot be ſupported in any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without a reaſonable Profit; this may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſome Colour of Reaſon; but in refuſing to pay Tax, I find none.</p>
            <p>Taxations are an unequal Injunction, I mean reſpecting Times; and when they are levied, as there is a fixed Law that Taxes may be levied, according to the preſent Emergency, which Power, in this Province, is ſolely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Governor and Aſſembly, and if they command a Tax to be either for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Defence of the Province, this Money, when raiſed, is properly the King's Money; and as he hath appointed Miniſters, under law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Qualifications, they are the Perſons that muſt appropriate this Money, in the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are able, to their Maſter's Service;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007635_0018_102D971F471971A0"/>
therefore I look upon the Tax to be the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Part of the King's Revenues; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may either be augmented or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as the preſent State of Affairs requires.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now take ſome Notice of the laſt Sentence in that Paragraph; which is, <hi>But ſhall ſuffer a Diſtraint on my Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> No Wonder, if a Man do a Thing, at a Time when he hath no Power to refrain from doing that Thing. But what is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of refuſing? Is it not an Attempt to defraud the King of his Dues? Becauſe, if a Man refuſe to pay, it is evident to me, that that Man is not willing to pay; and if that Unwillingneſs could find Protection, the King would never have his Dues. But if you are in Reality willing your Goods may be diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from you, you are certainly willing the King ſhall have his Dues, becauſe that is the only Means by which he can obtain it. If you ingenuouſly believe the above Tax to be the King's Dues, and refuſe to pay it, you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear as diſloyal Subjects to your King, but entirely reject the poſitive Command of CHRIST, which is, <hi>Render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the Things that are God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would have you to conſider it in this Light, whether you that refuſe to pay the Tax, do not the utmoſt in your Power to dethrone the beſt of Kings; who can be no more King, without his Subjects, than we can be Subjects, without a King. Although it is but little that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007635_0019_102D972315B66920"/>
one Man can do, yet that little is all he can do, and no Thanks to him for not doing more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paragraph</hi> 2. I ſhall now conſider the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſecond Paragraph; where I find, he complains of the Aſſembly's mixing or blending Things together, in ſuch a Manner, that he cannot be free to pay the Tax; and in the ſame Paragraph ſaith, that he is willing to pay the Tax in two Articles, which are, to ſupport the diſtreſſed Inhabitants, and maintain our Alliance with the friendly <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, in my Opinion, this is a ſtrange Way of Reaſoning: What, muſt the Aſſembly make three ſeveral and diſtinct Acts, for raiſing one and the ſame Sum of Money, and the Whole of that Money to be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the ſame Intents and Purpoſes?</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, I ſay, unleſs this Province is protected under the Title of King GEORGE, it may be morally impoſſible to ſuppoſe we ſhall be able to help ourſelves. Under this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination the whole Money is diſtributed.— It is true, the Act ſaith, to relieve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Inhabitants; but that Money is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the King's Uſe, as well as the reſt; unleſs they believe the Relieving the Back In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants is of no Uſe to the King. If ſo, by the ſame Parity of Reaſon, we may ſuppoſe, the whole Province lieth under the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
            <p>And that Money which hath been given to the <hi>Indians,</hi> was with the ſame View (though to little Purpoſe) in order to ſecure their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by which Means there might be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007635_0020_102D9724C714AEE0"/>
held with them in Trade; which Trade muſt certainly augment the Incomes of the Crown; and to prevent their killing the Inhabitants, and weaken the King, in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Dominions.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I ſhall obſerve the Clergyman's Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to pay his Part of the preſent Tax: He ſaith, he is willing to pay a Part, and at the ſame time he refuſes to pay the Whole; <hi>No, we will not pay one Penny.</hi> Here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, as well as ſtrange; that he ſhould be willing to comply with a Part of the Act, and at the ſame Moment cannot comply with any Part of that Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paragraph</hi> 3. In this Paragraph, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he is principled againſt Wars, both offenſive and defenſive; and for that Reaſon cannot pay the Tax.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This being a Matter which toucheth Conſcience, I ſhall not diſpute it with him, well remembering the Apoſtle's Expreſſion, <hi>Let every Man be fully</hi> convinced <hi>in his own Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paragraph</hi> 4. I obſerve, in this Paragraph, he hath produced a Suppoſition, as the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of his Argument, when he ſaith, we ſuppoſe there <hi>may be</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> War; and if ſo, ſome of the Monies will doubtleſs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to that Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If this be a ſufficient Argument in this Province, to refuſe paying Tax, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> it is much more ſo; where a War may be daily expected. But Suppoſition can be no Argument to deter any Perſon in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007635_0021_102D9726FA933570"/>
paying his juſt Debts. Neither doth it appear, with any Colour of Reaſon, that we ſhould refuſe paying Tax, under a Suppoſition that it will be appropriated to this, or the other Uſe. It is certainly none of our Buſineſs which Way the King, or his Miniſters, lay out his Money.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Majority of the Houſe, as he ſaith, were of his Religion, he can, with more Confidence, refuſe to pay the Tax.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This muſt certainly be a wrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation; for if they were of his Religion, they would act for his Safety, as much as the Nature of the Caſe would admit of; becauſe they are ſubject to the ſame Act themſelves.</p>
            <p>Our Aſſembly is compoſed of ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who were deemed the ſuitableſt Men (in their ſeveral Counties, where they are beſt known) to repreſent the People, doubtleſs for ſome apparent Virtues; and as this is the Caſe, I look upon it as a Slight to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, to thus refuſe to comply with their conſciencious Performances, and in this ſo juſt a Cauſe, where we are commanded by CHRIST, to obey, <hi>viz. Render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am of Opinion, that a Sett of Men could hardly be found, who would have acted more judiciouſly than they have done, in forming that Act, both for Eaſe of Church and State. For as they repreſent the whole Province, they repreſent the Members of every religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in it; and as no one Denomination can be exempted from refunding this Tax, the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007635_0022_102D9729419F5C08"/>
Whole have an equal Right in the Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of it.</p>
            <p>And as a Part of the Houſe was of Opinion, that it was neceſſary to defend the Province againſt the Encroachments of a barbarous and ſavage Heathen, who have committed Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Murders in Time of Peace, I ſay, as a Part of the Houſe thus thought it their Duty, would it not have appeared diſingenuous in the reſt to have withſtood it, and under this Conſideration, as a Part of the Money was their own? But, as the Clergyman owns them to be of his Religion, they muſt certainly be acquainted with the Rules of that Religion as well as he; and if ſo, he muſt think they have fail'd a little, or we muſt think he hath pick'd up ſome new Matter, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was never thought on before.</p>
            <p>Towards the latter End of the Paragraph he ſaith, "As they thought fit to lay this Burden upon us, I think we may with much more Freedom refuſe to pay it."</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, it hath not appeared to me, by the Minutes of that Council, that there was any Burden at all; it is true, there is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which, to me, appeareth only an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, and may poſſibly lull ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People into a Kind of Lethargy. But, I think I may ſafely conclude, that there is neither Divinity, Scripture, Law, nor Reaſon, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>But how could he with more Freedom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay it, becauſe they were of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? For it plainly appeareth to me, that it
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007635_0023_102D972BC929BFB8"/>
is an Eſſay towards a Diviſion; for I preſume, we muſt all allow the Legiſlators to be Head of the State; and it has been the Caſe, for many Ages paſt, that the Clergy have claimed the Title, of being Head of the Church; and whenever theſe two Powers claſh, it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been attended with ill Conſequence to the Commonalty: But, in this preſent Affair, it may be in that Society of which he himſelf is a Member, and doubtleſs will occaſion ſome Debate; notwithſtanding, I have Reaſon to believe the Majority will pay their Tax, well knowing, by this Time, they have for their Example the Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>But what Buſineſs have Goſpel Miniſters with the Affairs of the King? Will they not take CHRIST for an Example in the one Thing nor the other? You may read, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought to make CHRIST a King over them, he withdrew himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World; the Princes of the Earth uſurp Authority over one another, but it ſhall not be ſo with you.</hi> I think it is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Maxim, that every Miniſter of CHRIST muſt make CHRIST his Example; and if ſo, I alſo believe they are quite exempt from State Affairs; their particular Buſineſs is, "to mind themſelves, and their Gifts; to exerciſe their paſtoral Function, according to their ſeveral Denominations of Religion;" and while thus ſituated, they may be of Service in the Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſert one more Text of Scripture, which hath a full Connection with the above, which was wrote by no leſs than the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007635_0024_102D972F4F24D0D8"/>
to the <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> xiii. 1. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God; the Powers that be, are ordained of God. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God;</hi> and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Verſe 5. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but alſo for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience Sake. For, for this Cauſe pay you Tribute alſo; for they are God's Miniſters, attending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon this very Thing. Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whom Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this ſmall Tract, with mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Remarks on our preſent King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence towards his Subjects, under their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Denominations of Religion: I believe, the good Qualities of a Monarch were never diſplayed under a more agreeable Appellation than that of <hi>Charity;</hi> I think the Apoſtle ſheweth us, that it is the Height of Virtue, and that without it all our Performances are invalid. With this Virtue our King hath ſhewed himſelf familiar in divers Reſpects; for he hath ever appeared an affectionate King to his Subjects, particularly in that of granting free Liberty to every religious Society to act in the Manner they think beſt; this is a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege that for many Ages of the World could never be enjoyed, neither can it be, at this Time, in ſeveral other Nations: Ought we not to look on this as the greateſt Favour that can be granted by any Monarch? I think it
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007635_0025_102D973392E26190"/>
lays the greateſt Conſtraint upon Mankind to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to ſerve God, and honour the King.</p>
            <p>I look upon it as our abſolute Duty to join heartily together in every Affair, reſpecting the Preſervation of his ſacred Perſon, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his Realm, in that great Duty of paying Tax; becauſe, by a diligent Inſpection, I cannot find, that either the King or his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have laid any Injunction upon us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly or indirectly, that interferes with revealed Religion; and reſpecting tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, I believe the King has been as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in hurting of them, as we have been in maintaining of them as we ought to do. For Inſtance, even at the Time when the Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er landed his infernal Crew, and marched into <hi>England,</hi> with a View to ſubject the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Power, and aſſaſſinate his Royal Perſon; yet at this critical Juncture I never underſtood that he ſummoned one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his Aſſiſtance, that made a Scruple of Conſcience in bearing Arms. Are not thoſe valuable Privileges too lightly look'd upon at this Time, by thoſe who refuſe to pay Tribute to whom Tribute is due? And at a Time when a War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at a Time when our Fellow-Subjects in <hi>Britain,</hi> of every Denomination, payeth a Tax of <hi>Four Shillings</hi> in the Pound? I wiſh this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented and unhappy Circumſtance, when laid before his Majeſty, may not occaſion him to think there is ſome Reaſon to enquire into the Circumſtance of Affairs in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
