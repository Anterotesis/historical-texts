            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOthing can hurt us but sin; and that shall not hurt us, if we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it. And nothing can do us good but the love and favour of God in Christ; and that we shall have if we seek it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No man is in a sad condition, but he that hath a hard heart, and cannot pray.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So much Sin, so much Sorrow; so much Holiness, so much Happiness.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Make thy sin thy greatest sorrow; so shall thy sorrow never hurt thee. Make Jesus Christ thy greatest joy, so shalt thou never want joy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A man that hath the Spirit of prayer, hath more then if he had all the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Two things he commended to a Married Couple, <hi>Cares</hi> &amp; <hi>Strifes:</hi> for the first, Let your Cares be, which shall please God most: For your strifes, let them be, which shall love one another best: so will your cares &amp; strifes be to purpose; so will all needless cares and strifes vanish.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000174_0003_0FA2B5D4B6580C60"/>7. If you be in a Married Estate know and believe it, Though you might have had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or richer wife or Husband yet sure enough you could never have had a fitter, Because it was so appointed by God in heaven, before it could be accomplished here on earth; and therefore, though mutual love be not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to thee, yet do thou thy part in obedience to God, and thou shalt be sure to have comfort in the end, though God exercise thee with chastisements for a time.</p>
            <p n="8">8 There can no afflictions and miseries befall us, but by Gods appointment; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us, but must needs do us good, if we be Gods Children. But <hi>first,</hi> be sure you mix not sin with them, for that only makes them bitter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Look not at the rod, but at him that smiteth; for that causeth fretting and fainting both.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If thou desirest to be assured thy sins be forgiven thee, labour to forgive injuries and offences done unto thee, according to that in <bibl>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15.</bibl> Four things consider to this end; 1. Christ example, who forgave and prayed for his enemies. 2. Christs command, <hi>When ye pray, forgive, if ye have ought against
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000174_0004_0FA2B5D5B66E9DB8"/>
any man.</hi> 3. Christs promise, <hi>If ye forgive, ye shall be forgiven.</hi> 4. Christs threatning, <hi>If ye forgive not, ye shall not be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In all miseries and distresses, 'tis best wisdom to go to that friend that is most near, most willing, and most able to help; such a friend is God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He would often say, he had no reason to complain of his crosses, being they were but the bitter fruit of his sins.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Where sins lye heavy, crosses lye light: and contrary, where crosses lye heavy, sins lye light.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Either Prayer will make a man give over sinning, or sin will make a man give over praying.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Four things we may learn from chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 1. They take no unnecessary care. 2. They sleep without malice. 3. They are content with their condition. 4. They are humble; the child of a king will play with the child of a beggar.</p>
            <p n="15">15. There is no affliction so small, but we should sink under it if God upheld not; and there is no sin so great, but we should commit it, if God restrained not.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000174_0005_0FA2B5D761232398"/>16. If we be railed on, or reviled, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously dealt withall by friend or foe, we should be more troubled for the sin against God, then for the offence done to our selves.</p>
            <p n="17">17. A godly man is like a sheep, every place is the better for him where he comes. A wicked man is like a goat, every place is the worse for him; He leaves a stinking favour behind him.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Sanctified afflictions are spiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and are far better for a Christian then all the silver and gold in the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>the tryal of our faith is much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then of gold that perisheth,</hi> 
               <bibl>1 Per. 1.6.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Directions for the Lords day. Make the Sabbath the market day for thy soul. Lose not one hour, but be either praying, conferring, or meditating; think not thy own thoughts; let every day have its duties; turn the Sermon heard into matter of prayer; Instruction into petition, Reproof into confession, Consolation into Thanksgiving: Think much of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon heard, and make something of it all the week long.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Directions for every day. First, for Morning. Every morning presuppose, 1. I must dye. 2. I may dye ere night. 3. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000174_0006_0FA2B5D7B81B28C0"/>
will my soul go, to heaven or to hell? Secondly, for Night. Every night ask thy soul these questions. 1. Have I twice this day humbled my self before God in private? 2. How did I pray? in faith and love? 3. What have my thoughts been this day? 4. What have I been in my place and calling? 5. What have I been in company? Did I speak of good things? or did I hear, and with <hi>Mary</hi> lay up? 6. If God with the morning renewed mercies was I thankful? 7. If the day afforded me mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sorrow, did I fret? or did I lye in the dust before God? 8. When you have done, where you have been failing, confess it with sorrow; the less work you will have to do when death comes. Thus every night reckon right with thy God. This hath been my daily course, and shall be my practice till I dye.</p>
            <p n="21">21. What we win by prayer, we shall wear with comfort.</p>
            <p n="22">22. There is a twofold <hi>Assurance:</hi> 1. A sun-shine. 2. A moon-shine assurance in <bibl>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</bibl> The moon-shine is that of the word, <hi>to the which we do well that we take heed,</hi> 
               <bibl>1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 5. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.</bibl> The first is given but to few, and that but seldom; and that either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some great duty to be performed, or some
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000174_0007_0FA2B5D9F2830F90"/>
new condition of life to be entred into, or upon some great sufferings to be undergone, of which one faith, <hi>The hours it comes is but seldom, and the stay of it is short.</hi> The second is that we must trust to, A relying upon the sure word of God by the faith of adherence, when we want the other, the spirit of full assurance.</p>
            <p n="23">23. For the comfort of Gods people, he observed out of the 129 Psalm, That though the wicked were the plowers of the righteous, and would plow deep, make long furrows, and even plow their hearts out if they could; yet the righteous Lord that sits in Heaven, laughs at them, and cuts their cords, and they then can plow no more.</p>
            <p n="24">24. In case of persecutions, and other suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Gods people should seriously consider these four things: 1. <hi>God</hi> wills them and sends them: now <hi>God'</hi>s will is a perfect rule of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and what <hi>God</hi> doth, is so well done, that it could not be better done. 2. There is need of them, or else we should not have them. 3. Their number, measure and countinuance, is determined by <hi>God;</hi> they are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and last but for a few days, <bibl>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10.</bibl> not too heavy, too many, or too long, as the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000174_0008_0FA2B5DB38F84638"/>
Devil would have them; not too few, too short or too light, as our corrupt natures would have them. 4 Their end is <hi>a weight of glory,</hi> and the crown that attends them, everlasting, <bibl>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17</bibl>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. Three things make a man count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self happy here below: 1. To have a good estate. 2. To have it in a good place. And 3. By good Neighbours. Now these three, they that die in the Lord, eminently enjoy. 1. Their heavenly inheritance is great; <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard the like,</hi> 
               <bibl>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</bibl> 2. 'Tis in a good place, <bibl>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</bibl> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is a House made for them, and made by <hi>God,</hi> and therefore must needs be good. 3. By good neighbours; <hi>God,</hi> Christ, the spirit, angels, and saints. <hi>Adam</hi> had a good inheritance, and in a good place, but he had an evil neighbour of the Devil, that troubled him, and marred all: but there's no ill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="26">26. The Passions of <hi>God'</hi>s people do not hinder the success of their Prayers; <hi>Elias</hi> was a man subject to like Passions as we are, and he prayed, and was heard, <bibl>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 17.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p n="27">27. Three things do concurr to the making up of the sin against the holy Ghost: 1. Light
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000174_0009_0FA2B5DC694B8C68"/>
in the mind. 2. Malice in the heart. 3. The insensibleness of the sin: He that fears he hath committed it, hath not committed it.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The reason why many are not wrought upon that live under powerful means of grace, when many that live at a great distance, and come seldome under a powerful preacher, are wrought upon by it; he used to give by this similitude: As in a Market-town, the Towns people matter not so much for market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, as they that live in the Country, they come to buy, and must and will have what they want, what ever they pay for it; whereas they that live in the town, think they may buy at any time, and so neglect buying at present; and at last, oftentimes they are disappointed.</p>
            <p n="29">29. To perswade us not to returne railing for railing, he would say, that if a dog barked at a sheep, a sheep will not bark at a dog.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Four arguments against immoderate cares for earthly things, that we might not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor or deny God, he observed out of <bibl>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 1.</bibl> 'Tis needless. 2. 'Tis Brutish. 3. 'Tis Bootless. 4. 'Tis Heathenish. 1. Needless, What need we care, and God too? <bibl>
                  <hi>vers.</hi> 30, 31, 32.</bibl> 
               <hi>Our heavenly Father knows we have need of these
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000174_0010_0FA2B5DD0B542580"/>
things,</hi> and he bids us <hi>be careful for nothing, but cast our cares on him who careth for us.</hi> 2. 'Tis Brutish, nay more then brutish, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fowls of the air, and ravens that he feeds, they toyl not.</hi> 3. It is bootless, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit to his stature,</hi> or peny to his estate? 4. It is heathenish; <hi>After all these things the Gentiles seek,</hi> v. 32.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Many in the world take their Saintship upon trust, and trade in the duties of religion, with the credit thy have gained from others opinions; they believe themselves to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, because others hope them to be such; and so zealously trade in duties that lie out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, to keep their credit; but never look for a stock of solid Grace within; and this undoes many.</p>
            <p n="32">32. As we read of <hi>daily bread,</hi> so of a <hi>daily cross,</hi> 
               <bibl>
