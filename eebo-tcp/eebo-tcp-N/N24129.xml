            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN January laſt, I publiſhed <hi>The American Annual Regiſter for</hi> 1796. My collection of materials required more room than had been expected, and it was found neceſſary to cloſe the volume without completing the plan.</p>
            <p>Some gentlemen, who wiſhed to ſee the publication proceed, offered to aſſiſt by ſubſcriptions for a ſecond volume. But this was unſuitable, becauſe perſons who had not ſeen the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer one could not with propriety be aſked to ſubſcribe for a continuation of it. I therefore began the ſame taſk over again under a different title page. The ſubject was fertile, and repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of what had been ſaid already have been avoided with ſo much care that they do not, in whole, extend to near half a page.</p>
            <p>On the appearance of the former volume, certain critics complained of my ſtile. The roughneſs of their own, in the inſtant of condemnation, afforded the beſt apology for the faults of mine. But moreover theſe refined literati were the patrons and prompters of William Cobbet. He had ſpoke of me, with his wonted politeneſs, in ten or twelve pamphlets. It was proper, as it ſeems, that I ſhould be ſilent, becauſe the two chaplains of Congreſs, the ſecretaries of ſtate and of the treaſury were in the number of his auxiliaries or admirers. I would not injure Mr. Cobbet by comparing him with his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers. The bench and jury who aſſaſſinated lord Stafford were ſtill more execrable than Titus Oates.</p>
            <p>In this catalogue of the patrons of genius we find Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Liſton. The Britiſh ambaſſador, not contented with paying Mr. Cobbet for his labours, receives a daily bundle of his gazettes. No perſon poſſeſſing the feelings of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would ſuffer that commodity to come within his door. Such intermeddling from a foreign envoy would not be endured by any independent country in the world, unleſs in the United States of America. A French envoy at London, or an Engliſh ambaſſador at Paris, never ſets up a newſpaper to recommend
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:031906_0008_0FEF424D2739D308"/>
his meaſures. Neither the old monarchy nor the preſent republic of France, would, for a ſingle day, have endured ſuch a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In London, where the ſpirit of national independence is underſtood and felt, the firſt news of the Morning Chronicle being ſupported by a French penſion, would level the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's office with the pavement. But Mr. Liſton goes farther. He correſponds with internal traitors. He is detected, and the moſt deſpicable, or rather the moſt proſtituted of all cabinets, hath accepted of his refuſal to reveal their names. To trace the conſpiracy, Congreſs appoints a committee of five mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Of theſe, three are tories, and one of them is Robert Goodloe Harper, the intimate friend of Liſton, the adviſer of a Spaniſh war, and of the conqueſt of Mexico. This is a new way to diſcover plots.</p>
            <p>When the fifth number of this book was publiſhed, Mr. Alexander Hamilton printed, in Mr. Fenno's gazette, a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his connection with Reynolds. He has now come from New-York to complete a ſatisfactory ſtatement. Like the pot whitewaſhing the kettle, he has already received from Mr. Wolcot a certificate of his virtue. He is, at preſent, alſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mr. Monroe and Mr. Muhlenberg, on both of whom he had heaped mountains of calumny. Mr. Hamilton entreats them, to atteſt his <hi>innocence,</hi> that is to ſay, their belief of his having <hi>debauched Mrs. Reynolds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The variety of articles tranſmitted for reviſal and publication was unexpected, and many have been delayed for want of room. The denial of acceſs to ſubſcribers appeared an ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious taſk. A compliance with their wiſhes made it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſhorten the latter part of the narrative, and to leave out ſome entire chapters that were prepared for the preſs. This gives to the volume a miſcellaneous texture, which the rigid remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is entitled to condemn. At another time, I ſhall perhaps do better.</p>
            <p>A report has been circulated, that Mr. John Beckley is the author of this volume. He did not frame a ſingle ſentence of it. He is unacquainted with my hand writing, and I could not be ſure to diſtinguiſh his.</p>

                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap>  day of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap>  it ſhall not be lawful for any foreign ſhip or veſſel to land in the territories of the United States any goods, wares, or merchandize other than the produce of that country to which <hi>the ſhip or veſſel belongs.</hi>
                  </q> This propoſal was profeſſedly pointed at the treaty of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:031906_0010_0FEF42514506D1C8"/>
commerce with Britain, which had been ſigned at London on the 19th of November, 1794, by Mr. John Jay, as envoy on the part of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Mr. S. Smith oppoſed that inſtrument. He ſaid in Congreſs, that, within two years, it might be expected to deſtroy the ſhipping of this country. The fifteenth article of the treaty has theſe words: <q>Nor ſhall any prohibition be impoſed on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation or the importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, which ſhall not equally extend to all other nations.</q> Thus the reſolution was in ſtrict har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with the conditions of the treaty; yet, if the United States ſhall ever carry it into execution, the treaty itſelf will, in ſome meaſure, be at an end. Britain could find a thouſand effective ways of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing her diſguſt at this regulation, which would incommode her much more than the other mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſtates of Europe. Still ſhe would have leſs reaſon to complain than any nation in the world, becauſe the reſolution is grounded on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſumed in the Engliſh act of navigation<note n="*" place="bottom">On the 2d of September, 1793, the French Convention paſſed a ſimilar act. Its operation is only ſuſpended on account of the war. By the firſt article, no foreign commodities can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into France, but in French veſſels, or in thoſe of the country which produces them, or of the country from which they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally firſt exported. By the ſecond, no foreign veſſel can convey from one port of France or her colonies to another, any of their produce. Third, every French veſſel muſt have her officers and three-fourths of her crew Frenchmen. It is amazing that the court of Verſailles did not adopt this rule an hundred years ago. It will, in a ſhort time, double or quadruple the number of French ſeamen. Were other omens averted, this law is an epitaph on the naval ſupremacy of Britain. See an eloquent report by BARRERE.</note>.</p>
               <p>The treaty in queſtion has produced many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of elaborate inveſtigation. Since the new conſtitution, no other ſubject has excited ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral an effort of the ingenuity, the eloquence, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:031906_0011_0FEF42566FE27028"/>
the paſſions of America. It was this emergency which marked out the preſent year as more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently deſerving of hiſtorical notice. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter itſelf daily grows in importance, as this tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has brought the United States to the verge of a French war. Few have leiſure to read, and ſtill fewer have information or even capacity ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to comprehend a great part of the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted arguments employed for or againſt it. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a detail of the topics on each ſide would be a voluminous, and by this time, almoſt an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs undertaking. The public has already become ſatiated with eſſays, letters, memorials, replies, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, features, reports, addreſſes, views, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, defences, paragraphs, reſolutions, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, explanations, proceedings of town meetings, motions, and ſpeeches. Within the ſhort ſpace of eighteen months, the argument has entirely ſhifted its place. The ſtreſs of the debate can be no longer about whether the Britiſh treaty is advantageous or prejudicial to American commerce; but whether it is worth preſerving at the riſk of a French war. That the Directory of Paris have this object ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in their eye is moſt likely. The recall of their ambaſſador, citizen Adet, was a broad inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their deſign. In Europe, ſuch a ſtep is the profeſſed ſignal for hoſtilities. It is as certain that a party in this country are ſolicitous of driving the United States into that conteſt. If a croud of other evidences could be forgotten, their abſence is ſupplied by the letter from ſecretary Pickering to Mr. Pinckney our ambaſſador to the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. At the ſame time, attempts are conſtantly made to decry the power of France. When a French general chances to retreat, the newſpapers of the party teem with exultation. The republic at large is invariably repreſented as a rendezvous of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031906_0012_0FEF4259B933BCE0"/>
ruffians, a nuiſance to civilized ſociety. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the French ſhould fail of being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at ſuch unprovoked inſolence. They hire no gazettes in Paris to revile America. They do not fill libraries in cenſuring our political characters. Yet our federal prints attack, on every occaſion, both the republic and all her friends, in the moſt vulgar ſtyle of abuſe. Even the miniſterial prints of London, the organs of Roſe and Dundas, are, by many degrees, leſs inſolent in their invective, and leſs brutal in their reproach<note n="*" place="bottom">For inſtance, a late correſpondent in the Gazette of the United States writes thus: <q>That contemptible and drunken vagabond TOM PAINE, who is notoriouſly deſtitute of every honeſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, religious, moral, or political, has crowned his career of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and falſehood, &amp;c.—This creature of avaricious poverty and deranged ambition, would ſet the world on fire, if he could find ſixpence by the fight, and advocate the climate and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hell to be popular there.—He was, at the commencement of our troubles, a decided friend to the meaſures of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</q> After the war, <q>his firſt attack was upon the <hi>tranquility</hi> of Great Britain: but here he was diſgracefully defeated.</q> [It will be time enough to ſpeak of his <hi>defeat</hi> when the bank of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to pay its notes in gold and ſilver. The preſent paper-money plan is like trying to croſs the Atlantic in a cork jacket.] <q>I regret there was found any man in the United States ſo baſe and hoſtile to the peace and honour of his country, as to publiſh this letter of infamy;</q> the letter from Paine to general Waſhington, printed by Mr. Bache. The peace of the country runs no hazard, and as little awaits the honour of the general. On the 14th of December, 1796, Dr. Ames obſerved in Congreſs, that <q>the character is fixed in <hi>hiſtory!</hi>
                     </q> Paine, therefore, has come too late.</note>.</p>
               <p>Before going farther, we ſhall glance at the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and actual ſtate of the French, whom Mr. Pickering and his friends are ſo anxious to degrade. In preparing for a quarrel it is eſſential to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the talents and reſources of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt. The ſituation of our citizens, thinly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over an immenſe continent, affords a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar avenue to deception. It has been employed with diligence againſt the republic. On a topic
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031906_0013_0FEF425D9D6711B0"/>
of ſuch univerſal Importance candid explanation can hardly be tedious. No better authority will be required than that of Edmund Burke. Two letters from him on this head have been recently printed. A few detached ſentences, extracted from whole ſheets to the ſame purpoſe, will place the reſources of France in a juſt light, and ſhew what the United States have to expect in a conteſt with her. <q>Out of the tomb of the murdered monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in France, has ariſen a vaſt, tremendous, unformed ſpectre, in <hi>a far more terrific guiſe</hi> than any which ever yet overpowered the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and ſubdued the fortitude of man.—The republic has actually conquered the fineſt parts of Europe, has diſtreſſed, diſunited, deranged, and broke to pieces all the reſt.—We have not in the ſlighteſt degree, impaired the ſtrength of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, (France), in any one of thoſe points in which his particular force conſiſts.—The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide has received our advances with ſcorn<note n="*" place="bottom">The letters were publiſhed before Malmeſbury went to Paris.</note>!— If things ſhould give us <hi>the comparative happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſtruggle,</hi> I ſhall be found dying by the ſide of Mr. Pitt.—Spain is a province of the ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin empire.—Her crown is a fief of regicide.— We have not conſidered, as we ought, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful energy of a ſtate in which the property has nothing to do with the government.—The diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is dreadful, the mine <hi>exhauſtleſs.</hi>—A repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of a character the moſt reſtleſs, the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing, the moſt impious, the moſt fierce and bloody, the moſt hypocritical and perfidious, the moſt bold and daring that has ever been ſeen, or indeed that can be conceived to exiſt!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Burke is far from being ſingular in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. Major Cartwright, in his work, entitled, <hi>The
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031906_0014_0FEF425F65341028"/>
Commonwealth in Danger,</hi> ſhews the folly of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land depending for ſafety, ſolely on her fleet. The French may give battle by ſea, be defeated, and loſe twenty ſhips of the line, without material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. They know that the Engliſh muſt be crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and return to port. The road is then open, and they diſembark in Britain what troops they pleaſe. The major adds, that, previous to the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the 1ſt of June, 1794, admiral Howe was reviled for not beating the French fleet; but even then, he only did ſo becauſe the French came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely in his way. They alſo, by ſacrificing a few ſhips of the line, gained their object. This was to ſecure the arrival of an American convoy with proviſions. Arthur Young, a third writer of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, has demonſtrated the depth of his deſpair by the following propoſal; viz. that England ſhould raiſe an army of five hundred thouſand men; and that they, as well as their officers, muſt all be <hi>men of property.</hi> He ſays that nothing elſe can ſave the country from a French conqueſt. This was above two years ago<note n="*" place="bottom">See An Idea of the preſent State of France, printed ſometime previous to March, 1795.</note>. Theſe authorities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the lamentations of Mr. Burke. As to his picture of what France can perform, we may judge by what ſhe hath ſuffered. In March, 1795, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier printed at Hamburgh, a very intereſting pamphlet on the ſtate of the war. He therein ſays, that, in December, 1794, a report was laid before the Convention of the number of ſoldiers whom France had loſt by her three campaigns. They were ſtated at ſix hundred and fifty thouſand. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourier adds, that this computation was by one-third part leſs than the truth; and that, including emigration, famine, and the ſcaffold, France had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031906_0015_0FEF420ECB32C2A0"/>
then loſt twelve hundred thouſand men, in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of life, beſides aged perſons, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Compared with this havoc of the human ſpecies, the waſte of any other modern war is but trifling. The king of Pruſſia eſtimates that the war of 1756, which laſted ſeven years, deſtroyed, in the whole, and in all parts of the world, only about a million of ſoldiers. To the twelve hundred thouſand Frenchmen we may ſafely add eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand from the allied armies; ſince the latter were equally numerous with the republicans, and beſides were beaten. We have thus about two millions of deaths, in two years and four months, or above eight hundred thouſand per annum; ſo that the preſent war is at leaſt five times more deſtructive than that of 1756.</p>
               <p>No other nation or government that the world ever ſaw, could have ſupported ſuch enormous loſſes as the French have endured; yet their ſtrength appears undiminiſhed, and every campaign adds to the catalogue of their conqueſts. It is not leſs than madneſs for a party in America to be hiring newſpapers to revile ſuch a terrible people. They are not only moſt formidable from their phyſical ſtrength, but from the peculiar ſtructure of their government. <q>It is ſyſtematic; ſays Mr. Burke, it is ſimple to its principle; it has unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in perfection.</q> [Congreſs have refuſed to impoſe a land tax. Nay ſome of them, with ſurpriſing hardineſs, declare ſuch a meaſure imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, though land taxes are at this moment paid in perhaps every ſtate of the union. Pennſylvania has three or four. Oppoſed to this frivolity, this puppet-ſhew of legiſlation, obſerve what Burke tells of France:] <q>In that country, entirely to cut off a branch of commerce, to extinguiſh a manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to deſtroy the circulation of money, to

violate credit, to ſuſpend the courſe of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even to burn a city or to lay waſte a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of their own, does not coſt them a moment's anxiety.—Going ſtraight forward to its end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appalled by peril, unchecked by remorſe, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all common maxims and all common means, that hideous phantom overpowered thoſe <hi>who could not believe it poſſible ſhe could at all exiſt!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is the ſort of enemy whom we may chance to encounter, as the price of the Britiſh treaty, and the epiſtle of Mr. Pickering. When in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mr. Burke was conſidered as the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed member of the Houſe of Commons. He has long been the oracle of Engliſh ariſtocracy. He is a penſioner to Pitt, and would be ſorry to overcharge the picture of French power.</p>
               <p>It is ſerving America, to make a ſhort compariſon between the relative force of the two nations. The French, in only four years, have overcome the German empire, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the Netherlands, comprehending not leſs than fifty millions of people. The United States, white, black and yellow, have not five millions. The French have drubbed three Britiſh kingdoms, with their popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fourteen millions, and cruſhed numerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and rebellions in the heart of their country. The revolt of La Vendee alone coſt as much fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as paſſed in America during the revolution. Pichegru, in one campaign, did what Marlborough, though conſtantly victorious, could not accompliſh in ten.</p>
               <p>In 1794, France maintained nearly eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand fighting men, and was, in 1795, to have ſixty thouſand cannoneers<note n="*" place="bottom">Carey's edition of Guthrie's Geography, vol. ii. p. 699.</note>. In 1797, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, by the report of Oliver Wolcot<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 18.</note>, was to

Even this handful coſt infinite haggling in Congreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">The particulars will appear in the next volume.</note>; and the greateſt anxiety how they were to be paid. The French are the beſt appointed troops, perhaps, in the world. From an immenſe diſtance, they have been often tranſported in waggons to the field of battle. The pay of American regulars is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute beggary. The privates have a ration per day worth twenty cents, or ſeventy two dollars and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cents a year. Their pay is four dollars per month, or forty-eight dollars a year. An annual ſuit of clothes are valued at twenty-five dollars, ſo that the accounts ſtands thus;

               <p>Every man who can handle an axe may gain dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſum, and have his victuals into the bargain. For ſuch a pittance our ſoldiers, in war, penetrate the wilderneſs to fight an enemy who give no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

regular forces of France and the United States. They are as one man to three or four hundred. Our expences equal or exceed our revenues. Congreſs have refuſed to attempt a land tax. All other ſources are about exhauſted; and a war with France, by the ruin of our commerce, would certainly cut off a great part of thoſe ariſing from it. Nine parts in ten of the public taxes proceed from the duties on impoſt and tonnage. In the land tax debates of Congreſs, laſt winter, Mr. Harper ſtrangely ſaid, that, if at war with France, our trade would not, in his opinion, ſuffer more than it does already. He inferred that our revenues would not, by that event, be materially reduced.</p>
               <p>If we look at the ſea there is no proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a conteſt with France. We have on the ſtocks three frigates. Of their navy an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count cannot here be given, but it has, for a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, been the ſecond in Europe. It lately was ſaid to contain three hundred and thirty-ſeven veſſels. An hundred and twenty one were ſhips of the line. Of theſe the leaſt carry ſeventy four guns<note n="*" place="bottom">Carey's edition of Guthrie's Geography, vol. ii. p. 696.</note>. They would, in a conteſt with America, be ſeconded by Spain, Portugal, and Holland.

But then our privateers can deſtroy their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce! Yes. And they ſhall deſtroy ours. Thus, as Henry Fielding ſays, we ſell a blind horſe and receive a bad note in payment. Our ſeaport towns, from Portland to Savannah, will be ſucceſſively trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a range of bonfires. The ſhutting up of the Mediterranean and the weſtern waters would compoſe but an atom in the Alps of our calamity.

In a ſtruggle with France alone, unſupported by her allies, we could not muſter a tenth part of her force either by land or ſea. Mr. Pitt computed, in the Houſe of Commons, that the campaign of 1794, coſt the republic an hundred and fifty millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Ours with the Wyandots were eſtimated at a million of dollars yearly. The burden produced infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſcontent, and an earneſt deſire of peace. France, at an annual charge three or ſix hundred times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, continues to fight and to conquer, to trample every enemy, and to dictate the terms of every peace. To contend, if we can help it, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican Typhoeus would, in raſhneſs, reſemble the laſt ſtruggles of Jeruſalem and Palmira. On the altars of Titus and Aurelian we might read with probability the proſpect before us.</p>
               <p>As a political writer, Alexander Hamilton holds the ſame rank in America that Burke enjoys in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and it would be injuring the logic of his party not to give his opinion. Camillus, No. vii. was publiſhed in the ſummer of 1795, and contains a ſurvey of Europe extremely different from that of Mr. Burke. <q>It cannot be denied that ſhe (Britain) is triumphant on the ocean; that the acquiſitions which ſhe has made upon France are hitherto <hi>greater</hi> than thoſe which France has made upon her.</q> The reduction of two or three iſlands in the Weſt Indies is not worth notice in this conteſt, where the independence of Britain is in imminent danger. When No. vii. was written, the French had conquered Holland, and the Auſtrian Netherlands. <q>Holland, ſays Mr. Burke, is to England a matter of value <hi>ineſtimable.</hi>

For excluding them, an hundred ſhips of the line and an hundred canoes would be of equal importance. This, by the way, points out the folly of a favourite Britiſh maxim, that <hi>he who is maſter by ſea is maſter by land.</hi> While the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, therefore, continue a part of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, it is frivolous to ſpeak of Britiſh conqueſts in the Eaſt or Weſt Indies, or indeed any where elſe.

Britiſh credit has become, in a Britiſh mind, an article of <hi>faith,</hi> and is no longer an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reaſon.</q> [Thus Camillus tells us that the creditors of England are fools. The proſpects of a merchant are not very hopeful, when no man of prudence will truſt him. Yet ſuch is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of England as deſcribed by its advocate.] <q>Her government poſſeſſes, internally, as much vigor, and has as much national ſupport, as it perhaps ever had at any former period of her hiſtory. Alarmed by the unfortunate exceſſes in France, moſt men of property cling to the government, and carry with them the great bulk of the nation, almoſt the whole of the farming intereſt, and much the greateſt proportion of other induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous claſſes.</q>

               <p>Mr. Burke has the advantage of being on the ſpot;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031906_0021_0FEF4211473ECC20"/>
and he diſſents entirely from Mr. Hamilton. He eſtimates the number of Britiſh citizens who think for themſelves, at four hundred thouſand. Of theſe he computes that eighty thouſand are <q>pure jacobins, utterly incapable of amendment.— On theſe, no reaſon, no argument, no example, no venerable authority, can have the ſlighteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. They deſire a change, and they will have it if they can.—This minority is great and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. I do not know whether, if I aimed at the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal overthrow of a kingdom, <hi>I ſhould wiſh to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with a larger body of partiſans</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Letter I.</note>
                  </q> The London Courier, of the 26th of December, 1796, affirms, that theſe two letters were publiſhed by the connivance of <hi>the miniſter.</hi> Burke has penſions to the effective amount of about four thouſand pounds ſterling, ſo that this ſuppoſition becomes highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Thus the authority of Pitt is ſuperadded to that of Burke, and they explode the opinion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus. Each ſucceeding campaign is an additional nail driven into the head of monarchy. Every new tax makes a number of new enemies. Here we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive three diſtinct cauſes for a Britiſh revolution. Theſe are, a ſuperior and implacable enemy on the continent, whoſe local poſition makes a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh navy uſeleſs; a national debt, which by this time approaches to four hundred millions ſterling, and of which the very intereſt can be paid only in paper; and a party within the country whoſe enmity cannot be extinguiſhed, and who, by the confeſſion of their enemies, are abundantly numerous for the deſtruction of any government in the world. <q>Among her allies, ſays Camillus, are the two greateſt powers of Europe, France excepted; namely, Ruſſia and Auſtria. Spain and Sardinia
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031906_0022_0FEF4278EBEBFCF0"/>
make a common cauſe with her.</q> The two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have been turned by France into mere ſtepping ſtones in her path to the dominion of Europe. Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia never gave any help, more or leſs, to the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coalition. Catharine is now dead; and her ſon has declined any concern with it. But even if he did ſend an army to the Rhine, Britain would be obliged to pay them. As for Auſtria, Jaſper Wilſon, in his celebrated letter to Mr. Pitt, ſays, that, before the preſent war began, the Emperor was offering nine per cent for money, ſo that by this time he muſt be as much entangled in debt as England herſelf. Nothing but arbitrary power could enable him to pay even a ſingle regiment. This will not hold out long. <q>She (France) cannot, without great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, from their geographical poſition, make any farther acquiſitions upon the territories of Auſtria.</q> Carnot is a better geographer than Mr. Hamilton. Since this prediction, Moreau and Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan have penetrated into the heart of Germany. They have ſubdued a multitude of its princes, and were within a ſmall matter of reaching Vienna. As to Italy, Buonaparte has eclipſed every commander ſince Teleſinus and Sylla engaged under the walls of Rome. Hear what Burke ſays: <q>The over-running of Lombardy, the ſubjugation of Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, the poſſeſſion of its impregnable fortreſſes, the ſeizing on all the neutral ſtates of Italy, our expulſion from Leghorn, inſtances renewed for our expulſion from Genoa, Spain rendered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them and hoſtile to us, Portugal bent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke, half the empire over-run and rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter I.</note>.</q> This is the picture of 1796. Yet, in reliance on the political foreſight of Camillus, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous party in the United States have filled, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031906_0023_0FEF427A9EE51E60"/>
continue to fill <hi>their</hi> newſpapers with ſcurrilous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies againſt the French nation. They inſulted her ambaſſador, even after he had been recalled; and, as if this had not been enough to enſure a rupture, Mr. Pickering ſent a letter to Mr. Pinckney in France which is more in the tone of a libel than a diploma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic paper. When the blind lead the blind, we know the ſequel. With regard to Europe, Mr. Hamilton is, in all his views, miſtaken. This lamp of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom, has conducted America to the edge of a precipice from which General Waſhington ſaw fit to retire. It is of conſequence to expoſe the ſophiſtry of Mr. Hamilton, that our <hi>enlightened</hi> citizens may ſee by what ignorance they have been led into the preſent criſis. We ſhall, on this account, pick up two or three others of his miſtakes.</p>
               <p>"Britain and her poſſeſſions are <hi>eſſentially ſafe,</hi>" ſays Camillus, <q>while ſhe maintains a decided maritime ſuperiority.</q> Burke, in one of his letters, ſpeaking of the war of 1689, ſays, that <q>in two years three thouſand veſſels were taken from the Engliſh trade.</q> In every war, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Britain ſuffers prodigiouſly. The preſent ſtate of the Weſt Indies ſhews that a ſuperior fleet cannot always preſerve her iſlands. Witneſs the recapture of Guadaloupe, the conflagration of St. Vincents, Grenada, and St. Lucia! But the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hoche, to Ireland, is the beſt refutation of Mr. Hamilton. Some people ſpeak of the Britiſh navy as if it could be preſent every where at the ſame time. If twenty-five thouſand Frenchmen had diſembarked at Bantry bay, a march of two days would have brought them to Corke, a city as large as Philadelphia, diſaffected to government, and beſides entirely defenceleſs. Another week would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for reaching Dublin. The temper of its citizens appears by a letter from the viceroy.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031906_0024_0FEF427D3125BDC8"/>
He boaſts of having a militia of two thouſand bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters, attornies, merchants, and ſuch people. But theſe men would not mount guard, if they durſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the poorer claſſes to do ſo for them. Dublin has between two and three hundred thouſand inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and if the bulk of them had been well affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the militia might have amounted to twenty thouſand. His lordſhip ſays that the whole mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the iſland are about twenty-five thouſand. This is a pitiful portion in a population of four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>His lordſhip tells us, that when the ſoldiers went off to Bantry Bay, in queſt of the French, he granted their wives four pence per day till they returned. This was certainly a ſplendid allowance, and well worth fighting for. In a pamphlet printed in 1794, ſir Henry Clinton ſays, that <q>the army is now waiting to receive a very ſmall ſhare of plunder taken at the ſiege of <hi>Charleſtown!</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great take care of themſelves at leaſt. The hiſtory of <hi>The Crimes of the Kings of England,</hi> relates that the family of Mr. Pitt enjoy places and penſions to the amount of eighty-one thouſand pounds ſterling a year.</p>
                  </note>. It is hard to ſay whether the catholics of Connaught or the proteſtants of Ulſter would feel the greateſt impatience to join an invader. Thus the left arm of England would be cut off without, perhaps, even the honour of a battle. This is the <hi>eſſential ſafety</hi> that Mr. Hamilton ſpeaks about.</p>
               <p>In defiance of geography and hiſtory, Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus next endeavours to undervalue the conqueſt of the Netherlands. <q>France muſt be ſtill more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued and exhauſted even than her adverſaries. Her acquiſitions cannot materially vary this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; the Low Countries muſt have been <hi>pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well emptied</hi> before they fell into her hands.</q> He has more to the ſame effect. They are inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by about ſix millions of induſtrious people, among the richeſt in the world. The acquiſition was of immenſe importance. If Bruſſels and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam had been reduced to aſhes, and if a famine
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031906_0025_0FEF4280B7A43788"/>
like thoſe produced by Britiſh monopolies in Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, had whitened the whole country with the bones of its inhabitants, Camillus might have ſome reaſon for this inſinuation. The French did not think that Holland was <hi>emptied,</hi> as appears from their firſt requiſition. Among other articles, they demanded two hundred thouſand quintals of wheat, ſeventy-five millions of pounds weight of hay, fifty millions ditto of oats, and hundred and fifty thouſand pairs of ſhoes, two hundred thouſand ſhirts, with ſtraw, breeches, coats, waiſtcoats, overalls, hats, and ſo forth, all in one month, beſides twelve thouſand ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be furniſhed within two months. This enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhews the inaccuracy of Camillus, and what may be expected if the French diſembark at Mud iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Britiſh government maintains a proud and diſtant reſerve, <hi>repels every idea of peace,</hi> and inflexibly purſues the path of war.</q> Mr. Burke's two letters are half filled with lamentations for the debaſement of England. They hold out a ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous refutation of Alexander Hamilton. <q>The regicides were the firſt, ſaith St. Edmund, to declare war. We are the firſt <hi>to ſue for peace.</hi>— The ſpeech from the throne in the opening of the ſeſſion of 1795, threw out <hi>oglings</hi> and <hi>glances of tenderneſs.</hi> Leſt this <hi>coquetting</hi> ſhould ſeem too cold and ambiguous, the <hi>violent paſſion</hi> for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the regicides, produced,</q> &amp;c. This is the <hi>proud and diſtant reſerve</hi> deſcribed by Camillus.— <q>I do not know a more mortifying ſpectacle than to ſee the aſſembled majeſty of the crowned heads of Europe waiting as patient ſuitors in the anti-chamber of Regicide. They wait, it ſeems, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſanguinary tyrant, Carnot, ſhall have ſnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away the indigeſted fumes of the blood of his ſovereign.</q> The remainder of this ſcene
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031906_0026_0FEF4287C64BE488"/>
is admirably painted; but our envoy, Mr. Pinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is not, it appears, admitted even to the anti-chamber. He has been deſired to quit the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <q>At this ſecond humiliation it might not have been amiſs to pauſe and not to ſquander away <hi>the fund of our ſubmiſſions.</hi>
                  </q> A report from the Committee of Agriculture at London affirms, that the lands lying waſte in Britain, could be encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in value by <hi>twenty millions ſterling a year!</hi> They deferred this acquiſition to manufacture French kings.— <q>At Baſle, it was thought proper that Great Britain ſhould appear at this market, and bid with the reſt for <hi>the mercy</hi> of the people-king.</q> This is that republic which the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can emiſſaries of England are ſo buſy in provoking.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke then relates two fruitleſs applications made by England, the one at Berlin, by our friend Robert Hammond, and the other at Paris through the Daniſh ambaſſador. Both were rejected. <q>It might be thought that here, at length, we had touched the bottom of humiliation; our lead was brought up covered with mud. But <hi>in the loweſt deep, a lower deep</hi> was to open for us ſtill more profound abyſſes of diſgrace and ſhame. However, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> we leaped!.</hi>—The queſtion is not now how we are to be affected with it in regard to <hi>dignity.</hi> That is gone. I ſhall ſay no more about it. Light lie the earth on the aſhes of <hi>Engliſh pride</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Britain has good reaſon to be tired of this war. A late London newſpaper ſays, that, from 1775 to 1782, incluſive, there were three thouſand ſeven hundred and forty-two bankruptcies; and from 1793 to 1796, incluſive, three thouſand ſix hundred and eight. Thus <hi>four</hi> years of the preſent quarrel have done as much harm to the mercantile credit as <hi>eight</hi> years of the laſt.</note>!</q>
               </p>
               <p>We can now anſwer the query of Camillus. <q>How happens it that France with all her victories
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031906_0027_0FEF4289EC7921C0"/>
has not yet been able to <hi>extort peace!</hi>
                  </q> She never aſked for it. <q>It is probable, ſays he, the negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (Jay's treaty) received its firſt impreſſion and even its general outline anterior to the principal part of the diſaſters ſuſtained by the coaleſced powers in the courſe of the laſt campaign (1794).</q> If Jay had been warranted, as he was not, to make a treaty ſuch as he did, its firſt impreſſion would have been ſketched in America before he ſet out. But, as lately obſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, Chapter 8.</note>, the time choſen for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it was highly improper. Camillus, in ancient or modern annals, will hardly find that, with views merely commerical, any nation ever choſe ſo hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a time for entering into a treaty. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alone ſhould have laid the bargain on its back, at leaſt till the concluſion of a peace. It was juſt like building a houſe cloſe to another which is on fire. During the reſidence of Jay in England, every poſt brought him news of French victories. Hence, even if the outline of his paper had been ſketched before the conqueſt of Flanders, that deciſive event ſhould have taught him to make a pauſe. A ſuſpenſion of ſigning the treaty for only three months could not have ruined America. Theſe things were <hi>as huge as high Olympus.</hi> They pierced the deafeſt ear. They thruſt themſelves on the dulleſt underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The letter of Mr. Pinckney above referred to clearly admits the advantages that might have been gained by delay. <q>The buſineſs, upon the whole, ſays he, has been concluded more beneficially for us than I had any hope we could obtain by nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation <hi>ſix months ago,</hi> and, in my opinion, places us in a more advantageous ſituation than we ſhould have been in by becoming <hi>parties to the war.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:031906_0028_0FEF428C6064A9E0"/>
If ſo much had been acquired by one delay of ſix months, reaſon pointed out a ſecond poſtponement. Britain has been ever ſince going down hill, and had the affair been to begin at this time, we might have had any terms that could be deſired. The latter part of the above citation obliquely implies that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had no choice between a treaty and a war. The ſuppoſition gives a poor ſpecimen of the writer's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. How gladly ſome people would be at get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into war appears from the Aurora of the 5th of April 1797.—<q>
                     <hi>A correſpondent in the Centinel, ſays,</hi> that the people of this country are not YET ripe for an alliance offenſive and defenſive with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>but ſuggeſts that the event is probable.</hi>
                  </q> This paſſage points more clearly than uſual at the ultimate purpoſe of a certain party. If the alliance above recommended were to take place, the beſt fortune that we could look for would be that of Ulyſſes in the den of the Cyclops; we ſhould be reſerved as the laſt morſel. If any motive can drive out of our fancy a Britiſh alliance, it is to read the recent fate of the allies of England, as deſcribed by Mr. Burke. <q>They (the French) have hitherto conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined any other than a treaty with a ſingle pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.—In that light the regicide power finding each of them inſulated and unprotected, with great facility gives <hi>the law to them all.</hi> By this ſyſtem, for the preſent, an incurable diſtruſt is ſown amongſt the confederates; and in future all alliance <hi>is rendered impracticable.</hi> It is thus they have treated with Pruſſia, with Spain, with Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia, with Bavaria, with the eccleſiaſtical ſtates, with Saxony; and here we ſee them refuſe to treat with Great Britain in any other mode.</q> Suppoſe that we ſhall have entered into the alliance recommended by the Centinel, and that Britain, within ſix months, patches up a ſeparate peace,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031906_0029_0FEF429196594C58"/>
while Hoche's huſſars are whetting their ſabres in the barracks of Dublin. America would then make but a ſorry figure in a ſolitary negociation. Beſides, we cannot truſt our ally. This appears by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the journals of Congreſs, in the year 1779. <q>"We are contending, ſay they, againſt a kingdom <hi>crumbling to pieces</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">How does this agree with Camillus?</note>, a nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out public virtue, and a people ſold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by their own repreſentatives; againſt a prince governed by his paſſions, and a miniſtry without conſiſtency or wiſdom; againſt <hi>armies half paid,</hi> and <hi>generals</hi> half truſted [theſe were two flagrant falſehoods], againſt a government equal <hi>only</hi> (obſerve this <hi>only</hi>) to plans of plunder, conflagration, and murder, a government noted for its violations of the rights of <hi>religion,</hi> juſtice, humanity, and mankind, and revolting from <hi>the protection of Providence!</hi>"—"Our armies in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſwore terribly," ſaid uncle Toby, "but nothing like this!"</q> As for Providence, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England held frequent faſt days for military ſucceſs. This delicate ſpecimen of the mob-ſtile was part of a letter from Congreſs to their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and was draughted, at their deſire, by Mr. John Jay. They ſhould have ſaid nothing about half-paid armies, till they had been half able to pay their own. Several continental officers, on caſting up the difference between dirty paſteboard and hard ſilver, found, during the war, that they were fighting for about <hi>one cent</hi> per day<note n="†" place="bottom">This is affirmed by a gentleman, in Philadelphia who was one of them.</note>. Yet they continued to ſupport the cauſe, and to ſink money in it. But the object of the above quotation is to point out the <hi>conſiſtency</hi> of our envoy, and how not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031906_0030_0FEF42966FE77D20"/>
the ſtile of 1779 agrees with that of 1794. Only poor fifteen years have converted a horde of demons, for that is the amount of his billingſgate deſcription, into the moſt upright people in the world.</p>
               <p>We have remarked on the haſte with which Mr. Jay cloſed his treaty, and how much might have been won by deferring it. But the conduct of the negociator is eclipſed by that of the great body of the people. It does not appear that the poſſibility of a rupture with France ever once came into the conception of moſt of our citizens. A majority in the Houſe of Repreſentatives of Congreſs did indeed foreſee or fear it. One of them was aſked why they did not ſtate it in their ſpeeches, inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trifles, which were advanced againſt the treaty. He replied that <q>they did not think it prudent. The Hamiltonians would inſtantly have accuſed them of encouraging the French to begin a war with this country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the very deſign of ſome of that party themſelves. When a man calls hard names at his neighbour he is underſtood as deſiring to quarrel. Mr. Monroe, American ambaſſador to France, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf with prudence and popularity. In December 1796, he preſented letters of recall, and bade farewell to the Executive Directory, in the moſt amicable terms. His addreſs was received with reſpect and cordiality. He congratulated the nation on their victories, and their new conſtitution, in terms not as ſtrong, by twenty degrees, as thoſe of Mr. Waſhington on receiving the French flag. The Gazette of the United States, for the 29th of March, 1797, ſcolds him for this act of civility ſo contraſted to the inſolence of Mr. Pickering. <q>Though you could <hi>crouch,</hi> and <hi>kneel,</hi> and <hi>lick,</hi> and <hi>fawn,</hi> on ſuch an occaſion, your fellow citizens
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031906_0031_0FEF4298692FC708"/>
can feel nothing for you but <hi>contempt;</hi> and for the Directory, who require of the United States an act that would proſtrate them in the duſt, the utmoſt <hi>indignation.</hi>
                  </q> There is much more in this ſtile. The alleged act referred to, is, that the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory refuſed to admit an American miniſter till the United States <hi>had redreſſed their grievances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the contempt and indignation ſo fiercely ſpoke about, a different tone may ſoon be found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Mantua is at length given up. Five Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian armies have been deſtroyed, and an hundred thouſand priſoners taken, during a ſingle campaign in Italy. Compared to this work, the American revolution was mere ſcratching. The Emperor cannot pay his troops with Engliſh bank notes. He muſt either make an immediate peace, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned. It does not appear that the United States could, in one ſummer, raiſe five, or indeed two ſuch armies, in defence of the frontier of Canada; and it is likely enough that the French may reclaim that province from England, and require this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to reſtore its ancient boundaries. They would enter upon ſuch a ſcheme with every advantage. They have already a numerous colony of their own people in Canada, who are acquainted with it as well as the New Englanders. They have always exceeded the Britiſh in the art of gaining the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The war with the ſavages has been computed to coſt yearly a million of dollars; but with a French army to ſupport them, a campaign might devour fifty millions. The ceſſion of Canada would be one of the leaſt wonderful events of the preſent war. A great part of the people of New England have been uncomonly ſolicitious to exaſperate the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and, after the treatment which they have alſo diligently beſtowed on the ſouthern ſtates, and their numerous menaces of disjunction, the latter might
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031906_0032_0FEF429AAB853088"/>
chuſe to give themſelves but ſmall concern in the diſpute. On the ſouth-eaſtern frontier, the United States are ſtill more vulnerable. Were Victor Hughes, with three or four battalions of black troops, to land on the coaſt of Virginia, the horrors of St. Domingo would immediately be renewed. Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia ſtill continues to import negroes; a practice deſerving the ſevereſt reprobation.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the terror, which France has, for three years paſt, inſpired in Europe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Canada, and the extenſion of its limits, will ſeem but as duſt in the balance. The brutal inſolence with which the republicans are treated in the Columbian Centinel, can ariſe only from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintance with the poſſible extent of danger to New England. Count Montgaillard is a French royaliſt. His enmity to the revolution is as ſincere as that of any printer or preacher in the eaſtern ſtates. In 1794, he publiſhed a pamphlet on <hi>The Neceſſity of continuing the war.</hi> 
                  <q>The generation, ſays he, which is to invade and deſtroy Europe has now reached the twelfth year of its age. It was born in the very midſt of a revolution [that of America perhaps]; it has ſeen all the epocha of this [the French] revolution; it has inhaled all its principles, and it has ſucked in every poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by which it was infected.—Where is the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace which can conſtrain this riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to renounce ſo horrible a conqueſt.</q> He inſiſts, like Burke, that the war muſt be continued; he even affirms, that the republic <hi>muſt</hi> be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When this piece appeared, the French had not conquered Lombardy. They had not plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered one-half of Germany; and the bank of England had not ſtopt payment.

William Cobbet has ſet up a gazette in this city, for the expreſs end of reviling France. He does not conceal his deſign of bringing the nation into a French war. Sincerity is always reſpectable, and he cannot, as an editor, be charged with a want of that virtue. If we are plunged into ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his ſubſcribers, and not Mr. Cobbet, muſt be held accountable for the miſchief that he has done. It will be nothing wonderful, if, before three years elapſe, a French fleet ſhall anchor in the Delaware, and compel Philadelphia to deliver to the republic both him and them. Myriads of precedents of this kind are to be found in hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ames once obſerved, in Congreſs, that "this country is riſing into a giant's ſtrength." He was right. Ten years more of peace will double the population of the whole range of weſtern ſtates from Vermont to Tennaſſee. Above an hundred and fifty thouſand people are annually added to our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the ratio of increaſe is conſtantly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting. It will ſoon amount to two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yearly, or perhaps it has already reached that proportion. This is an advantage enjoyed with equal happineſs by no other nation. The addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſwarms will, for centuries to come, have no want of room.</p>

Let us forbear then to imitate, while we condemn the inſolence of Genet, or to propagate the exploded calumnies of Fauchet. Let us no longer whet the edge and embitter the venom of our faith by reviling a diſtant nation for having, like moſt of ourſelves, granted an univerſal right of conſcience. To ſpeak plainly, ſome of the holders of public ſtock, with Alexander Hamilton in their van, have excited this clamour. Witneſs the letters of PHOCION<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>Alias, Dr. William Smith. The author of <hi>An Examination of the late Proceedings in Congreſs,</hi> as to Mr. Hamilton's conduct, ſays that the doctor <q>holds between three and four hundred ſhares in the bank of the United States, and has obtained diſcounts <hi>ad libitum.</hi>
                        </q> The bank was incorporated by an act dated the 25th of February, 1791. A ſhare contains four hundred dollars. Three hundred ſhares come thus to an hundred and twenty thouſand dollars. In five years, from the 1ſt of January, 1792, to the 1ſt of January, 1797. Dr. Smith would draw nine thouſand ſix hundred dollars per annum, at eight per cent.; in whole, forty-eight thouſand dollars of intereſt. Add this to the principal ſum, and, with the advantage of diſcounts, we may reckon ſafely, that he has netted in whole at leaſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand dollars.</p>
                     <p>The world ſays that theſe ſhares in the bank were formed by an accumulation of Congreſs certificates, which the doctor bought from the continental army at eighteen pence or two ſhillings per pound. They may have originally coſt him ten thouſand dollars. As Hamilton was the progenitor of this maſter-piece of finance, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has been active in diſplaying his gratitude.</p>

for their paper, which no well informed citizen will ever think of moleſting; and, quite overſhooting the mark, they wiſh to preſerve it by plunging the continent into a Britiſh alliance and a French war. The latter is only another name for a ſecond American revolution. Were Pichegru at Elkton to-morrow, many citizens would feel <hi>more</hi> than a ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The public can trace the contrivers of ſuch a calamity; and, before oppoſing the houſe-breaker from without, they would perhaps begin with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe who had turned the key. It has already been proved in the Aurora, that the flambeau diſpatch of Mr. Pickering contains elaborate miſquotation and direct untruth. Our ſecretary takes the ſhorteſt way to provoke the rage of a conqueror alike inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible in defeat and ſucceſs, intoxicated with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, enriched with the ſpoils of Europe, and yet unexhauſted by his thouſand victories.</p>
               <p>In this chapter the narrative of the year 1796 has made ſmall progreſs, but ſomething perhaps has been gained in point of information. The motion of general Smith, with which it ſet out, regarding the Britiſh treaty, introduced ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the extreme hazard of a French war, and on the temerity or perfidy of thoſe who have led the United States into ſo critical a ſituation. The authority of Edmund Burke, and other intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Engliſh writers, was next appealed to with regard to the power of that republic, as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe to the ſyſtematic and voluminous fallacies of Camillus. This induced naturally to a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative view of the reſpective force of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by land and ſea; and the immeaſurable infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031906_0036_0FEF42A565B2A280"/>
of America was the reſult of examination. The ſhameful attempts made to widen the breach between the two countries was illuſtrated by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional remarks. We have cloſed with pointing out the peculiar advantages that America may hope for, beyond any other nation, from the continuance of peace; and we have ſeen ſome of the motives of that party, who, under pretended zeal for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, wiſh to diſturb her tranquility. To elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate the numberleſs advantages of a pacific ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem a great deal yet remains to be ſaid. So much untruth and deception have been ſtudiouſly heaped on the ſubject, that much previous labour is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to remove the rubbiſh, before even the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a narrative can be properly ſketched out. The moſt painful portion of the taſk is to beſtow cenſure on perſons or parties, and ſometimes to hold up even a large majority of the nation in a light not extremely reputable. Flattery to the prejudices and vices of the public has hitherto been the bane of almoſt every hiſtorian. This fault ſhall, in the preſent work, be avoided as much as poſſible, though at the requiſite expence of diſpleaſing the violent of every party. When we ſometimes ſtop to criticiſe the paragraph or eſſay in a newſpaper, it ſhould be remembered that to theſe publications the people of the United States do moſt univerſally reſort for political knowledge. By ſeeing detected ſome dozens of notorious fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that ſhape, perſons at a great diſtance from ſources of accurate information may come to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the habit of thinking more boldly for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of demanding evidence before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The enſuing chapter will partly conſiſt of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of federal compoſition, as a key to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and talents of that party. The next three chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031906_0037_0FEF42130E00B780"/>
proceed to ſome remarks on the mode of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the weſtern inſurrection, of repelling the ſavages on the ſouth-weſtern frontier, of compil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent national debt, and of negotiating Jay's treaty. The city of Waſhington, and the treatment of the late continental army, will merit and receive ſome inveſtigation. Theſe topics are intimately connected with the buſineſs of the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Congreſs about to be deſcribed. Without ſome prefatory explanations of this kind, a reader might find himſelf in the ſame ſtate of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if he were to begin a peruſal of Homer, at the thirteenth book of the Iliad.</p>
               <p>The firſt five introductory chapters having been employed on political ſubjects, we ſhall be prepared to go on with the journal of Congreſs. As variety is the ſoul of enjoyment, and as this work is intended for the entertainment of every claſs of people, an intermediate and miſcellaneous chapter will be given on the preſent internal ſtate of America. A ſwarm of books of travels, in this country will, among other articles of amuſement, be brought on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, and ſome of their injurious or abſurd obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reſpect to America will be candidly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. To ourſelves refutation may be unneceſſary, but ſeveral copies of the preſent work will be ſent to Europe, where it may chance to be reprinted. This part of the volume will there ſerve as a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of America againſt the errors of thoſe, who either did not perceive truth, or did not chuſe to tell it.</p>
               <p>A work of the preſent kind has been much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. We complain that newſpaper details are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, prejudiced, and contradictory. Theſe charges are true, but the printer cannot avoid affording foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for them. The narrative of to-morrow is often at variance with that of to-day: and neither
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031906_0038_0FEF42A7240E1658"/>
he nor his readers can, ſometimes, be certain which to prefer. Like Penelope, an editor muſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unravel at night the labour of the morning; while the public, amidſt the ſhreds and fragments of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, can hardly determine what to believe or to reject.</p>
               <p>The mere bulk of a daily newſpaper makes its mode of information often intricate, and ſometimes inacceſſible. A folio volume of twelve hundred and forty-eight pages may damp the curioſity of the boldeſt reader. No one newſpaper can relate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. The proprietor generally wiſhes, as far as he conveniently can, to decline publiſhing what his competitors have already given to the world. Almoſt every ſheet is, likewiſe, half filled with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements which are entirely uſeleſs to moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Theſe defects in newſpapers cannot, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or candour, be entirely ſhunned. But they point out the expediency of an annual compilation, where ſelection, brevity, and arrangement can more eaſily find place. Many citizens of Philadelphia take in ſix daily newſpapers at an yearly expence of about fifty dollars. Three different prints are a common ſupply. Not one-half or perhaps one-tenth part of their contents are read; and they are ſometimes caſt into the fire without being opened. After ſuch a waſte of money, a charge of one or two dollars for a yearly publication cannot be held extravagant. The compiler of ſuch a book has the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in coming at a diſtance behind the events which he is to relate. He can expatiate on the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſtateſmen who, at eaſter, did not exactly foreſee what was to happen next chriſtmas, and which, a twelve month after it has paſt, he ſees ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinctly. He is amazed at the dulneſs of news-printers, who, with ten diſcordant accounts of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before them, did not, for ſome hours, diſtinguiſh
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031906_0039_0FEF42A94E9DBEB8"/>
the right one. With judgement and induſtry, he may write an uſeful performance; and, by ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, he can look extremely wiſe at the expence of his predeceſſors.</p>

inſurgents of the weſtern counties in Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania. The late whiſky rebellion there is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally attributed to him.</q> There is ten times more of this trumpery. It is copied from the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck Intelligencer; and was publiſhed about the beginning of the year 1797 to defeat the re-election of Mr. Dearborne, a member of Congreſs for Maſſachuſetts. This is one ſample of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral eloquence of New England. If Mr. Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin had wiſhed for an opportunity of inflaming the public, he could not have choſen a better topic than American finance.

               <p>About the ſame time with this production, the Connecticut Courant contained <hi>Guillotina,</hi> a ſeries of rhimes, written by one Trumbull. They were republiſhed in a Providence newſpaper.

This fact could not be unknown to the libeller of Hartford. But <hi>old braſs will make a new pan,</hi> ſays the proverb. A fiction, though refuted in proſe, may have a joyful reſurrection in verſe. The polite introduction of the gallows ſhews how ſtrongly ſome of the federal party thirſt for blood. They have given more than one intimation to that purpoſe. The New-York Gazette has an eſſay by William Wilcocks, dated the 15th of November, 1796. <q>Surely, ſays he, the guillotine has not done <hi>all</hi> its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</q> He rails at the machine in France, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the ſetting up of another in America, for that is his plain inference. Some people ſhould not, in common prudence, be ſo forward to ſpeak of banks, till they give a ſatisfactory account of their connection with Alexander Hamilton, and <hi>his</hi> bank of the United States. <q>The books of transfer at the treaſury, and the books at the bank, are held ſecret under the obligation of an oath, on all perſons who uſe or inſpect them, not to reveal the names or amount of ſtock hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note n="*" place="bottom">See An Examination of the late Proceedings in Congreſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the official conduct of the Secretary of the Treaſury, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 8th of March, 1793, p. 25.</note>.</q> So much concealment can hardly be

for an honourable purpoſe. The righteous are bold as a lion. Trumbull proceeds thus:
<q>

                     </l>
                     <l>"They doubtleſs had a finger in't.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is another exploded untruth. The rhymer goes on at this rate through five columns of rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry. The lines now cited are ſufficient to ſhew the claſſical diſcernment of his friends, and what ſort of aid they will ſtoop to receive. Swanwick, Giles, Gallatin, and a long liſt of that party are reviled ſadly. Dr. Franklin, his grandſon, Mr. Bache, and Thomas Paine meet with the ſame uſage. General Waſhington, as uſual, is thoroughly ſoaked in the treacle of panegyric. But when the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent notified his intention to reſign, the party ſoon began to change their tune. Wilcocks has ſaid <q>that the <hi>fulſome adulation</hi> of the Preſident on the reception of the French flag was the <hi>moſt</hi> deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part of his adminiſtration<note n="*" place="bottom">Aurora, 31ſt December, 1796.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The charge of being a fulſome ſycophant does not entirely agree with the ſuperb encomiums, which Wilcocks has ſo frequently plaiſtered upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington. This veering about lets us into the real character of ſome people, and how little they care about the General, when his reputation ceaſes to promote their private ends.</p>
               <p>But this revolt was overbalanced by Major William Jackſon, ſurveyor of the port of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The ſpeech of the Preſident, on the 8th of December, 1796, was followed up, next day, by the Major, with a puff in one of our newſpapers. It begins thus. <q>To attempt an illuſtration of a ſubject in itſelf ſo illumined as the ſpeech of our moſt excellent Preſident were an arrogance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031906_0043_0FEF42BBAE02D6D0"/>
which we utterly diſclaim.</q> He goes on white-waſhing for a conſiderable length. <q>The diſtant ſettler on the Miſſiſſippi beholds with <hi>exultation</hi> that his happineſs forms a conſideration in the mind of the government, co-equal with that of his fellow citizen on the Atlantic.</q> He is equally entitled to protection; for his welfare is eſſential to the union. Hence exultation would be miſplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Preſident and other officers of government are paid for doing their duty; and, if they fail of performing it to public ſatisfaction, there are, if we could only believe ſo, abundance of men as good as the beſt of them. Major Jackſon here points at the Spaniſh treaty; but he might have reflected that the ſame adminiſtration, by the weakeſt and meaneſt ſpecies of trimming, has induced the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a French war, and if that happens, the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern waters will be more completely blocked up than ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Is there a ſeaman belonging to the United States, or a connection of that valuable claſs of citizens, whoſe vows are <hi>not</hi> offered for the good of him, whoſe head and heart have been ſo much occupied with their concerns?</q> This was an unfortunate topic. But the Major, as a military man, knows that the weakeſt part of a fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has moſt need of defence. <q>Where is the veteran whoſe boſom does not beat in reſponſive applauſe to the eulogium of Waſhington on military ſkill?</q> If, at the creation of the public debt, he had taken a ſingle ſtep to ſave them from indigence, if he had refuſed to ſign the ſtatute of limitations, and ſome other laws not much better<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, chap. v. and xi.</note>, their boſoms would have been more likely to beat. No peculiar ſhare of blame in this buſineſs lies on
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031906_0044_0FEF42C0CBFE3C78"/>
the Preſident. The great body of the people have betrayed entire indifference about the old ſoldiers, otherwiſe ſuch acts never could have paſt. At the ſame time money is unaccountably waſted on ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. John Watts, a Creek warrior, boaſts of having taken thirty-three ſcalps. In the latter part of 1796, this fellow, and a number of others, came to Philadelphia, where they feaſted at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of four thouſand dollars<note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſtated on the authority of Mr. Chriſtopher Greenup, a repreſentative from Kentucky. The writer has not yet ſeen the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</note>. Thus much for Major Jackſon.</p>
               <p>Nothing is, in itſelf, more comtemptible, and nothing tends more certainly to defeat its own purpoſe, than extravagant praiſe. Encomium ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared in a more farcical ſhape, than it has often aſſumed in poetry. Of this ſort of writing the Boſton Federal Orrery afforded a miſerable ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in the <hi>Gratulatory Addreſs</hi> on the birth-day of the Preſident, in February, 1796.</p>
               <p>If a ſtranger knew nothing elſe of the hiſtory of the American war, than what he could glean from this copy of verſes, he would infer, that General Waſhington had ſingly, and excluſively, extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Britiſh armies in a perſonal combat. In the laſt line of the firſt ſtanza, this rhymer of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts calls him the <hi>"Godlike Waſhington."</hi> This is ſomething worſe than mere nonſenſe. It approaches to indecency and profanation.</p>
               <p>In the third ſtanza we meet with a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween General Waſhington and —: let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he can, conjecture the counter part of this compariſon!

enough, there follows a parallel between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and the Creator of the Univerſe; and though this ſtyle may ſeem ridiculous, incredible, and mad, it has abſolutely been adopted by the bard of the <hi>Boſton Federal Orrery.</hi> After alluding to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous paſſage of the Red ſea, he adds, that
<q>
                     <l>"By <hi>night</hi> your pillar, and your <hi>cloud</hi> by day,"</l>
                     <l>"He (the Preſident) fought your battles."</l>

               </p>
               <p>Here is an attempt to blend the ſervices and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the American colonies with the omniſcient ſuperintendancy of the Supreme Being. Effrontery or impiety cannot proceed much farther. Of ſuch panegyriſts, Dr. Edward Young has obſerved, that

               <p>For the ſake of completeneſs, our author ſhould have run a compariſon of Mount <hi>Vernon</hi> with Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Delaware at Trenton and the Arabian Gulph. Between ſuch impious jargon and legitimate poetry, there is the ſame diſtinction as between the trowel of a bricklayer, and the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Titian.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, another piece of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, too ſingular to be forgotten, appeared in a Philadelphia newſpaper. Here it is:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <head>ADVICE TO COUNTRY POLITICIANS.</head>
                        <l>Go weed your corn, and plow your land,</l>
                        <l>And by Columbia's intereſt ſtand,</l>
                        <l>Caſt prejudice away;</l>
                        <l>To able heads leave ſtate affairs,</l>
                        <l>Give <hi>railing</hi> o'er and ſay your prayers,</l>
                        <l>For ſtores of corn and bay.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt ſtanza of that brilliant production. American farmers are very obligingly adviſed to give over <hi>railing.</hi> The writer muſt by this word mean <hi>remonſtrating</hi> againſt the treaty of Mr. Jay. As to <hi>able</hi> heads, five-ſixths of the members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031906_0046_0FEF42C52734E550"/>
are farmers, and hence this admonition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to them. They had better, as it ſeems, go home and mind their ploughs. The next and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſtanza runs, or hobbles, in the following words.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"With politics ne'er break your ſleep,</l>
                  <l>"But <hi>ring your hogs,</hi> and ſhear your ſheep,</l>
                  <l>"And rear your lambs and calves;</l>
                  <l>"And Waſhington will take due care,</l>
                  <l>"That Britons never more ſhall dare</l>
                  <l>"Attempt to make you ſlaves."</l>
               </q>
               <p>The felicity of the rhime in <hi>calves</hi> and <hi>ſlaves,</hi> proves that the auricular accuracy of this laureate keeps pace with his other qualifications. It is a very handſome compliment to the farmers of the United States to tell them that their underſtandings are juſt equal to putting a ring into the ſnout of a hog. The odes of Horace, and Martial's epigrams, were written in the ſink of Roman tyranny; yet, they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing correſpondent with the abject vulgarity of this advice. The piece is, from firſt to laſt, a ſtupid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the feelings of a free country. This Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian bard ſeems a formidable rival to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſycophant that ever licked up the ſpittle of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm.</p>
               <p>The people of America boaſt loudly of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of their ſuperiority, in this reſpect, to every other nation; yet the ſpirit of ſervility in writing birth-day verſes, exceeds all bounds.</p>
               <p>One of the gazettes of this city, after the birth-day in February, 1795, had another piece of the ſame ſhabby ſtrain. It filled two entire columns; and, which ſhews the wretchedneſs, or rather non-entity of literary taſte, it was printed, <hi>in at leaſt one other newſpaper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alluding to the friends of democratic ſocieties, this poet calls them <hi>ſorcerers in their cells.</hi> After

raving through this compariſon for a few impudent lines, worthy of Webſter and his Minerva, we are told that

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031906_0048_0FEF42CEEBF92038"/>
one other writer of the day. Curtius publiſhed twelve letters in defence of Jay's treaty. The points now to be inveſtigated, refer to what he ſays about the relative force of France and Britain, and the violent manner in which he ſpeaks of thoſe who differ from his political opinions.</p>
               <p>As an evidence of the greatneſs of Britain, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, No. vii. ſays, that her Eaſt-India territories <q>yield an annual revenue of more than eight mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling.</q> Camillus, alſo, No. vii. lays much weight upon the ſhips from India to England in 1795, having cargoes <q>computed to be worth between four and five millions ſterling.</q> While an alliance with that country is recommended, and ſuch accounts given of its wealth and power, only a few words are needful to ſet the matter right. Three-fourths of this revenue go to the expence of ſupporting the government of the country; part is abſorbed by inveſtments and commercial charges, and the remainder is conſumed in paying the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Indian debts of the company. By the lateſt advices received, on the 16th of June, 1795, from India, they were owing, in that part of the world, ſeven millions three hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. This was ſtated in the Houſe of Commons, on the above date, by Mr. Dundas. The company owe likewiſe another enormous debt in England, a part of which, under the name of <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> amounted then to two millions ſterling. Thus, when the company have paid the charges of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the intereſt of their debts, and mercantile expences, they are, by ſeveral millions ſterling, <hi>worſe than nothing.</hi> They have been often on the brink of bankruptcy, and would have ſtopt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many years ago, if Parliament had not lent them, in advance, large ſums of money<note n="*" place="bottom">See Smith's Wealth of Nations.</note>. It is
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031906_0049_0FEF42D0B1118218"/>
hard to think that ſuch an eſtabliſhment can add to the real ſtrength of a nation. Camillus and Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us need not build much on that ſource of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to France<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>As the world in general appear to be miſtaken on this head, the following ſtatements, laid before Parliament by Dundas, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.

                     <p>On the 24th of May, 1791, Charles Fox ſaid, in the Houſe of Commons, that the company's debts amounted to ſixteen millions eight hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. Theſe details agree in ſubſtance with the ſummary in the text. Much noiſe was made both for and againſt Jay's conduct on account of the ſtipulations reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Eaſt India trade. When it is obſerved how little even the Eaſt India company can make, who are maſters of India itſelf, a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion may be excited, that this branch of commerce was not worth much contention. American ſhips can ſail to China, without leave of England; and that is the moſt important branch of the Oriental market.</p>

Again. <q>Her debt has indeed been augmented; but ſtill immenſe ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (of <hi>paper</hi> he ſhould have ſaid) are offered, and the only queſtion with government is, whoſe <hi>money</hi> ſhall be received on loan.</q> That is on account of the extravagant premiums. As for money, all the gold and ſilver coin in England would not pay above one-nineteenth part of the debts that ſhe has contracted. If the iſland could be divided into three equal ſhares, it would require one of them to ſatisfy the public creditors. <q>Britain, at this moment, maintains as commanding an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude among the powers of the earth, as <hi>at any former period.</hi>

and there is no queſtion that any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat by land would be decided <hi>in favour</hi> of France.</q> When England won the battles of Blenheim, Quebec, and Minden, ſhe was equally ſuperior <hi>at ſea.</hi> Curtius has no ground to compare the preſent attitude to that of any former period.</p>
               <p>With the ſame judgment this writer rejects all danger of a Britiſh revolution. If England cannot be happy enough to make a peace, ſhe will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from every port in Europe, as ſhe is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from two-thirds of them; and then her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and her power muſt decline together. It is worth while to conſider the effects of this turn in her affairs on the ſituation of America. One of the conſequences muſt be the exploſion of her paper money. The quantity in circulation may be in England about three times, and in Scotland ſixty times greater than that of gold and ſilver. This is a rough gueſs. Every year of war augments the quantity of paper. The firſt effects of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bankruptcy would be an utter deſtruction of credit. Currency would again be reſtricted to the precious metals; and they would increaſe to three, four, or five times the value that they now bear. The ſilver ſix-pence, which, in London, would not, laſt winter, buy a pound of beef, will then purchaſe three, four, or five pounds, as was the caſe fifty or an hundred years ago. Hence it follows, that the manufactures of Britain will fall ſurpriſingly in their prices, becauſe the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of labour that formerly was worth half a gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, will then probably be offered for three or four ſhillings, or leſs. Another cauſe muſt cheapen Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh exports. The country being rid of public debt, will, of courſe, caſt off a great proportion of her taxes; for, at this time, including the expence of the collection of revenue to pay its intereſt, the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031906_0052_0FEF42DCCB289528"/>
debt requires about ſixteen millions ſterling per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. Even now the manufactures of the United States cannot, in many caſes, bear a competition in point of cheapneſs with thoſe of Britain. But a ſudden fall of one-half of the former rate, or perhaps a ſtill greater reduction muſt put an end to them, unleſs their coſt can alſo be leſſened. The price of ſo many commodities having ſunk ſo faſt, they will, of courſe, drag all other kinds of property after them, till matters ſhall be reſtored to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon level, becauſe the ſituation would be too forced and unnatural for any length of endurance. The price of flour, for example, could not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue at eight or ten dollars, in America, while En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland raiſed it for two or three. The value of lands, houſes, and perſonal labour ſinking with ſuch rapidity would produce numerous failures, and the quantity of money afloat being more than was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the precious metals, as on ſimilar occaſions, would drive paper out of the market. This muſt, in ſome degree, give a check to banking: Another claſs of people would ſuffer eſſentially, and that is the holders of public ſtock. From its nature the fall would be more ſeverely felt in this than moſt other property. Land, when equally ploughed, will yield as large a crop as now, whatever might be the want of money. The ſcarcity of houſes in the ſea port towns, would prevent them from ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding empty. Good tradeſmen are always need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and muſt be paid a ſubſiſtence. But ſtock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely unproductive of itſelf, unleſs as to the intereſt paid by the public, its decline in price would operate as a real loſs, ſince it is only worth what it can bring in the market.</p>
               <p>Thus the ruin of the Britiſh ſyſtem of funds, and paper money, would run the hazard of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame ſyſtems in the United States. This
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031906_0053_0FEF42DE96F4C138"/>
appears to be the reaſon why perſons connected with them have ſuch a violent prepoſſeſſion for Britiſh ſucceſs, and ſo ſtrong an averſion to the aſcendancy of France. The deſtruction of public credit in that country, ſoon after the revolution began, and the mixture of deſpotiſm and anarchy which have ſince prevailed, inſpired every holder of ſtocks with horror. A conſiderable number of theſe public creditors were from the eaſtern ſtates, and but few from the ſouthern. The whole influence of the fiſcal corps, was directed againſt the French revolution. As a requiſite counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe, the party wiſhed to caſt America into the arms of Britain. The bankers and ſtock-holders were joined by two other claſſes. The one of theſe conſiſted of Britiſh tories, who had been permitted to continue here in the war, or who had returned ſince the end of it. Another order of men, in whom the motives of the former were often blended, had frequent occaſion for the diſcounting of bills, to ſupport their credit. Within a few years, ſince banks became numerous, there has ariſen an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſpirit of mercantile ſpeculation, which could only expand its flight on the wings of paper-money. All theſe ſorts of people, with a few exceptions, and all on whom they had influence, joined in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probating the French revolution. Alexander Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton has always been conſidered as the leader of this party. His official powers gave him a very conſiderable ſway in the management of the public funds, and the bank of the United States. Under him, the party have acted, or are thought to have acted with ſyſtem and ſpirit. But while they were thus loudly declaiming, and often with juſtice, againſt the ſhocking barbarities perpetrated in France, many of them have forfeited their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to purity, by promoting, to the utmoſt of their
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031906_0054_0FEF42E0F88E0ED0"/>
ſkill, a civil war among the United States themſelves, and likewiſe a quarrel with the republic. Their deſigns have been gradually developed by the courſe of events; and it has at length been fairly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both by their words and actions, that they are willing to go to war with France. They dread her example as contagious for the deſtruction of their financial fabric, which they conſtantly mention not by its proper name, but as the <hi>conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe particulars, we ſhall now quote ſome of the expreſſions that Curtius adopts in his twelfth letter. <q>There is a confederation of characters, from New-Hampſhire to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, arrayed in oppoſition, either to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States, to its adminiſtration, or to particular men in office. The oppoſition of the principal men <hi>in this confederacy</hi> can be traced to ſome known cauſes, originally of a perſonal nature. Diſappointment in application for ſome office, or the failure of ſome favourite ſcheme in their political ſyſtem, has converted many of the friends of the late revolution into determined oppoſers of the general ſyſtem of the preſent adminiſtration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This charge is daily repeated in an infinity of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhapes. No facts are ſpecified by Curtius, except an indiſtinct reference to Genet. <q>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this ambaſſador is entirely unexampled in the hiſtory of civilized nations<note n="*" place="bottom">Carey's edition of Guthrie's Geography, vol. ii. p. 294.</note>.</q> He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with tumultuous hoſpitality, and childiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation. But when it was diſcovered that he wanted to plunge the nation into a war with Britain, this envoy inſtantly ſunk into neglect. Curtius ſays, <q>that his views were counteracted by the Preſident, ſeconded by <hi>the northern ſtates.</hi>
                  </q> One would
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031906_0055_0FEF42E5CAE40278"/>
imagine that the militia of New-England had been ordered to march, that the legiſlatures had taken ſome important ſtep, or at leaſt that their members in Congreſs had introduced ſome motion to the houſe, which led the way for recalling the French miniſter. Not one of theſe circumſtances ever happened. The impertinence and indiſcretion of Genet were, in a few months, viſible to all men of ſenſe. His importance ſhrunk immediately to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. As to <hi>ſeconding,</hi> it was manifeſted in no way by New-England, unleſs ſcurrilous newſpaper para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs deſerve that name. Even this commodity was as plentifully beſtowed at New-York and Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, as at Boſton. The reign of Genet was very ſhort. He arrived in this city on the 17th of May, 1793, and his recall was ſolicited by the American Secretary of State in a letter dated the 16th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt following. This letter, though different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the ſtile of Timothy Pickering's epiſtle to Pinckney, was as ſharp as decorum would permit. The one haggles like a ruſty knife. The other cuts like a razor. The next news from France was, that, if Genet had returned home, Robeſpierre would have made him look out at <hi>the little national window.</hi> Even the letter deſiring his recall was not ſo much as wrote by a native of New-England, though Henry Knox, as Secretary at War, was then a member of the American cabinet. Neither did Alexander Hamilton, though alſo in office, write any part of it; for the diſpatch has none of his entangled periods. It was drawn by Thomas Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon of Virginia. The ſtory of the Preſident being <hi>ſeconded by the northern ſtates</hi> is, therefore, an entire falſehood.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of Genet has been thus examined, becauſe it is the only fact to which Curtius refers. We now go back to his quotation, and ſhall begin
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031906_0056_0FEF42EAD8B89530"/>
with what he calls <hi>a confederation of characters ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed againſt the conſtitution, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt eminent perſonage of the party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is Thomas Jefferſon, the ſingle man who aſſiſted the Preſident in driving Genet out of office. But if the democrats, as, for the ſake of diſtinction, we muſt call them, were ſo violently attached to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, they muſt have held his antagoniſt Jefferſon in the utmoſt abhorence. Yet this is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe, that, at the diſtance of four years, their reſpect and friendſhip are unabated. Thus, as to Genet, the charge againſt the great body of the democrats involves a groſs contradiction. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a few individuals do ſtill admire what he did, cannot be worth enquiring. If he was often in the wrong, he was ſometimes in the right. The wretched attack made upon him by John Jay and Rufus King was only fit for two old women in a chimney corner. It diſgraced the national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of America, by ſhewing what weak men had been elected as a chief juſtice and a ſenator.</p>
               <p>Curtius ſpeaks of <hi>the principal men in this confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi> and <hi>their diſappointment in application for ſome office.</hi> Neither can this apply to Jefferſon. He had been ambaſſador to France. He was then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State. Little more was to be had. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after he reſigned his office. The reſignation was voluntary. This appears from the choice of a ſucceſſor to him. Randolph was of the ſame party and principles; which proves that the Preſident only choſe him becauſe Jefferſon would no longer keep the office.</p>
               <p>As to the failure of <hi>ſome favourite ſcheme in their political ſyſtem,</hi> of this alſo Mr. Jefferſon ſtands clear. His retirement was heard of with general regret. Nay, ſo much does he poſſeſs the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every ſtate in the union, that Mr. Adams
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031906_0057_0FEF421A61262908"/>
was perhaps the only man on the continent who could have had a tolerable chance againſt him for the preſidency. It is ſingular that the principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a confederacy againſt government ſhould poſſeſs the eſteem even of its friends.</p>
               <p>We muſt enquire among the repreſentatives in Congreſs for the ſecond leader of the confederation of characters. This is James Madiſon, <abbr>eſq</abbr> of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. Mr. Vans Murray ſaid, ſome years ago, in Congreſs, that he might be called the father of the preſent conſtitution. It would be ſtrange if he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impatient to ſtrangle his own offspring. Of the private character of the man it is needleſs to ſpeak, for the ſtock-holding newſpapers confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an incomprehenſible jargon about conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies. He certainly had no hand in promoting the popularity of citizen Genet. He was in Virginia during the period of the citizen's importance. It is doubtful if they were ever in the ſame room toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The claſſical elegance, and logical acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Madiſon bear the ſame reſemblance to the ſcampering fuſtian of Genet which Madeira has to ditch-water. It is impoſſible that two perſons ſo contraſted in every thing intellectual could have agreed, for a ſingle day, in any confederation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Mr. Madiſon is in cloſe friendſhip with Mr. Jefferſon, who put an end to the citizen. <hi>Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in application for ſome office</hi> cannot be imputed to this gentleman, unleſs the office can be named which he was diſappointed of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Very few places in the gift of the Preſident would have been a temptation. Mr. Jefferſon did not, as Secretary of State, ſave money. By abſence from his eſtate, he very likely loſt as much as he received for reſiding in Philadelphia. If Mr. Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had undertaken an office in this city worth two thouſand dollars a year, it would have been of no
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031906_0058_0FEF42FB565E8830"/>
pecuniary advantage to him, while his plantation was lying half waſted for want of his preſence. But none of the federal hacks has ever pretended that Mr. Madiſon met with a repulſe in ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They ſay that he has been in the pay of France. Yet he juſt now deſpitefully gives up his ſeat in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, thus robbing the accuſation of the laſt rag which covered its nakedneſs. He never had a cent from the government of this country, excepting his ſix dollars per day. As to <hi>favourite ſchemes,</hi> Mr. Madiſon, at leaſt for the laſt four years, has been as often in a majority as out of it.</p>
               <p>Thus we have got over the firſt and ſecond heads of the confederation. The third in order is Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam B. Giles, another Virginian. Almoſt all which has been ſaid of Mr. Madiſon ſuits him. He never applied for any office. Perhaps the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive has not one to beſtow, that, in a pecuniary light, would deſerve his acceptance. He has an independent fortune. He is a lawyer of eminence. He could make a handſome income by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if he choſe to ſtay at home, and mind that only. He could live on his own farm in Virginia for a tenth part of the money which he muſt ſpend in attending Congreſs. To ſuch a man ſix dollars a day, or any place that the executive could give him, is not an object; and nothing but ſheer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can excuſe a party writer for holding ſuch language about him.</p>
               <p>If we look over the other members who have often voted in oppoſition to executive oracles, the ſame obſervations as to perſonal indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence apply to perhaps every one of them. For inſtance, Gabriel Chriſtie is a merchant in Havre de Grace, a village at the mouth of the Suſquehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah. If he wants to recommence planter, he has a large farm of his own a few miles up the river,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031906_0059_0FEF42FD13AA7450"/>
in one of the moſt healthy and deſirable ſpots in Maryland. Such a man could gain nothing by confuſion, nor could the executive offer him almoſt any poſt poſſeſſing a lucrative tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An office in Philadelphia, or any where out of his own country, with a ſalary of fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars a year would be as a feather. The caſe is ſimilar with Meſſrs. Baldwin, Blount, Heath, Page, Parker, New, Nicholas, Macon, M'Dowell, Carnes, Venable, Preſton, and others. They have either independent property, or lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive profeſſions, or both. They could gain nothing by diſturbing government. They never made the ſmalleſt attempt of the kind; nor has any of the ſcribblers, who abuſed them in wholeſale, ever pretended to ſpecify a ſingle fact, and much leſs to bring evidence of a ſingle fact, that looked like a confederacy againſt government. Such malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nonſenſe may do very well for a Connecticut tavern, a Kennebeck Journal, or a town meeting of Stockbridge, when our patriotic citizens are toaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>John Jay and the papers!</hi> It may ſuit Samuel Dexter in a circle at the dancing ſchool, or Daniel Buck in an addreſs to ſome mob, who are ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the town bells for joy at his return to Vermont.</p>
               <p>After the words <hi>ſeconded by the northern ſtates,</hi> Curtius proceeds thus. <q>But the party which <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> rallied under that man, (Genet) ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and forms a league co-extenſive with the United States, connected in all its parts, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſingle impulſe.</q> Dr. Swift, ſpeaking of Gulliver's Travels, ſays, that they contained <hi>a lie at every ſecond word.</hi> If a ſingle word could convey an untruth, Curtius would be an unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led maſter in that ſort of brevity. The party, ſuch as it is, exiſted in all its vigour, for ſeveral years before Genet landed on this continent, a fact known
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031906_0060_0FEF42FFB89440C0"/>
to every perſon who has croſſed even the threſhold of American hiſtory. As for the <hi>ſingle</hi> impulſe, if the <hi>confederates</hi> were always to behave to each other with common civility, there might be ſome poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the charge being true. But they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly differing among themſelves on ſerious topics. For example, Colonel Parker, on the 10th of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, 1797, made an able and earneſt ſpeech in defence of the three frigates. He was ſupported, <hi>manibus pedibuſque,</hi> by John Swanwick, who, if cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of ſlander can beſtow diſtinction, ſhines like a ſtar of the firſt magnitude in the democratical zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac. They were oppoſed by three of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, Meſſrs. Chriſtie, Nicholas, and Giles. The poor frigates were kicked about, as if they had been ſo many waſhing tubs. Nicholas wiſhed them to rot on the ſtocks, as an inſtructive monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of national folly. Chriſtie did not care if they were reduced to aſhes. Giles declared that he always had oppoſed, and always ſhould oppoſe them, in every ſtage, and every ſhape. This is only one inſtance out of fifty or an hundred, that occur in every ſeſſion, where the gentlemen ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as acting by a ſingle impulſe, do ſhew very plainly that they value not one farthing the opinions of each other; but ſpeak immediately from their own caprice or conviction. We go back to Curtius.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus, in the infancy of our empire, the bane of all republics, is already diffuſed over our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>poiſons the whole body politic!</hi>
                  </q> [It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that weak or ignorant people ſhould find their heads half cracked, while they hear of ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble phantoms.] <q>Faction is a diſeaſe, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fatal to all popular governments; but in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica it has aſſumed an aſpect more formidable than in <hi>any other country.</hi>
                  </q> [He aſſigns ſome fooliſh rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and then adds:] <q>But in America, faction
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031906_0061_0FEF42EC87E9F488"/>
has aſſumed conſiſtency and ſyſtem. It is <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy perpetually exiſting,</hi> an oppoſition organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and diſciplined, for the purpoſes of defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the regular exerciſe of the conſtitutional pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our government, whenever a meaſure does not pleaſe the <hi>ſecret</hi> leaders of the confederacy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Curtius ought to name thoſe ſecret leaders, and to give ſome traits of the progreſs of this conſpiracy. In his labyrinthian ſtile, it is impoſſible ever to take a faſt hold. He is one of the moſt decent wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the federal party; and this is the univerſal way in which they make an aſſault on private cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. In the laſt four years of chiming, they have hardly advanced four intelligible aſſertions. Their charges glide from the graſp of ſtraight inquiry, like the ſhade of Anchiſes from the embrace of his ſon. The Tom Thumb tale about Fauchet bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Randolph, has been ſafely conducted to its grave in the American Annual Regiſter. As for the weſtern inſurrection, Findley, in his hiſtory of it, has ſhewed that Gallatin was ſo far from being an inſurgent, that he had a principal ſhare in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting miſchief. It is deplorable that a party ſo pregnant with charges ſhould be ſo unfortunate in their few attempts at ſpecification. <q>Already, ſays Curtius, are the heads of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced as traitors; already is our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try threatened with civil war.—If the oppoſers of <hi>the treaty</hi> can poſſibly embroil our country in civil war, it will be effected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is a conſiderable ſameneſs in the dialect of the Hamiltonians. Their conſtant cry is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a civil war; and the uſual menace a disjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eaſtern from the ſouthern ſtates. This railing comes excluſively from the eaſtern and ſome parts of the middle ſtates. To the ſouth of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania no newſpaper embattles itſelf againſt the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031906_0062_0FEF421DE9C70D98"/>
Yankees. Of the three daily prints in Baltimore, not one is attached cloſely to either party. A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the inhabitants voted for Jay's bantling. In the whole country, down to Georgia, you meet with no gazette lying and raving in the ſtile of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius and the Columbian Centinel. The Virginians encourage no newſprinter to balance accounts in black ball with Webſter; or to proclaim the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of New-England bankrupts, ſwindlers, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, and traitors. They are not, with the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony of a magpie, eternally croaking about the danger of rebellion. Their ſouls do not ſit ſo much upon thorns as thoſe of their eaſtern fellow citizens. There appears to be leſs vinegar in their compoſition. At leaſt, by judging from the ſtate of the preſs, in theſe oppoſite quarters of the union, a byſtander would make that inference. Envy may have ſome ſhare in this barking. The popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut is ſtationary, and their territory is but ſmall. From New-York, incluſive, all the ſtates to the ſouthward, excepting three<note n="*" place="bottom">New-Jerſey, Delaware, and Maryland.</note>, have an immenſe extent of new land, which holds out the certain proſpect of augmented wealth, population, and importance.</p>
               <p>The relative proportion of exports from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and ſouthern ſtates has augmented greatly, and muſt continue to do ſo. Boſton, formerly as popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as Philadelphia, hath ſtill but about twenty thouſand inhabitants, while thoſe of its late rival have augmented to ſixty thouſand. New-York, which formerly was much its inferior, hath fifty thouſand. But Baltimore is the moſt provoking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of recent aſcendency. This town aroſe, but as yeſterday, from a marſh; and rivals or eclipſes the wealth and population of the metropolis of New-England.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031906_0063_0FEF4301F1B065E0"/>
Virginia is twelve times larger than Maſchuſetts; and has already double her popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So great a difference of numbers did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the cenſus, of 1775, and it is hourly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<q>"Like ancient ladies when refus'd a kiſs,"</q>
Theſe two New-England ſtates are not perhaps pleaſed to foreſee the decline of their conſequence. Whatever may be the cauſe, the rancour of many of their citizens againſt the ſouthern ſtates appears to be of the bittereſt kind. Judging from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbian Centinel, a foreigner might be led to believe that the latter have ſubſcribed a ſolemn league of revolution; that troops have been raiſed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines formed; that half our citizens are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to butcher the reſt; that Madiſon is a ſecond Cataline, and Giles a Caeſar Borgia. A conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minority in New-England agree with the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of Virginia. In May, 1794, the inhabitants of Boſton held a very numerous town-meeting, at which, by a great majority, they agreed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to Congreſs to prolong the embargo. An additional ſixty days of famine would have put an effectual end to Britiſh piracies in the Weſt Indies; and would likewiſe have been of more ſervice to France than an aid of ten thouſand land forces, and ten ſhips of the line. A copy of the Boſton reſolutions, ſigned by the town clerk, was tranſmitted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their repreſentative, Dr. Ames, but a ſecond alſo, ſuperſcribed to Mr. Madiſon, Colonel Parker, and Mr. Giles. This told pretty plainly that they truſted the three latter gentlemen farther, in that inſtance, than their own repreſentative. Perhaps, however, this town-meeting conſiſted likewiſe of <hi>conſpirators. Aves unius generis facile congregantur.</hi> The fooliſh word <hi>jacobin</hi> is rung in endleſs changes;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031906_0064_0FEF422005E66428"/>
while Curtius gravely declares that <q>private aſſociations are formed and extending their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over our country.</q> All this is the vileſt traſh imaginable.</p>
               <p>The calumny of the federal patriots is not confined to the ſouthern ſtates. The whiſky riots in the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern counties of Pennſylvania have ſupplied them with a happy fund for declamation. Of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this line, accept the following ſpecimen.</p>
               <p>In a Philadelphia newſpaper of the 8th of March, 1796, there is inſerted an extract of a letter, dated Pittſburgh, the 25th of February preceding, which contains unexpected intelligence. The extract extends to one third of a column, and repreſents the weſtern counties, as having relapſed into a ſtate of anarchy. <q>It is generally believed, ſays the writer, that near half the men in this country have croſſed the river to take poſſeſſion of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever land they could get. <hi>This town is almoſt empty!</hi> Some large parties are gone with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to clear all before them, where the land is good. Reports from the woods ſay, that a ſtrong party coming to a houſe, they turn out the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a ſtronger coming on turn them out, ſo that ſome houſes <hi>change their owners two or three times a day.</hi>
                  </q> This makes about a fourth part of the extract, which is all exactly in the ſame ſtyle, though ſome paſſages ſoar quite above comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>No farther intelligence about this tumult reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, till the 28th of March brought forth a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond extract of an epiſtle from Pittſburgh, dated the 12th of March.

                  </q> &amp;c. Both letters, but the ſecond in particular, have a
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031906_0065_0FEF4308C6939FD0"/>
multiplicity of ranting bombaſtical phraſes, which would be apt to make their veracity ſuſpected. Both of them ſpeak much about a Mr. —, who is doing ſome inexplicable wonders. Both contain a profuſion of ſuch egregious nonſenſe, and malicious falſehood, that they are in themſelves, an hundred and fifty degrees beneath animadverſion.</p>
               <p>No further notice was taken in any newſpaper about this inſurrection. Hence it is natural to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that both pieces came from the ſame pen, and that both were written with one raſcally view, that of ſpreading a falſe alarm among the people in the Atlantic regions of the union. If ſuch revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary wonders were going forward, beyond the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, it was ſtrange that nobody ſhould hear about them but one correſpondent. It is the buſineſs of every good citizen, to pluck up by the roots ſuch incendiary ſlander. There ſeems a double barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ripping open the ſcar of a wound that is but juſt ſkinned over.</p>
               <p>The bad effect of ſuch reports was very well deſcribed in Congreſs by Mr. Baldwin. On the 1ſt of December, 1794, this gentlemen obſerved that in a country ſo extenſive as America, and where the people are ſo widely ſcattered, it was a work of immenſe difficulty to have a regular and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate account of the meaſures of government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated through every part of the union. It can ſcarcely be conceived, ſaid he, by thoſe who have no call to viſit the interior and more retired parts of the country, how much the peace of ſociety is diſturbed by the malicious propagation of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical falſehood. The moſt wicked lies are kept in circulation, for months together, and before they can be effectually contradicted, the people have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come almoſt frantic. For example, Mr. Baldwin mentioned, (and editors of newſpapers in every
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031906_0066_0FEF42243AC4D490"/>
part of the union, ought to quote this part of his obſervations, as a <hi>caveat</hi> in future,) that it had been aſſerted that a poll tax of forty ſhillings per head, has been laid on all the inhabitants, that the exciſe has been extended to <hi>wheat,</hi> to <hi>looms,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of huſbandry, and that the late draughts of the eighty thouſand militia, are ſold to France to carry on the war! It is probable, that riots and inſurrections are fomented by theſe rumours more than by all other cauſes. If a conſtant and regular publication of all that is done could reach every part of the United States, it would be an effectual, and, perhaps the only cure for theſe miſchiefs. The people of this extenſive country have, for theſe ten years, enjoyed all the eſſential benefits of ſociety, on very eaſy terms. A man with five or ſix hundred acres of land is ſcarcely called upon for a dollar of taxes in a year. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no people on earth ever enjoyed ſo fully the advantages of ſociety with ſo few burdens. Is it not a diſtreſſing conſideration, that when we have ſo few real evils, we ſhould create to ourſelves ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ones, that give us ſo much uſeleſs uneaſineſs? Some wrong meaſures have taken place, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will take place, and nobody can expect that any kind of conduct will give <hi>univerſal</hi> ſatisfaction<note n="*" place="bottom">In the courſe of the diſcuſſion of this day, Mr. Hillhouſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoke for ſome time, Mr. Dayton roſe next. He began by remarking, that it could not be expected that he was to make any obſervations on what had been ſaid by the member juſt ſitten down, <hi>as he did not hear ten words which the gentleman ſaid.</hi> This was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to noiſe made by members in the houſe.</note>.</p>
               <p>But a very ſmall difference is perceivable in the ſcale of morality from one end to another of America. Of this remark the Yazoo buſineſs afforded a notable inſtance. By an act paſt in January, 1795, a junto in the aſſembly of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia

ſold to four companies of land-jobbers ſome vacant lands of that ſtate. On the 2d of March, 1795, Mr. Harper ſaid in Congreſs that the ſale covered thirty millions of acres of the fineſt land in the world, and moſt admirably ſituated for commerce and emigration. It might, every foot of it, be made worth half a dollar per acre. Its ſettlement would tend to open the Miſſiſſippi navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Theſe <hi>thirty millions</hi> of acres had been ſold, he ſaid, for <hi>five hundred thouſand dollars!</hi> A more villainous tranſaction cannot be conceived. Yet, ſtrange to tell! many perſons in the religious town of Boſton were deeply concerned in buying from theſe purchaſers. The newſpapers ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reader knows that the bargain hath ſince been ſet aſide, but that does not leſſen the infamy of thoſe connected with it. The following extract from the preſentment of the grand jury of Chatham coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Georgia, at the October term of 1796, gives an entertaining picture of the parties concerned.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>We further and abominably preſent thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and iniquitous grants of pine barren land, which have been palmed upon foreigners and northern citizens, the plats of which have been decorated generally with timber not found on them; and moſt of the pretended tracts ſold are not in exiſtence, to the injury of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the ſtate, and the honeſt citizens thereof; nine-tenths of whom behold the ſpeculation with the utmoſt abhorrence, conſidering the meaſure calculated to injure their reputation and to cheat the unwary, to add to the pelf of a few men, who are void of principle and honour, and who would ſacrifice their country and its rights to increaſe their own property.

                  <p>We congratulate our fellow citizens, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on the virtue of the laſt legiſlature, which declared the ſaid pretended ſale, conſtitutionally null and void, as fraudulent and corrupt, and we hope our fellow citizens at large, will now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit their virtue, by ſending ſuch men only to the next legiſlature, as are known to be free from ſpeculation, and will reſpect our rights by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and confirming the annulling law. It is only by a firmneſs of conduct in the citizens at large, on this important occaſion, that our rights can be reſpected in Congreſs, and at home; that this ſpecies of gambling can be diſcountenanced, and ſpeculating ſharpers be defeated, which is as much to be deſired, on account of morality and our riſing generation, as the future repoſe of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the reputation of our growing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
                  <p>We further preſent on this head the attempt by Alexander Moultrie and others to drag this ſtate into the federal court, to anſwer a ſuit in equity, under a former pretended Yazoo ſale. We abhor both ſpeculations alike, and we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

to the officers of the ſtate, who may have been ſerved with copies of the bill filed in the ſaid ſuit, to make no anſwer thereto until the next meeting of the legiſlature, who we hope will remonſtrate to Congreſs on this ſubject. We cannot ſuppoſe the ſtate liable to be ſued, and in this caſe we hope ſhe will preſerve her dignity, by refuſing an anſwer, particularly in a court where the judges have been guiding the laſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and where ſhe can conſequently expect no juſtice. We hope that the amendment to the conſtitution, ſo unanimouſly entered into by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, againſt the ſuability of a ſtate, will not be leaped over to anſwer the vile purpoſes of the moſt infamous ſpeculation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The above preſentment gives no ſublime notion of American juriſprudence, even at its fountain head. What follows will ſhew the pollution of ſome of its inferior ſtreams. In a work like this, the wrongs of the poor ought not to be overlooked; and the ſtory is inſerted at this place leſt, in the ſubſequent preſs of matter, it might chance to be forgotten. The particulars are taken from a letter addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the printer of the Georgia and Auguſta Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, dated Hancock county, 30th of April, 1796, and ſigned Henry Boyle. They ſerve to ſhew what outrages may be perpetrated, in this country, under the ſanction of public juſtice.</p>
               <p>Sometime in laſt fall, Abner Pierce was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to jail, and as it ſeems in Hancock county, on ſuſpicion of ſtealing a mare, the property of Ward Darnel. He remained in irons till the ſitting of the ſuperior court, <hi>but could not have his trial.</hi> The only evidence againſt him was the oath of Darnel, while two other perſons ſwore that they were witneſſes to his having received the mare from Darnel, in virtue of a mutual agreement. After
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031906_0070_0FEF434534815090"/>
being confined for a conſiderable time, public juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice had not leiſure <hi>to do its duty,</hi> by giving him a trial.</p>
               <p>This poor man was on the point of lying in jail till the next ſuperior court; <q>conſequently, ſays the letter, as the impriſonment would have amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to nearly twelve months, lying ſummer and winter in the dungeon, chained in irons, without one bit of fire to thaw the froſt off his frozen limbs, and only one oath againſt him, two in his favour, humanity ſhrinks at the idea<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>What uſe could there be for keeping the man in irons? A good ſtone wall would have anſwered well enough. But perhaps the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was made of boards. About forty years ago, a wooden jail in Virginia, with a priſoner for debt confined in it, took fire. The alarm ſpread. The jailor, in haſtily turning the key, ſpoiled the lock. The priſoner, ſeeing all efforts for his releaſe to be in vain, ſtript off his clothes, thruſt them through the bars of the door, which was of iron, and bade the keeper carry them, as being all which he had, to his family. He then retired to a corner of the priſon, lay down, and periſhed in the flames,</p>
                        <p>If a man was to be kept a twelve-month in-irons, and then to be hanged, for ſtealing <hi>one</hi> horſe, what ſhall we make of the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and their agents, who forcibly pilfered ſo many that are yet unpaid for? Nay, what is to be ſaid of the third and fourth Congreſs, who have rejected many ſcores or hundreds of ſuch claims, <hi>after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to be juſt?</hi> At the ſame time, we are giving John Adams, FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS to buy furniture for his houſe. The latter motion went through the Repreſentatives by ſixty-three votes againſt twenty-ſeven. It was impoſſible to withſtand the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos of Mr. Samuel Sitgreaves, when deſcribing the crazy bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteads, the broken chairs, the ragged linen, the moth-eaten curtains, the ruſty ſaucepans, and the fractured waterpots, that General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was to leave behind him in Market-ſtreet. But, had it been a ſoldier with a wooden leg, who, reſiding at the diſtance of three hundred leagues, had only juſt heard of the ſtatute of limitations; or had it been a widow, like Ami Darden, whoſe only horſe had been dragged from her plough, while her children were ſtarving, Mr. Sitgreaves might as well have addreſſed the north-weſt wind.</p>
                     </note>.</q> What makes the affair ſtill worſe, the priſoner had a wife and two ſmall children. They had neither cow nor horſe, nor any viſible means of ſubſiſtence,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031906_0071_0FEF430E61E5C7B8"/>
except his labour. Four perſons entered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſecurities to the amount of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars, that this Abner Pierce ſhould attend at the next ſuperior court. Mr. Boyle, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes this letter, was one of the juſtices of peace who granted his liberation. For ſuch an office of benevolence and of equity, he has been abuſed in a newſpaper, and publiſhed, in his own defence, the letter above abridged.</p>
               <p>The following is another anecdote of oppreſſion, and of ſo ſingular a kind, that it ought to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the honour of the eighteenth century. A negro man from the coaſt of Guinea had been ſold to a farmer on the ſouthern line of North-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. In the fall of 1793, he applied to a black boy and girl, the property of an adjacent planter, to give him ſome victuals. In return he aſſured them that he would perform a charm to ſoften the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their maſter. He gave them a callibaſh full of the feathers and claws of birds, mixed with negro men's nails. This was buried under the threſhold of the planter's door. He was, at that time ſick, or fell ill ſoon after; and having ordered the boy to be puniſhed for ſome offence, the latter ſaid that, if he was pardoned, he would tell what had made his maſter ill. The concealment was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcovered, along with ſome of the ſame materials which had been ſtuck about the ſick man's bed. The necromancer was conſequently taken up. This was on a Saturday. He was tried on the next Monday, by a jury of three free-holders, convicted of witchcraft, and hanged on the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. The boy and girl were whipt and branded in the forehead with a red hot iron. One of theſe children was eleven, and the other thirteen years of age. The ſtory has made noiſe, and an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct account of it with ſome remarks, appeared
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031906_0072_0FEF31FCA525B078"/>
in the newſpapers, a conſiderable time after the perpetration of the murder. The narrative is here given on the authority of a gentleman of veracity in Pennſylvania, who was on the ſpot ſoon after. A neighbouring magiſtrate obſerved to him that he had no doubt as to the guilt of the priſoner. He was ſorry for being from home at the time of the execution, as he ſhould have made his own negroes attend it. He added, by way of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the owner of the ſlave would not be any great loſer by the affair, becauſe the ſtate was to grant him ſeventy pounds of damages<note n="*" place="bottom">In Jamaica, ſeveral black people have been executed for witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</note>.</p>
               <p>We ſhall cloſe this chapter with a few miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous remarks. In the profound debates of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1796, about <hi>whether Americans were the freeſt and moſt enlightened people in the world,</hi> Dr. Ames ſaid that, by all which he could learn, the people in Europe who <hi>could</hi> read were but as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as thoſe in America who could <hi>not</hi> read. In plainer words, he meant to ſtate that the people in the new world had twenty times more commonly a decent education than thoſe in the old one. Mr. Giles agreed with him in thinking that Americans were wiſer than the reſt of mankind, but he did not believe it modeſt or becoming to divulge the ſecret; for a ſecret it hitherto has been, and, ſince the reſolution was negatived, it is likely to remain ſo. The very morning after the doctor made the above remark, Mr. Bache printed a deciſive ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the ſuperiority of the American intellect. A woman in New-Hampſhire was accuſed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for being a witch. A man who had beaten her, was, juſt before this debate, brought to trial. The wicked bench laughed at the charge of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.

               <p>Connecticut is uſually held up as the mirror of true republicaniſm, the centrical point, the very focus of federal virtue. Take the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In ſpring, 1796, during the debates on the Britiſh treaty, a newſpaper of that ſtate, which has been already cited<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, chap. ix.</note>, had the following moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are informed, by a gentleman from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the county of Hampſhire, that a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental review was held, if we are not miſtaken, at Conway. As the people were informed that ſome communications of a political nature, were to be made to them, upon the parade, a very general attendance was obſerved, of all ages, from ſixteen years to ſixty. The communications were read to them <hi>while under arms,</hi> and they were then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon to expreſs their ſentiments, which was done without any heſitation. The unanimous voice of the people preſent was, that, <hi>before they would ſubmit to a proſtration of the conſtitution,</hi> by the preſent majority in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, they would <hi>MARCH TO PHILADELPHIA;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the conſtitution and the Preſident; and cauſe the treaty with Great Britain to be carried into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It would have been curious to ſee this army ſet out from Hartford with Trumbull, as a ſecond Alcaeus at their head, chanting the paean of battle. Before they had got within an hundred miles of this city, Pennſylvania might perhaps have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with materials for a Connecticut Aeneid; and truly the cauſe to be celebrated, and the bard

By the way, it was time that a public ſervant of ſuch dangerous popularity ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from his office. The reſignation of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington merits the inexpreſſible gratitude of his country. But what better was the Conway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view than the meeting at Braddock's field?

Did a Britiſh Houſe of Commons ever ſcruple, or did they even forbear, to diſcuſs the merits of a foreign treaty? No! And yet it ſeems that to do ſo in America is to <hi>pull down</hi> the Preſident, and <hi>overturn</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. If the conduct of Congreſs in making this enquiry was culpable, the conſtitution is <hi>de fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> overturned already. It is laid in ruins at the feet of the executive. The writer goes on to tell us that, ſince 1781, Mr. Madiſon has been <hi>a devoted tool to the French intereſt and government, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

               <p>There is more ribbaldry to the ſame purpoſe, and all equally impudent and nonſenſical. What muſt be the <hi>ſtate of mind</hi> among the readers of this honeſt <hi>Centinel,</hi> if they digeſt ſuch a morſel? An hundred legiſlators never yet aſſembled, without often differing in opinion from each other. The people without doors are alſo much divided on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every great topic, and we may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit them to be bribed as their repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>If the citizens of New-England are ſo much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than their neighbours, it muſt certainly appear in the choice of their repreſentatives in Congreſs. The ſuperiority is not always conſpicuous. In the debate on the ſnuff exciſe, in ſpring 1794, ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from that part of the union, and eſpecially Mr. Sedgwick, affirmed, that a land tax was injuſt and <hi>impracticable,</hi> and that Americans <hi>would never ſubmit to it</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The words were taken down at the time, by the author.</note>. It was impoſſible for any member to give a more conſummate proof of ignorance or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. The conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts itſelf, the very ſtate that ſent Mr. Sedgwick to the houſe, authoriſes the aſſembly <q>to impoſe and levy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional and reaſonable aſſeſſments, rates, and taxes, upon all the inhabitants of, and perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and <hi>eſtates</hi> lying within the ſaid common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth<note n="†" place="bottom">Part 2d. chap. i. ſec. i. article 4.</note>.</q> Such taxes are actually paid, yet Mr. Sedgwick has often declared that they never could be raiſed, This conveyed a groſs reflection upon the country.

               <p>By far the greater part of the world is full of miſery; government, a few of the republics ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, is nothing but robbery reduced to a ſyſtem.

theſe powerful and coaleſcing cauſes, muſt be, that this bleſſed planet is pregnant with ſympathy, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, liberality, and the entire bead-roll of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſenſibilities. Amen.</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks have occurred on reading the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a very melancholy affair which took place in the latter end of February, 1796, at Hingham, in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts. The following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it are abridged from a letter written by one of the profeſſors in the univerſity at Cambridge, dated the 23d of February, and printed in a late Boſton newſpaper.</p>
               <p>About two months before the date of the letter, a young foreigner called on this profeſſor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced himſelf by ſaying, that he wanted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted with ſome ſcientific man. The ſubject which he brought on was pneumatics and mechanics. He converſed with the profeſſor flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, in French, Dutch, and Latin. After a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, of which part is related, he took his leave, and, by agreement, paid a ſecond viſit to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in three days. We ſhall now quote <hi>verbatim</hi> a part of the account of him, as given by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>From his good figure, polite and eaſy manners, I concluded he was ſome unfortunate emigrant from the continent of Europe, probably in the ſervice of the monarchy, <hi>who, deſtitute of money and friends,</hi> choſe to apply ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he had learnt at college, to the purpoſe of <hi>procuring ſubſiſtence</hi> by a novel exhibition. <hi>On this account,</hi> I never aſked him his name or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</q>
               </p>
               <p>On what account? He was deſtitute of money and friends, and he wanted to procure ſubſiſtence by the exhibition of a novel mechanical apparatus;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031906_0080_0FEF4317771881E8"/>
and, <hi>therefore,</hi> this American philoſopher did not venture to aſk him his name or nation.</p>
               <q>"'Twas pitiful! 'twas wond'rous pitiful!"</q>
               <p>That the profeſſor in a college ſhould be capable of mean ungentlemany conduct, we know by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent perſonal experience; but, that any man ſhould wiſh to bring himſelf forward to the public in ſo humiliating a point of view, is rather uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Is it a crime to be in want of money? Is it culpable to attempt earning ſubſiſtence by exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an apparatus of mechaniſm? Both theſe <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> doctrines are avowed by this Cambridge profeſſor. Such treatment of a foreigner, a man of learning, and, above all, a fellow creature in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, is diſgraceful not only to the individual who acted ſo, but, from his alacrity in telling the ſtory, it reflects a ſarcaſm on the country to which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. A reader in Europe will be tempted to think very meanly of the general caſt of our ideas. Was the profeſſor afraid that this foreigner would eclipſe him in the eyes of his pupils, by his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhew? How eaſy would it have been for the profeſſor to have found employment of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent kind for a well educated man, who underſtood four languages! It is truſted that every reader will heartily deſpiſe ſuch a froſt-bitten pedagogue.</p>
               <p>The chilling reception that he encountered, was undoubtedly the reaſon why this ill-fated wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er fell into deſpair, and ſhot himſelf. He left a letter addreſſed to the profeſſor, wherein he ſtates, that his want of money, and the failure of his plans for obtaining ſubſiſtence, had determined him to put an end to his life.</p>
               <p>The profeſſor ſpeaks of him thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The writings and drawings which he left di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me, are ſo far from evincing a derang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, that they intimate a cool and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031906_0081_0FEF43672CD0A418"/>
intellect; being executed not merely with taſte, but mathematical exactneſs.—I have never heard any thing againſt his character, but have ſeen ſome evidences of his humanity, in giving freedom to his ſlave, after binding him to a trade by which he could get his living.</q> How much is it to be regretted that a man ſo gifted, ſhould have met with ſuch beaſtly treatment!</p>
               <p>The profeſſor concludes by citing the exit of this gentleman as a proof, that <q>
                     <hi>nature,</hi> without the commanding voice of <hi>religion,</hi> has left the nobleſt of her works imperfect.</q> What part of the chriſtian religion taught this perſon to keep a ſtranger at a diſtance, becauſe he is in diſtreſs? To repel ſuch ſordid ideas, and to extend the feelings of humanity, is the only intelligible or rational purpoſe of religion.</p>
               <p>The name of this victim to raſhneſs was <hi>Iberkin.</hi> He was probably a German, there is, at leaſt, ſuch a name in Pruſſia. The letter-writer is Dr. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Waterhouſe, Profeſſor of Medicine at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Leyden gave him education; Rhode-Iſland had the diſhonour of his birth.</p>
               <p>The people of New-England boaſt much of their ſuperior hoſpitality to ſtrangers; of which this anecdote holds up a ſhocking ſample.</p>
               <p>Before this ſorry pedant ſpeaks a ſecond time of <hi>religion,</hi> let him read the parable of <hi>the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan.</hi> In the Levite, <hi>who paſſed by on the other ſide,</hi> he will trace the intellectual pedigree of his own mind. When ſuch a character preſents itſelf to mankind, as a paragon of <hi>piety,</hi> it is both our right and duty to wrench the vizor from the features of deformity, and to adminiſter that typographical drubbing, which has been ſo hardily courted, and ſo richly deſerved.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AMONG other artifices employed by the federal party to exaſperate the people of this country againſt the French republic, one is, their aſſertion that the United States were indebted for the aid of France to the perſonal benevolence of Louis. This is conſtantly held up as a reaſon for deteſting the revolution; and mountains of ribbaldry have, from that ground, been diſcharged on its authors. Some notice has already been taken of this error<note n="*" place="bottom">Britiſh Honour and Humanity, p. 14. American Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter, chap. viii.</note>. Mr. Burke, in the letters above quoted, goes fully through it. He ſays that even when Louis came to the throne, <q>the revolution ſtrongly operated in all its cauſes.</q> The politicians of France had been compelled to deſpiſe their kings. <q>From quarrelling with the court, they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031906_0083_0FEF431F9DA47870"/>
of <hi>monarchy itſelf;</hi> as a ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too variable for any regular plan of nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al aggrandizement. They obſerved, that, in that ſort of regimen, too much depended on the perſonal character of the prince.—They compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with mortification the ſyſtematic proceedings of a Roman Senate with the fluctuations of a <hi>monarchy.</hi>—What cure for the radical weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the French <hi>monarchy,</hi> but in <hi>a republic?</hi> Out the word came; and it never went back.— The different effects of a great military and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious republic, and of a monarchy of the ſame deſcription were conſtantly in their mouths.</q> After a long detail of circumſtances, Edmund goes on in theſe words: <q>Theſe ſentiments were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as ſome think, by their American alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The American alliance was produced by their <hi>republican</hi> principles and <hi>republican</hi> policy.</q> Several pages are ſpent on this ſubject, and every thing proves that the alliance of France with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was the work of the republican party, not of the king. After this explanation, no man who prefers truth to fiction will deafen the public about their obligations to Louis, or the guilt of putting him to death. It was at worſt not more criminal than the unavenged murder ſo lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the jail of Philadelphia<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, chap. X.</note>. We print week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whole columns of reproach againſt French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; yet, when five thouſand of theſe troops mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched down Front-ſtreet, in their way to the capture of Cornwallis, it is ſtill remembered with what proſtration of gratitude they were welcomed by the ſurrounding citizens. The French ambaſſador was looked up to as a tutelar divinity. His landing from Europe was announced by the diſcharge of cannon, by fire-works and illuminations. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031906_0084_0FEF4232432E8788"/>
was eſſential at every public entertainment. He was the arbiter of politics, of faſhion, and of taſte. But our turn has been ſerved, and citizen Adet can deſcribe the reverſe of the medal. Daniel Defoe, ſpeaking of his country, ſays:
<q>
                     <l>"Ingratitude, a devil of black renown,</l>
                     <l>"Poſſeſs'd her very early as <hi>his own!</hi>"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet there is nothing quite ſo paltry as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ours, even in the ſable hiſtory of England. In a compariſon with Britiſh armies, the French cannot loſe much. When Howe landed at the head of Elk, many perſons in that neighbourhood had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the beſt entertainment which they could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for the reception of their deliverers. They brought the Engliſh ſoldiers to their tables. The inſtant that dinner was over, the gueſts began to plunder. It was affirmed, at the time, that in an extent of a few miles, they took away ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſes. It was a common practice, when one of the regulars met an American, to aſk him the time of day. When he pulled out his watch, it was wreſted from his fingers. The tories were ſo much aſhamed of this treatment, that they were never heard to complain, and at the diſtance of twenty years, many of them are yet as firm in loyalty as ever.</p>
               <p>Alexander Hamilton and Co. are in the habit of making compariſons between France and England to the advantage of the latter. A celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the federal phalanx obſerves, that the French <q>have ranſacked the coffers of the rich, ſtripped poverty of its very rags, robbed the infant of its birth-right, wrenched the crutch from tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering old age, and, joining ſacrilege to burgla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, have plundered the altars of God<note n="*" place="bottom">A New Year's Gift for the Democrats, p. 1.</note>.</q> All this, and much more is true; and declamations of that ſort have been a powerful means with the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031906_0085_0FEF43538B9E8490"/>
intereſt for exaſperating the people of America. But, coming home for a compariſon, the citizens of this ſtate would not think themſelves fairly painted in a picture of the Paxton boys, butchering innocent Indians in the priſon of Lancaſter. A few ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will ſhew that, in general morality, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh are as bad as other people, and often much worſe than many.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard ſays, that the annual average of executions in London only, for twenty-three years, was between <hi>twenty-nine</hi> and <hi>thirty.</hi> 
                  <q>In all the ſeven provinces, ſays he, there are ſeldom more executions than from <hi>four</hi> to <hi>ſix.</hi>
                  </q> The United Provinces are, by common calculation, three times more populous than London. They ſhould, in proportion, have <hi>ninety</hi> executions per annum, inſtead of which there are but <hi>five.</hi> Mr. Howard gives an hundred other facts of the ſame nature. This may help in aſcertaining the balance of <hi>domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> morality.</p>
               <p>As for politics, no jacobin can leſs diſguiſe his appetite for blood and plunder than the common run of Britiſh hiſtorians. The late war againſt Tipoo Saib is ſpoke of as follows: <q>No period ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more favourable <hi>to humble Tipoo.</hi> The Nizam and the Mahrattas both declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready TO CRUSH THE RISING POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER OF MYSORE<note n="*" place="bottom">Guthrie's Geographical Grammar, fourteenth London edition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 686.</note>.</q> The latter words are, as printed by the author, in <hi>capitals.</hi> He proceeds at conſiderable length, in the moſt ſordid and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tone of exultation. No highwayman could ſpeak in plainer language. To <hi>humble Tipoo!</hi> This creed vindicates every thing that the French have done, or can do. Thus, after the earthquake at Liſbon, Spain, might have ſent an army to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Portugal. France, in the midſt of peace, might as juſtly diſembark an hundred thouſand men at Plymouth or Dover, to humble England. Thus, in all ages, has the moſt deteſtable ſophiſtry, been exerted to vindicate the commencement of unjuſt and deſtructive wars. Guthrie ſays, that this war coſt Tipoo forty-nine thouſand men. A famine deſtroyed perhaps ten times that number. Nothing but the wildeſt ignorance of hiſtory could make our citizens believe that the French are worſe than their neighbours. It is of the higheſt importance to remove this miſtake, which has become ſuch a favourite handle of party.</p>
               <p>Of all writers, Burke is the fitteſt to be quoted on this head. <q>I never, ſays he, ſhall ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the janiſarian republic of Algiers as to put it in compariſon, for every ſort of crime, turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and oppreſſion, with the jacobin republic of Paris.</q> Yet, when ſpeaking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> England, this author has afforded a ſtill more complete idea of depravity. <q>There has not been in this century any foreign peace or war, in its origin, <hi>the fruit of popular deſire,</hi> except the war that was made with Spain in 1739.</q> [This is the grand aſſertion of Paine that government dragged England into ſuch quarrels for the ſake of augmenting public debt, and pillaging the public purſe.

[This ſhews the rooted corruption of the people.] Some years after, it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to converſe with many of the principal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors againſt that miniſter (Walpole), and with thoſe who principally excited that clamour. None of them, <hi>no not one,</hi> did in the leaſt defend the meaſure, or attempt to <hi>juſtify their conduct.</hi> They condemned it as freely as they would have

               <p>This is a ſufficient reply to the endleſs barking of Webſter and Camillus about jacobin principles. Let us add one word more about this war of 1739. Guthrie ſays, that the Engliſh took three thouſand four hundred and thirty-four prizes. They loſt three thouſand two hundred and thirty-eight. Thus we learn that a navy cannot protect an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive commerce. Engliſh trade has, in the preſent ſtruggle, ſuffered ſtill more ſeverely. A Britiſh navy of ſix hundred ſail cannot ſecure Britiſh ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Six frigates have an hundred times leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability to protect the commerce of America.</p>
               <p>In 1772, an enquiry took place before the Houſe of Commons, as to the conduct of the Eaſt-India company. Burgoyne was chairman of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. He ſays, that <q>ſuch a ſcene of iniquity, rapine, and injuſtice, ſuch unheard of cruelties, ſuch open violations of every rule of morality, every tie of religion, and every principle of good government was never before diſcovered; and that, through the whole of the inveſtigation, he could not find <hi>a ſingle ſpot</hi> whereon to lay his finger, it being all equally one maſs of moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of villainies, and the moſt notorious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption<note n="†" place="bottom">Evidences of our tranſactions in the Eaſt-Indies, &amp;c. by Mr. Parker.

               <p>One inceſſant reproach to the French has been the breach of public credit. Our ally is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with haſty leaps, to the ſame level. On the 27th of February, 1797, the privy council of George the third, by an arbitrary order, forbade the bank of England <q>from iſſuing any caſh in payment, until the ſenſe of parliament could be taken on that ſubject.</q> The reaſon given is, an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <q>a want of ſufficient caſh to anſwer the exigencies of the <hi>public</hi> ſervice.</q> If government had forbidden the bank to pay gold and ſilver as the intereſt of the public debt, this would have been no worſe than a ſimple confeſſion of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy. But they ſtep in between the bank and its private creditors, and ſay, <q>You ſhall not pay your private debts.

iniquity. It is as extenſive in its operation, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in its object. Every individual in Britain will feel the effects of this ſtoppage.

               <p>The act of parliament that has followed this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of council, affects, in a tender point, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile intereſt of the United States; and, as ſhall be preſently explained, it ſtrikes at one of the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Britiſh treaty. Much pains are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repreſent it as of a temporary nature, and to convince the public that credit will quickly come round to the former ſituation<note n="*" place="bottom">The tories who ſay ſo do not believe it. The rate of exchange on England was formerly above par, which is one hundred and ſixty-ſix and two thirds per cent. It has now (May 10th, 1797,) ſunk to an hundred and twenty-five, and an hundred and thirty. When a bill returns under proteſt from England, the indorſee is intitled to twenty per cent. of damages. People now refuſe to grant ſuch bills, unleſs with this proviſo, that they ſhall not be liable to the uſual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of non-payment.</note>. On this account, it cannot be regarded as deſultory to ſtate, in this place, ſome deciſive facts, of which a few are not generally known in America.</p>
               <p>The national bankruptcy of England is not a matter which has come ſuddenly to a criſis. Its inevitable approach was diſtinctly foreſeen and deſcribed. Mr. William Morgan, an eminent writer on Engliſh finances, publiſhed, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of 1796, <hi>Facts addreſſed to the people of Great Britain.</hi> From a long ſeries of arguments and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, the following particulars have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pitt eſtimates the yearly rents of all the landed eſtates in Britain, at twenty-five millions
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031906_0090_0FEF4327B511B180"/>
ſterling. But the land tax, at four ſhillings in the pound, though comprehending houſes, places, and penſions, gives only one million nine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds. Mr. Morgan believes that the yearly rents do not exceed eighteen millions. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual expenſes wanted, in 1796, even for a <hi>peace</hi> eſtabliſhment, were twenty-two millions. Thus, even a year ago, the public taxes were equal to the whole landed rents of Britain. It was, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, found difficult or impoſſible to raiſe the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two millions eſſential for the national credit, even ſuppoſing that the war had ended in January, 1796. In February, 1795, taxes were laid to the expected amount of ſixteen hundred and forty-five thouſand pounds. In December following, others were alſo <hi>propoſed</hi> to the amount of eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-three thouſand pounds. Yet the intereſt of many millions of debt ſtill remained to be <hi>provided for.</hi> From the firſt eſtabliſhment of the conſolidated fund, in 1786, till the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent war, the expenditure invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exceeded the <hi>revenue.</hi> The deficiencies in the ſix years preceding the war, amounted to nearly ſeven millions ſterling. The blank was ſupplied by loans, and extraordinary but caſual receipts. In the firſt three years of the war, new taxes were laid to the amount of about four millions, and ſtill the annual deficiencies increaſed. In 1795, they came nearly to <hi>two millions.</hi>
                  <q>It is probable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſays Mr. Morgan, that <hi>annual loans</hi> will become neceſſary, in future, to provide for the ordinary expences of a peace eſtabliſhment; and theſe loans, by requiring new taxes, will produce further deficiencies; ſo that, by borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each year, not only to pay the deficiencies of the preceding year, but alſo the intereſt on the deficiencies in former years, the national debt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031906_0091_0FEF4329F8E49EF8"/>
will be increaſing, at compound intereſt, in the ſame manner as it is reduced; but with this alarming difference, that the operations in the one caſe, are ten times more powerful than in the other. If theſe are likely to be the effects of the public debt, with the expenditure only of a <hi>peace</hi> eſtabliſhment, or on the ſuppoſition that the war were immediately cloſed, what muſt be the conſequences of obſtinately perſiſting in a ſyſtem of profuſion, which, if long continued, would ruin any country, however unimpaired its ſtrength and reſources?</q>

               <p>Men who deſire uſeful knowledge will not tire of this quotation. It is certainly better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than to ring invidious changes on the purity of Connecticut<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The hiſtory of the new ſtate-houſe at Hartford, exhibits a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable ſpecimen of this commodity. The aſſembly poſſeſſed a claim on the ſtate of New-York for almoſt fifteen hundred thouſand acres of land, which are worth three or four millions of dollars. In 1795, they ſold this claim for a few thouſand pounds, to a private company. See American Annua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus it follows, that for the dirty conſideration of a few thouſand pounds, the legiſlature of Connecticut has put the union in danger of a civil war. With theſe facts before their eyes, and with an effrontery that tranſcends all deſcription, many writers extol the ſuperlative <hi>federaliſm</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut; and poor Samuel Dexter, as one of his reaſons for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the ſugar and ſnuff exciſe, ſaid in Congreſs, in 1794, that all the members of that ſtate voted for it.</p>
                     <p>If from the aſſembly themſelves, we turn to their conſtituents, the proſpect does not improve. The ſale of theſe fifteen hundred thouſand acres, if the ſtate had a real right to them, was an act of outrageous robbery on their fellow citizens; it was a ſecond Yazoo buſineſs. When the people of Georgia found their property invaded, they elected a new aſſembly, eraſed the ſwindling law from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic records, proclaimed its infamous authors, and ordered their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney-general to proſecute ſenator James Gunn, as one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. This was acting like men; but the citizens of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, when in a ſimilar ſituation, truckle under legiſlative treachery; while Pelham, and Trumbull, and Webſter, and a ſwarm of other ſcribblers from that quarter, rack their ingenuity in reviling, as a race of inferior and degraded beings, the people of the ſouthern ſtates.</p>
                  </note>, and the wickedneſs of Virginia. Since theſe remarks were publiſhed by Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, a campaign has elapſed more diſaſtrous, if poſſible, to England, than any of the former. Her ſituation has, uniformly, ſunk from bad to worſe. What, in the end of 1795, was but <hi>expectation,</hi> has, in 1797, been converted into <hi>hiſtory.</hi> Many people in America ſeem to be intoxicated with the ſuperior information and abilities of Mr. Hamilton. The extravagant predictions and aſſertions of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031906_0092_0FEF43746F6F43C8"/>
and his auxiliaries, about Britiſh pride, and power, and opulence, have become too deſpicable for refutation. If Camillus really believed what he wrote reſpecting them, he muſt have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant. If he knew more than he choſe to tell, his conduct demands a harſher name. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther citation from Mr. Morgan will, perhaps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay a peruſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The competition of rapacious loan-mongers to ſhare in the ſpoils of the country, ſupported by the <hi>fictitious</hi> credit of paper-money, may perhaps enable the miniſter to triumph in the facility with which the public debts are accumulated, and the temporiſing expedient of ineffectual taxation may ſerve him as a proof of our inexhauſtible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources to provide for thoſe taxes; but a ſyſtem founded upon deluſion, muſt end in diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ruin. It was the boaſt of a French miniſter of finance, that the American war was carried on during his adminiſtration, without impoſing a new tax upon the French people; and it was this very circumſtance which produced
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031906_0093_0FEF432BC73AC0F8"/>
the revolution. He borrowed immenſe ſums an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and endeavoured to provide for them by the ineffectual means of economy; for, in that country, taxation had then arrived at its limits. A ſyſtem of economy, under a government which exiſted by corruption, neceſſary failed. New loans became neceſſary to pay the intereſt of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer loans. The maſs of debt continued to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate, till at length it overwhelmed public credit, and buried the government in its ruins.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the government and the bank of England can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at preſent command ſpecie, the next queſtion is, at what time, or from what ſource, have they a proſpect of getting it? The debts of the former are about three hundred and eighty millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Paine gueſſes the paper of the bank of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland at ſixty millions. Several other great banks had ſtopt before it, and the banks of Scotland and that of Ireland, have ſtopt ſince. In an affair of uncertainty, but of enormous magnitude, we may conjecture that eighty millions ſterling, in bank notes have been blocked up. This added to the debt will make four hundred and ſixty millions. Oppoſed to this world of paper, George Chalmers, an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be truſted in this caſe, ſays, that the Britiſh dominions have a circulation of twenty millions in gold and ſilver. Thus credit ſtands like an inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pyramid, of which paper is the baſe. But ſince that calculation, the quantity of hard money has been reduced. Beſides, every guinea, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſixpence, will now hide itſelf. Suppoſe that the bank has at preſent in its coffers two millions ſterling, and that this money is to be reſerved for public exigencies. Two months only of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching campaign will exhauſt it. The caſh will dive into the pockets of thoſe who furniſh the ſupplies, and they will hold it, with the gripe of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031906_0094_0FEF43763A435C08"/>
death, till the alarm has become to an iſſue. It is hard to ſee from whence money can be expected. The emperor will not replace his wages. In the mean while, confidence muſt by degrees decline. Tradeſmen muſt be thrown idle, from the want of a proper medium to pay them; and, after every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient has been tried, an univerſal bankruptcy will enſue. Unleſs France ſhall grant England a peace, the campaign of 1798 will require another loan. Paper cannot be ſent to the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, even were its character ſound at home. The precious metals cannot be had, and public credit will of neceſſity expire. We ſee that ſix years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the war, the miniſter after every exertion, was annually borrowing great part of a million ſterling to pay the intereſt of old debts. This practice alone would, in time, have produced inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; but, when there is ſuperadded the hiſtory of the laſt four years, probability riſes to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. In 1791, Mr. Rayment publiſhed a ſtatement of the number of the public creditors of England, taken from the books. It amounted to an hundred and twenty-ſeven thouſand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and one perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> About an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty millions ſterling have been added to the debt, ſo that we may now compute the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as being at leaſt an hundred and ſixty thouſand. The bankruptcies of 1793 came perhaps to twenty millions ſterling. Thoſe made by the ſtoppage of paper money will be at leaſt twenty times greater. Every man in Britain, who is worth five guineas, will be affected more or leſs. The ſhock muſt convulſe every nerve in the maſs of property. Thus much for Britiſh credit. We now come to apply theſe remarks with reſpect to Jay's treaty. The Philadelphian addreſs to the Preſident, thanking him for having ſigned it, ſpeaks of <q>indemnity

                  </q> The New-York chamber, in their reſolutions of the 21ſt of July, 1795, congratulate themſelves on <q>a fair <hi>compenſation</hi> for the ſpoliations upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</q> Curtius in his fourth letter, truſts that <q>juſt claims will be ſupported, and juſt damages <hi>paid!</hi>
                  </q> The fifteenth number of Camillus is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied on this ſubject. He quotes the ſeventh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the treaty, by which, referring to the pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies on American commerce, <q>his Britannic ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty undertakes to cauſe the ſame to be paid to ſuch claimant in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> without any deduction,</q> after the amount has been aſcertained. <q>The plan, ſays Camillus, affords a <hi>moral certainty</hi> of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial juſtice.—The indemnification which may be awarded, is to be paid fully, immediately, and without <hi>de tour</hi> by the Britiſh government itſelf. Say ye impartial and enlightened, if all this be not as <hi>it ought to have been!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, the hope of recovering payment for the ſhips and cargoes was the greateſt cauſe for the treaty becoming popular among American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Its advocates inceſſantly held out this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle as an object of exultation. When handling it Camillus riſes above his wonted compoſure, and one apoſtrophe may well enough anſwer another. <q>Say ye impartial and enlightened, after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding explanation of Engliſh finances, do ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect one farthing from the king of England? Do ye fancy that a monarch who is fifteen months in arrears to the wench who ſcours his water cloſet<note n="*" place="bottom">On the 18th of April, 1796, Mr. Grey ſaid in parliament, that the civil liſt was FIVE QUARTERS in arrears.

               </p>
               <p>Dr. Ames, in his renowned ſpeech in Congreſs on the treaty, delivered himſelf with more caution. <q>Five millions of dollars, ſaid he, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more, on the ſcore of ſpoliations committed on our commerce, depend upon the treaty.

               </p>
               <p>One feels leſs for the misfortunes of ſome of the merchants on account of their ingratitude to their ſeamen. The neglect of Jay to ſecure an article in favour of theſe people, even when it was offered by Grenville, has already been ſtated to the public<note n="†" place="bottom">Britiſh honour and humanity, p. 41.</note>. It was diſgraceful to have accepted of ſuch a treaty at all, without an ample compenſation to every one of theſe men, who had been impriſoned, hand-cuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, ſtarved and flogged, while acting in American ſervice. The printed reſolutions of the chamber of commerce at New-York and Boſton approve the treaty in general terms, without the ſmalleſt notice of this infamous omiſſion. The <hi>indemnity</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Philadelphia drop not one word of alarm or ſympathy for the dangers or ſufferings of ſome thouſands of mariners. On the 14th of April, 1797, alſo, when the merchants of Philadelphia
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031906_0097_0FEF43364D3491C8"/>
preſented an addreſs to Congreſs in favour of the treaty, that paper contains not one glimmering of compaſſion or even of reference to the ſufferings of their ſeamen. Five millions of dollars, and <q>the principal part of their remaining <hi>fortunes,</hi>
                  </q> form the excluſive burden of the ſong. Never did the ſordid ſpirit of mercantile adventure diſplay itſelf in more repulſive colours. Woe be to that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whoſe counſels are governed by merchants, or by prieſts! When the Senate ſaw an article about the Weſt Indian trade which they did not like, they refuſed to accept it. But they overlooked this hideous chaſm about ſeamen, though in every view of juſtice, honour, humanity, and even of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt, it was by many degrees more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant than the other. This is preciſely the way in which Congreſs and the country have treated their old continental ſoldiers; ſo that no part of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened citizens has a title to condemn the reſt.</p>
               <p>It may be anſwered, <hi>but what could you do!</hi> The reply is ready. The immediate reſtoration of every American ſeaman, or a ſerious and vigorous effort to that end, ſhould have been demanded and obtained, before making a ſingle clauſe of any treaty. Farther, every one of them ſhould have received a liberal compenſation for the time during which they had been confined in Britiſh veſſels. We have not heard of ſuch compenſation being either given, or ſought. If any ſcruple was to be entertained on the part of Britain about making ſuch reparation, it contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted common reaſon to believe that negociation with ſuch people could end in ſatisfaction. Figure the caſe that a crimp kidnaps your ſon on the ſtreets of London, and ſends him to the Eaſt Indies as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit. This offender owns the fact, and without engaging to reſtore the young man, he aſks you to enter into an agreement for a freight of cotton or
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031906_0098_0FEF433800BC9558"/>
tobacco. You would not liſten to ſuch a propoſal till ſecurity was given for the redemption of your ſon; or, if you did liſten, the whole world would pronounce you an unnatural barbarian. Of Britiſh impreſſments, the following inſtance is not, perhaps, worſe nor better than an hundred others. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted merely as a ſample.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of July, 1795, Cyprian Cook, maſter of the ſloop Criſis, of Norwich, in Connecticut, and Elijah Clarke, a paſſenger in the veſſel, emitted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions at New-London, of which here follows an abridgement. On the 4th of July, preceding, the Criſis, and above twenty other American veſſels were lying at anchor in the port of Jeremie, in Hiſpaniola. The Hermione, an Engliſh frigate, came into the port, anchored, and ſent her boats to board the Americans. Every man in the veſſels, was taken away, excepting the captains and mates. They were, to the number of ſixty or ſeventy, kept on board and faſting, during forty-eight hours. They were examined, one by one, and five only were diſmiſſed, becauſe, as the Engliſh captain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, they were unfit for ſervice. All theſe men were Americans born, excepting two Danes, who had been naturalized here. This outrage happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven months and an half after ſigning of the treaty; and it ſhews how ſincerely England deſpiſed our envoy and thoſe who ſent him. Tame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſuch treatment was the very exceſs of national diſgrace. But, after Jay had declined to write an article in favour of our ſailors, they were ſure of meeting with the worſt uſage. It is ſtrange that Jay did not burn the copy of his card, making a demand in their behalf, and of the conſenting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Grenville. The Preſident had very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be aſhamed of laying ſuch a correſpondence before the Houſe of Repreſentatives. It is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031906_0099_0FEF433A77547D60"/>
that ſome thouſands of American ſeamen have been treated like the above at port Jeremie<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Some Engliſh newſpapers of 1796, ſay, that the preſs gangs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Britain, amount to nine thouſand men. A great part of theſe fellows are themſelves ſailors, and every one of them, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſervice, muſt be robuſt and able-bodied. Their ſituation requires better wages, and better living, than that of a foot ſoldier. They can hardly coſt the country leſs, in one ſhape or other, than two ſhillings ſterling per day. On ſhip board, or in uſeful manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, they would be worth at leaſt an equal ſum. Thus each of theſe kidnappers ſinks daily four ſhillings ſterling, which, between poſitive and negative loſs, they might expend or earn for ſociety. Nine thouſand men, at a loſs of four ſhillings per head, make a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fund of eighteen hundred pounds ſterling a day. This, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the number of days in a year, gives ſix hundred and fifty-ſeven thouſand pounds per annum, for the charge of preſs gangs. It is an ordinary computation in Britain, that every impreſſed man coſts, upon a medium, an hundred pounds ſterling, before he is got into actual ſervice.</p>

               <p>Camillus, in No. vi. points out many difficulties in the way of a complete protection for our mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is likely enough that the article, if inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would have been broken; and real difficulties might have occurred in the buſineſs. But even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum required ſuch a clauſe. Camillus has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſome aſſertions that are abſolutely untrue. He ſays that <q>Great Britain has accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly declined any definitive arrangement on the ſubject; notwithſtanding earneſt and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted efforts of our government.—Our miniſter plenipotentiary, Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly exerted himſelf to have it placed upon ſome acceptable footing; but his endeavours have

While France was in the very act of driving the allies to perdition, Jay, by the moſt abſurd, or perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious miſconduct, put his hand to the treaty, when, if he had only waited ſix weeks, till the approaching conqueſt of Holland had been completed, he might have had almoſt any terms worth aſking. Pinckney was ſilly enough to approve of his management in making ſo good a bargain. Neither of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious envoys would buy largely in the funds, when there was a certainty of their tumbling. Yet they clapped up a treaty, when every moment of delay was ineſtimable to America. This is the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous way in which our buſineſs hath been tranſacted. The affair had hung over ten years, and then was finiſhed at a moment of infinite impropriety. Such miſerable botching the world has probably never ſeen before.</p>
               <p>Camillus foreſaw the objection as to the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable period of ſigning the treaty. In No. vii. he defends it thus. <q>It will be uſeful to go back to the periods when the negociation began and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Our envoy arrived in England, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the buſineſs of his miſſion, at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when there was a general elation on account of the naval victory gained by Lord Howe, and previous to thoſe important ſucceſſes, which have terminated in the conqueſt of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember laſt, prior to the laſt mentioned event, and the defection of the king of Pruſſia. The poſture of things at the time of the negociation, and not <hi>at this time,</hi> is the ſtandard to try its merits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It will indeed be <hi>uſeful to go back;</hi> for every line of this argument is contradicted by undiſputed facts.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031906_0101_0FEF4429022A9C78"/>
The Preſident's meſſage to Congreſs about his having appointed Jay, was dated the 16th of April, 1794. The king of Pruſſia, in the beginning of that month, had publiſhed a curious manifeſto ſtating his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for quitting his allies. Pitt afterwards gave him twelve hundred thouſand pounds to make him return to the combat. He took the money, but never performed his promiſe. Inſtead of that, he went into Poland to beſiege Warſaw. He left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his quota as a prince of the German empire; but they alſo were annihilated, along with an Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian army, at Kaiſerſlautern, in a battle which laſted incluſively night and day, from the 12th to the 15th of July, 1794; in the end, the republicans plunged through the loaded Pruſſian batteries at the point of the bayonet. Surely, Mr. Hamilton imagines that nobody reads newſpapers except himſelf. In No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1794, when Jay ſigned this paper, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric William had, for many months, been abuſed in the daily prints of London, as a deſerter from the cauſe of <hi>morality,</hi> and <hi>regular</hi> government. Thus Camillus ſtands detected of an intentional and notorious falſehood.</p>
               <p>As to the general <hi>elation</hi> about lord Howe's victory, the French were equally ſatisfied, and with better reaſon. An American ambaſſador <hi>ought to have been</hi> poſſeſſed of more penetration than the porters and chairmen whom Pitt or his runne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, upon that joyful occaſion, to break the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of John Wilkes and lord Stanhope.</p>
               <p>Again, Camillus ſays that Jay entered upon the buſineſs of his miſſion <hi>previous to thoſe important ſucceſſes which terminated in the conqueſt of Holland.</hi> This is another ſtupendous untruth, like that about the king of Pruſſia. A few facts and dates will prove it to be ſo. On the 26th of April, 1794, Pichegru totally beat Clairfait at Moucron, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031906_0102_0FEF43CE40A6E2A8"/>
killed ſix thouſand of his troops. In the courſe of a few weeks, a number of other deſperate battles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. The allies did whatever brave men, and able officers could do; but the French, by their numbers, their enthuſiaſm, and their talents, fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drove them out of the field. So early as the 19th of May, 1794, the emperor printed an addreſs to the inhabitants of Bruſſels, in a tone almoſt as dejected as the king of Pruſſia's farewell manifeſto. The armies continued almoſt conſtantly fighting till the 26th of June, when the French gained the battle of Fleurus. This completely turned the ſcale. The grand Auſtrian army immediately ſent off their baggage, and, in the courſe of a few days, thirty thouſand people fled from Bruſſels. From that day forward every man in England, excepting Jay, muſt have foreſeen the conqueſt of Holland. Though Jay had <hi>entered upon the buſineſs of his miſſion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fate of Flanders was decided, it was his duty to have ſpun out the buſineſs and to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the utmoſt advantage of that invaluable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency. Camillus, by advancing, in Jay's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the above palpable fictions, has expoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reinforcing the weakneſs of the cauſe.</p>
               <p>But Camillus ſhould alſo have defended the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Congreſs. They certainly did not approve of the treaty till after the defection of the king of Pruſſia, and the ſurrender of Amſterdam. They did not ratify till the 24th of June, 1795. In the above quotation, Camillus plainly implies, that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>defection</hi> and <hi>reduction,</hi> &amp;c. better terms might have been had. The queſtion then comes to be <hi>why the Senate did not ſtand out to get them?</hi> They ſent back an article. They ſhould have amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſent back others. The true reaſon was, firſt, that ſome of the Senators were ſeriouſly and ſubſtantially ignorant about the real ſtate of politics
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031906_0103_0FEF4386638EEBA8"/>
in Europe; for, after the reduction of the ſeven United Provinces, a fear of England attacking Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was <q>but the eye of childhood; that fears a painted devil.</q> Secondly, the ratification was an object of party. Jay had been ſent over in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of a majority in the Houſe of Repreſentatives; and to have refuſed the ratification of a treaty plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under the auſpices of Mr. Hamilton, would have caſt irrecoverable ridicule on their whole connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For this reaſon twenty ſenators, leſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, if ſuch a thing can be, than Jay himſelf, agreed to what he had done; and, as Junius ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>though royal favour cannot remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of infamy, it undoubtedly <hi>leſſens,</hi> for it <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides</hi> the burden.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, independent of French victories, Jay muſt have known that Pitt, from his dreadful want of money, could not hold out for any conſiderable time. Much has been ſaid as to the danger of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (forſooth!) declaring war againſt the United States. To ſhew the dreadful plight that ſhe was in, the following particulars are taken from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of reſolutions read in the houſe of commons by Mr. Smith, on the 22d of February, 1796.</p>
               <p>In September, 1795, Walter Boyd, junior, was requeſted by Pitt to advance him a million ſterling. He did ſo, and by agreement, he was to draw bills on the lords commiſſioners of the treaſury, which they were to accept. Now comes the aſtoniſhing part of the tranſaction. Bills for ſeven hundred thouſand pounds were drawn in London, bearing a falſe date at Hamburgh, ſeveral weeks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the real time of framing them. Walter Boyd is not engaged in any houſe of buſineſs at Hamburgh, ſo that he might as well have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to draw bills from the moon. Theſe forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, proſeſſing to be foreign bills, were written
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031906_0104_0FEF442AE165BE60"/>
upon unſtamped paper. <q>They were, ſays Mr. Smith, of ſuch a nature and deſcription, as the bank of England would have refuſed to diſcount for any commercial houſe whatever, and ſuch as it would have been injurious to the credit of any private houſe, to have negociated.</q> Theſe are civil words, but, in plain Engliſh, any other parties of ſuch a plot, but the miniſter and his friends, would infallibly have been hanged.</p>
               <p>It was plain that a government adopting ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous expedients to raiſe money, muſt have been upon its laſt legs. With ſuch facts in view, it is amazing how completely ſome of the ableſt men in America were deceived about it. Of all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in favour of the Britiſh treaty, none was more loudly repeated than the danger of a war with Britain. <q>War, ſaid Dr. Ames, might be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but could not be prevented. The cauſes of it would remain, would be aggravated, would be multiplied, and ſoon become intollerable. More captures, more impreſſments, would ſwell the liſt of our wrongs, and the current of our rage.</q> [If England had declared war againſt the United States, in conſequence of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives rejecting the treaty, ſhe would have become bankrupt before the next Chriſtmas.] <q>The progreſs of <hi>wealth</hi> and improvement is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſome will think too rapid.</q>

And in this

progreſs what ſeems to be fiction is found to fall ſhort of experience.</q> And, <hi>in this progreſs,</hi> the bank of the United States, unleſs its diſcounts are extremely circumſpect, will go to the family-vault of thoſe in London, Edinburgh, and Dublin. The reign of paper is paſt in Europe, and, as a matter of courſe, its expiration in America will happen ſooner or latter. In caſe of any ſerious rupture with France, and after the unparalelled ruin that is overſpreading England, every man here will directly inſiſt on metal for his bank notes.

                  </gap> the <hi>vaſt crop of our neutrality,</hi> the privateers of France and England have reaped a very great part of it.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now go back to Mr. Smith's reſolutions, and cite another proof of the utter incapacity of England, in June 1796, to have attacked America. <q>The profits of the contractors, ſays he, at the expence of the nation, have been ſo exorbitantly ſwelled, as to have riſen even before the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit was made thereon, to an amount greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the depoſit itſelf, viz. on a loan of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen millions, to the enormous and incredible ſum of, <hi>two millions, one hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds ſterling.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>No man could imagine that ſuch a ſyſtem was to hold out, any more than the gambling intereſt of five per cent. per month, ſo frequently paid of late in the ſea port towns of America. Both theſe ways of raiſing money reſembled the reſource of the culprit, who ſaid that he could eſcape the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by cutting his throat in priſon.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance ſhall be given of the hurry in which Pitt was to ſecure the loan for 1796, and of the extreme impatience with which the people of England ſaw the war prolonged.</p>
               <p>When the bankers of London agreed to lend a ſum of money to the miniſter, the cuſtom was to
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031906_0106_0FEF43D586C0F160"/>
give them credit in the public funds to a certain amount. The current price of ſtock, at the time of making the bargain, determined the quantity of it to be given for the new advances of the creditors. Thus, if the three per cents were at eighty, the ſame proportion of them would buy ten thouſand pounds, that would only buy ſeven thouſand five hundred, if the ſtocks were at ſixty per cent. It was hence the great aim of every premier to raiſe them as high as poſſible, before his loan, and it was uſual to caſt proſpects of peace, into ſome royal ſpeech or meſſage, by which they were ſure of being raiſed. But, on the 27th of November, 1795, Mr Pitt, with a precipitancy that wears the fouleſt aſpect, cloſed a loan for eighteen millions with Mr. Boyd. A meſſage that he muſt have foreſeen, came on the 8th of December, thereafter, from George the Third to parliament, telling his earneſt deſire of peace. The funds inſtantly got up ſo high that the quantity given for the loan, roſe in its value, <hi>nine hundred thouſand pounds ſterling.</hi> This was juſt ſo much money loſt to the public, and gained to the bankers, who probably run halves with Pitt himſelf. So rapid a riſe in the funds, on the ſlender proſpect of peace, ſhewed how very little the Britiſh were by this time diſpoſed or indeed enabled for a war with America. <q>I conſider all thoſe war arguments that have been made uſe of," ſaid Mr. Chriſtie, as nothing more than the old ſtory of raw-head-and-bloody-bones, much fitter to be uſed by an old woman to quiet a croſs child, than to convince any of the enlightened members of this houſe of the propriety of this meaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates, vol, ii. p. 351.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Events have ſince proved that the dread of war was a mere chimera, as the public credit of England
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031906_0107_0FEF438928314A98"/>
had become too feeble to ſupport ſuch a ſhock. But, independent of that, and admitting our legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators to have been, as many of them were, very ſhamefully ignorant of the ſtate of Engliſh finance, ſtill America had another ſtring to her bow that would have reduced Britain to any reaſonable terms. The Weſt-India Royal Gazette, of the 7th of October, 1794, contains a memorial to Henry Dundas from the Weſt-Indian planters and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. They ſtate, at much length, how impoſſible it is for them to ſubſiſt unleſs by ſupplies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from this country. Hence an embargo on exportation would have reduce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is not room here to inſert the whole memorial, though every line of it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves attention; but the following paſſages will ſhew how ſilly it was in members of Congreſs to ſtand up and make ſpeeches about the danger of an attack from England in the ſhape of open war.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands," ſays the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, "containing about five hundred thouſand black, and about fifty thouſand white inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, have been for many years, greatly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for food upon a ſupply of flour, rice, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an corn, oatmeal, bread, and other articles of dry proviſions, received by a ſpeedy channel, and in quantities proportionate to their want, from the countries now under the ſovereignty of <hi>the United States of America;</hi> by no internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource can they render themſelves <hi>independent of ſuch a ſupply,</hi> excepting by a total change of their agricultural ſyſtem, at the expence of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and revenue of the mother country; and experience dearly bought, on ſuch occaſions, has now ſufficiently evinced, that, <hi>by no other external channel,</hi> can ſuch a ſupply, adequate to their wants, and ſuited to the emergency of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, be obtained.</q>

Or how could two-third of the people in this country fall into ſo fooliſh a tremor on that head? It argues very little either for the ſound information, or the good ſenſe of our citizens.

               <p>The whole paper goes on the ſame principles, that the Britiſh Weſt-Indies are abſolutely at the mercy of the United States.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Britiſh colonies of Canada, Nova-Scotia, and St. John, inſtead of ſupplying the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia iſlands with timber and proviſions, have, upon a fair experience, been found, nearly at all times, to conſume their own productions of theſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and, upon ſome occaſions, even to need a ſupply from their neighbours of the United States.</q>

Every ſtep of inveſtigation diſcovers more clearly the utter ignorance, negligence, or corruption of his excellency John Jay. This envoy might have dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated his own terms about the Weſt-India trade, yet it was in this very quarter that he conſented to a ſtipulation which even the capacious gulp of our Senate could not, or durſt not, ſwallow. By the twelfth article, we were not to keep the Britiſh iſlands from ſtarving by freighting any veſſels larger than <hi>ſeventy tons!</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Many obſtacles ſtand in the way of the Weſt-India colonies, obtaining lumber and proviſions from Great-Britain, or any other country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; more particularly the precarious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch a ſupply; its diſtance in time of emergency, and the periſhable nature of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of food, which forbids a proviſion of large ſtores from a reſource ſo remote; and even were it practicable for the colonies to exiſt under a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the neceſſaries of life and cultivation, upon means ſo uncertain, yet the enormous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of thoſe means, particularly in reſpect to lumber, muſt prevent their cultivating their lands to any beneficial purpoſe either to themſelves, in the firſt inſtance, or finally to Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>The Britiſh colonies have found, in an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the United States, a market for their ſuperfluous produce beyond the European con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and particularly for the article of rum; for which, at different times, the European market would not afford the coſt of package and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far we have about one-fourth part of the memorial. We now plainly ſee that the more iſlands which England conquered in the Weſt-Indies, the more ſhe was dependant on this country, for their means of ſubſiſtence, for timber to build houſes,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031906_0110_0FEF43D737AE41D8"/>
for ſtaves and heading, as likewiſe for taking off a great part of the Weſt-Indian productions that would not bear the expence of being conveyed to Europe. The planters and merchants proceed to complain heavily of the mode of intercourſe then permitted between the continent and the iſlands. It is difficult to do juſtice to their ideas but in their own words. Here follows part of what they ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Since the ſeparation of the United States from Great Britain, their intercourſe with our iſlands having been reſtricted to <hi>Britiſh veſſels only,</hi> the price of lumber and proviſions at the Weſt-India markets, under the moſt favourable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of peace and regular ſupply, has ariſen from fifty to an hundred per cent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, by the way, ſhews the tyrannical ſpirit of the Britiſh government, and how every other part of the empire is ſacrificed to the plan of aggrandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the mother country. The memorial goes on in theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The intercourſe, while confined to Britiſh veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, has, for various reaſons, been principally carried on by a direct trade between the iſlands and the United States, in veſſels conſtructed and fitted for the purpoſe, which muſt evidently have the advantage over veſſels employed in the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous trade from Great-Britain; as the laſt could not be at once proper for the tranſport of lumber from America to the iſlands, and for that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from the iſlands of Great Britain; nor afford means of barter in rum and molaſſes, nor be navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated on equally advantageous terms with thoſe ſmaller veſſels, nor equally ſuit their expedition to the wants of the iſlands and to the ſtate of markets.</p>
                  <p>Upon the breaking out of a war with France, theſe ſmall and defenceleſs veſſels have either
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031906_0111_0FEF322308621288"/>
fallen a prey to the enemy, or been employed in other trades; and this cannot be accounted a circumſtance accidental, or that admits of future remedy; ſince the nature of the intercourſe in queſtion forbids an eſtabliſhment of regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys to and from all the iſlands at ſuch times as may be ſuited to their wants; and the immenſe expence of outfit, ſeamen's wages, and inſurance, diſcourage adventure in a trade attended with ſuch imminent riſk, and which, if a ſupply by ſuch means were even poſſible, muſt ſwell the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence beyond thoſe bounds which the cultivators in thoſe iſlands can poſſibly ſupport.</p>
               </q>
               <p>There is next ſtated the frequent and <hi>invincible neceſſity</hi> which the governors of the Weſt-India iſlands find of opening their ports to American veſſels to prevent inſtant ſtarvation; and yet proviſions and other articles of <hi>immediate neceſſity</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſold at three hundred per cent. beyond the average price. For this, and other reaſons above ſtated, they ſolicit a more extended intercourſe with America. They repreſent the impoſſibility of providing food from their lands, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſtreſs under which they labour during the preſent war. <q>Under ſuch diſadvantages a perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the preſent ſyſtem of their intercourſe with America muſt form an accumulation of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which will entirely preclude a fair competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their rivals in cultivation, will ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and aſſiſt the progreſs of cultivation in the Dutch and Spaniſh ſettlements, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the diſtreſs and ruin of the inhabitants of the Britiſh Weſt-India colonies, and of the numerous claſſes of their fellow ſubjects in Great Britain and Ireland connected with and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The memorial alſo repreſents the good policy

of encouraging America to perſevere in her agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultural ſyſtem, and expreſſes fears that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her intercourſe with the iſlands may have a tendency of driving her to manufactures. They add, <q>our ſyſtem of excluſive poſſeſſion of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits has been found, in times of emergency, impracticable, and the participation which, at ſuch times, we have granted to America, has had neither the merit of a conceſſion with that country, nor the advantage of effectual relief to ourſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is needleſs to ſeek farther evidence of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Weſt-Indies exiſting wholely at our good will; and how highly England values that part of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions appears from her ſolicitude to extend them.</p>
               <p>In the debate, in parliament, about the beginning of 1796, on the bill for aboliſhing the ſlave-trade, in the Houſe of Commons, Mr. Dundas ſtated the imports from the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, in 1795, to be as follows: eight millions eight hundred thouſand pounds ſterling; revenue ariſing on this amount, one million ſix hundred and twenty-four thouſand; ſhipping employed in that trade, ſix hundred and ſixty-four veſſels; tonnage, one hundred and fifty-three thouſand; ſeamen eight thouſand; exports from Great-Britain, to the Weſt-Indies, in 1794, three millions ſeven hundred and forty thouſand pounds, employing ſeven hundred veſſels; tonnage, one hundred and ſeventy-ſeven thouſand; ſeamen, twelve thouſand; produce of the iſlands imported to Britain and re-exported, three millions ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>On the 10th of February, 1797, Mr. Parker, when defending the plan of building American fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, obſerved that, ſince the beginning of the war, not a ſingle Britiſh Weſt-India fleet had been home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bound which theſe ſix frigates were not ſtrong
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031906_0113_0FEF4392A093FB28"/>
enough to have taken. Such was the known track of the trade-winds that they were obliged to come <hi>within ſeven days ſailing of this coaſt.</hi> The French were in the ſame condition, ſo that we might have been as formidable to either of theſe powers as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers is.</p>
               <p>The ſtopping of this enormous trade muſt have ruined the credit of Britain. She would not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have been haſty in declaring war againſt the country, after the dreadful campaign of 1794. On the 10th of February of that year, Dorcheſter had, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, made an addreſs to the Indians, wherein he ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the poſſibility of a war, in the courſe of the year, between England and the United States. But this was, moſt likely, a mere decoy for our executive. On the 26th of May following, Grenville and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das denied, in Parliament, any knowledge of this performance. They certainly lied, for they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to produce a copy of Dorcheſter's inſtructions; and, as Fox obſerved in reply, his lordſhip was not a perſon who would hazard ſuch a conduct without proper authority. This diſavowal by Dundas and Grenville ſhews that they were afraid to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſpeech; and that a rupture with the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States would have been regarded in the old country with univerſal reprobation. Grenville even pretended to deny the poſſibility of ſuch a harangue having ever been delivered. What an impoſtor! But this agrees very well with the forgery of Boyd's Hamburg bills<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſatellites of the miniſter have about as much honour and honeſty as himſelf.

               <p>Camillus, No. v. overlooks every circumſtance of this kind that ſhews how much Pitt would have
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031906_0114_0FEF4394417A76B8"/>
been afraid of an American war. He tries to play upon our prudence and our fears. When ſpeaking of the claim for negroes carried away by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh from New-York, at the end of the late war, he ſays <q>no conſideration of honour forbid <hi>(for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade)</hi> the renunciation; every calculation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt invited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the advantage, if, at the end of it, there was a certainty of attainment. But was war the alternative? Yes, war or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. —If nothing had reſulted [from Jay's voyage, he means,] was there any choice but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſals? Should we not have rendered ourſelves ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of the whole world by forbearing them?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The neceſſity that Camillus deſcribes did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; though we have loſt leſs by a ſhabby ſtate of peace, than we muſt have done by a ſucceſsful war. But wiſdom would have choſen a middle courſe. Jay might have addreſſed Grenville in terms like theſe. <q>You have wronged the United States in a variety of ſhapes. Your offers of redreſs are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or inſolent. We ſhall not declare war againſt you. There is a ſhorter and a cheaper way. America has no treaty of commerce with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. She cannot be accuſed of breaking any, by ſtopping the exportation of proviſions to your Weſt-India iſlands. We know that your fifty thouſand whites, and five hundred thouſand blacks cannot find bread or pork for their dinners, or timber to build their houſes, or ſtaves for their caſks, or even horſes or cattle, but by ſending for them to our continent. Beſides large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of their rum, we alſo take ſeveral produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that will not bear the expence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to Europe.

After driving Victor Hughes out of Guadaloupe, you might burn ſome of our towns on the ſea coaſt, as you did in the laſt war. But then we ſhall infallibly deſtroy your nine millions ſterling per annum of imports from the Weſt-Indies, and the ſixteen hundred thouſand pounds of revenue derived from them. This would be a mortal ſtroke to your finances, and ſo take your choice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In No xv. Camillus treats of the compenſation afforded by the ſeventh article of Jay's treaty for Britiſh piracies on American commerce. Since the apoplexy of Britiſh paper the word <hi>compenſation</hi> ſounds like mockery. But Camillus would have it believed that Pitt never intended the confiſcation of our veſſels. <q>Theſe terms, <hi>legal adjudication,</hi> were certainly not equivalent, upon any rational conſtruction, to <hi>condemnation.</hi>—Yet the Britiſh Weſt-India courts of admiralty appear to have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally acted upon the term as ſynonimous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.—The Britiſh cabinet have diſavowed this conſtruction of the Weſt-India courts; and
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031906_0116_0FEF442D74E59870"/>
have, as we have ſeen, by a ſpecial act of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, opened a door,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſtile of Mr. Hamilton is ſo prolix, he has ſuch ſkill at beating out his guinea into an acre of gold leaf<note n="*" place="bottom">This can really be done.</note>, that it is inconvenient to quote him at full length. But he means to have it underſtood, that the Weſt-India judges acted againſt the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and wiſhes of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. The latter muſt have been a very great blockhead, if he could not write a dozen intelligible lines, eſpecially on a ſubject of ſuch immenſe importance. But every man, Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and the tories excepted, can ſee at once the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſtory. The object was to ſeize Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhipping for the treble purpoſe of enriching the Engliſh, of humbling America, and diſtreſſing France. Yet the orders were to be drawn in a ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling form, that Pitt, if he ſhould afterwards find it adviſeable to diſown them, as he did Dorcheſter's inſtructions, might have a chink to creep through. We may be ſure that judges, and officers of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, acted from a perfect acquaintance with Pitt's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al intention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, when colonel Hamilton tries to perſuade us of the contrary, it is only adding inſult to robbery. When the object had been attained, it was very eaſy for Pitt to deny his orders. In a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chapter ſhall be inſerted a regular hiſtory of the whole of theſe inſtructions. A ſecond ſet was publiſhed by the cabinet of London on the 8th of January, 1794. They were very little better than the firſt. A former edition, juſt about as bad, had been iſſued on the 8th of June, 1793, under which alſo ſome bucaneering was committed. Thus the court of London acted upon a ſyſtem, and it was very wrong in Camillus to caſt the blame on the judges in the Weſt-Indies. As for the above <hi>door
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031906_0117_0FEF4431F6E78EA8"/>
that has been opened,</hi> it coſts two hundred and fifty pounds ſterling to get in. Divine juſtice never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played itſelf more ſplendidly than by the chaſtiſement of Britiſh pride. Since the ſtorming of the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, the moſt auſpicious event in the annals of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope is the fall of the bank of England.</p>
               <p>Among the inflammatory topics of the federal party, no one has had a more powerful effect than the attempt of Genet to involve this country in hoſtilities with England. The force of the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be admitted; but any other envoy, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like Genet, would have rejoiced in ſecuring the alliance of America. This was the very part which Dr. Franklin acted at the court of France; and the ultimate conſequences of his miſſion overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French monarchy. Nothing, therefore, can be more impenetrably ſtupid than to advance, as Mr. Hamilton and his hacks conſtantly do, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of involving us in an Engliſh war, as a charge of peculiar atrocity againſt Genet and the republic. This was the very path formerly purſued by the United States; and it would, under ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, have been attempted by any nation or any ambaſſador under heaven. This identical trap had been laid by the old Congreſs and Franklin for the French cabinet, ſo that it was perfectly natural for France to endeavour at obtaining a retaliation. While Genet muſt be condemned, Mr. Hammond was equally culpable. His perfidious and inſolent propoſal to Mr. Randolph, previous to the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jay's treaty<note n="*" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, chap. viii.</note>, was more affronting to the executive feelings, if any ſuch feelings exiſted, than the moſt frantic menaces uttered by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. A compliance by General Waſhington would have caſt him completely into the lee-way of the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031906_0118_0FEF4434FAD40348"/>
Britiſh ambaſſador. The poſſeſſion of ſuch a ſecret muſt have been of immenſe value to the Britiſh cabinet. It would have been a rudder by which our executive muſt have ſteered wherever Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond choſe to lead him; for it diſcovery was ſure to have interred even the popularity of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington. If this diſgraceful project had come from Genet, the Gazette of the United States would have played a weekly tune upon that fiddle to the end of this century. But, originating with Pitt, not a ſingle word will be heard about it from the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Waſhington has made an uncommon parade about the impartiality of his conduct between France and England. As the former ſaved him from the chance of aſcending a gibbet, to which he had been deſtined by the Parliament of Britain, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derive much honour from an utter oblivion of his political obligations. But the fact is, that he has preferred Britain to France. This will appear from what follows.</p>
               <p>In 1793, when Genet came here, he was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his inſtructions, to open negociations for a commercial treaty. They direct him to tell the American government that the executive council <q>are inclined to extend the latitude of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>commercial</hi> treaty.</q> Another idea was to break up the colonial and monopolizing ſyſtems of all nations, and emancipate the new world. Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, No. xxiv. calls the latter <hi>a mad ſcheme</hi> and <hi>a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical chimera.</hi> Theſe expreſſions betray Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton's general caſt of thinking. His feelings are ſo perfectly Britiſh, and monarchical, that it ſeems inconceivable how he ever came to ſight, as he did, for the American revolution. Mexico and Braſil are juſt as well entitled to freedom as New-York and Pennſylvania. Their emancipation would be
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031906_0119_0FEF449F2AC979D8"/>
an immenſe benefit both to the inhabitants of thoſe countries themſelves, and to mankind at large. So far from being chimerical, the event is probable<note n="*" place="bottom">The French had actually prepared a manifeſto intituled, <hi>Les Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiſe Libres le leurs fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>res de la</hi> LOUISIANE. In one place they ſay, <q>Le deſpotiſme Eſpagnol a ſurpaſſe en atrocité, en ſtupidité tous les deſpotiſms connus.</q> [Spaniſh deſpotiſm exceeds all others in atrocity and ſtupidity.] <q>Ce government qui a rendu le nom Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnol execrable ſur tout le continent de l'Amerique.</q> —[This go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which has rendered the Spaniſh name execrable over the whole continent of America, &amp;c.] Such orators would ſoon have found an audience.</note>; and it would thrill with joy the heart of every man who is not completely petrified againſt the pleaſure of ſeeing his fellow creatures happy. In the laſt age, Camillus would have defended the divine right of kings. In England, he would vindicate the Guinea trade, as in America he ſighs over the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Baſtile; while John Jay, and Rufus King, and Jedidiah Morſe, and the whole prieſthood of Connecticut, heave reſponſive notes of ſorrow<note n="†" place="bottom">The reverend doctor has a pulpit at Charleſtown, in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. A mob in that place burnt the Britiſh treaty. Their paſtor, hearing what was going on, haſted into the ſtreet to prevent them. He preſently returned to his houſe with a black eye.</note>. Were theſe regions of the new world independent, a rapid influx of the precious metals would pour into this country; and Mr. Hamilton's bank of the United States might then be able, upon a month's warning, to give hard dollars for one-fortieth part of the notes which it hath in circulation. So far from ſuch an emancipation being chimerical, it is next to certain of taking place. If the French do not atchieve this great event, the tide of federal population, rolling weſtward, will begin it in leſs than a century.</p>
               <p>Returning to Preſident Waſhington and Genet, we obſerve that the former refuſed to enter into any treaty, becauſe the Senate were not ſitting at the time when the French envoy made the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031906_0120_0FEF93EFA5A01868"/>
Yet, in the following ſpring, while the Senate were in ſeſſion, and without ever once conſulting them, did this identical George Waſhington take John Jay from the bench of the Supreme Court of this country, and ſend him to England, where, as we all know, he made a treaty. It was impoſſible for the French to avoid being affronted at ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. They could no longer put truſt in a man capable of ſuch naked inconſiſtency. Here is inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted evidence of the fact.</p>

No words can be plainer or ſtronger than thoſe which he employs. The oppoſite column ſpeaks an oppoſite language.

The bare circumſtances ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede any attempt either to exaggerate or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Nothing but the neceſſity of explanation could have, at all, brought the ſubject forward.</p>
               <p>While this ſheet was going to preſs, (16th May, 1797,) Preſident Adams has delivered a ſpeech at the opening of the firſt ſeſſion of the fifth Congreſs. He ſays that <q>the conduct of the government has been juſt and IMPARTIAL to foreign nations.</q> With reſpect to France, what has been above cited refutes the aſſertion. The ſpeech conſiſts entirely of a complaint againſt the republic. It forms a kind of poſtſcript to Pickering's letter to Pinckney. Not a word eſcapes the Preſident about Britiſh piracy, which continues to expand in full bloſſom. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day before this ſpeech was pronounced, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia Gazette contained a curious example of the relative amity of France and England. The French had carried about ſixteen American veſſels into Jean Rabel. The Britiſh cut out theſe veſſels, and it was expected that they would be ſent to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica for trial. There can be no doubt of their being tried ſomewhere; and the chance is, that moſt, if not the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of them will be confiſcated.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Munroe, had his farewell audience of the executive directory, Barras glanced with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at the Britiſh treaty, and the Britiſh intereſt by which it had been brought about. Mr. Adams
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031906_0122_0FEF443BC4691EB0"/>
has muſtered up this into an alarming inſult againſt our country, and an attempt to ſow domeſtic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion. He reprobates ſuch a ſtyle in the bittereſt terms, as <q>ſtudiouſly marked with indignities to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the government of the United States. It evinces a diſpoſition to ſeparate the people of the United States from the government; to perſuade them that they have different affections, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and intereſts, from thoſe of their fellow-citizens, and thus to produce diviſions fatal to our peace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech does not come within the period aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the preſent volume; but it forms a branch of the plan already explained for provoking a French war. A caſe exactly ſimilar to this of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras and Munroe happened, ſome years ago, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween lord Grenville and Thomas Pinckney. The former mentioned to the latter, in the moſt overbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring manner, the influence of a jacobin faction in America. Choiſeul or Neckar would not have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided an Engliſh envoy with the riots excited by John Wilkes or George Gordon. If the American executive of 1793, had felt even the moſt glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering ſpark of national dignity, the inſult would have been reſented. If Pinckney himſelf had been penetrable by reproach, he would have cut Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville ſhort. <q>My lord, he might have ſaid, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has many jacobins. Scotland has perhaps a ſtill larger proportion, and the number is hourly augmenting. The Iriſh are a jacobin nation. They are as ripe for a revolution, as a peach ever was for dropping. Confine your ſolicitude to them, and leave us to get rid, as quietly as we can, of your correſpondent, Alexander Hamilton, and his funding cancer of ſix per cent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Pinckney pocketed the ſtigma. He ſent home the precious notice of a jacobin faction in
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031906_0123_0FEF443F5F2E6FE8"/>
America. The executive, proud of ſuch a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration to his own doctrine, ſent it to Congreſs; and the letter was read to the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives without one murmur of diſdain. That Pinckney ſhould have endured ſuch mockery was bad. That General Waſhington ſhould have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the indignity to his own ſhoulders, without any muttering, was a great deal worſe. The abject ſilence of the repreſentatives, when the paper was read, betrayed an equal extinction of any formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Barras could not have wiſhed for a better prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his ſpeech to Munroe. The etiquette of federal degradation had been eſtabliſhed at London. It had been approved by the Preſident and Congreſs. Barras, with a thouſand reaſons for reſentment, while Grenville had not one, was highly excuſable for giving us a repetition of the doſe.</p>
               <p>The Preſident affects to briſtle up at the mention of American parties. He knows that there are ſuch, and an alluſion to them was not <hi>ſeparating the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the government.</hi> The Britiſh treaty was ſqueezed through the Senate by a party of twenty againſt a party of ten; and two of the former, on account of their perſonal characters, would hardly be admitted as evidences in a court of juſtice<note n="*" place="bottom">

The Gazette of the United States is an egg hatched under the very wing of the Senate. It produces a conſtant ſtream of invective againſt the republic, and againſt every man in this country who has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the French revolution. On the part of Barras the ſarcaſm was perfectly fair. We had no right or pretence to complain about it.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Repreſentatives have ſet out with a direct breach of one of their ſtanding rules. This is that <q>in ALL caſes where others than mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the houſe are eligible, there ſhall be <hi>a previous nomination.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The propriety of adopting this rule will be happily illuſtrated by a recent circumſtance, which occurred within the walls of that houſe. In the ſecond ſeſſion of the third Congreſs, Mr. Sedgwick preſented a petition from a perſon who wanted to be appointed as their ſhort hand writer. It was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known that this man <note n="*" place="bottom">David Hogan, editor of the State-Trials of Pennſylvania.</note> had, ſometime before, been publicly tried at Baltimore, and baniſhed, as <hi>a receiver of ſtolen goods.</hi> Had a ſtenographer been, at that time, choſen by ballot, Mr. Sedgwick might have probably brought himſelf into the dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of voting for this <hi>honeſt</hi> candidate. Such an inſtance has, to be ſure, nothing to do with the ſucceſsful candidate in the election here referred to; but it ſhews what may fall within the chapter of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles urged the juſtice of naming the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates beforehand, that gentleman might have an opportunity of balancing, in their own minds, the merit of each. This looked like fairneſs. The propoſal was reſiſted by Dr. William Smith of South-Carolina. That ſtate hath, in the fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſent two members of the ſame name and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031906_0125_0FEF44474BD3D118"/>
ſurname. The one here meant is the writer of PHOCION'S letters. This is the man who diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pilot boats, while Congreſs met at New-York, to Charleſton. The object of this maritime embaſſy was to buy up continental certificates. They were obtained at eighteen pence or half a crown per pound. They were then funded by the doctor at twenty ſhillings. By a ſpecial act of Congreſs, to which he gave his vote, an hundred and twenty or an hundred and fifty thouſand dollars of his precious commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity were transferred from the public ſtocks into the ſtock of the bank of the United States. There the Doctor draws eight per cent. of intereſt for the nominal amount of a ſum of which the principal originally coſt him but ten per cent. In plainer words, he advanced as it were ten dollars to ſerve his country, and, by various ſteps, he now draws an yearly intereſt for them, at the moderate rate of eight dollars. A nation cannot help flouriſhing, when under the auſpices of ſuch a <hi>diſintereſted</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator.</p>
               <p>The point in view, by the breach of the above ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rule, was, to remove Mr. John Beckley from his office as Clerk of Congreſs, an office which he has held ever ſince the operation of the new government. There was not a member in the houſe, who could, even in the ſmalleſt degree, impeach his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial conduct. This made it neceſſary to exclude him by a <hi>ſilent</hi> vote. The motion was carried by forty-one voices againſt forty. Mr. Beckley may now, like Sully, find leiſure to write an hiſtory of the abominations to which he has been a witneſs. His talents are equal to the taſk, and he cannot ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der America a more important ſervice.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid about the ſale of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, it is not inferred that every purchaſer of them, at an inferior price, acted diſhoneſtly. No
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031906_0126_0FEF44490DBF5D08"/>
certainty exiſted of their being funded by the new government, and much leſs of their being funded at the full nominal value. It was a lottery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no one could tell the proportion of prizes. The blame in ſpeculating reſted entirely with thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs who bought up the certificates at a cheap rate, with the view of thereafter voting for their being funded at the full price; or who gave ſuch a vote with an eye to ſubſequent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes. Among other defects of the new government, one was that the Houſe of Repreſentatives conſiſted only of ſixty-five members. This number was too ſmall, and twenty, joined together, by the ſacred bond of paper-jobbing, were next to certain of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying any point about which they were anxious.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt of January, 1790, this domeſtic debt amounted, in principal and intereſt, to forty milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, two hundred and fifty-ſix thouſand dollars<note n="*" place="bottom">Gallati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, p. 96.</note>. A majority of each houſe voted for funding the whole maſs at its nominal value. How many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions belonged to themſelves cannot be aſcertained until the arrival of that day, which is to diſcloſe all human ſecrets. Thus did the nation ſuffer a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen or perhaps thirty ſpeculators to ſit as judges upon their own job.</p>
               <p>A member of Congreſs might, on this occaſion, be very fitly compared to an attorney whom you ſend into court to make the beſt compoſition that he can with your juſt creditors. They had heard of your being partly inſolvent, and offer to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their claims for an eighth part of their nominal amount. It is the buſineſs of your agent to take advantage of this juncture; inſtead of which he clandeſtinely buys up all thoſe debts againſt you, at the reduced price, for which his funds afford
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031906_0127_0FEF444BF4497F80"/>
him ability. To ſhelter himſelf in a croud, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages other adventurers to buy up all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maing debts againſt you in the ſame way. He then comes forward, in name of himſelf and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, and compels you to give a mortgage for forty millions of dollars, when he could, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have rid you of the whole ſum for five milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You would not think that ſuch an attorney had diſcharged his truſt with fidelity. You never would employ him again. It is even poſſible that he might be turned out of his profeſſion. Within the laſt twenty years, Mr. Alexander M'Kenzie, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney at Edinburgh, was employed to ſell an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. At the time and place publicly appointed, no purchaſer appeared, and Mr. M'Kenzie bought it up in his own name. Several of his brethren, men above being ſuſpected of colluſion, attended the whole tranſaction, and gave evidence that they had no jealouſy of unfair dealing. The price it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though alledged to be ſomewhat low, was not much under the mark. Yet the Court of Seſſion declared that no factor could buy and ſell at the ſame time. They reverſed the bargain, and the houſe of peers confirmed their decree. But, if Mr. M'Kenzie had been directed to buy an eſtate at its market price of two thouſand five hundred pounds, and if he had firſt procured it for himſelf, and thereafter forced his client to pay twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds for it<note n="*" place="bottom">This proportion of one to eight is laid down by Mr. Gallatia as the medium difference between the market price, and the full amount at which the certificates were funded.</note>, his gown would have been torn from his ſhoulders. The firſt glance from the bench would have announced the annihilation of his ſcheme.</p>
               <p>Of the above forty millions of dollars, a ſmall part was funded at only three per cent. though with
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031906_0128_0FEF444FFB0AF998"/>
the proſpect of certain advantages, needleſs here to be explained, which were ſuppoſed to place it on a level in value with the remainder of the debt. Another part, though but a ſmall one, was funded in name of original creditors, the men with pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and rheumatiſms caught on board of the Old Jerſey, with wooden legs and weather-beaten faces, whoſe very looks are diſguſting to a <hi>friend of order.</hi> Theſe heroes promoted an American revolution, when we were fifty times leſs heavily taxed than any other ſubjects of the Britiſh crown. They began a rebellion when its expence, for a ſingle week, exceeded the value of all the taxes that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had either got or aſked for the preceding twenty years. HUNC <hi>tu Romane caveto.</hi> After ſuch doings, they are unfit to be truſted under any government.</p>
               <p>For the ſake of round numbers, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably under the fact, ſuppoſe that only twenty four millions of dollars, out of the above forty, had been funded in the name of purchaſers at half a crown per pound. The intereſt, at ſix per cent. comes to fourteen hundred and forty thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars per annum. If this ſum had remained in the pockets of thoſe who pay it, we ſhould have been ſaved from many of the burdenſome taxes which are ſo heavy on the inhabitants of the ſea-port towns; and more or leſs ſo upon every part of the country. Again, thoſe traders or manufacturers, who pay ſuch taxes, muſt always add more than the net addition, to indemnify themſelves for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which attends it, as well as for the advance of money<note n="*" place="bottom">This circumſtance has been fully explained, and proved in <hi>The Political Progreſs of Britain.</hi>
                  </note>. The enormous dearth of labour muſt partly be deduced from this cauſe, and it produces, in an hundred different ways, inconvenience and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031906_0129_0FEF445334A82DC8"/>
backwardneſs to all ſorts of buſineſs. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of collecting or borrowing the money forms alſo a ſerious item; and all theſe together, make a real loſs to the public, by theſe twenty-four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars, not merely of fourteen hundred and forty thouſand dollars, but of at leaſt three millions. This equals the whole principal ſum that the buyers of the twenty-four millions advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Thus nominally we pay about fifty per cent. but in reality, at the loweſt, an hundred per cent. of intereſt for the ſum truly given before hand.</p>
               <p>The common body of creditors muſt have been very glad to ſee ſix millions of dollars. This would have doubled their principal and made a very ſnug adventure. Judging by the ſtatute of limitations, and other deſperate leaps of congreſſional economy, we may be perfectly ſure that other creditors would not have got one ſixpenee more than they really ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, if it had not been to ſerve as a ſcreen for the full gratification of Camillus and his myrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons. They have ever ſince been conſtantly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing the public about conſpiracies. <hi>The greateſt rogue always turns king's witneſs,</hi> ſays the proverb. Nothing, ſince the new conſtitution, has, within an hundred degrees, as much the appearance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy as this certificate buſineſs, unleſs, perhaps, the uproar which forced Congreſs to ratify the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh treaty.</p>
               <p>This was the dawning ſcene of that government whoſe wiſdom and virtue have reſounded through the four quarters of the globe. The annals of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern finance record not a more deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranſaction. In the black luxuriance of Roman rapine, a more pregnant field never exerciſed the ferocious contempt of Claudian, or the majeſtic ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Juvenal.

               <p>MR. BACHE has compiled two volumes of ſpeeches on Jay's treaty, which were made in the Houſe of Repreſentatives of Congreſs, in ſpring, 1796. It would have been a ſervice of ſtill more conſequence to this country, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed a collection of the various narratives of Britiſh piracy on American veſſels in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. This monument of bucanneering might have ſerved as an uſeful curb to national vanity, and have taught us, if not quite incurable on that ſide,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031906_0131_0FEF3225E0544A78"/>
to apprehend the meanneſs of our preſent maritime condition. The devaſtation has been going on, with different degrees of violence, ſince the ſummer of 1793. A complete account of theſe piracies would very far exceed our preſent limits. A few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are here ſelected from the maſs; and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the early part of the year 1796; ſeveral miſcellaneous anecdotes and obſervations being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally interſperſed.</p>
               <p>A Salem newſpaper, of March 8th, mentions the arrival of the ſchooner John, captain Philip Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, from Jamaica. While he lay there, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh officer and five men, from a ſloop of war, came on board to impreſs his crew. Only one of them happened to be on board, beſides the mate and a boy. The reſt were on ſhore on buſineſs. The gang t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p of war, to reclaim his ſeaman. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander told him to go back to his own veſſel, make out his account of the wages due to the hand, and ſend them and his clothes to the ſloop. In caſe of non-compliance, he was threatened with a ſlogging. Whether he obeyed this order, we are not told. The reſt of the crew were ſecreted on ſhore by the captain, for ten days, till the ſloop of war ſailed, as her declared deſign was to impreſs the whole. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, the ſchooner lay expoſed to the weather, as well as the inſults of the ſloop of war, without any perſon to take care of her, except the captain, his mate, and the boy. The ſloop's crew conſiſted of eighty-ſeven men. Of theſe, <hi>thirty-five</hi> were ſaid to be Americans, who had been impreſſed in the Weſt-Indies. Such, at the diſtance of twenty months, was the ſucceſs of Jay's appeal to the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:031906_0132_0FEF445832575440"/>
of George Guelph, and of his kiſſing the hand of <q>the meat, drink, ſnuff, and diamond-loving dame.</q> Captain Saunders further inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſeveral veſſels belonging to the ſouthern ſtates, were lying at Jamaica, when he left it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeamen to navigate them home. The crews had been impreſſed.</p>
               <p>The ſame poſt brought an article from the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, which is in admirable uniſon with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding narrative. An entertainment had been given, a few months before, at Amſterdam, where, <q>the portrait of our beloved Waſhington, was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the chief decoration of the room.</q> Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then gives a long rhapſody, pronounced by ſome Dutchman, on the Preſident, <q>As a Cato in council; a Caeſar in the field; a Hercules in the political tempeſt; the ſcourge and admiration of proud Albion; Columbia's bulwark,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. Mynheer ſhould rather have ſaid the joſſing-block of proud Albion, from which ſhe vaulted into the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of ſea-robbery; for now, ſince the mountain of compenſation hath been happily brought to bed of its mouſe, all parties muſt, in their hearts, agree, that, from the day when Jefferſon left his office<note n="*" place="bottom">The 1ſt of January, 1794.</note>, our Britiſh concerns could not have been more wretchedly managed than they actually have been. If Hercules had permitted Cacus to keep his ſtolen oxen, the inſertion of his name would have been more intelligible. As for Caeſar and Cato—but it is needleſs to tread upon imbecility.</p>
               <p>Early, as it ſeems, in the year 1796, captain Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Green made a voyage from Norfolk, in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, to Martinico. He had the command of a faſt-ſailing ſchooner, of three bundred barrels burden, and carried a cargo for the Britiſh at that iſland.
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031906_0133_0FEF445C9B60B678"/>
On his arrival, the conſignee ſhewed him a bill of ſale of the veſſel, and told him, that he was no longer maſter, becauſe the ſchooner was bought for the <hi>Britiſh government,</hi> and to be fitted out as a privateer. If captain Green choſe to remain on board, he was told that he might have employment. This offer he refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. Several of the ſailors were <hi>impreſſed by the Britiſh.</hi> Others were enticed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as volunteers in the different ſhips. This was the treament which other American crews, in the ſame trade, met with as well as his. Theſe priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, when thus fitted out, were to intercept our ſhipping in their way to the Weſt-Indies. Thus the United States furniſhed privateers and ſeamen for the deſtruction of their own commerce. This is one proof, among many, of the indifference of ſome American owners to the perſonal ſafety of their ſailors. Captain Green arrived from Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico at Baltimore, about the 14th of March, 1796. He related the above particulars to Colonel Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that town, who gave them for publication to the author. Put the caſe, that a merchant of Liverpool were to freight a veſſel for Calais or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg, with the previous but concealed certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before him, that the ſhip was to be ſold; the captain turned adrift without warning, and the crew to be ſeduced or preſſed into the Ruſſian or the French ſervice. The atteſted recital of ſuch a fact would make the owner completely odious to the public. But, in this country, a ſeries of ſuch tranſactions does not excite the ſmalleſt emotion, or even attention. About twenty-five years ago, an Engliſh ſailor at Dantzie, was entrapped by a recruiting party, belonging to the late king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. The man got a letter conveyed to England, and though Frederic poſſeſſed, in all its vigour, the faculty of retention, yet he found it neceſſary
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031906_0134_0FEF445FCF57DF28"/>
to give Jack his freedom. The ſtory was printed in the Engliſh newſpapers, and became, for a ſhort time, a topic of converſation. Compare this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to national rights, with the ſelfiſh American apathy, and ſay which of the two countries has the greateſt appearance of being <hi>enlightened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A newſpaper of this city, of the 15th of March, 1796, contained a narrative ſubſcribed by Jacob Peterſon, maſter of the ſloop Polly, of Philadelphia. He ſays that, on the 29th of January, 1796, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at cape Nicola Mole, where he had ſcarcely caſt anchor, when the Syren, a Britiſh ſixty-four, preſſed one of his beſt ſeamen. On the 31ſt, he ſailed for Jeremie. While he remained in that port, about nine o'clock in the evening, of the 9th of February, captain Reynolds, of the Harriot, a Britiſh armed ſhip in government ſervice, manned his boat and preſſed ſeveral American ſeamen from different ſhips in the harbour. He began with the ſhip Carolina, of Baltimore, captain Luſher.</p>
               <p>Next day, Reynolds, when on ſhore, ſwore that he would that night make a ſweep among the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans. The latter, hearing of this threat, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves into two veſſels that lay in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, one of them the brig Richard and James of Philadelphia, and the other the ſchooner Eliza of Baltimore. About nine o'clock in the evening, a boat full of armed men was obſerved coming from the Harriot towards the Eliza. She was hailed and enjoined to keep her diſtance. Reynolds cauſed his men to fire. This was returned; and, after ſometime, the boat went off. She came back with a freſh ſupply of men, and again found it prudent to retire. The people in the Eliza then went on board of the Richard and James. Reynolds went on ſhore, obtained a reinforcemt, and came back to a third aſſault. Finding the Eliza deſerted he
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:031906_0135_0FEF4461F792F590"/>
gave up the attempt. In this conteſt, the Britiſh ſaid that they had ſeventeen men killed or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Americans had one killed, and one wounded.</p>
               <p>The above account, as to what happened at port Jeremie, was almoſt immediately confirmed by the arrival of captain Webb, of the brig Nymph. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Webb added, that the Americans had preſented a petition to the commandant at Jeremie, admiral Murray, for the recovery of their impreſſed men, and ſatisfaction for the behaviour of Reynolds. Murray anſwered, that he had given no orders for the impreſs, and that he would uſe <hi>his influence</hi> to get the men reſtored; but, when captain Webb left Jeremie, there was no appearance of that taking place. The anſwer of Murray was mere mockery. Reynolds durſt not have fired a piſtol againſt the real inclination of the admiral. A Britiſh officer, in the river Thames, durſt no more impreſs a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without orders, than he durſt ſet fire to the city. For the bare loſs of ſo many men, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of other circumſtances, he would have been called to a moſt ſevere account, even at Jeremie, unleſs he had acted by expreſs orders, or conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>On this affair, Webſter has a curious para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph<note n="*" place="bottom">Minerva, March 17, 1796.</note>. In ſpite of his Britiſh penſion, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſave appearances, by ſaying ſomething about it. Accordingly he obſerves, that, <q>hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this villainous buſineſs has been juſtified under the pretence, that the men were Britiſh ſubjects, and indeed <hi>this has often been the fact;</hi> but theſe lawleſs fellows <hi>now</hi> openly, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly take Americans.</q> The <hi>heretofore</hi> inſinuates an untruth; becauſe, from the beginning, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

of Americans were taken without any ſuch pretence. <q>As the admiral, ſays Webſter, did not juſtify him (Reynolds) it is poſſible the inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Americans may obtain redreſs, and we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume [and what is your reaſon for that <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>], all impreſſments are made <hi>without orders</hi> from the Britiſh government.</q> [The beſt and only <hi>redreſs</hi> will be, when the French ſhall burn Plymouth and Dover.]—<q>Their conduct is now, if poſſible, aggravated, as it is a direct violation of the <hi>treaty;</hi>

Simcoe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, acted alſo <hi>without orders,</hi> when he ſent a body of Britiſh regulars and Detroit militia, to aſſiſt the Indians in aſſaulting fort Recovery. The rank and file, with their faces blacked, and the three Britiſh officers dreſſed in ſcarlet, who kept at a diſtance, in the rear, and directed the motions of the Putawatimes, were certainly acting likewiſe <hi>without orders.</hi> Nay farther, Henry Knox, late Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary at War, did infallibly act <hi>without orders,</hi> when he refuſed to give the newſprinters a copy of the long and important letter from Wayne, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving evidence of theſe facts<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>This is not a hearſay. Not more than a ſixth part of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be obtained. The late Mr. Andrew Brown, was in the War-Office, trying to get a full tranſcript for the Philadelphia Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, and both he and others met with a refuſal. They received, beſides a liſt of the killed and wounded, only ſome ſcraps which make up a paragraph of about thirty lines. Nothing was ſuffered to tranſpire in the public prints that could place the behaviour of Simcoe in a proper light.</p>
                     <p>But, on the 21ſt of November, 1794, it was thought proper to read this diſpatch to Congreſs, with ſome depoſitions that had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been kept ſecret. The latter ſhewed, in the ſtrongeſt light, the extreme averſion of the Indians to fight Wayne, and the artifices of the Britiſh to make them do ſo. A perſon who overheard the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers read obtained, a conſiderable time after, permiſſion to copy them from the repoſitories of Congreſs. So late as May, 1796, they were ſucceſſively printed in the Maryland Journal, the Aurora, and the Argus. Mr. M'Henry, now Secretary at War, being greatly ſurpriſed at their appearance, wrote a letter to one of theſe printers, entreating to know which of his clerks in the war-office had betrayed official confidence; and aſſuring the printer, that if he would give up the name of this correſpondent, <hi>the mode of diſcovery ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</hi> Such is the minute vigilance of the American cabinet! and ſo culpable it is to let the people become acquainted with their own buſineſs! In reply, the Secretary was aſſured of the entire inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of all his clerks, and adviſed to proceed with his inquiries.</p>

He depoſed that, when he was at cape Nichola Mole, he was on board a ſchooner from Virginia, where he ſaw two of the crew, native Americans, impreſſed by the officers of the Britiſh ſhip Severn. One of the men was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards returned as unfit for duty. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Severn ſaid, that he was authorized, by the late treaty, to take all ſeamen who had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections from the United States. In ſaying this, he paid a compliment to Jay's treaty which it does not merit. All ſeamen, whether with protections or without them, are alike unnoticed by that paper. On preſenting this proteſt, an inſignificant debate enſued in the houſe. The queſtion was, whether it ſhould be referred to the ſelect committee on American ſeamen, or to the Secretary at War, that the Preſident might make ſuitable repreſentations to the Britiſh government. It was remitted to the committee. Congreſs might as well have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated, whether the proteſt ſhould be caſt under the table, or into the fire.</p>

The captain ſaid that, while he lay there, the Hermione frigate preſſed, from time to time, a vaſt number of American ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of different veſſels.

Four days before capt.

                     <p>On Monday, February 8th, at two P. M. was boarded by the Mermaid's boat, a Britiſh frigate, who impreſſed one of the men (he not being a Britiſh ſubject), and overhauled us very ſtrictly on ſuſpicion of my having ſailors ſtowed away. That ſame night I went on board to ſolicit for my man. After communicating to the captain my errand, he told me he was certain I had men ſtowed away, and he would ſend
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031906_0139_0FEF93F2EFEE0500"/>
his boat on board, and overhaul us from keel to gunnel; and, after giving me much abuſive language, ſaid, <hi>he would flog me, and all I had on board.</hi> Accordingly, the Mermaid's boat came on board with a great many hands, hove the long boat out of the chocks, hoiſted up twenty-two barrels of beef, moved part of the ballaſt, and, as the ſaying is, turned every thing upſide down. They went on board, firſt being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I had no people ſtowed away. I ſhortly after went on board the Mermaid to ſee if they would ſend the boat and crew on board to ſtow the cargo in its proper place, as I had no people to do it, and put the boat in the chocks, &amp;c. and after diſtreſſing me all they could, with reſpect to my people, I was told they had done with me, and bid me go about my buſineſs, and get people where I could.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after I had got on board my veſſel, the Charlotte, captain Williams, a Britiſh ſloop of ten guns, ſent her boat on board, who overhauled us, &amp;c. On the 9th, at meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, with much difficulty weighed anchor, and made ſail, as I could get no redreſs, and no probability of getting hands.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after was brought too by a ſhot from the above ſloop, and after we hove the ſails to the maſts, and brought too, ſhe fired no leſs than half a dozen muſket ſhot, aimed right at us; but providentially we received no hurt from them, though I heard the whiſtle of ſeveral of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After we had laid ſome time, they ſent the boat on board, who rummaged and overhauled; but ſeeing they could find nothing, they returned on board.</p>
                     <p>On Thurſday, the 11th, at nine A. M. ſaw a ſloop to the leeward, which ſhortly knew to be the ſame ſloop, that had boarded us two days before, in St. George's bay.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe came within a league of us ſhe fired, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to do ſo, as long as the guns would bear, ſhe reaching one way and we the other. When ſhe got into our wake ſhe tacked but did not come up with us until two P. M. when we tacked, and ſhe fetched us and brought us too with another ſhot. I received a great deal of abuſive language from the captain without giving any reaſons.</p>
                     <p>He curſed and damned the Americans and ſaid they were their greateſt enemies. He ſaid he had fired twelve ſhot at us, that I ſhould pay two dollars for the firſt, and double for every one after: however, I not being willing to comply with this unreaſonable requeſt, and ſeeing he had no buſineſs to have fired at us, as he had boarded us the day before, and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031906_0140_0FEF446D0E63E620"/>
as he did not think fit to ſend his boat on board, he ſuffered us to ſet ſail.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of March, 1796, the ſhip Bacchus, captain George, arrived at Philadelphia. On the 20th he was boarded by the Thetis, a Britiſh fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. She preſſed his mate and cabin boy, on a ſuſpicion of their being Britiſh ſubjects. The boy was an indented apprentice.</p>
               <p>As it is proper to do juſtice to all parties, it may here be noticed that, at this time, captain Burnet, of the brig George, arrived in Philadelphia from Kingſton, and brought a complaint of the French privateers. He ſaid that ſeveral of them were cruiſing off Jamaica, when he left it. They were very troubleſome to American veſſels, ſometimes plundering them of their ſea ſtores, and otherwiſe behaving with the greateſt inſolence. No farther particulars are ſpecified; and this is the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt France, or at moſt the ſecond, which hath as yet occurred in collecting materials for the preſent ſummary of piracies. At the ſame time, ſeveral articles of Britiſh rapine have been omitted for want of room. So contraſted at that period, was the conduct of theſe two nations to this country!</p>
               <p>A gentleman at Kingſton in Jamaica, in a letter to the printers of the Maryland Journal, dated the 25th of February, 1796, gave the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. The Argonaut man of war of ſixty-four guns, had, a few days before, ſent into Kingſton, two American veſſels. The one was the ſchooner Swallow, captain Stubbs, from Cape Francois to Boſton. Her cargo conſiſted of cotton and coffee, with ſix thouſand dollars in ſpecie. The whole
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031906_0141_0FEF43A18BCB3DC8"/>
property belonged to Mr. Triſdale of Boſton. The other veſſel was the ſchooner Paragon of Norfolk, laden with coffee, and owned by Mr. Moſes Myers of that town. In June, 1794, coffee coſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, at Philadelphia, about a ſhilling per pound. In June, 1795, it had got up to one ſhilling and four pence. By November, 1796, if not ſooner, it roſe to two ſhillings and four pence. The pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies juſt now ſtated, which are only part of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the ſame kind, explain, very fully, the cauſe of this alteration. The writer of the above letter added that both veſſels were libelled, and that indeed <hi>none need expect to eſcape that fate,</hi> whatever might be the final verdict about them. The very delay, diſappointment, and riſe of inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in conſequence of ſuch alarms, impoſe a ruinous tax on the owners, while, in the mean time, the ſailors were frequently preſſed. Sometimes they were ſwept off by the yellow fever; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes of a periſhable nature were often deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while the ſhip waited for a deciſion.</p>
               <p>The ſame letter adds that the ſchooner Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Jonathan Hall, maſter, of Baltimore, had been ſent into Kingſton, by the Severn of forty-four guns. She had on board a valuable cargo of cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee and cotton, and part of an outward bound freight of proviſions, with a large ſum of money. The ſupercargo, Mr. Duncan, was going from Gonaives to the Platform, to purchaſe coffee to load the ſloop for Baltimore The pretence for ſending in the Voluptas was, that ſhe carried pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for an enemy's port. At this time, the captain of the Severn had kept Mr. Duncan a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner for fifty-two days, and threatened to try him, as a Britiſh ſubject, for high treaſon; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had with him a certificate of his being an American citizen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:031906_0142_0FEF446EECD19E18"/>Captain Hall, and Mr. Duncan had been ſent priſoners from cape Nichola Mole to Port Royal, on board of the Lark man of war. On their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they were put upon two-thirds of the Britiſh ſeamen's allowance of ſalt beef and bread. One of them, the letter does not ſay which, happening to ſleep in the next birth to the lieutenant, had his watch and money ſtolen out of his pocket. It was their opinion that the Severn had deſigned to ſend the ſchooner to the bottom, for ſhe run ſo near as to carry away their bowſprit.</p>
               <p>A few days before the writing of this letter, the ſhip Lydia, Robert Blount, maſter, from Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth in New-Hampſhire, had arrived at Kingſton. About four leagues to windward of Port-Royal, he had been boarded by the Regulus. She took away his mate, and four men. They were all natives of Portſmouth, married, and had regular protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Before taking them on board, the Britiſh captain ſent his ſurgeon into the Lydia, to examine the men, and ſee if they were in good health. The Regulus had preſſed above fifty ſeamen, went to Port-au-Prince, and from thence to England; ſo that when the Portſmouth ſailors were to ſee their families, or whether they were ever to ſee them at all, was extremely doubtful.</p>
               <p>The ſame correſpondent gives an account of the conduct of a French privateer to an American brig which, on the 14th of February, had come into Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. This privateer had taken the Britiſh ſhip Barzil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai, captain Blackburn, which left Kingſton on the 3d of February, and was taken on the 7th, in ſight of Port Royal<note n="*" place="bottom">

his whole private property, on board of the brig. In his trunk were two bags of money; the plate of the ſhip's cabin; and two bills of exchange to the amount in whole of eight hundred pounds. The Frenchman ſaid that he diſdained to take any thing from a priſoner, and wiſhed him a good voyage to Kingſton. From the brig this jacobin took a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of beef, and paid fifteen dollars for it. Thus far the letter to the printers of the Maryland jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>A Philadelphia print of the 26th of March, 1796, contained an extract of a letter dated March 2d, from Bermuda. The writer mentions that the ſhip Hannah, captain Hoare, from Philadelphia to France, was, on the 24th of February, taken by the Lynx ſloop of war. She ſtript the Hannah of her whole crew, excepting the mate, the cook, and the cabin boy, and ſent her into Bermuda. Moſt of the hands impreſſed had protections. The captain of the Lynx had ſpoke, on the day before, with the Roebuck of Philadelphia, and ſaid that he was prevented from taking her by a violent gale of wind.</p>
               <p>An article dated Salem, the 22d of March, gives what is called <hi>verbal information by captain Blacker.</hi> Part of it is in ſubſtance as follows:</p>
               <p>On the night of the 22d of January, 1796, the preſs gang at Liverpool crimped an American ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, having previouſly ſerved ſeveral others in the ſame way. Two hundred and fifty American ſailors aſſembled, went to the houſe of rendezvous of the gang, and reſcued their companion. They placed the officers of the impreſs in the centre of the room, obliged them to uncover, and give three cheers to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031906_0144_0FEF44715D784020"/>
the United States. On the 27th, another American was impreſſed. His countrymen again aſſembled, reſcued the man, killed one of the gang, threw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the dock, where he was drowned and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely beat the remainder, who fled.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of February, the American captains were called before the mayor and magiſtrates of Liverpool. They were admoniſhed to keep their crews in order. They made an anſwer which muſt have occurred to any body excepting a member of Congreſs vindicating appropriations for the Britiſh treaty. The account adds that, from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Americans were unmoleſted.</p>
               <p>About the 29th of March, 1796, the ſhip Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, captain Atkins, arrived at Norfolk. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaid that, within the capes of Cheſapeake, he was boarded by a boat from the Thetis, captain Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, which preſſed a man who had been naturalized for ten years paſt. As the Cheſapeake is within the territory of the United States, the Britiſh might as decently have taken him from the ſtreets of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia. A letter from New-York to a merchant in Philadelphia, dated the 2d of April, informed that his ſhip, the Ocean, captain Vredenburgh, had been taken on the 31ſt ult. and ſent into Halifax by La Prevoyance, a Britiſh frigate. The whole crew, at the time of writing the letter, were detained on board of the frigate, except the maſter, the firſt mate and a boy. The Ocean was from Havre-de-Grace, and the frigate took her, not far from the Highlands, with a pilot on board. The Argus, of April 4th, ſays, that before ſhe was diſmiſſed for Halifax, <q>ſeveral paſſengers were moſt graciouſly permitted to jump into the long boat, and come up to New-York.</q> When captain Vredenburgh remonſtrated, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh captain told him that this conduct was juſtified by Jay's treaty. The Minerva ſays that the Ocean
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031906_0145_0FEF4475F53BFDA0"/>
was taken three days before ſhe made land. But the Connecticut goddeſs of wiſdom is diſtinguiſhed for want of veracity<note n="*" place="bottom">Webſter is a native of that ſtate.</note>. It is at leaſt very uncommon to take in a pilot, at ſuch a diſtance from ſhore; and it is agreed that the Ocean had one. While the Britiſh were thus plundering American ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Mr. Pickering received a letter from Mr. Samuel Bayard, dated London, 29th of December, 1795. The following extract appeared, on the 31ſt of March, 1796, in the Philadelphia Gazette.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In the courſe of this next month, the Judge of the Admiralty has authorized us to expect an order for the reſtitution of the veſſels and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes ſeized and ſold by ſir J. Jarvis and ſir Charles Grey, at Martinico, St. Lucia and Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daloupe.</p>
                  <p>In the Court of Appeals, alſo, two illegal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Vice-Admiralty Courts, in the Weſt-Indies, have lately been annulled, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the judges ſeverely cenſured by the Lords commiſſioners of appeals.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This intelligence, as if worth a peruſal, was communicated by Mr. Pickering to the Committee of Merchants in this city, appointed to ſuperintend the buſineſs of indemnification. Nothing but the blindneſs of intereſted hope, could have drawn any comfort from ſuch an account. The attainment of an object is at a very indefinite diſtance, when the parties are only <hi>authorized to expect.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling of two piracies, out of five or ſix hundred, was merely caſting a tub to the whale. As for the cenſure beſtowed on the Weſt-Indian judges, how much it was in earneſt, and how much it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, appears from their perſiſting, at that very moment, to proceed in the ſame track. There
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031906_0146_0FEF447A81EF9EE8"/>
could not be a more palpable deluſion, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the thinneſs of the diſguiſe almoſt precludes it from that name. The Britiſh had been plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing American merchantmen for almoſt three years. A treaty, which was to ſtop every proceeding of the kind, had been ratified eight months before. Yet ſtill piracy and impreſsment went on at full vigour. But when we conſider the uncommonly petrified ideas of many merchants in the ſea-ports of America, nothing but the moſt ſnivelling timidity could be looked for. In ſummer, 1793, Britiſh effrontery declared the French republic in <hi>a ſtate of ſiege;</hi> and, under that pretence, confiſcated Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican veſſels freighted for any French port with proviſions, as if France and her colonies had only been ſome fortified town with an area of a ſquare mile. At that criſis, merchants of eminence in this city were to be found who vindicated that enormous robbery. If, in a ſimilar ſituation, any citizen of London had harboured ſuch feelings, the certainty of public abhorrence would at leaſt have forced him to hold his tongue. When captain Barney, about that time, made a voyage to the Weſt-Indies, and declared his determination, if attacked, of giving battle to the ſucceſſors of Blackbeard, the tory par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Philadelphia were violent in his condemnation. A report having reached the continent, that the Engliſh at Jamaica had reſolved to hang him, it was ſolemnly pronounced, in this city, to be perfectly right; and that he was an incendiary who wanted to embroil the two countries. It was to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſuch people would abominate the American Annual Regiſter as <hi>the verieſt catch-penny that ever was publiſhed, the mere tittle tattle of jacobiniſm</hi>

This blank in Jay's treaty, and Bayard's commiſſion, may be compared to the capitulation of a general, who, without a ſingle ſtipulation about protecting the ſick and wounded men of his army, thinks of nothing but the ſecurity and free depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his baggage.</p>
               <p>Captain Paulding, of the brig Polly, in a letter to his owners, at New-York from Curracoa, dated March 3d, ſays that he had been ſent into Grenada, by the Favourite ſloop of war, after ſhe had taken from him <hi>all his hands,</hi> with ſailing orders, letters, invoices, and bills of lading. He was detained for ſome weeks. At length he had orders to depart, but could not recover his papers. His cargo was, he ſays, conſiderably damaged by his detention. He does not tell whether he got back any of his men, which is very unlikely, or by what means he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the veſſel to Curracoa.</p>
               <p>The Maryland Journal, of the 13th of April, 1797, has an extract of a letter from an American ſeaman, dated Spithead, December <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This veſſel, with four other Americans, had been carried into St. John's, Newfoundland. He expreſſed a hope that the Hannah would be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated. The printers added, that the ſticklers for Britiſh amity might, upon calling at their office, ſee the original letter. This intimation was needful in the caſe where ſuch an article had not
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031906_0148_0FEF448068951190"/>
been copied from ſome other print; for in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and perhaps in every ſea-port town in the union, a number of people are conſtantly ready to browbeat and even ruin any printer who publiſhes articles unfavourable to Britain. Thus, at the death of Dr. Franklin, a newſpaper of this city obſerved, that the flags of the ſhips in the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware were lowered. The printer unthinkingly ſubjoined that <hi>even the Britiſh,</hi>

Next day, ſeveral of his ſubſcribers came into his office, and, with many reproaches threw up his paper. The author had the ſtory from himſelf. Indeed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate of ſociety can be expected in our ſea-ports, where the whole maſs of Britiſh tories, who had been doing the utmoſt miſchief in their power to this country during the revolution, were permitted, almoſt univerſally, without diſtinction, to return and mix upon a level with the republican citizens. In private morals, they were juſt as good as other people. But, in a political light, they were at beſt concealed, and often profeſſed enemies. In pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, no man would lodge under his roof an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary who, for eight years, had been attempting to burn his houſe. At the laſt election for Congreſs, in the county of Philadelphia, one of the moſt offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the <hi>federal</hi> managers had formerly acted as a Britiſh guide. He was, for this offence, tried by the ſtate, and very nearly hanged. A ſhoal of ſimilar examples might be traced.</p>
               <p>The next article in the ſame Maryland Journal, ſhews in what ſubjugation the tories hold the preſs.

Captain Herring, from Jamacia, had informed the printers that, when the Britiſh captured and ſent into that iſland American veſſels, the ſailors were either turned aſhore to ſtarve; or preſſed into the Britiſh ſervice. He added that all of them received <q>the moſt indignant treatment from theſe <hi>tyrannical ſea monſters.</hi>
                  </q> For inſerting ſuch harſh language, the printers made a long and humble apology. This timidity betrays a feature of degradation unknown in France or England. Was it ever heard of that a Britiſh mariner, on returning home from a French jail, durſt not publiſh his complaints in a Britiſh newſpaper; or that the editor would be forced to apologize for giving him a corner<note n="*" place="bottom">Juſt below, in the ſame column, there follows a ſtring of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions from Cumberland county, in the ſtate of Maryland, in favour of Jay's treaty. They ſay that <q>the eſteem of his fellow-citizens is <hi>the only reward,</hi> which he (the Preſident) is willing to receive for his <hi>unexampled</hi> ſervices.</q> It ſignifies nothing to chime over this impertinent fable of the Preſident ſerving his country for <hi>nothing.</hi> Yet though he has aſked and received the laſt cent of his two hundred thouſand dollars, beſides thirteen thouſand ſix hundred, to aſſiſt him in ſetting up a houſe, the friends of <hi>order</hi> will never ceaſe to prate that he would accept of no ſalary.</note>?</p>
               <p>Captain Herring, abovementioned, furniſhed the printer of the Journal with the following liſt of veſſels left at Kingſton, on the 8th of March laſt, which were all prizes to the Argonaut, Schooners Voluptas, Hall, Baltimore; Active, Compton, do.; Adelaine, Stanley, do.; Fortitude, Roſs, do.; Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Stubbs, Boſton; Paragon, —, Norfolk; and a number of other veſſels, belonging to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ports in the United States; in all FIFTY-FIVE.</p>
               <p>The infatuation and ſtupidity of a certain ſet of people in this country ſurpaſſes all deſcription.

are the ſhield which ſaves us from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable fury of Britain.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, though they cannot deny the ſcandalous conduct of our bleſſed mother country, they do no not wiſh, if they can help it, to hear a ſingle word upon the ſubject.

                           <p>Captain Elkanah Mayo, who arrived in town this week from New-York, has favoured us with the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the cruel treatment he and his men received from the officers and men of the Britiſh frigate La Pique, at Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, in December laſt, viz. Captain Mayo, in the ſhip Polly, of Cape Ann, homeward bound, from a whaling voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, was drove in by ſtreſs of weather to Barbadoes, where he lay near three weeks for the arrival of ſome Americans to freight his oil home; during which time, the Britiſh fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate La Pique arrived there from a cruiſe, and in two days after, preſſed two of his hands. Captain Mayo applied to the governor for protection, who cauſed the men to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed; three days after, captain Mayo's boat, being aſhore with three men waiting for him, the frigate's barge hauled in cloſe to his boat, and boarded him with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>utlaſſes, to preſs the men by force. The men called on captain Mayo, from the ſhore, who run to the boat for their relief, where he found the crew of the Britiſh frigate with the tiller of their barge, beating his men over their heads, with ſaid tiller, till the blood guſhed from their mouths and noſes, and otherwiſe mangling them in a barbarous and ſhocking manner. Captain Mayo ſprung into the boat and cleared it of the Britiſh crew. The commanding officer, who was then on the wharf, ſaid he would have every man aboard the ſhip. Mr. Woodruff, with whom captain Mayo did buſineſs, being on the wharf, offered his bonds to the captain of the frigate that he would bring his protections on ſhore. Captain Mayo then went on board his ſhip to bring his protections. While he was on board, the commanding officer of the frigate, and all the reſt of the officers, got into their barge, waiting for captain Mayo, who was returning with all his protections; they boarded him; the commanding officer jumped into captain Mayo's boat with his drawn cutlaſs, and dragged by force all
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031906_0152_0FEF44898793A2E0"/>
his men into their barge, and then preſented his cutlaſs to capt. Mayo's breaſt, and ordered him into the barge, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; after which he pricked him ſeveral times in the breaſt, and then towed him on board the frigate; he put capt. Mayo's men into the hole among his men who were ſick with the yellow fever; he then ordered a pair of irons to be fixed on captain Mayo, which were not, however, fixed; he kept him on the quarter-deck until evening, then ordered captain Mayo's boat to be hauled up, and ordered him on board alone. Capt. Mayo requeſted him to let him have a man to go with him, which the captain of the frigate refuſed; then ſaid he would caſt him off, and let him go adrift, he told him he might periſh at ſea, to which he replied, he hoped he would. Captain Mayo told him he would not go, unleſs he caſt him off, he then took his barge, and towed captain Mayo on board his own ſhip; the next morning captain Mayo went to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and complained of the officers' conduct; the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ordered his men to be immediately releaſed, who were accordingly ſent on ſhore. Four days after, three of his men were taken with the yellow fever, which they took while on board the frigate, and which ſpread through captain Mayo's ſhip's company: four of his men died of the fever, the reſt were obliged to leave the ſhip, and he hired negroes to pump her. Captain Mayo then chartered veſſels as he could find them to take his men and cargo to the United States. This baſe conduct of our new-treaty-allies occaſioned the loſs of eight thouſand dollars to his owners.</p>

               <p>While the Britiſh were going on at this rate, a letter, dated January 17th, was received in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, from Samuel Bayard, agent for the United States, at London, on the buſineſs of reſtitution. Mr. Bayard writes thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As ſoon as miniſtry learn the line of conduct, which the Houſe of Repreſentatives mean to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, I am perſuaded their conduct, as it regards us, will be leſs fluctuating. Should the houſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with the Preſident and Senate, every thing here will go well: ſhould obſtacles, on the other
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031906_0153_0FEF448D6B2E4E58"/>
hand, be thrown in the way by the popular branch of the government, I doubt whether the weſtern poſts will be ſurrendered, or <hi>reſtitution made of our captured property.</hi> However, I truſt that every man who has any regard to the <hi>honour,</hi> the <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi> of his country, will ſee the neceſſity of carrying the treaty fully into effect, ſo far as regards the United States.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſcope of the letter is, that, if Congreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for Mr. Jay's treaty, compenſation would be made for the piracies in the Weſt-Indies. If they did not, the prizes would be kept. This plainly infers, that the Britiſh were acting as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate bucanneers. For, whether the treaty paſt or not, they had no title to have taken theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. But the ſuperior talents of Mr. Jay had happily interwoven two matters totally diſtinct. If you ſign this treaty of commerce, you ſhall get compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the veſſels. If not, we ſhall have them to ourſelves. Before entering upon the old ſtory of debts due to Britain; of the weſtern poſts, and of matters relative to the laſt war; before plunging into treaties of amity, the recent ſeizure of the veſſels ſhould have been fully and ſeparately ſettled. If that could be done, it was time enough to get into a treaty. If it could not be done, the way for America was to have ſtood by in wait for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, while an embargo on proviſions would have laid the Britiſh Weſt-Indies proſtrate at her feet. Inſtead of this obvious policy, matters the moſt diſtinct were all jumbled together; and the bait of compenſation made America ſnap at the gilded hook.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In juſtice to Mr. Jay, it muſt be believed that his conduct was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſome reaſons not yet communicated to the public. The application of the following anecdote cannot be miſtaken. It ſhews the frequent appeals that Pitt makes to Macedonian logic.</p>
                     <p>On the 9th of February, 1794, colonel Whitlock wrote a letter to general Lavaux, who commanded at Port-au-Paix, in St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo. He required Lavaux to deliver up the town, the forts, and ſhipping. He then, in the name of the Britiſh government, adds thus: <q>The ſum of FIVE THOUSAND CROWNS TOURNOIS ſhall be paid to you in perſon, or depoſited in the bank of England, payable to your order.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his anſwer, Lavaux ſays, <q>permit me now to complain to yourſelf, of the indignity you have offered me, in thinking me ſo vile, ſo flagitious, ſo baſe, as not to reſent,</q> &amp;c. He concludes with ſending Whitlock a challenge immediately to meet and fight him. See New Annual Regiſter for 1794, Hiſtory, p. 338.</p>
                     <p>But if Port-au-Paix was worth five thouſand crowns to England, Jay's treaty was worth fifty millions. The Repreſentatives were in the direct way to the deſtruction of the Britiſh Weſt-Indies. A ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of commercial intercourſe, and an embargo, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced both England and thoſe colonies to the utmoſt difficulty. Theſe two meaſures would have broke no treaty, nor afforded any pretence for a quarrel, and they would have humbled England too much to leave her any appetite for the wanton declaration of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. All this was ſo evident, the track purſued by the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives was marked with ſuch luminous circumſtances of invitation, that nothing but ignorance, corruption, or the moſt abject imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of underſtanding, could miſtake it.</p>
                     <p>Like Sennacherib's angel, Camillus interfered to ſuggeſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs libel on Congreſs, to tarniſh the character, to undermine the intereſt, and to hamſtring the vengeance of America. With a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſo welcome, ſo neceſſary, to the very being of the court of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Jay muſt have been a favourite gueſt. And, after the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he made, if he did not pay due attention to the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of his family, he is a greater ſimpleton than the world can poſſibly think him to be.</p>
                  </note> Suppoſe that one of her neighbours
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031906_0154_0FEF43A616A71E38"/>
hath broke into a widow's wheatfield, nightly, for months together, and carried off or deſtroyed her crops. An envoy is ſent to demand ſatisfaction. The robber anſwers that he has old accounts to ſettle with the landlady, that he wants a wife, and that, if ſhe will agree to a ſettlement, and at the ſame time let him have her hand, he will enter into one ſweeping treaty for the whole. Any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant girl would ſee the abſurdity of this jumbling

propoſal. She would reply, that intermarriage might come time enough, when former complaints were cleared up. But the object of Mr. Hamilton and his friends was, right or wrong, to have a <hi>Britiſh</hi> treaty; and the preſent one could not have been got through, but for entwiſting it with the proſpect of compenſation.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of April, 1796, a Philadelphia print contained the following extract of a letter from London, dated February 2d.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I this moment came from the court of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, where the firſt caſe of the captures at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinique, by Grey and Jervis, was tried this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: it was reverſed, which will be a precedent for all the others, and a point gained for all of us that have caſes in the courts here. And now they ſay, on Saturday next, the lords will ſit, and will go on to try the legality of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the Weſt-Indies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>the point gained for all of us,</hi> there is yet very little progreſs made, nor is it of much concern to the claimants whether there is or not. The above, and Mr. Bayard's letter, are quoted chiefly becauſe they contain not even one ſingle, ſolitary, word, about the relief of the ſailors, who had been torn from their families, and their country, ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hand-cuffed, and flogged, to make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol in the Britiſh ſervice of aſſaſſination. If this book falls into the hands of any of that claſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are entreated to reflect for what ſort of <hi>owners,</hi> and what ſort of a country, they are bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the hardſhips of a mariner's life. We have ſeen how tranquilly Camillus gets over their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous wrongs. Yet, when a Britiſh creditor in the American funds was concerned, he could ſpeak about them like a man who was in earneſt. <q>No powers of language, ſays he, at my command,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031906_0156_0FEF43DB38A6B750"/>
can expreſs the abhorrence I feel at the idea of violating the property of individuals, which, in an authorized intercourſe, in time of peace, has been confided to the faith of our government.— In my view, every moral, and every political ſentiment, unite to conſign it to execration.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Camillus, No. 28.</note> Compare this glowing ſtyle with the frigid accents in which he obſerves, that it was impoſſible to help the impreſſment of American ſeamen. They ſhould be at leaſt as near our hearts, as the mere pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary intereſt of an Engliſh creditor in the American funds. This will be granted by every friend to the country; and, on this principle, <hi>every moral and political ſentiment will conſign to execration,</hi> Jay and his treaty, wherein the ſafety of our mariners has been totally neglected. As for the twenty treaty-making ſenators, they are neither worſe nor better than the numerous bodies of our citizens, who thanked the Preſident for ſigning this monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of American apathy—an inſtrument by which thouſands and ten thouſands of ſeamen were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Britiſh mercy. There is no deſertion of fellow-countrymen ſo thoroughly diſgraceful in the annals of any independent people under heaven. A century of heroiſm could hardly wipe out the ſtain. Fifty-five American ſhips are captured by a ſingle Britiſh corſair,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Argonaut. See above.</note> more than a twelvemonth after a treaty of amity had been ſigned, and above ſix months after it had been fully ratified. With ſuch intelligence ſtaring in their faces, while every newſpaper, for eighteen months preceding, had been ſuffocated with ſimilar information, <q>the FREEST and moſt enlightened nation in the world,</q> compelled their repreſentatives, <hi>for fear of a Britiſh war!</hi> to appropriate for the treaty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:031906_0157_0FEF4378E74E1688"/>As Mr. Hamilton has betrayed ſo much concern for Britiſh creditors, it may be aſked why he does not feel equal intereſt in the ſtate of Maryland? Before the war that province had veſted conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſums of money in the bank of England. On the 17th of December, 1795, a ſelect committee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the legiſlature of that ſtate, that <q>they have no information as to the probability of their recovering the ſtocks in the bank of England, to which they claim a title.</q> When Jay took ſo much care for the ſafety of Britiſh creditors in American funds, he might likewiſe have paid ſome attention to the intereſt of Maryland in the Britiſh funds.</p>
               <p>The tenth article of the treaty contains a plain commentary on this ſtoppage of Maryland property. It ſays that <q>neither the debts due from individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor ſhares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war or national differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated, <hi>it being unjuſt and impolitic, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Why then did England ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, or with what pretence of decency does ſhe continue to keep the funds of Maryland? When the Senate and Executive ſigned the treaty, they might ſurely have thought of this important omiſſion. But this article has even a worſe fault The words <hi>unjuſt and impolitic</hi> contain a direct libel on Mr. Dayton, and that party in the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, who, in March, 1794, had propoſed to ſequeſtrate Britiſh debts, as a ſecurity for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican compenſation. The Senate and Preſident ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified this inſult on the Repreſentatives, though, as being a ſolemn act of government, it contained an attack on the American legiſlature, a million of times more flagrant than the tranſitory ſquib of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031906_0158_0FEF43E2567271D8"/>
Barras. Yet the latter is to be made the handle for a French war, while the former, <hi>becauſe it came from Britain,</hi> was pocketed in ſilence. If an Engliſh miniſter had ſubſcribed a treaty conveying ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reference to, and ſuch an abrupt cenſure of any previous motion in parliament, the parties aggriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would have taken the matter up. But indeed no Engliſh miniſter dared to have made ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. In diſcuſſing the treaty, none of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives adverted to this tacit reproach. The pulſe of national dignity ſeems to beat higher in England than in the United States.</p>
               <p>Camillus clamours loudly about the iniquity of America in neglecting the payment of debts due to Britain, before the laſt war. What here follows, on that head, was related to the author, in January 1796, by Mr. James Madiſon.</p>
               <p>Much noiſe has been made about the juſtice of America, in neglecting the payment of debts due to Britain before the laſt war. In Virginia, it was formerly uſual for the planters, in that country, to conſign their cargoes of tobacco to a correſpondent in Britain, who was veſted with a diſcretionary power of ſelling them as high as poſſible. It was often obſerved, that when two planters had each of them, at the ſame time, ſent cargoes of tobacco of equally good quality to England, the one received perhaps twenty pounds the hogſhead, and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not more than four pounds. There was no regularity or equality in the prices, and this gave riſe to complaints and ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>Sometime ago, a gentleman, in Virginia, brought a counter-action againſt his Britiſh creditor, in one of the courts of that ſtate. His plea was, that the creditor and conſignee had actually ſold his tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co in Europe at a much higher price than <hi>he had ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in balancing their accounts.</hi> The facts alledged
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031906_0159_0FEF4490955647C0"/>
were clearly proved, and the jury gave a verdict for damages to the amount of <hi>thirty thouſand dollars.</hi>

               <p>THIS chapter begins with a few inſtances of the maritime conduct of France and England, that occurred about, or previous to, the commencement of the year 1796. They had been omitted for the ſake of brevity. But while this work is printing off, Preſident Adams, and a formidable phalanx in the fifth Congreſs, are driving the federal chariot, at full ſpeed, to the brink of a French war. One great pretence for this meaſure is the republican robberies on our ſhipping in the Weſt-Indies. But if it can be proved that our commerce endured greater injury, in 1796, from England, than it hath ſince done from France, and that the government
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031906_0160_0FEF4494DFDC43E8"/>
of laſt year took very ſmall concern about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the former, while it has conſtantly exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated thoſe of the latter, the reader will gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be convinced of <q>a conſpiracy perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra Chap.

               <p>A letter from Port-au-Paix, dated the 18th of December, 1795, to a merchant in Philadelphia, Has the following particulars. Anthoine Chaplin, captain of the Guillotine, a French privateer, had maltreated captain M'Keever of the American ſhip James. For that and a ſimilar offence againſt the ſhip Molleville, of St. Thomas, Chaplin was fined in two hundred dollars, and all damages that might accrue from the illegal capture of theſe veſſels. His privateer was confiſcated; and the pirate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was condemned to fifteen months of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in irons. <q>I this day ſaw him, ſays the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-writer, chained with a negro working in the ſtreet, in the ſame kind of dreſs in which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced captain M'Keever to leave the privateer and go on board an American veſſel. So much for our Laveaux's juſtice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anthoine Chaplin was leſs culpable than Reynolds, and other Engliſh kidnappers. His puniſhment was immediate and complete; but we have never
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031906_0161_0FEF43E5CAF10680"/>
heard a ſingle inſtance of a Britiſh offender meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch a check. At the time here ſpoke of, the American executive had ſigned Jay's treaty, to the extreme joy of England, and the utmoſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of France. Yet the former continued to rob America, and the latter did not<note n="*" place="bottom">The moſt ſolid argument then urged againſt the French in the Weſt-Indies was, that they had taken many American cargoes upon credit, and either paid an inferior price, or exacted a delay that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came equivalent to no payment at all. But we have never been told of their flogging American ſeamen, to make them enter into the republican ſervice. The convulſive ſtate of the French Weſt-Indies was well known. Anarchy, conflagration, and maſſacre, ſtrode ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively from one iſland to another. If a merchant in Philadelphia, choſe to ſend his cargo to ſuch a market, he could expect no better reception, nor did he, in all caſes, merit much ſympathy. Theſe ſpeculators raiſed the price of flour from ſeven dollars per barrel, to fifteen, to the utter oppreſſion of the labouring poor in this and other ſeaport towns. In Britain, neither the laws, nor even the people would have endured ſuch foreſtalling.</note>. For what reaſon was Laveaux able to execute juſtice, while admiral Murray could only promiſe to <hi>uſe his influence?</hi> Thus Pichegru might have promiſed to uſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with one of his own corporals. The fact ſeems to have been this. The Directory ſtill valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed federal friendſhip as ſomething; while Pitt held it as <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 4th of January, the ſchooner Hiram, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brooks, arrived at Hartford in Connecticut. He related, that the Sea Horſe, captain Smith, from Guadaloupe for Boſton, had all her crew, excepting the maſter and firſt mate, taken out by an Engliſh ſhip. She was ſent to Antigua, and releaſed, but her crew were detained on board of the ſhip that took them.</p>
               <p>A more complete account of the ſufferings of captain Smith and his people, was given by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, dated Baltimore, January 5th, 1796. On the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031906_0162_0FEF43AD6F762580"/>
13th of November, preceding, he was taken by the frigate Reſource, captain Watkins. Five of his men, two of whom had the fever, were impreſſed. A prize-maſter and four men were put on board of the Sea-Horſe. They confined captain Smith for three days below, under the guard of two men with drawn cutlaſſes, and loaded piſtols. While captain Smith was on board of the Reſource, he was ill treated by a midſhipman; and told him that he would not be inſulted by a boy. Captain Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins ſaid, that, if he had heard the expreſſion, he would have tied up and flogged Smith for daring to inſult his <hi>majeſty's officer.</hi> To the feelings of an <hi>enlightened federaliſt,</hi> this language may be acceptable. Watkins offered him two hundred pounds, and a ſhare of the prize-money, to ſay that <hi>the ſhip was French property.</hi> At Antigua, the firſt mate of the Sea Horſe died, and the preſident cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his body to be thrown into the ſea. He alſo ſent a pilot and negroes on board to carry the veſſel out to ſea. Captain Smith offered to knock them down. The preſident ſent for him, and threatened to cauſe the fort to fire into the veſſel, if ſhe did not go out to ſea, either with men or without them. On Smith's refuſal, the preſident ſaid that he would have him confined. What a ſplendid blaze of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh honour and hoſpitality! And how fondly would Noah Webſter have chuckled over it, if the ſcene had only paſt in a French port inſtead of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh one! Watkins had brought three other Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can prizes into Antigua. He cut them out of a port in Guadaloupe; and, their regiſters being in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on ſhore, he boaſted of them as a ſure prey. They were, notwithſtanding, diſcharged. How captain Smith got hands to work his veſſel to Baltimore does not appear. Two leagues from Cape Henry, he was boarded by admiral Murray, who, as if the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031906_0163_0FEF43E7A6B491C0"/>
poor man had not already ſuffered enough, took from him Wilkinſon Gilt, a mate whom he had ſhipped at Antigua. Somebody called citizen Hughes, is ſincerely thanked for ſupplying him with part of a crew. But whether this was Victor Hughes, or where the help was given, we are left in the dark.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of January, 1796, the brig Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, captain Houſton, arrived from Port-au-Prince at Philadelphia. He informed, that three Britiſh ſhips of war, at the former place, preſſed every American who could not produce a protection. They were chiefly manned with American ſeamen. A number of our veſſels, lying at Port-au-Prince, were in a moſt diſtreſſed ſituation for want of hands.</p>
               <p>A letter from St. Kitts, dated 4th January, 1796, and received by a merchant of Philadelphia, ſays, that the brig Fame, captain Medlin, of this port, was about to ſail for it. The letter adds, that ſhe had been plundered by a French privateer, but gives no particulars.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of January, the Muſquito, captain Harſhaw, arrived at Baltimore from Bourdeaux. On the voyage, he was met by the Huſſar, a Britiſh frigate. His keys were taken, his cheſts broke up, and every thing ſtolen that the Britiſh could lay their hands on. They alſo drank a caſe of his wine, and preſſed the Muſquito's mate, and one of the hands, who was an American.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have inſtances of Britiſh piracy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly overlooked or omitted, as obſerved in the beginning of this chapter. The reader muſt have become tired with this uniform and diſguſting tale of our commercial degradation. As a relief to the melancholy picture, let us turn, for a moment, to the debates on the Britiſh treaty. The enthuſiaſm of attachment which it inſpired, forms one of the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031906_0164_0FEF43E9733CA360"/>
moſt ſingular phenomena in the hiſtory of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind. Many of its ſanguine advocates were men unſuſpected of a ſiniſter deſign.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of April, 1796, Mr. Gallatin, in ſpeaking of the Britiſh treaty, had theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fact was uncontroverted, that the Britiſh ſtill continued to impreſs our ſeamen and to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our veſſels. If they pretended to juſtify that conduct by the treaty, it became neceſſary to obtain an explanation of the doubtful articles; if there was nothing in the treaty to juſtify it, their acts were acts of hoſtility; were an infrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that treaty; and even, according to the doctrine of thoſe gentlemen who thought that, in common caſes, the houſe had no diſcretion, the treaty once broken by one party, was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger binding on the other; and it was the right as well as the duty of this houſe, not to proceed to paſs the laws neceſſary to carry it into effect, until ſatisfactory aſſurances were obtained, that theſe acts ſhould ceaſe, and until Great Britain had evinced a friendly diſpoſition towards us<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates, vol. ii. p. 266.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was impoſſible to conceive a plainer, or a more ſubſtantial argument. Theſe few lines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſt enough to have convinced an audience of acceſſible underſtandings, of the propriety of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending proceedings toward fulfilling the Britiſh treaty, till an effectual check had been given to Britiſh piracy. On the 27th of April, Mr. Tracy roſe in anſwer to Mr. Gallatin. Two paſſages ſhall be here given from his ſpeech. The firſt is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It had been acknowledged, by Mr. Gallatin, that a new negociation, at preſent, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Great Britain poſſeſſes the poſts, the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031906_0165_0FEF449803D7CF78"/>
confidence of the Indians, the many millions of dollars deſpoiled from our commerce, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our trade, and proceeds to make more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions on our property and our rights, and yet <hi>the gentleman ſays we will not go to war!</hi> What would be the American conduct under ſuch a ſtate of things? Would they tamely ſee their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtrut, attempt to look big, call hard names; and the moment they were faced, like an over-grown lubberly boy, ſhrink into a corner? Is this, he aſked, the American character? He thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acquainted with a part of the United States, too well, to believe they merited ſuch a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; the people where he was moſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whatever might be the character in other parts of the union, were not of the ſtamp to cry Hoſannah to day, and crucify to-morrow; they will not dance round a whiſky pole one day, and curſe their government, and, upon <hi>hearing</hi> of a military force, ſneak into a ſwamp. No, ſaid Mr. Tracy, my immediate conſtituents, whom I very well know, underſtand their rights, and will defend them, and if they find that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either cannot, or will not protect them, they will at leaſt attempt to protect themſelves. And he could not feel thankful to Mr. Gallatin for coming all the way from Geneva, to give Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans a character of puſillanimity<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates, vol. ii. p. 295.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This rhapſody makes up with ill-nature what it wants in meaning. From the firſt part of it, where the gentleman ſpeaks of the injuries committed on this country by England, one would ſuppoſe, that he was going to recommend an immediate exertion of American vengeance. But, ſo far from that, he only recommended that we ſhould kiſs the Britiſh
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031906_0166_0FEF43EF8FB77000"/>
rod by inſtantly appropriating for Jay's treaty. The bluſtering ſound of his words, and the abject proſtration of his ideas form a ſtriking contraſt. His compariſon between Connecticut and the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern counties of Pennſylvania is a maſter-piece of vulgar calumny. That the people of the former ſtate are as brave as any in the union has never been denied; and the convention of Saratoga will, for ages to come, be remembered and cited as a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their courage. But this ought not to be converted into a handle for reproach, and much leſs for ſlander, againſt other ſtates. As to the weſtern inſurrection, it is time that we ſhould begin to ſpeak truth about it. The way in which that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair was ſuppreſſed did, in itſelf, diſcredit the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the country. The late king of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia would not have thought all the military conduct diſplayed about it, worth an enſign's commiſſion. Here are a few ſpecimens of the federal army.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>On Thurſday the 13th of November, there were about forty perſons brought to Parkiſon's houſe, by order of general White; he directed to put the damned raſcals in the cellar, to tie them back to back, to make a fire for the guard, but to put the priſoners back to the father end of the cellar, and to give them neither victuals nor drink. The cellar was wet and muddy, and the night cold; the cellar extended the whole length, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a log-houſe, which was neither floored, nor the openings between the logs daubed. They were kept there until Saturday morning, and then marched to the town of Waſhington. On the march, one of the priſoners, who was ſubject to convulſions, fell into a fit: but when ſome of the troop told general White of his ſituation, he ordered them to tie the damned raſcal to a horſe's tail, and drag him along with them, for he had only
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031906_0167_0FEF43B029055F90"/>
feigned having the fits. Some of his fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, however, who had a horſe, diſmounted, and let the poor man ride: he had another fit before he reached Waſhington. This march was about twelve miles. The poor man, who had the fits, had been in the American ſervice, during almoſt the whole of the war with Great Britain.</q>
               </p>
               <p>General White has not denied this accuſation, nor proſecuted the hiſtorian who records it. Hence we muſt admit the ſtatement to be true; and New Jerſey may congratulate herſelf on the acquiſition or production of a ſecond DUKE OF CUMBERLAND. Mr. Findley gives ſome farther traits of this fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hero. <q>Stockdale was forbid, on the peril of of his life, to adminiſter any comfort to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, though they were periſhing with cold, and famiſhing with hunger. The general treated the priſoners, as they arrived, with the moſt inſulting and abuſive language, cauſing them all to be tied back to back, except one man, who held a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable rank, and who, however, was ſaid to be one of the moſt guilty in his cuſtody. One of the neareſt neighbours, who had a child at the point of dying, and obſerving that they were bringing in the whole neighbourhood priſoners, without regard to guilt or innocence, went and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to general White, expecting that, as he was conſcious there was no charge againſt him, he would be permitted to return to his family on gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bail, but he alſo was inhumanly thrown into the cellar, tied with the reſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the privilege of ſeeing his dying child; nor was he permitted to attend its funeral, until after many entreaties he obtained that liberty, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the moſt horrid oaths and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</q> Of the ſmall honour acquired in
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031906_0168_0FEF449A66C366A0"/>
this expedition, a great part falls to the ſnare of captain John Dunlap, of this city. <q>Captain Dunlap and his party, while they behaved with the greateſt dexterity in taking the priſoners, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with as much politeneſs and attention as their ſituation would admit of, and engaged their gratitude by accompanying unavoidable ſeverity with humanity<note n="*" place="bottom">Findley's Hiſtory of the Inſurrection, p. 202.</note>.</q> At Carliſle, a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, after a hearty dinner, were on the point of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire to the town, and of charging each other with the bayonet. Mr. Tracy is left to judge whether ſuch conduct was not as bad as that of dancing round a whiſky pole. But when the member attempts to ſtigmatize the whole conſtituents of Mr. Gallatin, as rebels and poltroons, it is hard to find, within the compaſs of decency, a term ſuitable to his behaviour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tracy farther complained of Mr. Gallatin for having ſaid that <q>the negociation with Great Britain was begun in <hi>fear,</hi> carried on through <hi>fear,</hi> and the treaty made by the ſame motive; when it arrived in this country the Senate ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it, and the Preſident placed his ſignature to it from <hi>fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and now there was an attempt to obtain the ſanction of the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives from <hi>fear.</hi> All theſe expreſſions, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified manner, the gentleman had applied to this country, in its moſt important tranſactions, by its moſt important characters, and to crown all, we were to defeat the treaty, and ſit down quietly under injuries the moſt irritating, and not attempt a redreſs, or to do any thing like going to war. Under impreſſions made by ſuch declarations, he had ſaid what he had, and he now ſaid, he wiſhed to look in the face of Mr.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031906_0169_0FEF4380F1772D70"/>
Gallatin, or Mr. Heiſter, or any other, who da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſay, the American character was that of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice. He would ſay again and again, it was madneſs, or worſe, to ſuppoſe we could defeat this treaty and avoid a war.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What Mr. Gallatin ſays about <hi>fear</hi> is perfectly true. Mr. Tracy always takes it for granted, that America had no medium between the acceptance of Mr. Jay's treaty and a Btitiſh war. An embargo for four months would have reduced the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to our terms, without occaſion for the firing of a piſtol.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tracy next denies the reality of Britiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſments. <q>He took this opportunity to aſk for <hi>the proofs of ſuch tranſactions,</hi> as impreſſing our ſeamen, by the Britiſh government. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he knew of none; and had never heard one inſtance of the Britiſh government either avowing the right, or practiſing upon it, of impreſſment of an American into their ſea ſervice; many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had occurred of complaints to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all were immediately redreſſed; and, although it was become very faſhionable to calumniate the Britiſh government, he was impelled, from his own belief and conviction on the ſubject, to ſay, that no ſuch inſtance had ever taken place or would ever, of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, juſtifying the impreſſment of natives of the United States, or one who was an acknowledged citizen. Is it not unfair, ſaid Mr. Tracy, to attribute to the government unautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized miſconduct of individuals, far removed from the ſeat and controul of the government? It was equally unreaſonable to ſay, that we were not protected by the treaty, and ſhould not be, when the Britiſh government had promiſed to pay for all former depredations made in that way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

our commerce, was it not reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they would prevent or pay for any ſuch depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation now made? And they certainly would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuch, which were not from the confuſion of war rendered inevitable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>proofs</hi> of impreſſment, the gentleman is referred to the depoſition of Cyprian Cook, emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Norwich in Connecticut. As for his never hearing of <hi>one</hi> inſtance, where the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment avowed the right of impreſſing, or practiſed upon it, the inference muſt be, that Mr. Tracy has ears of a particular conſtruction. Whether Mr. Pitt himſelf aſſerted the right is of no conſequence. The Britiſh, in the Weſt-Indies, univerſally avowed and practiſed upon it. Mr. Tracy ſays that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to government were immediately redreſſed. He ſhould have told us what redreſs was obtained in the caſe related by captain Cook. He then mounts upon that favourite topic of the Britiſh officers acting without orders. <hi>Compenſation</hi> cloſes the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. We now proceed with the liſt of Britiſh pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, leaving Mr. Tracy to deny their exiſtence, as long as he ſhall think proper.</p>
               <p>A Philadelphia newſpaper, of the 8th of April, 1796, informs, that the brig Maria Wilman, of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, captain Oaks, was taken in Tortola by the Bull Dog ſloop, and there ſold at auction. She was from Demarara, bound to Baltimore, with a cargo of ſugar and coffee. It farther ſays, that, on Monday, the 11th of April, 1796, the brig Charlotte, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, arrived at Baltimore, in thirteen days from Martinique. Captain Watts, of the ſchooner Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, of Alexandria, came paſſenger, along with a number of other Americans. Their veſſels had been contracted for, and they were <hi>obliged to leave them.</hi> This corroborates the account already given by captain Samuel Green.

Henfield and John Singletary had been arreſted on board of the Citizen Genet, a French privateer, lying in the Delaware, and Henfield was tried in this city, ſoon after, for having enliſted in the French ſervice. In ſpite of a buſtle made by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was acquitted. In the eye of reaſon, it ſeems equally culpable to have ſold privateers to Britain, yet no notice has been taken of that practice.</p>
               <p>A paragraph from Fredericſburg, dated April 1ſt, 1796, ſays, that, laſt week, arrived in the river, the ſchooner William, captain John Scott, from Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre, St. Kitts. He ſaid that on the 23d of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, in Baſſaterre road, he was boarded by a boat with five men with cutlaſſes. They belonged to a Britiſh armed ſloop lying there. They ordered William M'Coy, a native of Fredericſburg, into the boat; but, being prevented from taking him, they went back to the ſloop. Immediately after, they returned with their commander, one Williams, and an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional number of men, armed with piſtols and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes. They took away from the ſchooner, John Mansfield, William M'Coy, and two blacks. Next morning, captain Scott went on ſhore, and proved theſe people to be citizens of the United States. He could recover only the two blacks. Every Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can at the port ſhared a ſimilar fate. A Baltimore ſchooner was ſtript of all her hands, excepting the mate and a boy.</p>
               <p>A practice had for ſometime prevailed at Norfolk, in Virginia, of ſending horſes to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies to mount their cavalry. This, if not a breach of neutrality, was at beſt a plain enough indication to France that we preferred the moſt petty ſelf-intereſt to any ſucceſs on her ſide. A Kingſton newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, of the 23d of February, 1796, has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing article. <q>Captain Huntington reports, that,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031906_0172_0FEF43B8FA945298"/>
when he left America, admiral Murray, with his ſquadron, was lying in Hampton road, waiting to convoy the horſes that were purchaſed for <hi>the dragoons in St. Domingo.</hi>
                  </q> Two articles, dated Philadelphia, April 12th, ſay, that three of theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, with their freights of horſes, were taken by the French, and ſent into Cape Francois. This is the only capture by the French of American ſhipping that has yet occurred in compiling the laſt or the preſent chapter.</p>
               <p>The Federal Gazette of Baltimore, of the 15th of April, 1796, contains a letter from Tortola. The writer mentions the irregular proceedings of the Britiſh court of admiralty in that iſland, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting American captures. The captains of the ſhips of war were permitted to detain the maſters and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percargoes of the prizes as priſoners on board of their veſſels, till they were deprived of opportunities for employing proper counſel. Enormous coſts were granted, of which the bench received a ſhare. Some particular circumſtances of injuſtice are mentioned in the caſe of the Maria Wilman, captain Oaks, who, in the ſame newſpaper, is noticed as having, at this time, arrived ſafe with his veſſel at Baltimore. It is likely that he wrote this very letter; but perhaps nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor his owners durſt avow it, for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Britiſh party. In an <hi>independent</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, this dread may ſeem ſtrange, yet nothing is more notoriouſly true, than that ſuch influence is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active and formidable. Every mercantile man, and every newſprinter, who dares to ſpeak, with energy, of the inſolence and rapine of the Queen of Iſles, runs imminent hazard of perſecution. The Britiſh tories, in our ſeaport towns, ſeconded by the American intereſt, will ſpare no toil or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to make him inſolvent and infamous. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſcription cannot convey a complete picture
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031906_0173_0FEF43BD0FFE73B0"/>
of their proceedings. Their own pencil furniſhes the beſt portrait. Here follows an extract from a federal electioneering hand-bill. An hundred years hence, it may be hoped, that Americans will turn over ſuch outcaſts of typography, with the ſame contemptuous pity as an Engliſhman of the preſent age looks back on the ſallies of Settle and Tom Browne<note n="*" place="bottom">See Johnſon's Life of Dryden.</note>.</p>

                     <p>Jacobin men and jacobin meaſures are all hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and rotten. An inſtructive inſtance has juſt occurred. The bank of Pennſylvania was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in oppoſition to the bank of the United States. A jacobin preſident, ſecretary, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of jacobin directors were appointed. The iſſue has diſcloſed a ſcene of jacobin villainy. It turns out, that the preſident, ſecretary, and the notable John Swanwick, have fraudently, and by colluſion, drawn out of the bank one hundred and ſeventy thouſand dollars more than they had a right to. John Swanwick, the famous French American democrat, whom the good democrats in Philadelphia have lately made a member of Congreſs, in oppoſition to the prudent and honeſt part of the city, now appears in his true colour, an unprincipled ſwindler. Such is the authentic intelligence juſt received from Philadelphia. And yet a large body of citizens, many good but delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ones, are ſtraining every nerve to place once more in Congreſs the ariſtocratic, democratical, jacobinical, Edward Livingſton.

The anſwer is, that ſuch writings were, in December, 1796, propagated at New-York, with the approbation of a very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party. The deſign was, to defeat the re-elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Livingſton as repreſentative in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for that city; and while any remembrance of this handbill ſhall remain, its authors and its abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors muſt be abhorred by every honeſt man.</p>
               <p>The bank of Pennſylvania was not eſtabliſhed in oppoſition to the bank of the United States. The field of competition was alike open to every perſon. It has never been ſaid that the Pennſylvania bank uſed an unfair means to rival or injure the bank of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. The latter is here referred to, as if it were ſomething ſacred; and yet the holders of its ſtock are aſhamed or afraid of telling their names<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra, chap. ii.</note>. Mr. Swanwick did not, in the cloſe of 1796, nor for a long time before it, owe the Pennſylvania bank a dollar. Here he is charged as <hi>an unprincipled ſwindler,</hi> for having made fraudulent draughts out of it. Thoſe who voted for his election oppoſed the <hi>honeſt</hi> part of this city. But even if it had been all as true as it was falſe, this had nothing to do with the election of Livingſton, any more than the idle ſtory of Mr. Gallatin, ſleeping under hedges, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a reaſon for rejecting general Dearbourne<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The ſame tiſſue of defamation, falſehood, and vulgarity, runs through a very large proportion of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the federal party.

               <p>Recurring again to the caſe of the Baltimore brig, it may well be ſuppoſed, that captain Oaks was afraid of provoking ſuch a ſwarm of ſcorpions. For the ſame obvious and weighty reaſon many nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives of Britiſh piracy have been ſecreted, by the ſufferers, from the public prints. Of the fifty-five ſhips taken by the Argonaut, perhaps no regular account of the capture of ſix has appeared in any newſpaper.</p>
               <p>The Maryland Journal, of the 2d of May, 1796, gives the following account as from captain Wade of the ſchooner Polly, from Jamacia. He ſays, that from the 20th of February to the 1ſt of April, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen American prizes had been ſent into Kingſton. Three of theſe were ſchooners, belonging to Oliver and Thomſon, of Baltimore. Another was a new copper-bottomed ſhip from Baltimore to Calcutta.</p>
               <p>On the 3d of May, the ſchooner Edward and William, captain Levin Jones, arrived at Baltimore, in nineteen days from Port-au-Paix. In the paſſage, ſhe met with a brig from Port-au-Prince bound for New-London. The people told captain Jones, that five of them had been impreſſed by a Britiſh frigate. On the 28th of April, they were chaſed by another, but night coming on they got out of her way.</p>
               <p>On the ſame day, the Ariel, captain Fiſher, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Baltimore from Jacquemel. He had ſpoke to the ſchooner Elizabeth, of Philadelphia, from Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica. The captain gave him an account of <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven</hi> American veſſels carried into that iſland
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031906_0176_0FEF43F4EA9181B8"/>
for trial, and of <hi>two</hi> carried into the Mole, which were to be ſent to Jamaica. He adds, that all veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to or from French iſlands were ſeized.</p>
               <p>On the 17th of April, the brig Siſters, captain Brent, arrived in Hampton roads from Guernſey. She had, on the 12th of March, been boarded by the Thetis, a Bermudian corſair. Theſe pirates took out the maſter and crew, rummaged the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, broke up all the letters and papers, and, after three hours, permitted her to proceed.</p>

                              <hi>By an arrival, on Saturday, of a veſſel from Curracoa, we received the following proteſt of Hugh Wilſon, maſter of American brig called the Jay, belonging to Baltimore; who being duly ſworn before the notary royal and public of St. Bartholomew, declareth:</hi>—</opener>
                           <p>That, having got his veſſel captured and condemned, as hereafter will appear, and having had his log-book and all the papers belonging to the veſſel and to himſelf taken from him, all to the ſhipping articles and a ſmall memorandum book of his private diſburſements, he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give his declaration from memory, and to the beſt of his recollection, viz. that, on the 10th of April laſt, 1795, he ſailed in ſaid brig from St. Pierre, in the iſland of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinique, bound to Antigua: that, on the 12th of ſaid month, in the morning, he was boarded by the French armed ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner called, (as near as he could recollect) the Alhenienne, commanded by one Paſcal from Guadaulope, under the lee of which iſland the brig then was, and in the evening was carried into Baſſaterre road, in ſaid laſt iſland. That the ſame deponent and all his crew were immediately put on board a French ſloop of war, where they were detained about eight or ten days, without knowing what was the intention of the French to do with the ſaid brig, and without ever having been heard or examined. That the deponent and the ſupercargo, Mr. John Starck, were ſent on ſhore and conducted to the interpreter or linguiſter, who told them the brig Jay and her remaining cargo, conſiſting in corn and ſtaves, had already been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and who furniſhed Mr. Starck with a copy of the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031906_0177_0FEF43C0E7A77958"/>
condemnation. That Mr. Starck was put at liberty; but the deponent was, the next day, thrown into Baſſaterre goal, where he remained about ten days, after which he was drove out of the ſaid goal and put in chains, on board a ſmall French ſchooner bound to Point-a-Petre, the deponent lying all the paſſage (about ſixty hours), with eight priſoners more chained to the ſame bar, in the hold of ſaid ſchooner, upon the ſtone bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, with a very ſcanty and indifferent food. That, having arrived in ſuch a ſituation at Point-a-Petre, the deponent was immediately put on board one of the priſonſhips in the harbour, where he was detained for near eight months, that is to ſay, until the 1ſt inſtant, (January 1796) when captain Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, of the brig Peggy, of New-York, having obtained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to pick out American ſailors, that might be found on board of the different priſon ſhips, came along ſide the ſhip, where the deponent was detained. That having made his caſe known to him, he the ſaid captain Wheeler took the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent along with him, and put him on board the ſaid brig Peggy. That on the 11th inſt. or thereabout, the depon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent went in ſaid brig from Point-a-Petre, and arrived in this harbour of Guſtavia yeſterday, the 13th inſt. without yet knowing what has become of his veſſel, the brig Jay, her cargo, or any thing belonging to her, and without ever hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been heard, either in behalf of ſaid property or of himſelf, during all the time of near nine months, he was detained in Guadaloupe, plundered of every thing belonging to him, and not left a ſecond ſhirt to put on; that, during his detention in Point-a-Petre, captain Lyle of Baltimore, as he paſſed by the ſaid priſonſhip, having ſeen and recollected the deponent, had applied to the commiſſaire de guerre in his behalf, but in vain, as ſaid captain Lyle afterwards told the deponent.</p>

               <p>The inſertion of the preceding article, ought to vindicate this work from the ſuſpicion of a deſire to conceal or palliate the injuries committed againſt American commerce by the French republic.

diſcovery and publication of truth, without the ſmalleſt concern what nation, or what individual may chance to appear in an unfavourable light. From this inſtance of French piracy, we return to Britiſh depredations.</p>
               <p>A paragraph, dated Norfolk, April 26th, 1796, mentions the arrival of the ſchooner Eleanor, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Jackſon. He gave an account of the Huſſar, a Britiſh frigate, having captured the ſhip Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Yorktown, captain Orr, from Liſbon to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk. The crew were taken on board of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, and the ſhip herſelf was ſent to Halifax. The Maryland Journal, of the 2d of May, gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſchooner Betſey of Boſton, captain Philips. She was taken by the Britiſh, but re-cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the crew, who delivered up the Britiſh as priſoners to the French, at Jacquemel. The ſame newſpaper tells of the ſeizure of the ſhip Alexander, of Baltimore, by the Britiſh. She was bound from Demarara for Baltimore. The captors ſent her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grenada, where the cargo was libelled. Here is alſo a ſtatement from captain Wade of the ſchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Polly, of thirteen ſail of Americans which had been ſent into Kingſton, Jamaica, between the 20th of February, and the 1ſt of April, 1796. One of theſe veſſels was bound from Baltimore to Calcutta.</p>
               <p>It ſeems amazing that, in the face of ſuch injuries, any member of Congreſs could recommend appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations for the Britiſh treaty. Public curioſity has been excited by the concealment of Mr. Jay's inſtructions. Acceſs has been obtained to this paper, and leave has been given to make an abſtract of every material part of it. This, though not in form, yet in ſubſtance, will anſwer the end in view.</p>
               <p>Some notice has already been taken of the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conduct of the executive in refuſing to treat
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031906_0179_0FEF44A22C36D130"/>
with Genet becauſe the Senate were not then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and thereafter, while they actually were in ſeſſion, of his reſolving to enter into a Britiſh nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and nominating Mr. Jay as envoy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the Senate previous intimation of ſuch a deſign. The meſſage does not aſk either advice or conſent, but abruptly declares that <hi>he has thought proper.</hi> This is not the conſtitutional ſtyle of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advice, or conſent. The departure from the ſpirit of the conſtitution is obvious.</p>
               <p>The meſſage was received by the Senate on the 16th of April, 1794. On the 17th, a motion was made in the following words: <q>that previous to going into the conſideration of the nomination of a ſpecial envoy to the court of Great Britain, the Preſident of the United States be requſted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Senate of <hi>the whole buſineſs with which the propoſed envoy is to be charged.</hi>
                  </q> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was negatived. Thus the <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> of the Senate, as required by the conſtitution, were overlooked. Without conſulting them, the Preſident reſolved to enter into a negociation, and named an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy. When he ſent down the meſſage to the Senate as to his having done ſo, he did not let them know what the negociation was to be about. If the words <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> mean any thing, it muſt ſurely be that the Senate are to be previouſly acquainted with and conſulted upon the buſineſs that an ambaſſador is going to undertake. There can be no other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional explanation of the phraſe. The Senate could not pretend to give their advice about the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of commencing a treaty, when they did not know the terms on which it was to begin. Yet ſuch is the ſpirit in a majority of that body that they refuſed, as appears above, to requeſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from the Preſident upon this pohnt. They had a title to have <hi>demanded</hi> ſuch an ecclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſement. In private life, it would be mockery to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031906_0180_0FEF43C6CE9F6880"/>
aſk a man to conſent to any buſineſs, without firſt telling him the ſcope of it. Without ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is impoſſible that he can give any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the name either of <hi>advice</hi> or <hi>conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 19th of April a motion was made in the Senate of which the following is part. <q>That to permit judges of the Supreme Court to hold, at the ſame time, any other office or employment emanating from, and holden at the pleaſure of the Executive, is contrary to the ſpirit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and, as tending to expoſe them to the influence of the Executive, is <hi>miſchievous</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic.</hi>
                  </q> This motion paſſed in the negative, ten to ſeventeen. On the 27th of November, 1794, Dr. William Smith objected in Congreſs to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic ſociety of this city, the holding of ſuch a doctrine. But its being ſupported by ſo large a part of the Senate ought at leaſt to have ſoftened the ſeverity of his cenſure.</p>
               <p>We now come to the inſtructions of our envoy. Of theſe an entire copy cannot, as above ſtated, be obtained; but permiſſion has been procured to make a copious abſtract. They ſet out with directing Mr. Jay to obtain redreſs for the piracies committed on our commerce by authority of inſtructions from the king and council. He is next enjoined to draw to a concluſion all points of difference concerning the peace of 1783. The Executive then expreſſes a wiſh, that <q>the debts, the intereſt claimed upon them, and all things relating to them, be put out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in a diplomatic diſcuſſion, as being certainly of a judicial nature to be decided by our courts.</q> If this point could not be obtained, he was to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the doctrines of government, <q>with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proper for the occaſion, and with that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his former public opinions, which ſelf-reſpect will juſtify.</q> This phraſe, as to former
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031906_0181_0FEF3218D61B06F0"/>
public opinions, does not ſeem very happy. Mr. Jay, as a judge, had declared, from the bench that the Engliſh were juſtified in detaining the weſtern poſts, on account of the debts due to Britain. Hence, attention to his former opinions, would lead him to vindicate the latter, at the expence of America.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions proceed to ſay, that, <q>the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, having denied their abetting the Indians, we muſt, of courſe, acquit them. But we have ſatisfactory proofs, ſome of which, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, cannot, as you will diſcover, be well uſed in public, that Britiſh agents are guilty of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up, and aſſiſting, with arms, ammunition, and warlike implements, the different tribes of Indians againſt us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is incumbent upon that government to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain theſe agents, as a forbearance to reſtrain them, cannot be interpreted otherwiſe than as a determination to countenance them.</q> Mr. Jay was farther directed to inſiſt, <q>that the Indians dwelling in the territories of one, ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered with by the other.</q> He was likewiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, <q>to explain the pacific wiſhes of America, in caſe that he ſhould find the court of London equally diſpoſed for amity.</q> Mr. Jay was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, inſtructed to mention the dangerous effect that might be produced upon the minds of the citizens of America, by the continuation of outrages in the Weſt-Indies, while, at the ſame time, our courts gave entire authority to claims for Britiſh debts. Mr. Jay was, in particular, enjoined to conſider <q>the inexecution and infraction of the treaty, as ſtanding on diſtinct grounds from the vexations and ſpolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that no adjuſtment of the former, is to be influenced by the latter.</q> Mr. Jay was, in the next place, inſtructed, if he ſhould be able to obtain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031906_0182_0FEF44A41319B1B8"/>
as to the treſpaſſes on the treaty of 1783, and as to the Weſt-Indian piracies, to ſound the Britiſh miniſtry on the ſubject of a commercial treaty. If he found this ſubject eligible, he was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially directed to inſiſt upon the following points.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1. Reciprocity in navigation, and particularly to the Weſt-Indies, and even to the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>The admiſſion of wheat, fiſh, ſalt-meat, and other great ſtaples, upon the ſame footing with the admiſſion of the great Britiſh ſtaples in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ports.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. FREE SHIPS TO MAKE FREE GOODS.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Proper ſecurity for the ſafety of neutral commerce in other reſpects; and particularly, by declaring proviſions never to be contraband, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the ſtrongeſt poſſible caſe; as the block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of a port; or, if attainable, by aboliſhing contraband altogether. By defining a blockade, if contraband, muſt continue, in ſome degree, as it is defined in the armed neutrality. By reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the opportunities of vexation, in viſiting veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and bringing under ſtricter management privateers, and expediting recoveries againſt them for miſconduct.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Exemption of emigrants, particularly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers, from reſtraint<note n="*" place="bottom">Every body knows how admirably this point has been attended to.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Free export of arms and military ſtores.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. The convoy of merchant ſhips, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſhips of war, where it ſhall be neceſſary, and they be holding the ſame courſe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is anxiouſly to be deſired, that the fiſhing grounds now engroſſed by the Britiſh, ſhould be opened to the citizens of the United States.</p>

                     <pb n="175" facs="unknown:031906_0183_0FEF43F71DD9B558"/>10. The intercourſe with England makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the diſability ariſing from alienage, in caſes of inheritance ſhould be put on a liberal footing; or rather aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. You may diſcuſs the ſale of prizes in our ports, while we are neutral; and this, perhaps, may be added to the conſiderations which we have to give, beſides thoſe of reciprocity.</p>

No privateering commiſſions to be taken out by the ſubjects of the one, or the citizens of the other party, againſt each other<note n="*" place="bottom">It is hard to gueſs what our Executive could mean by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. In caſe of a rupture between this country and England, the chief way in which we can affect her intereſt, muſt be by attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her commerce. Hence a ſtipulation for reſtricting our own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in that quarter, has not an extreme appearance of perſpicuity.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Conſuls to be admitted in Europe, the Weſt and Eaſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. In caſe of an Indian war, none but the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupplies in peace ſhall be furniſhed.</p>

                  <p n="18">18. No ſtipulation whatever is to interfere with our obligations to France.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. A treaty is not to be continued beyond fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The above enumeration preſented, in a general point of view, the objects which our Executive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as deſirable to be comprehended in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty. But Mr. Jay was eſpecially caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to expect that a treaty could be poſitively ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſo great a variety of advantages in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031906_0184_0FEF43C9C4090520"/>
of America. Here it is difficult to ſuppreſs the feelings of ſurpriſe, at ſo very injudicious a choice of the time for making a commercial treaty with Britain. Something has been ſaid upon that ſubject already, and to which the reader is referred.</p>
               <p>The ſixth chapter of an act of Parliament, paſt in the 28th year of the reign of George the third, mentions certain articles which may be carried from the United States to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, in <hi>Britiſh</hi> bottoms; and certain others which may be conveyed from the Britiſh Weſt-Indies to the United States in <hi>Britiſh</hi> bottoms. Mr. Jay was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, if practicable, to obtain the ſame privilege, in both caſes, for <hi>American</hi> bottoms. But ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſtead of the uſual clauſe of ratification, was to contain the following. <q>This treaty ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory and concluſive, when the ſame ſhall be ratified by his Britannic majeſty of the one part, and by the Preſident of the United States, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, of the other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But if a treaty of commerce could not be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a baſis as advantageous as that above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Mr. Jay was prohibited from <hi>concluding or ſigning any ſuch;</hi> 
                  <q>it being conceived that it would not be expedient to do any thing more than to digeſt with the Britiſh miniſtry, the articles of ſuch a treaty, as they appeared willing to accede to, <hi>referring them here for conſideration and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtruction,</hi> previous to a formal concluſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From this part of Mr. Jay's inſtructions, the plain inference ſeems to be, that he was not at liberty to ſign any treaty at all, till it had been previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this country for examination. Indeed it was plainly enough admitted, in the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, that our envoy had exceeded his powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:031906_0185_0FEF43FD0B9C4E28"/>After this injunction, the inſtructions to Mr. Jay proceed immediately in the following words. <q>Some of the other points which it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to comprehend in a treaty, may not be attended with difficulty. Among theſe, is the admiſſion of our commodities and manufactures generally, in the Britiſh European dominions, upon a footing equally good with thoſe of other foreign countries. At preſent, certain enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted articles only are admitted, and though the enumeration embraces all the articles which it is of preſent conſequence to us to be able to export to thoſe dominions, yet, in proceſs of time, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of the objects may become of moment. The fixing of the privileges which we now enjoy, in the Britiſh Eaſt Indies, by toleration of the company's government, if any arrangement can be made with the conſent of the company for that purpoſe, would alſo be a valuable ingredient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As Denmark and Sweden were upon very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent terms with the Britiſh miniſtry, and as Ruſſia, the nominal ally of England, had, in the American war, appeared at the head of the famous armed neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, it was to be expected, that ſome co-operation from that quarter would greatly tend to enforce the ſucceſs of Mr. Jay's errand. Accordingly, ſome ideas on this ſubject ſeem to have occurred to our American cabinet. But the timid and indeciſive ſtyle in which the inſtructions, as to that point, are couched, ſhews how little could be reſted upon them. Our envoy was cautioned as to entering into ſuch a negociation, if there was a danger of its being diſcovered by the Britiſh court. Now this notion of our Executive runs expreſsly counter to the common experience of mankind. For, the very dread of Jay maturing ſuch a treaty, would have been the moſt likely way to bring Grenville to favourable terms. Nothing
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031906_0186_0FEF43848BC21608"/>
was to be depended upon from that quarter, but through the operation of intereſt or fear; and the ſhorteſt way to make this impreſſion, was, by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a correſpondence with the Daniſh and Swediſh miniſters, even though America had previouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to decline ſuch a conjunction. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer armed neutrality had ſtruck England with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual alarm, and the very dread of a ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of that ſort would have chilled the warmeſt drop of blood in the veins of the Engliſh nation. In private life, when you want to cheapen a piece of goods, the firſt argument is, that you can go to the next ſtore. But Jay was expreſsly directed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any deſign of ſuch a nature. To give our Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive full juſtice, the whole paſſage, as it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows the laſt quotation, is here inſerted <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>You will have no difficulty in gaining acceſs to the Miniſters of Ruſſia, Denmark, and Sweden, at the court of London. The principles of the armed neutrality would abundantly cover our neutral rights. If, therefore, the ſituation of things with reſpect to Great Britain ſhould dictate the neceſſity of taking the precaution of foreign co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation on this head; <hi>if no proſpect of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be thwarted by the danger of ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being known to the Britiſh court;</hi> and if an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire view of all our political relations, ſhall, in your judgment, permit the ſtep; you will ſound thoſe miniſters upon the probability of an alliance with their nations to ſupport thoſe principles. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there can be no riſk in examining what can be concerted with Denmark and Sweden, or any other power, againſt the Algerines. It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Britiſh miniſtry, how productive of perfect conciliation it might be to the people of the United States, if Great Britain would uſe her
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031906_0187_0FEF4400A92416D8"/>
influence with the Dey of Algiers for the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the American citizens in captivity, and for a peace upon reaſonable terms. It has been <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from abroad,</hi> to be the fixed policy of Great Britain to check our trade in grain to the Mediterranean. This is too doubtful to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mcd, but fit for enquiry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the reſtriction in correſponding with the miniſters of Sweden and Denmark, with regard to an armed neutrality, the reader can compare the text with the commentary, and decide whether a miniſter like Jay, who had juſtified the Britiſh in detaining the weſtern poſts, was likely to negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with the northern powers, under ſuch equivocal and tremulous injunctions.</p>
               <p>Another part of the above paragraph, refers to getting the Britiſh miniſtry to obtain the liberation of American priſoners in Algiers. Our miniſter was to tell how productive this ſtep would be of <hi>perfect conciliation.</hi> If the Britiſh had deſired the latter, American ſailors would never have been carried as ſlaves into Barbary. It was publicly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in both countries, that the court of London, by patching up the Portugueſe truce, were the real authors of the Algerine piracies. <hi>Noſtro quoque ſeculo monſtrum.</hi> To ſuch atrocious, ſuch abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed political bloodhounds, whoſe guilt rivals the darkeſt precedent in the records of perdition, the application of this trimming, fawning ſtyle, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly uſeleſs. It was like telling a highwayman how greatly you would thank him for returning your purſe. Jay, if in earneſt, ought to have aſſumed a different tone. <q>You are not only, he might have ſaid, corſairs in perſon, but corſairs by proxy. You have not only accumulated upon our commerce every wrong that Britiſh bucanneers were capable of inflicting, but with a meanneſs and baſeneſs which
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031906_0188_0FEF44A781CFEDA0"/>
no language can deſcribe, you have ſummoned to your aid the dregs of the human race. Till you make reparation, common ſenſe loudly exclaims that no treaty between us can repay the trouble of ſubſcription.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt ſentence of the above extract from Jay's inſtructions, ſpeaks of ſomething as a ſecret, which was in reality known to the whole world. England adhered to the policy of checking, not merely <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican trade in grain to the Mediterranean,</hi> but Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican trade in every commodity to every quarter of the world. Lord Sheffield had even wrote a book, extremely popular in England, wherein he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that protection from <q>the powers of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</q> ſhould not be granted by England to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican commerce. This was, in other words, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending that theſe robbers ſhould be turned looſe upon us, at the firſt opportunity. When Jay went to England, Lord Sheffield, the apoſtle of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was high in the confidence of Mr. Pitt, ſo that the conduct of the latter was merely an illuſtration of the principles of the former. Yet our Executive ſpeaks, in the inſtructions, as if this news had been conveyed by ſome ſecret channel, though the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and practice of the Britiſh miniſtry were alike notorious. Nay, Mr. Tench Coxe had wrote an anſwer to Sheffield, and in particular to this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine plan, ſeveral years before Mr. Jay went to England. Thus our Executive might have found full evidence as to <hi>the fixed policy of Britain,</hi> in the ſtore of every bookſeller in Philadelphia. The next part of the inſtructions is in theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Such are the outlines of the conduct which the Preſident wiſhes you to purſue. He is aware that at this diſtance, and during the preſent inſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of public events, he cannot undertake to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rules which ſhall be irrevocable; you will,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031906_0189_0FEF440270FFDE78"/>
therefore, conſider the ideas herein expreſſed, as amounting to <hi>recommendations only,</hi> which, in your diſcretion you may modify, as ſeems moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the United States, except in the following caſes, which are <hi>immutable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That, as the Britiſh miniſtry will doubtleſs be ſolicitous to detach us from France, and may, probably, make ſome overtures of this kind; you will inform them that the government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States will not derogate from our treaties and engagements with France, and that experience has ſhewn that we can be honeſt in our duties to the Britiſh nation, without laying ourſelves under any particular reſtraints as to other nations; and,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no treaty of commerce be concluded, <hi>contrary to the foregoing prohibition.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>This extract concludes the inſtructions. A ſhort analyſis will evince that they are not remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for perſpicuity. We ſhall begin at their outſet, and attempt a ſhort ſketch of their merits.</p>
               <p>The firſt object ſtated in the inſtructions is, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain redreſs for the piracies, or, as the paper terms it, <q>for the <hi>vexations</hi> and <hi>ſpoliations</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on our commerce.</q> The moſt atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of theſe vexations was the impreſſment of American ſeamen; yet, in the whole text of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, of which about five-ſixths have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly cited, nothing diſtinct or deciſive is ſaid on that point. We have inſerted above, an entire copy of the whole nineteen articles upon which Mr. Jay was authoriſed to found a commercial treaty. In theſe, nothing levels at the practice of impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs it can be implicated under the general phraſe, "as to the ſafety of neutral commerce," and <q>
                     <hi>reſtricting</hi> the opportunities of vexations in viſiting veſſels.</q> Reſtriction is one thing, and prohibition is another; ſo that even if impreſſment
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031906_0190_0FEF442142A34EE8"/>
had been really implied, the language was too vague and equivocal for the object. The treaty, as it now ſtands, contains not one ſingle word about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of American ſeamen. After Grenville and Jay had almoſt finiſhed the articles of this paper, Jay ſent a note to the Britiſh miniſter, containing eighteen corrections, or additions, that had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him. Only one of them, viz. the ſixteenth, deſerves publication here. It is in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>An article ought to be added, to prevent the impreſſment of each other's people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this clauſe, the anſwer was thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lord Grenville can ſee no reaſon whatever, why ſuch an article ſhould not be added.</q> No farther notice was taken by Mr. Jay of the buſineſs. As to the authenticity of this ſingular correſpondence, it has been firſt had from a member of the Houſe of Repreſentatives of laſt Congreſs, who read it when lying on the table of the Senate, and the ſubſtance of it was publiſhed, laſt fall, in <hi>Britiſh Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Humanity.</hi> It was ſince repeated to the author by a member of the Senate. As for the merit of our envoy, in this caſe, a thouſand volumes of diplomatic hiſtory would not furniſh ſuch another inſtance of negligence in the duty of office.</p>
               <p>The inſtructions next obſerve, that the debts due to England are to be <q>put <hi>outright</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In paſſing, one cannot fail to admire the claſſical ſtyle of our cabinet.</note> in a diploma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic diſcuſſion, as being certainly of a judicial na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be <hi>decided by our courts.</hi>
                  </q> Inſtead of this Mr. Jay erected an arbitrary board of five commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. Thus American debtors were, with one daſh of his pen, deprived of the right of a trial by jury. The Preſident and Senate ratified this breach of juſtice and of law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:031906_0191_0FEF43CC52A29D58"/>The inſtructions likewiſe ſay, that <q>the Britiſh government, having denied the abetting of the Indians, <hi>we muſt, of courſe, acquit them.</hi>
                  </q> On the ſame principle, an American debtor, denying his debt before the five commiſſioners, they <hi>muſt, of courſe, acquit him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Jay was alſo to conſider, <q>the inexecution and infraction of the treaty, as ſtanding on diſtinct grounds from the vexations and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations; ſo that no adjuſtment of the former, is to be <hi>influenced by the latter.</hi>
                  </q> The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral face of the treaty plainly ſets off the debts due to Britain, againſt the detention of the weſtern poſts, and the piracies in the Weſt-Indies. The public have been ſufficiently tired with harping upon Jay's treaty; but the buſineſs of compenſation ſtands at preſent as follows. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that American merchants recover their dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a Britiſh court of admiralty, they are not to receive immediate payment. The Britiſh claims on American debtors are to be held up as a counter-poiſe; and, when the balance ſhall be ſtruck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two claſſes of claims, the Britiſh expect and ſay, that ſeveral millions of dollars will be found in their favour. This extraordinary mode of compenſation for piracy, was related by a perſon high in office in the Britiſh ſervice, to a Senator of the preſent Congreſs, from whom the account is here given.</p>
               <p>We now come to the queſtion, <hi>whether Mr. Jay broke his inſtructions?</hi> A few literal citations from them will decide this point. On p. 176, there has already been quoted a paragraph beginning thus: <q>but if a treaty of commerce cannot be formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a baſis as advantageous as this, YOU ARE NOT TO CONCLUDE OR SIGN ANY SUCH, it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</q> &amp;c. The whole paragraph is ſomewhat
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031906_0192_0FEF44046B7C7628"/>
confuſed, but it clearly enjoins a prohibition upon Mr. Jay of ſigning any treaty, unleſs he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an agreement to the whole of his own terms, which the Executive, as above, ſays, <hi>could not be expected.</hi> Thus we have one ſtep.</p>
               <p>A ſubſequent paſſage already quoted, has theſe words: <q>you will therefore conſider the ideas herein expreſſed, as amounting to <hi>recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations only,</hi> which in your diſcretion you may modify, as ſeems moſt beneficial to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, except in the two following caſes, which are IMMUTABLE.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The two caſes are above inſerted. One of them is, <q>that no treaty of commerce be concluded or ſigned, contrary to the foregoing prohibition.</q> Theſe are the cloſing words of the inſtructions; and hence they muſt be regarded as explanatory of what goes before them. The preceding prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition can only allude to that paſſage where Mr. Jay is forbidden from ſigning a treaty, unleſs he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained every thing on his own conditions. The intermediate reference to his <hi>diſcretion</hi> is inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checked by the prohibition of ſigning. The caſe may then be reduced to three points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. Jay was prohibited from ſigning a treaty unleſs <hi>on certain terms,</hi> that were not within the compaſs of expectation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. Jay ſigned a treaty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So far from obtaining the terms required, he agreed to a treaty almoſt entirely the reverſe of them. For inſtance, <hi>Free ſhips to make free goods</hi> is inverted. The ſecurity of emigrant manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers is unnoticed. No admiſſion is obtained to Britiſh fiſhing grounds. In the caſe of an Indian war, we have no reſtriction of military ſupplies from Britain to the ſavages. The free export of arms and military ſtores is forbidden, in time of
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031906_0193_0FEF44128BA70C28"/>
war, for the eighteenth article of the treaty declares them contraband. Thus, out of the eighteen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions above quoted, the third, fifth, ſixth, ninth, and ſixteenth, are either neglected or contradicted; and other infractions, of an inferior nature, may readily be found. But, paſſing by ſuch trite mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, we proceed at once to the two capital points of <hi>ſecurity to American commerce</hi> and of <hi>avoiding all cauſe of offence to France.</hi> As to the firſt, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh continue at this day (June 19th, 1797,) to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though two years and ſeven months have paſt over ſince Mr. Jay ſigned his treaty. With regard to the ſecond, the French were, from the firſt, highly and reaſonably exaſperated at the conditions of the treaty, and a war with that republic is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the conſequence.</p>
               <p>Thus, in all their material parts, Mr. Jay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his powers. We aſked for a fiſh, and he gave us a ſerpent. It has been whiſpered that a ſecond ſet of inſtructions were tranſmitted to our envoy. They were never laid before the Senate, and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that, if they really exiſted, which is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubtful, the Senate knew nothing about them. They can form no part of our envoy's vindication, unleſs he ſhall chuſe to produce them.</p>
               <p>The tenth article, as to the injuſtice and impolicy of ſequeſtrating Britiſh debts, was written, as it now ſtands, by Mr. Jay. This evinces, if evidence were wanting, that the whole affair was an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of party.</p>
               <p>We have now aſcertained that Mr. Jay treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his orders. The next queſtion is, by what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives he could be induced to do ſo? In this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it has been the cuſtom to hold up Americans as a race of ſuperior beings, and from that theory the reſult is, that, for Grenville to purchaſe our federal envoy, was impracticable. But the tenth article of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031906_0194_0FEF441FA9C80B80"/>
the treaty, by an expreſs implication, arraigns Mr. Dayton and a conſiderable party in Congreſs, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating an act of injuſtice. Camillus, alſo<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra, chap. IV.</note>, in all the plenitude of his eloquence, can find <hi>no powers of language</hi> equal to the baſeneſs of the Daytonian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>From theſe eſtimates of American purity, every man will make what inference he thinks fit, as to the probable ſale of our treaty. Speaking of this country, Thomas Paine has indeed told us that <q>the <hi>innocence of her character,</hi> that won the hearts of all nations in her favour, may, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years hence, ſound like a romance; her <hi>inimitable virtue,</hi> as if it had never been<note n="†" place="bottom">Paine to Waſhington, p. 8.</note>.</q> At the date of only ten years, from writing of the above ſentence, the tale ſounds not like a romance, to be ſure, but very like an untruth. It forms a part of that empty blabbing of national vanity, which has been remarked among every race of mankind, from Greenland to Cape Horn. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out launching into the ocean of the revolutionary virtue of the United States, let us hear what the Aſſembly of Georgia have to ſay about its ſituation, in 1796. The picture makes an intereſting part of the hiſtory of that year.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031906_0195_0FEF44184361B900"/>
the ſaid Grindat, underſtood it was worthy our notice; for Mr. Thomas Wylly, a Senator from Eſſingham county, had told the ſaid Grindat, that he, the ſaid Wylly, could have eight or ten negroes for his part: and the deponent further ſaith, that, on the ſame day, in the afternoon, the ſaid Thomas Wylly, came into the lobby of the houſe, and beckoned to the deponent, who followed him out, when the converſation commenced about the <hi>Yazoo act;</hi> that at the ſame time, a Mr. Deniſon came by, and aſked what we were upon. The ſaid Wylly anſwered, the land buſineſs; the ſaid Deniſon then came up, and Wylly withdrew; that Deniſon then told the deponent, that he did not pretend to adviſe any member to be in favour of ſelling the land, but that thoſe who were in favour of ſelling it, were <hi>handſomely provided for,</hi> and that if the deponent thought proper to be in favour of ſelling, that <hi>he ſhould have part;</hi> and that the ſaid Deniſon ſaid, that he was a purchaſer of ſuch of the member's parts, as had a mind to ſell, but underſtood that ſome of the members pretended to aſk eight and ten negroes for a ſhare, or their ſhares; he ſaid he could not give ſo much, but the deponent might depend he would purchaſe: the deponent further ſaith, that, previous to any of the before recited circumſtances, Mr. William Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, one of the members of the ſaid legiſlature, frequently called on the deponent, and aſked why he was not in favour of ſelling the weſtern lands, who anſwered, he did not think it right to ſell to companies of ſpeculators. The deponent at this time, wiſhed to make further diſcovery of the conduct of the members on that ſale, and therefore affected to be inclined to come into the meaſure, and, by that means, kept up a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation about it occaſionally; that on the day the bill received its firſt reading, before the houſe convened, ſaid Longſtreet ſpoke to the deponent to get his approbation to the ſale. The deponent aſked him to ſhew him what ſecurity the members had of the purchaſe, when the ſaid Longſtreet preſented a certificate, entitling the bearer to two ſhares of twenty-five thouſand acres each, ſigned by <hi>Nathaniel Pendleton, chairman.</hi> The deponent then told the ſaid Longſtreet, that that was not what he had formerly told him was a member's ſhare; for the ſaid Longſtreet had before ſaid, a member's ſhare was <hi>ſeventy-five thouſand acres.</hi> That the ſaid Longſtreet, then told the deponent if he would wait a few minutes, or an hour, he would bring him another certificate from <hi>Gunn's company,</hi> for the ſame number of acres. That the deponent
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031906_0196_0FEF44065B4C9620"/>
in order to diſengage himſelf from the converſation, then ſaid the ſecurity was not ſufficient to entitle him to the land. That the ſaid Longſtreet then told the deponent that if he was not ſatisfied with the certificates, he would give him one thouſand dollars for it, or for them. The deponent then preſented the certificates to the ſaid Longſtreet, and went into the houſe, which was the laſt interview he had on the ſubject. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent further ſaith, that the ſhares offered him as aforeſaid, were expreſsly deſigned to induce him, the deponent, to vote for the bill for diſpoſing of the weſtern territory.</p>

               <p>The above depoſition is one of thoſe publiſhed by the legiſlature of Georgia, reſpecting the Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoo buſineſs. It was happy for America, that, in June, 1795, the terreſtrial ſpeculations of general Gunn did not prevent his attendance at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia as a ſenator. An abſence ſo fatal would have deprived this continent of the Britiſh treaty, for which he voted, of that maritime ſecurity which now conſtitutes the pride of the ſeaman, and of that compenſation <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> which now cracks the coffers of the merchant<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Even if the Britiſh government could preſerve its exiſtence, this boaſted compenſation would be a very remote object. It is amuſing to hear people yet ſay, that, after a peace with the emperor, Britain will ſtill maintain her ſupremacy at ſea. France, in the firſt place, can exclude her manufactures from every country in Europe, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, perhaps, excepted. This cuts off three-fourths, at leaſt, of Britiſh commerce, and one-half of her revenue. Second, Other objects being out of the way, France will turn her chief attention to her navy, which, in a ſhort time, may rival that of England, as it nearly did in the laſt war. Third, The exploſion of paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the reduction of revenue, will ſoon diſable England from maintaining a navy, equal to what ſhe ſupports at preſent. Fourth, France has, in arms, ten or twelve hundred thouſand men. A great number of them are proprietors in the national domains. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may be employed upon canals and other public works. But, for the internal tranquility of the republic, myriads muſt be diſcharged upon ſome foreign enterpriſe. England will moſt likely be the ſcene of action, and a leſſer effort than that which conquered Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, would convert her into a French province. Though the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral party in Congreſs cannot ſee the danger of this event, yet Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Young, and Edmund Burke, perceive it very diſtinctly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TO commence this chapter, a few additional ſpecimens of Britiſh amity are inſerted. A letter from captain Thorndike Deland, dated King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, 1ſt of April, 1796, to a merchant in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, contains, for publication, a liſt of twelve American veſſels taken and carried into that port. Captain Deland farther ſays, that he had heard of
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031906_0198_0FEF440E568A3F98"/>
twenty-ſeven other ſhips at Tortola, which were in jeopardy. He informs, that all Americans, when carried into Kingſton, were, after examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, turned aſhore, without proviſion for their ſupport. Any one having concern in a houſe, or having even a factor at St. Domingo, or any French port, was deemed a Frenchman, and his property was, on that account, condemned. On the 21ſt of April, 1796, the ſchooner William and Mary, captain Shaw, arrived at Portſmouth, New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, in thirty-eight days from Kingſton. When he left that place, the impreſſment of American ſeamen had not ſubſided. On the 5th of May, the ſchooner Mermaid, captain Tabet, arrived from the Mole, at New-York. His mate, a native Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, was preſſed by the Regulus. Several other Americans were, at the ſame time, preſſed from different veſſels. The Mermaid had ſailed from New-York, with a load of timber, on account of the Britiſh government.</p>
               <p>The Minerva, of the 13th of April, expreſſes ſurpriſe, that, if all the accounts of impreſſments were true, they had little or no effect in deterring American ſeamen from entering into the ſervice. <q>In a full public meeting of merchants, in this city, laſt week, ſays Webſter, the queſtion was aſked, whether the Britiſh impreſſments had operated to diſcourage ſeamen from entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſervice? The reply was, that no ſuch effect had been perceived.—If ſeamen do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, how happens it <hi>[that]</hi> printers take up their cauſe <hi>with ſo much zeal?</hi>
                  </q> Seamen do complain, of which the numerous details in this volume, and which are not, perhaps, a twentieth part of the whole, compoſe an ample atteſtation. But a common ſeaman has more difficulty in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his profeſſion, than almoſt any other perſon.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031906_0199_0FEF4410016C3648"/>
This explains the general adherence to it, even in ſpite of Britiſh crimping. Webſter is angry at printers for taking up the cauſe of ſeamen with <hi>ſo much zeal.</hi> But, if they are not to be defended with ardour, upon what point ſhould zeal be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited? If circumſtances require it, the preſſes of America will continue to remonſtrate againſt ſuch wrongs, when the bones of Webſter ſhall be as rotten as his heart. As to the query ſtarted in the mercantile meeting, the members would have gained more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by ſubſcribing to form a fund for the relief of ſuch ſeamen, or the families of ſuch ſeamen, as might be impreſſed while in their ſervice. This would have been acting like men. It would have been acting like ENGLISHMEN; for, at London or Liverpool, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of that kind would, under a ſimilar ſituation, have been adopted. But, in the United States, it ſeems that, if a merchant can only ſave himſelf, he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly indifferent, what becomes of the people in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>A Charleſton newſpaper, of the 8th of April, 1796, contains the copy of a ſentence paſt by judge Green, of Bermuda. It is dated the 6th of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary preceding, and reſpected the brig Fame. In ſummer, 1795, the Fame ſailed from Charleſton, for Bourdeaux. On her return ſhe was captured, and taken into Bermuda. The veſſel and cargo were both American property. But one of the owners, who went along with her, had ſtaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, in France, to diſpoſe of ſome remaining part of her cargo. This accident, in the eyes of Green, transformed him into a French citizen, and, on that pretence, both ſhip and loading were confiſcated. Thus the Britiſh went on in the Weſt-Indies, while Mr. Bayard was tranſmitting to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia his important aſſurances about indemnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſentment of the London Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty at the decrees of Green.</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:031906_0200_0FEF453B29C1A6C8"/>Reader! unleſs you are a Britiſhtory, or the Britiſh editor of the Columbian Centinel, or Harriſon Gray Otis, or Robert Goodloe Harper, or ſome other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of their caſt, who is fitter for a work-houſe than a ſtate-houſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>During the preſent ſeſſion, the ſpeaker has ſignified in the houſe, that Harper ſpoke like a MADMAN. This juſtifies the text. The following traits will help to conjecture in what way congreſſional bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs hath ſometimes been conducted.</p>
                     <p>Previous to the election of a clerk for the Repreſentatives, in the preſent Congreſs, (Supra, chap. 3d,) Dr. Smith convened his party without doors, and they agreed in the nomination of a candidate to oppoſe Mr. Beckley. Next morning the votes were taken by ballot. The republican members had each to write the name of their candidate; but the friends of <hi>order</hi> pulled theirs ready written out of their pockets. As great part of them could know nothing of Mr. Beckley but by name, this promptitude ſhews the exactneſs of their diſcipline, and what praiſe is due to the diligence of our legiſlative Martinet.</p>
                     <p>In the Senate, matters proceed ſtill more ſtraightly. For inſtance, a few weeks ago, five reſolutions were moved in that body, and it was agreed to ballot, next day, for committees upon each of them. The federal majority conſiſted of ſeventeen; and ſo nicely had matters been aſcertained without doors, that the five committees, having each three members, were elected excluſively out of the ſeventeen. The minority have no ſhare of influence whatever. They are debarred even from the appearance of it.</p>
                     <p>Compare this plain account with the plaiſter which Mr. Adams laid upon the Senate in his late farewell addreſs. It might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into a few words. <hi>Gentlemen, you are the greateſt legiſlators in the world.—No ſir,</hi> YOU <hi>are the greateſt, and we are confident that you will make us all judges or ambaſſadors, as early as poſſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note>, you muſt revere the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Preſident Waſhington, who, in his laſt ſpeech to Congreſs, diſdained all notice of theſe Britiſh peccadiloes.</p>
               <p>About the 23d of April, Captain Mercer, of the ſloop Ambuſcade, arrived in this port from Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. He brought a liſt of eight American veſſels with their cargoes which were condemned at that place; and of ſeven others which were libelled. One of the latter was a brig from Boſton. Captain Mercer had heard that her captain had died of
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031906_0201_0FEF45AFC28602E8"/>
abuſe which he received from the prize-maſter. A paragraph of the ſame date ſays, that, at Nevis, the ſchooner Andrew, captain Montayne, of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, had her mate and ſeamen preſſed by a Britiſh ſchooner. They were all Americans; and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections. The particulars are related in the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's proteſt, as tranſmitted to his owner.</p>
               <p>Theſe maritime anecdotes are valuable, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of that people, who, in the midſt of ſuch injuries, could wiſh to appropriate for Jay's treaty. It would be vain to look in the hiſtory of England, for any meaſure ſo deplorably deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To proceed in a regular ſucceſſion, to the end of the year 1796, would occupy a large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. At preſent, only three or four incidents of this kind ſhall be added, as they come to hand in the order of time.</p>
               <p>Joſhua Whiting was a ſeaman on board of the American brig Samuel. At Port-au-Prince, he, and four others of the crew, were preſſed by a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh frigate. Three of them, after eleven days, eſcaped by ſwimming, in the courſe of which, one man had the calf of his leg bitten off by a ſhark. Another of them was retaken, received four dozen of laſhes, and was put in irons. Whiting, and the cripple, eſcaped, after loſing their whole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, beſides being cruelly treated. In the Boſton Chronicle, of the 18th of April, Whiting publiſhed a narrative, of which the above is the ſubſtance. Inſtead of voting money for the treaty, Congreſs might as well have voted ſome relief of the poor man who loſt the calf of his leg, under that emblem of abaſement, that contempt of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that nautical DETERSORIUM, the <hi>American flag!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The brig Columbia, and the ſchooner Unity, both of Newburyport, ſailed from Port Lewis, on
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031906_0202_0FEF324BEC94C7E0"/>
the 7th of March, 1796. Next day, they were brought to by the Ganges, a Britiſh ſeventy-four; and a ſchooner, attendant to the ſhip. <q>This ſchooner, ſays the account, is one of <hi>the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pilot boats built in Virginia,</hi> not long ſince, which are all employed as attendants to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh men of war.</q> They were ſent into Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerrat, examined, and on the 14th, diſmiſſed, upon paying forty-four pounds, four ſhillings, and ten pence, as the expence of their examination.</p>
               <p>The ſloop Dove, of New-Haven, in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, had gone on a voyage to the Weſt-Indies. While lying at Antigua, ſhe was boarded by a boat's crew from the Narciſſus, who took away Benjamin Eaſtman. He was a native American, and as ſuch, had a protection. On the 3d of April, 1796, the maſter and mate of the Dove made oath to this fact, at New-Haven. James Smith, maſter of the May Flower, of Norfolk, publiſhed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, dated the 3d of March, 1796. One of his men, an American, was impreſſed at Port Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie, by the Regulus. Captain Smith, himſelf, was kept, for three days, a priſoner, on board of the frigate, and half ſtarved. He left about thirty or forty American ſailors in her. Almoſt the whole of them had protections, and he ſaw ſome of them ſeverely puniſhed for attempting to eſcape. The newſpapers containing theſe miſerable details, are crammed with exulting encomiums on the number of petitioners to Congreſs, in favour of the Britiſh treaty.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, the 31ſt of May, 1796, the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, laid before them, a letter from ten American captains, whoſe veſſels were then lying at Jamaica. Their ſeamen were on board of Britiſh ſhips of war, where they were treated like ſlaves. They ſaid that their

brethren at Algiers were not greater objects of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. Theſe ten captains might as well have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed a memorial, on the ſame ſubject, to any old woman, in any chimney corner on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Congreſs have no fleet, and they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe money to pay the national debt. In this <hi>unparalleled ſtate of proſperity,</hi> what would you have us to do?</p>
               <p>The Aurora of June 2d, 1796, contained a long account of the capture of the Eliza, a veſſel, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican property, by the Britiſh. She ſailed from New-York, for St. Thomas's, and had orders to touch at St. Bartholomew's. She was taken by captain Cochran, of the Thetis frigate. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cargo, a Daniſh ſubject, was ſtript to the ſkin. The ſhip was libelled before the Vice-Admiralty Court at Bermuda, under pretence of being French proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The trunks of the ſupercargo were ſealed up, and he was himſelf thrown pennyleſs out of the ſhip, without a ſecond ſhirt to his back. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and crew were put on ſhore, deſtitute of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Six or ſeven days after the ſhip and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go had been libelled, the cattle were ſold at half their prime coſt, bought in by the agents who ſold them, and ſold a ſecond time, next day, at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable profit.</p>

It was emitted by the ſecond mate of the brigantine Polly, John Boſſon, late maſter. The veſſel was on her way from Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, to Boſton, when the Cleopatra, a Britiſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer, took her. Soon after, the prize-maſter quarrelled with captain Boſſon, and wantonly beat him in a moſt ſhocking manner. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the depoſition. Within ſix days after, captain Boſſon died of his bruiſes. He was only in the twenty-fifth year of his age.</p>

At ſome future opportunity the narrative will, perhaps, be reſumed and completed. In the mean time, theſe inſtances may be compared, by an impartial citizen, with the cenſure beſtowed by Barras, on the government of the United States. He can then attempt to decide, whether Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington had, laſt year, greater cauſe to complain of England, or Mr. Adams, in the preſent year, of France. We ſhall now proceed to examine ſome federal tranſactions by land. In a work embracing ſuch various objects, many points of importance are ſure of being omitted. Still, however, even an imperfect hiſtory, if candid and accurate, is better than none. The facility acquired by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the reſources derived from public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage may, hereafter, furniſh means for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a more regular, and leſs defective, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Among the memorials preſented to Congreſs, in ſpring, 1796, perhaps none deſerved more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that of the ſnuff-makers of this city, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the exciſe on their manufacture. On the 5th of June, 1794, an act had paſt in Congreſs, for levying a duty of ſix cents per pound, upon all ſnuff, manufactured in the United States. As this law did not anſwer the end propoſed, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and on the 3d of March, 1795, another was enacted in its room. By the l4ter, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and forty dollars were to be paid for every ſnuff mill, with ſtampers and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſums proportionably leſs, for thoſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior effect. As a relief to the ſnuff-maker, he received a drawback of ſix cents upon every pound of ſnuff, exported out of the country. The firſt of theſe two laws originated with Mr. Alexander
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031906_0205_0FEF44EFF9AF45E0"/>
Hamilton, then Secretary of the Trerſury. Both of them met with warm oppoſition in Congreſs. Both were, in an eminent degree, abſurd, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and impracticable. Both deſerve to be held in remembrance, as proofs of what ſhocking deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm the legiſlature, even of a free country, may poſſibly commit. They were ſaid to be laws of experiment, by thoſe who were leaſt eager in their defence. But a government has no right of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king experiments in oppoſition to probability, on the property of the public. The memorial was preſented on the 9th of February, 1796, and is in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>THAT whilſt the United States exhibit an univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of public proſperity, and of private happineſs, the memorialiſts feel deep regret and mortification upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once more compelled to addreſs you in the ſolitary lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of diſſatisfaction. They have ſometime ago entered into a ſtruggle to ſupport a ſecond exciſe law upon their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture. Your predeceſſors, the late Congreſs, gave a fair trial to the firſt act, which attempted to levy a duty on ſnuff in proportion to the pound weight. This law, as the honourable Congreſs well knows, operated at once like a ſtroke of annihilation. No exciſe could be paid, at leaſt in the ſtate of Pennſylvania; for, out of ſeven ſnuff-mills, ſix were inſtantly ſhut up, to the infinite injury of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers. Their ſtock lay dead on their hands. Their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers diſperſed, and in many caſes declined to pay the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding debts, becauſe the ſubſcribers, having no power to manufacture ſnuff, were unable to give them further credit. The buildings for carrying on their manufactories, erected at an expence of many thouſand dollars, were at once conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into ſepulchres of American induſtry; and, in the vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031906_0206_0FEF32BFD4F00FC8"/>
to extract a revenue, where every moral and phyſical circumſtance rendered it impoſſible, ſix months of buſineſs and of human life were loſt. Even the ſeventh ſnuff-mill, which actually was entered, never paid any duty.</p>
                     <p>Every feature in the hiſtory of this firſt exciſe upon ſnuff, juſtified the energetic preſage of a gentleman, who was a member of the laſt, and is one in the preſent Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of Congreſs. He declared in his place that the act would terminate not in revenue, but deſtruction. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of his prediction hath been verified by experience, and fully acknowledged and atteſted on the floor of Congreſs. The effects of that memorable ſtatute were perhaps unrivalled, even in the tragical and exterminating annals of exciſe. Like a peſtilence, or a tempeſt, this law blaſted and ſwept before it every bloſſom of induſtry, and had your memorialiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ever ſince entirely unmoleſted by exciſe laws, yet ſome years of good fortune would have been requiſite for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to recover the ground which they had loſt.</p>
                     <p>That, with the deepeſt aſtoniſhment, the memorialiſts have, during the preſent ſeſſion, heard of ſeveral petitions preſented to Congreſs, chiefly as they believe from ſnuff-makers in the eaſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap> ſtates, requeſting the repeal of the preſent exciſe, in order to replace it by the former law for levying the duty by the pound weight. Theſe petitioners have indeed honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented many inſurmountable objections to the preſent law, and which your memorialiſts admit, as well as they do. But it does not follow, that the preſent extremely oppreſſive exciſe on ſnuff ought to be ſuperceded for the ſake of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another ſtatute which is infinitely worſe, and which has already been tried and caſt aſide as impracticable. The ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of both theſe laws, have been fully ſtated in a ſhort hiſtory of exciſe laws, drawn up at the deſire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſpection of a number of manufacturers in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and of which a printed copy has lately been tranſmitted to each of the members of the two houſes of Congreſs, and to the principal officers of the federal government.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt act for an exciſe upon ſnuff, a drawback of ſix cents per pound has been allowed upon the exportation. This drawback was liable to various abuſes. If not granted at all, ſnuff could not be exported after paying an exciſe, and this would tend to depreſs the American manufacturer. But, in order to be entitled to the drawback, it was requiſite to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a certificate of the ſnuff having been duly landed at the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031906_0207_0FEF44F24BC4C970"/>
deſtined port: the chief exportation was to the Britiſh Weſt-Indies, where American ſnuff is contraband, and conſequently it was quite impoſſible to get the requiſite certificates. But farther, nothing could be more eaſy than to make a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded exportation of ſnuff to ſome iſland in the Weſt-Indies, where it was not prohibited, obtain a regular certificate of its being landed, and then ſmuggle it back to this country. Thus one barrel of ſnuff, might receive twenty drawbacks. Such frauds are practiſed every day in Britain. Many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants on the river Thames ſupport their families in ſplendor by drawbacks, procured from their government for imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exportations. Your memorialiſts have been aſſured, that one bale of muſlin, ſuppoſed to be worth five hundred guineas, received in this way a drawback of twelve and an half per cent forty times over, ſo that this bale earned two thouſand five hundred guineas.</p>
                     <p>Traſh of any kind, or even ſand, might be exported from the United States, under the name of ſnuff, and obtain the ſix cents per pound of drawback. Frauds of this kind could not be prevented without a multiplicity of inſpectors, whoſe ſalaries would ſwallow up the revenue.</p>
                     <p>That the eighty-fourth and ninety-third ſections of the Britiſh tobacco exciſe act of 1789, fully ſhew, to what length impoſtures of this ſort have been carried in that country. The former of theſe two clauſes, inflicts a penalty of two hundred pounds, for the mixture of cut walnut leaves, of hops, of ſycamore, or ony other leaves or herbs, with the leaves of tobacco. The injunctions in the ninety-third ſection, againſt mixing ſnuff with other materials, are ſtill more pointed. The penalty of two hundred pounds is levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for mixing with ſnuff, any fuſtick, yellow honey, touch-wood, log-wood, red or guinea-wood, braziletto or Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca-wood, Nicaragua-wood, Saunders-wood or any other ſort of wood, or any walnut tree leaves, hops, ſycamore, or any other leaves or herbs. This ſingular enumeration aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains how far ſuch practices have gone.</p>
                     <p>That there is another material objection to the preſent mode of granting a drawback. The price of different kinds of ſnuff differs very conſiderably, and yet the ſame drawback of ſix cents is granted, without diſtinction, upon all kinds. Richard Gernon &amp; Co. in their petition, ſtate, that the ſnuff which they have been exporting is worth ten cents per pound, beſides the ſix cents of drawback. Thus its value, after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:031906_0208_0FEF32C2B490F478"/>
the duty, would be about one ſhilling and three pence per pound. The memorialiſts are now ſelling ſnuff at two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſix pence and three ſhillings per pound, and were they to export it, a drawback of at leaſt twelve cents per pound would be neceſſary to put them on a level with Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non &amp; Co. who receive ſix cents per pound drawback on an article not half ſo valuable.</p>
                     <p>The memorialiſts, in their publication already referred to, ſtated the poſſibility that the drawbacks for a ſingle manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer might amount to ſixty thouſand dollars per annum, and if a dozen ſuch manufacturers were to be found in the United States, that they would drain the public treaſury of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thouſand dollars a year, a ſum which all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the country could not cover. To the great aſtoniſhment of the memorialiſts, this prediction received a partial fulfilment almoſt at the inſtant when it was made. The revenue deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the mills, entered in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, comes only to eight thouſand three hundred and eighty dollars. On the 26th January laſt, the drawbacks, at the port of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, ſince the new act began to operate, amounted to eight thouſand five hundred and twenty-three dollars and thirty-nine cents, which is already one hundred and forty-three dollars, and thirty-nine cents, more than the total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for this ſtate. Almoſt the whole of this drawback has been paid to Meſſrs. Richard Gernon &amp; Co. who have been only about four months in buſineſs, and within that period, have got back above five thouſand dollars additional, beſides the two thouſand two hundred and forty dollars, which they paid, according to law, for entering their mill. It is not the deſign of your memorialiſts to caſt the ſlighteſt reflection on the conduct of this manufacturing company. On the contrary, if government has laid itſelf open by a law which defeats its own purpoſes, and ſinks a revenue where it expected to raiſe one, the manufacturers are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juſtice, entitled, to take every legal advantage of ſuch an overſight. Nay, they beg leave to ſtate it as a matter of abſolute certainty, that if this law is not repeated, a number of ſnuff-makers will immediately enter into the buſineſs of exportation. They only forbear altering their mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s, and adapting them for the buſineſs, till they ſee whether Congreſs will adhere to the law or not; for the example of Richard Gernon &amp; Co. proves how eaſily a ſnuff-maker, with the requiſite degree of capital and enterpriſe, may take from the public treaſury in the ſhape
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031906_0209_0FEF44F56FE5AC48"/>
of drawbacks ten times as much as he pays into it. Your memorialiſts cannot believe that Congreſs, or indeed any le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative aſſembly on earth, would ſuffer the longer exiſtence of a law ſo pregnant with the moſt prepoſterous and ruinous conſequences. A few weeks ago, Meſſrs. Gernon &amp; Co. preſented to Congreſs a memorial, repreſenting the immenſe expence which they have been at in preparing their mill to grind ſnuff for exportation. Among other details, they ſtate their having, in the firſt four months of their copartnery, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed four hundred and thirty hogſheads of tobacco, and that they are continuing to make large purchaſes of this kind. At that rate, they will, in the courſe of twelve months, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, altogether, twelve hundred and ninety hogſheads. Your memorialiſts eſtimate, that, when grinded into ſnuff, the drawback on this quantity will amount to about ninety thouſand dollars. The company will thus gain, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic revenue, eighty-eight thouſand dollars, the drawback exceeding the revenue in the proportion of forty-five to one. This is a circumſtance perfectly novel in the hiſtory of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                     <p>But further, if this affair is ſuffered to go on in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent way, Congreſs may ſoon expect to ſee twenty other ſnuff-mills working on the ſame plan, and to an equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with that of Gernon &amp; Co.</p>
                     <p>If the government of this country intend, ſeriouſly, and ſteadily, to give a drawback of ſix cents per pound on the exportation of American ſnuff, it is the moſt acceptable and joyful intelligence that your memorialiſts could ever hear of. They will immediately repair their mills, extend their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, and they have not a doubt of clearing, from the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, before the end of a year, twenty or thirty times the ſum which they are to pay into the treaſury. Twenty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers, like Gernon &amp; Co. would each of them thus coſt government ninety thouſand dollars, or, collectively, one million eight hundred thouſand dollars per annum. The original object of the law was ſaid to be a revenue of forty thouſand dollars; there is an equal chance, that, in ſearch of it, forty-five times that ſum will be ſunk. It has been abovementioned, that the drawbacks, within this ſtate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exceed the revenue. The firſt year of this law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires on the laſt day of March next, and, before that time, there will moſt likely be a balance of ſeveral thouſand dollars againſt the revenue, at the port of Philadelphia.

                        </gap>um of perſonal property. Since their publication took place, they have ſeen this doctrine juſtified by an authority of the higheſt nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The new conſtitution of France, in the ſixteenth article of the firſt ſection, lays it down as a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental maxim, that, "as all taxes are eſtabliſhed for the general good, they ought to be apportioned among the taxed in the ratio of their means." Under the head of finances, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in the ſame work, it is declared, "that taxes of all kinds are aſſeſſed among all thoſe liable to contribution according to their means."—Your memorialiſts cannot deny that the word exciſe is to be found in the letter of the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; but they ſtrongly contend, that it is entirely hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile to the ſpirit of that inſtrument. One of the principle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricators of that production, was the preſent judge Wilſon. When the ſubject was debated in the convention of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, he argued that it was neceſſary to give all power to government, but he was certain that an exciſe never would be impoſed, unleſs in the laſt extremity. From the opinion which the convention of Pennſylvania expreſſed of exciſe, at that time, and which the aſſembly of this ſtate have expreſſed ſince, it is evident that they never would have conſented to ratify ſuch a ſtipulation, if they had conceived that it was to become one of the firſt, and favourite reſources of government.</p>
                     <p>That your memorialiſts, cannot help conſidering this exciſe on ſnuff as coming, exactly, under the deſcription of an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> law. They had no contemplation of ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when they built their mills, and gave credit, to ſo great an extent, to their cuſtomers. Their mills would not, at preſent, ſell for one half of the money which they originally coſt, and one half of them are, at this hour, ſtanding idle. This, of itſelf, would be ſufficient to deſtroy any ſet of manufacturers. Your memorialiſts likewiſe beg leave to ſtate, as their opinion, that if the merchants and manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Britain had a liberty of petitioning Congreſs, they could not ſolicit a more favourable mode of conduct for their own intereſt, than perſuading you to trammel, and diſtreſs, the manufacturers of America with exciſes, which do not pay the expence of their collection, which in one ſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

bankruptcy, and in a ſecond, rebellion. They humbly regard it as chimerical to term America independent of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, while we are forced to ſend to England for a coat, and to Ireland for a ſhirt. It is this commercial chain of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence in which Britain has entangled ſo many nations, that conſtitutes the eſſence and ſoul of her ſtrength, and that enables her to bully, to combat, and to rob her neighbours. It is her ſuperiority in manufactures, which has enabled this kingdom to ſubſidize and embattle pirates and cut-throats, in every corner of the world, while ſhe herſelf may be termed a bucanneer of Atlantean magnitude, whoſe graſp embraces the terraqueous globe, and whoſe ſtature reaches from earth to heaven.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, your memorialiſts ardently flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a hope, that Congreſs will ſee the expediency, and even the poſitive and inevitable neceſſity, for an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and complete abolition of the exciſe upon ſnuff made in America. Though ſome ill-adviſed manufacturers to the eaſtward have called for the reſtoration of the act of 1794, the principal ſnuff-makers, in that part of the union, regard it with as much abhorrence, as the memorialiſts themſelves do. To continue the preſent exciſe, and withhold the drawback, would be to prohibit, in a great meaſure, the manufacture of tobacco, the ſecond ſtaple of the continent; and it has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been demonſtrated, that, to continue the law, and the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, in their preſent ſhape, is only to ſquander forty-five dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in a fruitleſs ſearch after one.</p>
                     <p>Your memorialiſts, therefore, earneſtly ſolicit an entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the exciſe upon ſnuff, and they, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>The ſtatute hath been ſince repeatedly ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and, it is ſuppoſed, will never more be put into execution.</p>
               <p>Some people may wonder what the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:031906_0212_0FEF4566C5B8A150"/>
were thinking of, when they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively enacted ſuch ſelf-condemned laws. It is likely that, during the diſcuſſion, ten or fifteen were employed in reading newſpapers, or in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting letters. About as many more might be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate converſation, at the back of the Speaker's chair, or at the windows. General Samuel Smith, who hath ſaved the houſe from many woeful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, is the gentleman alluded to, in the ſecond paragraph of the memorial.</p>
               <p>We now come to a part of the work, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, perhaps, than any other. The freedoms which the federal party have taken with thoſe who differ from their opinions, are univerſally known. The moſt impartial ſcrutiny would determine, that, in the arts of calumny and detraction, their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations exceed, beyond all proportion, thoſe of their adverſaries. In the firſt ſeſſion of the fifth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Mr. Harper has publicly declared to the Repreſentatives, that Mr. James Munroe, our late envoy to France, was guilty of corruption by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign influence. On being queſtioned by Mr. Giles, he has promiſed, in due time and place, to bring evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his accuſation. This example is only one out of hundreds which might be adduced to ſhew that the friends of <hi>order,</hi> for ſuch they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are reſolved to ſet no limits to their rage and their vengeance. Of courſe, they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with that tenderneſs which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to grant.</p>
               <p>Attacks on Mr. Munroe have been frequently repeated from the ſtock-holding preſſes. They are cowardly, becauſe he is abſent. They are unjuſt, becauſe his conduct will bear the ſtricteſt enquiry. They are ungrateful, becauſe he diſplayed, on an occaſion that will be mentioned immediately, the greateſt lenity to Mr. Alexander Hamilton, the prime
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031906_0213_0FEF32CB888A3BC8"/>
mover of the federal party. When ſome of the papers which are now to be laid before the world, were ſubmitted to the ſecretary; when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that they were to be communicated to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Waſhington, he entreated, in the moſt anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious tone of deprecation, that this meaſure might be ſuſpended. Mr. Munroe was one of the three gentlemen who agreed to a delay. They gave their conſent to it, on his expreſs promiſe of a guarded behaviour in future, and becauſe he attached to the ſuppreſſion of theſe papers, a myſterious degree of ſolicitude, which they, feeling no perſonal reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the individual, were unwilling to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The unfounded reproaches heaped on Mr. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, form the immediate motive to the publication of theſe papers. They are here printed from an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted copy, exactly conformable to that, which, at his own deſire, was delivered to Mr. Hamilton himſelf. Not a word has been added or altered, and the period of four years may, ſurely, have been enough to furniſh the ex-ſecretary with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for his defence. In the letters of Camillus, the moſt ſublime principles of action are every where inculcated. But we ſhall preſently ſee this great maſter of morality, though himſelf the father of a family, confeſſing that he had an illicit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with another man's wife. If any thing can be yet leſs reputable, it is, that the gentlemen to whom he made that acknowledgement held it as an impoſition, and found various reaſons for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Mrs. Reynolds was, in reality, guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. An attentive critic will be led to enquire what has become of her huſband, and why the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant innocence of Mr. Hamilton, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the completion of public juſtice againſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who had treated his name with ſuch groſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect?
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031906_0214_0FEF456861CFD688"/>
What a ſcandalous imputation was it for this culprit to caſt upon our ſecretary, that he had gained thirty thouſand dollars by the purchaſe of army certificates, that this fellow could bring him to capital puniſhment, &amp;c. &amp;c.? It is to be wiſhed that Reynolds may ſtill be found, and that, to borrow the words of his friend, Dr. William Smith, the Secretary may come out of this matter, "as fair as the pureſt <hi>angel in heaven!</hi>"</p>
               <p>Before committing the following papers to the world, their editor muſt again beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that they are nothing more nor leſs than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act copies, from atteſted originals, of which Mr. Hamilton, as hereafter ſpecified, has been, at his own deſire, ſupplied with an accurate tranſcript. Some expreſſions uſed by the culprit, Reynolds, are harſh, and convey diſguſt, without adding to conviction. The editor, from averſion to invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, had, on this account, reſolved to leave them out, as well as ſeveral other paſſages, which are of little importance to the main point. But on due reflection, it has been found ſafer, and more adviſeable, to publiſh the whole, even at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being tedious. This precludes all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of mutilation for unfair purpoſes.</p>
               <p>As to the aſperity of ſtyle in ſome parts of the <hi>precious confeſſions</hi> of Reynolds, the painful reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the editor, to the printing of them, has been ſomewhat leſſened, from the volunteer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſeduction, emitted by the ex-ſecretary himſelf. This appears to be about as bad, as any thing which his wretched underſtrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per either ſaid againſt him, or could imaginably have to ſay. A procurer has always been regarded as in the loweſt ſcale of human character. <hi>Mutatis mutandis,</hi> the patron of ſuch an agent can have no ſcruple to become one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:031906_0215_0FEF456AE92AD180"/>Again, the intemperate ſtile of the convivial and confidential communications of our ex-ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, prohibits him from being regarded as any peculiar object of indulgence. For inſtance, he has often boaſted of rceieving letters from Preſident Waſhington, with the word <hi>private</hi> wrote on the back of them, and a croſs drawn over the ſeal. <q>After opening ſuch a parcel, ſaid Mr. Hamilton, what do you think were the contents? DEAR HAMILTON, <hi>put this into ſtyle for me.</hi> Some ſpeech or letter has been incloſed, which I wrote over again, ſent it back, and then the OLD DAMNED FOOL gave it away as <hi>his own.</hi>
                  </q> Mr. Hamilton is not ſingular in uſing this ſtyle to general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington. After the ſquabble between citizen Genet, John Jay, and Rufus King, the two latter ſent a moſt inſulting letter to the Preſident. Randolph adviſed him to reſent it. He had once reſolved to do ſo; but altered his intention, from a jealouſy that the writers were in concert with Hamilton, from whom he could not determine to disjoin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Jay and King wanted to obtain a certificate which Mr. Jefferſon had drawn up, relating to the behaviour of citizen Genet. The Preſident actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave them the certificate, but it is thought that they found it not to their purpoſe; for it was ſuppreſſed, Jay and King alſo got back from the Preſident their impertinent letter; of which, after cooling, they began to be aſhamed. But a copy of it is in exiſtence, and ſome hopes remain of its being obtained for publication. Theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are derived from undoubted authority. They prove what was ſo fully ſtated in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Annual Regiſter, that the federal party deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed the late Preſident; that they took frequent opportunities of inſulting him; and that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the popularity of his name with no view but to ſerve their own ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:031906_0216_0FEF456D81E07030"/>To be the prompter and <hi>primum mobile</hi> of the greateſt man in the world, might have flattered the vanity of a more diſcreet favourite than Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton. To hear the Repreſentatives, as in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1794, diſpute for three weeks upon the wording of an anſwer to a ſpecch of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, muſt have been highly ſoothing to the ſelf-importance of the ex-ſecretary. But, as general Waſhington had been, in the higheſt ſenſe of the word, his benefactor, he ought to have concealed the imperfections of his friend. He has often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his influence over the Preſident to that of the wind upon a weather cock, or of that over an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomaton, moved only by the hand which directs it. This ſtyle was both imprudent and ungrateful. His power was very great, but not entirely unbounded. He wanted to be ſent to England as envoy to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate the treaty. The arguments of Randolph hindered the Preſident from giving his conſent. That the pen of Mr. Hamilton has long aſſiſted the Preſident is a ſtory current in Europe as well as in America; and that the ſpeeches and letters of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington are extremely different from his more early productions is very well known.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude theſe prefatory obſervations with an anecdote. During the late canvaſs for the election of a Preſident, Webſter, in his Minerva, gave a hint, that Mr. Hamilton would be an adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able candidate. A perſon in this city, who chanced to ſee this newſpaper, wrote immediately to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent in New-York. The letter deſired him to put himſelf in Mr. Hamilton's way, and inform him that if Webſter ſhould, in future, print a ſingle paragraph on that head, the following papers were inſtantly to be laid before the world. It is believed the meſſage was delivered to Mr. Hamilton, for the Minerva became ſilent.</p>

                  <p>JACOB CLINGMAN, being a clerk in my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (F. A. Muhlenberg) and becoming involved in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution commenced againſt JAMES REYNOLDS, by the Comptroller of the Treaſury, on a charge or information exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited before Hilary Baker, <abbr>eſq</abbr> one of the aldermen of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for ſubornation of perjury, whereby they had obtained mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the treaſury of the United States, he (Clingman) applied to me, for my aid and friendſhip, on behalf of himſelf and Reynolds, to get them releaſed or diſcharged from the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecution. I promiſed, ſo far as reſpected Clingman; but, not being particularly acquainted with Reynolds, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, declined ſo far as reſpected him. In company with colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Burr, I waited on colonel Hamilton for the purpoſe, and particularly recommended Clingman, who had hitherto ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good character. Colonel Hamilton ſignified a wiſh to do all that was conſiſtent. Shortly after, I waited on the Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller for the ſame purpoſe, who ſeemed to have difficulties on the ſubject; and, from ſome information I had, in the mean time, received, I could not undertake to recommend Reynolds, as I verily believed him to be a raſcal, which words I made uſe of to the Comptroller. On a ſecond interview with the Comptroller, on the ſame ſubject, the latter urged the propriety of Clingman's delivering up a certain liſt of money due to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, which Reynolds and Clingman were ſaid to have in their poſſeſſion, and of his informing him, of whom, and through whom, the ſame was obtained from the public offices; on doing which, Clingman's requeſt might, perhaps, be granted with greater propriety. This, Clingman, I am informed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, and alſo refunded the money or certificates, which they had improperly obtained from the treaſury. After which, I underſtand the action againſt both was withdrawn, and Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds diſcharged from impriſonment, without any farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of mine whatever.</p>
                  <p>During the time this buſineſs was thus depending, and which laſted upwards of three weeks, Clingman, <hi>unaſked,</hi> frequently dropped hints to me, that Reynolds had it in his power, <hi>very materially to injure the Secretary of the Treaſury;</hi> and that Reynolds knew ſeveral very improper tranſactions of his. I paid little or no attention to thoſe hints; but, when they were frequently repeated, and it was even added, that Reynolds ſaid,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031906_0218_0FEF4574E5067460"/>
                     <hi>he had it in his power to hang the Secretary of the Treaſury;</hi> that he was <hi>deeply concerned in ſpeculation</hi> that he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently advanced money to him, (Reynolds); and other inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of an improper nature, it created conſiderable uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my mind, and I conceived it my duty to conſult with ſome friends on the ſubject.—Mr. Monroe and Mr. Venable were informed of it yeſterday morning.</p>

                  <p>BEING informed yeſterday, in the morning, that a perſon of the name of Reynolds, from Virginia, Richmond, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the jail, upon ſome criminal proſecution relative to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, and that he had intimated, he would give ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of ſpeculations by Mr. Hamilton, which ſhould be known, WE immediately called on him, as well to be informed of the ſituation of the man, as of thoſe other matters, in which the public might be intereſted. We found it was not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we had been taught to believe, but a man of that name from New-York, and who had, for ſome time paſt, reſided in this city. Being there, however, we queſtioned him reſpecting the other particular; he informed us, that he could give infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the miſconduct, in that reſpect, of a perſon high in office, but muſt decline it, for the preſent, and until relieved, which was promiſed him that evening: that at ten to-day, he would give us a detail of whatever he knew on the ſubject. He affirmed, he had a perſon, high in office, in his power, and had had, a long time paſt. That he had written to him, in terms ſo abuſive, that no perſon ſhould have ſubmitted to it, but that <hi>he dared not to reſent it.</hi> That Mr. Wolcot was in the ſame department, and, he ſuppoſed, under his influence or controul; and, in fact, expreſſed himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to leave no doubt, he meant Mr. Hamilton. That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be releaſed by Mr. Wolcot, at the inſtance of that perſon, although he believed, that Mr. Wolcot, in inſtituting the proſecution, had no improper deſign; that he was ſatisfied, the proſecution was ſet on foot, only to keep him low, and oppreſs him, and ultimately <hi>drive him away;</hi> that he had had, ſince his reſidence here, for eighteen months, many private meetings with that perſon, who had often promiſed to put him into employment, but had diſappointed him; that on hearing
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:031906_0219_0FEF45785EA3DF40"/>
the proſecution was commenced againſt him, he applied to this perſon for counſel, who adviſed him to keep out of the way, for a few days; that a merchant came to him, and offered, as a volunteer, to be his bail, who, he ſuſpected, had been inſtigated by this perſon; and, after being decoyed to the place, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant wiſhed to carry him <hi>[to],</hi> he refuſed being his bail, unleſs he would depoſit a ſum of money, to ſome conſiderable amount, which he could not do, and was, in conſequence, committed to priſon. As well as we remember, he gave, as a reaſon, why he could not communicate to us, what he knew of the facts alluded to, that he was apprehenſive, it might prevent his diſcharge; but that he would certainly communicate the whole to us, at ten this morning: at which time, we were informed, he had abſconded, or concealed himſelf.</p>

It was, with difficulty, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from her, any information on the ſubject; but at length ſhe communicated to us the following particulars.</p>
                  <p>That ſince colonel Hamilton was Secretary of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and at his requeſt, <hi>ſhe had burned a conſiderable number of letters from him to her huſband,</hi> and in the abſence of the latter, touching buſineſs between them, to prevent their being made public.

ſatisfied, this wiſh for his departure did not proceed from friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to him, but on account of his threat, that he could tell ſomething that would make ſome of the heads of departments tremble. That Mr. Wadſworth had been active in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; firſt at her requeſt, but, in her opinion, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and communication of Mr. Hamilton, whoſe friend he profeſſed to be; that he had been at her houſe yeſterday, and mentioned to her, that two gentlemen of Congreſs had been at the jail, to confer with her huſband; enquired, if ſhe knew what they went for; obſerved, he knew Mr. Hamilton had enemies, who would try to prove ſome ſpeculations on him, but when enquired into, he would be found immaculate; to which ſhe replied, ſhe rather <hi>doubted it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſaw, in her poſſeſſion, two notes; one in the name of Alexander Hamilton, of the 6th of December, and the other, ſigned "J. W." purporting to have been written yeſterday; both expreſſing a deſire to relieve her.</p>
                  <p>She denied any recent communication with Mr. Hamilton, or that ſhe had received any money from him to-day.</p>

                  <p>That his acquaintance commenced in September, 1791; that a mutual confidence and intimacy exiſted between them; that in January or February laſt, he ſaw colonel Hamilton at the houſe of Reynolds. Immediately on his going into the houſe, colonel Hamilton retired. That in a few days after, he (Clingman) was at Mr. Reynolds's houſe, with Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, her huſband being then out; ſome perſon knocked at the door; he aroſe and opened it, and ſaw that it was colonel Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton. Mrs. Reynolds went to the door; he delivered a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to her, and ſaid, he was ordered to give Mr. Reynolds that. He aſked Mrs. Reynolds who could order the Secretary of the Treaſury of the United States to give that? She replied, that ſhe ſuppoſed, he did not want to be known. This happened
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031906_0221_0FEF457A4787BFE8"/>
in the night. He aſked her, how long Mr. Reynolds had been acquainted with colonel Hamilton? She replied, ſome months; that colonel Hamilton had aſſiſted her huſband; that ſometime before that, he had received upwards of eleven hundred dollars, of colonel Hamilton. Sometime after this, Clingman was at the houſe of Reynolds, and ſaw colonel Hamilton; he retired and left him there.</p>
                  <p>A little after Duer's failure, Reynolds told Clingman, in confidence, that if Duer had held up, three days longer, he ſhould have made fifteen hundred pounds, by the aſſiſtance of colonel Hamilton; that colonel Hamilton had informed him, <hi>that he was connected with Duer.</hi> Mr. Reynolds alſo ſaid, that colonel Hamilton had made <hi>thirty thouſand dollars</hi> by ſpeculation; that colonel Hamilton had ſupplied him with money to ſpeculate. That, about June laſt, Reynolds told Clingman, that he had applied to colonel Hamilton for money to ſubſcribe to the turnpike-road at Lancaſter, and had received a note from him, in theſe words, <q>It is utterly out of my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I aſſure you, upon my honour, to comply with your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Your note is returned;</q> which original note, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying this, has been in Clingman's poſſeſſion ever ſince. Mr. Reynolds has once or twice mentioned to Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he had it in his power <hi>to hang colonel Hamilton;</hi> that if he wanted money, he was <hi>obliged to let him have it.</hi> That he (Clingman) has occaſionally lent money to Reynolds who always told him, that he could always get it from colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Hamilton, to repay it; that, on one occaſion, Clingman lent him two hundred dollars; that Reynolds promiſed to pay him, through the means of colonel Hamilton; that he went with him, ſaw him go into colonel Hamilton's; that, after he came out, he paid him one hundred dollars, which, he ſaid, was part of the ſum, he had got; and paid the balance, in a few days; the latter ſum paid was ſaid to have been received from colonel Hamilton, after his return from Jerſey, having made a viſit to the manufacturing ſociety there.</p>
                  <p>After a warrant was iſſued againſt Reynolds, upon a late proſecution, which was inſtituted againſt him, Clingman, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reynolds, aſked him, why he did not apply to his friend colonel Hamilton? He ſaid, he would go immediately, and went accordingly. He ſaid afterwards, that colonel Hamilton adviſed him to keep out of the way, a few days, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be ſettled. That after this time, Henry Seckel,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031906_0222_0FEF457BF6F9D658"/>
went to Reynolds, and offered to be his bail, if he would go with him to Mr. Baker's office, where he had left the officer, who had the warrant in writing; that he prevailed on Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds to go with him. That after Reynolds was taken into cuſtody; Seckel refuſed to become his bail, unleſs he would depoſit, in his poſſeſſion, property to the value of four hundred pounds; upon which, Reynolds wrote to colonel Hamilton, and Mr. Seckel carried the note. After two or three times going, he ſaw colonel Hamilton. Colonel Hamilton ſaid, he knew Reynolds and his father; that his father was a good whig in the late war; that was all he could ſay; that it was not in his power to aſſiſt him; in conſequence of which, Seckel refuſed to be his bail, and Reynolds was impriſoned. Mr. Reynolds alſo applied to Mr. Francis, who is one of the clerks in the treaſury department; he ſaid, he could not do any thing, without the conſent of colonel Hamilton; that he would apply to him. He applied to Mr. Hamilton, who told him, that it would not be prudent; if he did, he muſt leave the department.</p>
                  <p>After Reynolds was confined, Clingman aſked Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, why ſhe did not apply to colonel Hamilton to diſmiſs him, as the money was ready to be refunded, that was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She replied, that ſhe had applied to him, and he had ſent her to Mr. Wolcot; but directed her not to let Mr. Wolcot know, that he had ſent her there. Notwithſtanding this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, ſhe did let Mr. Wolcot know, by whom ſhe had been ſent, who appeared to be ſurpriſed at the information, but ſaid, he would do what he could for her, and would Conſult colonel Hamilton on the occaſion. Colonel Hamilton adviſed her, to get ſome perſons of reſpectability, to intercede for her huſband, and mentioned Mr. Muhlenberg.</p>
                  <p>Reynolds continued to be kept in cuſtody, for ſome time, during which time, Clingman had converſation with Mr. Wolcot, who ſaid, if he would give up a liſt of ſoldier's claims, which he had, he ſhould be releaſed. After this, Mrs. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds informed Clingman, that colonel Hamilton had told her, that Clingman ſhould write a letter to Mr. Wolcot, and a duplicate of the ſame to himſelf, promiſing to give up the liſt, and refund the money which had been obtained on a certificate, which had been ſaid to have been improperly obtained. Cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aſked Mrs. Reynolds, for <hi>the letters</hi> that her huſband had received from colonel Hamilton, from time to time, as he
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:031906_0223_0FEF457F1D023948"/>
might probably uſe them to obtain her huſband's liberty. She replied, that colonel Hamilton had requeſted her <hi>to burn all the letters, that were in his hand-writing, or that had his name to them;</hi> which ſhe had done. He preſſed her to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine again, as ſhe might not have deſtroyed the whole, and they would be uſeful. She examined, and found two or three notes, without any name, which <hi>are herewith ſubmitted,</hi> and which, ſhe ſaid, were notes from colonel Hamilton.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that having heard, that her huſband's father was, in the late war, a commiſſary under the direction of colonel Wadſworth, ſhe waited on him, to get him to intercede for her huſband's diſcharge. He told her, he would give her his aſſiſtance, and ſaid, <q>now you have made me your friend, you muſt apply to no perſon elſe.</q> That on Sunday evening, Clingman went to the houſe of Reynolds, and found colonel Wadſworth there. He was introduced to colonel Wadſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, by Mrs. Reynolds. Colonel Wadſworth told him, he had ſeen Mr. Wolcot; that Mr. Wolcot would do any thing for him, (Clingman), and Reynolds's family, that he could; that he had called on colonel Hamilton, but had not ſeen him; that he might tell him, Mr. Muhlenberg, that a friend of his (Clingman's) had told him, that colonel Wadſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth was a countryman and ſchoolmate of Mr. Ingerſoll, and that colonel Wadſworth was alſo intimate with the governor, and that the governor would do almoſt any thing, to oblige him; that his name muſt not be mentioned to Mr. Muhlenberg, as telling him this; but that, if Mr. Muhlenberg could be brought to ſpeak to him firſt, on the ſubject, he would then do any thing in his power, for them; and told him not to ſpeak to him, if he ſhould meet him in the ſtreet; and ſaid, if his name was mentioned, that he would do nothing. That on Wedneſday, Clingman ſaw colonel Wadſworth, at Reynolds's houſe; he did not find her at home, but left a note; but, on going out, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e met her, and ſaid, he had ſeen every body, and done every thing.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Reynolds told Clingman, that ſhe had received money from colonel Hamilton, ſince her huſband's confinement, enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a note, which note ſhe had burned.</p>
                  <p>After Reynolds was diſcharged, (which was eight or nine o'clock on Wedneſday evening); about twelve o'clock at night, Mr. Reynolds ſent a letter to colonel Hamilton by a girl; which letter, Clingman ſaw delivered to the girl.
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:031906_0224_0FEF45828C530F50"/>
Reynolds followed the girl, and Clingman followed him. He ſaw the girl go into colonel Hamilton's houſe. Clingman then joined Reynolds, and they walked back and forward in the ſtreet, until the girl returned, and informed Reynolds, that he <hi>need not go out of town that night,</hi> but call on him early in the morning. In the morning, between ſeven and eight o'clock, he ſaw Reynolds go to colonel Hamilton's houſe, and go in. He has not ſeen him ſince, and ſuppoſes, he is gone out of town.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Clingman further adds, that ſometime ago he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds, that <hi>he had books contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amount of the caſh due to the Virginia line at his own houſe at New-York, with liberty to copy,</hi> and were obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Mr. Duer.</p>
                  <p>The above contains the truth, to the beſt of my knowledge and recollect on, and to which I am ready to make oath.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Clingman informs us, that Mr. Reynolds returned to town, on Thurſday night, and told him, he had written him a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he then had; not having had an opportunity to ſend it to him, and which he then tore; part of which was thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire. Other parts he preſented to us, and which we now have.</p>
                     <p>That Reynolds, at the ſame time, told him, he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Mr. Hamilton, the morning of that day, when they parted, about ſunriſe. That he was extremely agitated, <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward and forward the room, and ſtriking, alternately, his forehead and his thigh; obſerving to him, that he had ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at work, but was willing to meet them, on fair ground, and requeſted him not to ſtay long, leſt it might be noticed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. Clingman alſo informs us, that he received a note from Mr. Wolcot, to meet him, on Friday morning, at half paſt nine (which note we have). That he attended, and had an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with him, in preſence of Mr. Hamilton; when he was ſtrictly examined by both, reſpecting the perſons, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the matter, and their object; that he told Mr. Hamilton, he had been poſſeſſed of his notes to Reynolds, and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031906_0225_0FEF32CD12E985B0"/>
had given them up to theſe gentlemen: and to which, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he had done very wrong. That he alſo told Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton of the letter he had received from Reynolds, ſince his enlargement, mentioning that he (Mr. Hamilton) would make Francis ſwear back what he had ſaid; and to which Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton replied, he would make him unſay any falſity he had declared.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hamilton ſaid, Reynolds was a villain, a raſcal, and he ſuppoſed, would ſwear to any thing.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wolcot ſaid, that unleſs Clingman uſed the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to him, that he had done to Clingman, he ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelf bound.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hamilton wanted to know, what members of Congreſs were concerned in the enquiry, and deſired him to go into the gallery, where he would ſee them, and enquire their names of the byſtanders.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hamilton obſerved, he had had ſome tranſaction with Reynolds, which he had before mentioned, as well as Clingman remembers, to Mr. Wolcot, and need not go into detail.</p>
                     <p>Clingman alſo informs us, that Reynolds told him, ſince his enlargement, that when he was about to ſet out to Virginia, on his laſt trip to buy up caſh-claims of the Virginia line, he told Mr. Hamilton, that Hopkins would not pay upon thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of attorney; and to which he, (Mr. Hamilton) replied, he would write to Hopkins, on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>16th. Laſt night we waited on colonel Hamilton, when he informed us of <hi>a particular connection with Mrs. Reynolds:</hi> the period of its commencement, and circumſtances attending it; his viſiting her at Inſkeep's; the frequent ſupplies of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to her and her huſband, on that account; his dureſs by them from the fear of a diſcloſure, and <hi>his anxiety to be relieved from it and them.</hi> To ſupport this, he ſhewed a great number of letters from Reynolds and herſelf, commencing early in 1791. He acknowledged <hi>all the letters in a diſguiſed hand, in our poſſeſſion, to be his.</hi> We left him under an impreſſion, our ſuſpicions were removed. He acknowledged our conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him had been fair and liberal: he could not complain of it. We brought back all the papers, even his own notes, nor did he aſk their deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, the diſmiſſion of the proſecution againſt the parties, Reynolds and Clingman, had been in conſideration of a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a liſt of pay improperly obtained from his office, and by
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:031906_0226_0FEF458A47B00C50"/>
means of a perſon, who had it not in his power now to injure the department, intimating he meant Duer: that he obtained this information from Reynolds; owned that he had received a note from Reynolds in the night, at the time ſtated in Mr. Clingman's paper, and that he had likewiſe ſeen him in the morning following: ſaid, he never had ſeen Reynolds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to this place; and that the ſtatement in Mr. Clingman's paper, in that reſpect, was correct.</p>

                              <p>[This is the card referred to in No. IV. being the anſwer to a requeſt from Reynolds, of money to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe for the Lancaſter turnpike. It has neither date nor addreſs; but muſt have been written about the month of June, 1792. On what ground could Reynolds pretend to make ſuch applications to a perſon ſo far above his rank? The gentle tone of the refuſal, alſo, deſerves notice. It expreſsly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a high degree of previous intimacy. The ſimple aſſurance of inability was not enough. Mr. Hamilton declares PON HIS HONOUR, that it is not merely <hi>out of his power,</hi> but UTTERLY, &amp;c. How generous! How magnanimous this language of the ex-ſecretary! eſpecially when he wrote to a being who was in the habit of threatening to bring him to diſgrace. If the ſtatement of Mr. Hamilton, as to Mrs. Reynolds, had been true, ſhe muſt have coſt him, in whole, a ſmart ſum. In No. IV. ſhe ſays, that her huſband had, ſometime before, <q>received upwards of eleven hundred dollars of colonel Hamilton.</q> A ſhare in the Lancaſter turnpike coſt three hundred dollars; and though, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, Reynolds did not ſucceed, yet ſo extenſive a ſcale of application ſhews, that he had been in the habit of receiving, or at leaſt of expecting, to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount. In the ſame number it appears, that Clingman was almoſt an eye witneſs to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, by Reynolds, of a large ſum from Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. No. IV. alſo, ſhews, that Mrs. Reynolds, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the confinement of her huſband, received mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from our ſecretary; and in No. III. when Mr.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031906_0228_0FEF458E761ED7D8"/>
Hamilton wanted to get rid of theſe people, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if they would <hi>leave theſe parts, not to be ſeen here again, to give</hi> SOMETHING CLEVER. By the way, this was not the language of a lover. If the colonel was tired he might have quitted the lady with leſs ceremony. We proceed to the third card.]</p>

                  <p>Here the ſtory comes to a criſis. Reynolds, a man of a bad character, and dependent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, had been caſt into jail for an offence of a very deep dye, and which, as it appears, could have been fixed upon him. Inſtead of comporting himſelf with
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:031906_0230_0FEF4597ED513A10"/>
that humility ſuitable to a ſituation apparently ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, he ſpeaks of nothing elſe but ruining and hanging Mr. Hamilton, who, the Preſident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was the moſt powerful and dangerous enemy that he could have met with on the whole continent. This was not, certainly, an obvious way to get out of priſon. He had been proſecuted by the Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Mr. Wolcot, with whom he found no blame; but he affirmed, that it was a ſcheme of the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to keep him <hi>low,</hi> and <hi>drive him away.</hi> Even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that his wife was the favourite of Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, for which there appears no evidence but the word of the ſecretary, this conduct would have been eminently fooliſh. Mr. Hamilton had only to ſay, that he was ſick of his amour, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hopes of Reynolds at once vaniſhed. Our ſecretary was far above the reach of his revenge. The accuſation of an illicit amour, though ſounded in notes louder than the laſt trumpet, could not have defamed the conjugal fidelity of Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. It would only have been holding <hi>a farthing candle to the ſun.</hi> On that point, the world had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly fixed its opinion. In the ſecretary's bucket of chaſtity, a drop more or leſs was not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, If Reynolds had no claim to regard but in one of the capacities of Mercury, his accuſations and his threats were more than folly. They were ſynonimous to lunacy.</p>
                  <p>Grounding merely on the procuring ſyſtem, the forbearance of Mr. Hamilton is equally inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The natural temper of our ſecretary, where he ventures to exert it, is vindictive and furious<note n="*" place="bottom">See Findley and Brackenridge, <hi>paſſim.</hi>
                     </note>, combining <q>that unuſual mixture of quick feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unrelenting vengeance,</q> which Mr. Hume has marked out as a peculiarity in the character of

                        <p>The feelings of Mr. Hamilton may be eſtimated by the tone of the hireling writers of his party; and ſhew how little quarter he or they are entitled to. William Cobbett, in his Cenſor for March 1797, deſcribes Mr. Monroe as <q>a traitor, who has bartered the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and intereſt of his country, to a perfidious and ſavage enemy.</q> Meſſrs. Muhlenberg, Jefferſon, Swanwick, Giles, Madiſon, Gallatin, Mr. Tench Coxe, and others, are all ſpoken of in the ſame ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous way, without the leaſt regard to truth or decency. What could ail this writer at Dr. Ruſh? That gentleman has long ſince quitted politics, and his philoſophical works are better known and more highly reſpected in Europe, than thoſe of any writer whom the new world has produced, Franklin or Jefferſon's notes excepted.</p>
                        <p>This man does not write at random. His enemies laughed at him for boaſting of intimacy with ſome of the firſt characters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He ſpoke only truth. Not long ſince, Mr. Liſton, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ambaſſador, came down North Second-ſtreet, paſt by the door of his ſtore, looked carefully around him, as if to ſee whether he was obſerved, then turned back and went in. Two days after he was in the ſame ſtore: and, no doubt his excellency derives much improvement from this elegant and dignified connection.</p>
                     </note>. That ſuch a man, or indeed that any man ſhould tamely endure this treatment is in itſelf highly incredible. No tranſient attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as that which the ſecretary alledged that he had, could have been put in the balance againſt his official character; and from the time that Mr. Monroe and the other gentlemen ſaw Reynolds, his reputation was evidently at ſtake.</p>

                  <p>The above letter, cloſes the collection of papers regarding this affair of Reynolds. It only remains to make ſome obſervations; and theſe demand a retroſpect.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the magnitude of the object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, it was highly commendable in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen concerned in theſe enquiries to trace the matter as cloſely as they did. The funding of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates to the extent of perhaps thirty, or thirty-five millions of dollars, at eight times the price
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:031906_0233_0FEF459D23EF43B8"/>
which the holders had actually paid for them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, in itſelf, one of the moſt egregious, the moſt impudent, the moſt oppreſſive, and the moſt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bubbles that ever burleſqued the legiſlative proceedings of any nation. The debt that could have been diſcharged for ten or fifteen millions of dollars, was funded at forty millions.</p>
                  <p>But as the univerſal ſuſpicion and hatred which the formation of this maſs had excited, might, at ſome future period, endanger its exiſtence, the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion act, was brought forward. This law incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the former ſtock thoſe debts contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by individual ſtates during the war. Hence each of them became, for its own ſake, intereſted in the ſupport of public credit which implicated a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the debt eſpecially due by itſelf. Thus the certificate funds were inſeparably embodied with a powerful and popular ally, under the ſhelter of whoſe reputation they might hope for ſome degree of longevity. This artful meaſure was puſhed through Congreſs by the ſame party, who funded the half-crown certificates at twenty ſhillings. But, even in this project, it is entertaining to notice the blindneſs and precipitation of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous guilt. The paper-jobbing junto were in ſuch a hurry to ſhelter their ſpeculations under the wings of the above aſſumption law, that they acted the meaſure in the moſt profligate or bungling manner which can be imagined. Take notice! They pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the public faith for <hi>twenty-two</hi> millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, inſtead of <hi>eleven</hi> millions<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>The accounts of the union with the individual ſtates might have been placed in the ſame relative ſituation in which they now ſtand, by aſſuming eleven millions, inſtead of twenty-two. The <hi>additional</hi> and <hi>unneceſſary</hi> debt, created by that fatal meaſure, amounts, therefore, to <hi>ten millions eight hundred and eighty-three thouſand, ſix hundred and twenty-eight dollars, and fifty-eight cents.</hi>

would have ſettled the claims, if a reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of time, of judgment, or of method had been employed upon it. This work was the very pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of ſtupidity, or knavery, or probably of both. Suppoſe that you ſee a man go into a ſtore, and buy ten ſhillings worth of linen. He receives the cloth, flings down a guinea, and runs away without wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his change. You will infer that he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circulcating falſe money, or has deſerted from bedlam. Yet ſuch is preciſely the <hi>profile.</hi> view of this aſſumption act. It is natural that Dr. Smith ſhould be fond of calling Americans the moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of mankind, when his party have made them ſuch egregious dupes. Thus, the founder of ſome new ſect in religion, while cramming the ears of his diſciples with viſions and miracles, aſſures them that they are the choſen people. In both inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the encomiaſt holds in his eye the very ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. As for the ſtate of public information, it is likely that not more than one-tenth part of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens recollect or have heard any thing of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption act. Not one out of five thouſand people is acquainted with this blaſting blunder, about the eleven millions being funded at twenty-two.</p>
                  <p>This is a profile view of the aſſumption act. But when we look ſtraight into its face, fraud, anarchy, and rebellion, are ſeen indelibly engraved on its forehead. Witneſs the debates of laſt winter in Congreſs, about the balance due from New-York to the union! A ſpark a thouſand times ſmaller, has, before now, involved half the world in conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This act is like an ulcer in the midriff of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican tranquillity. To paint its poſſible effects would require the eloquence of Milton deſcribing the <hi>congreſs</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi>

This inſtitution, and the irreſiſtible influence which it draws after it, afford a ſtriking evidence of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and profound genius of its author. By what clauſe of the conſtitution Congreſs thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves authoriſed to turn bankers, they have not yet informed the public. From any thing which appears on the face of that inſtrument, they had no more warrant for erecting banks than for erecting pyramids. Their plea, that the inſtitution was to be of national benefit, does not form a proper apology. It would have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tell the real motive, which was, that the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a majority in Congreſs expected the ſcheme to iſſue in perſonal advantage to themſelves. The report of Mr. Hamilton to Congreſs, on this bank, promiſed mighty matters which have never come to paſs. But the grand point, the bracing of the funding ſyſtem, has been completely ſecured. The city of Waſhington ſhall be juſt mentioned, as a <hi>quietus</hi> to the honeſt credulity of the Preſident. Millions have been worſe than idly ſunk upon that ſpot, which, if government removes to it, may be ſafely predicted as the tomb of the federal conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all theſe meaſures hath been a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt of eighty millions, inſtead of thirty; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government harnaſſed in a monarchical fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a continent overwhelmed with paper money, with jobs, and bankruptcies, of a nature and ſpecies of infamy almoſt unknown in Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">See, for example, the polite correſpondence between Mr. James Greenleaf and Mr. John Nicholſon, that hath ſo long blockaded the newſpapers. Sometime ago, bills of a merchant in this city were advertiſed for ſale, by auction, to the amount of about four hundred thouſand dollars.

               </argument>
               <p>IN his letter laſt copied, Mr. Hamilton ſpeaks of an <hi>explanation.</hi> He gave nothing meriting that name. The ſhort way to exculpate himſelf was, by confronting Reynolds and his wife, who accuſed him of fraud, with the gentlemen who undertook the enquiry. Inſtead of that, he ſent Reynolds and his wife out of the way, to prevent any ſuch perſonal exculpation. That <hi>he</hi> packed them off, there can be little doubt, ſince the ſuddeneſs of the diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Reynolds can be accounted for upon no other ground. The letter from Reynolds to Clingman mentions a promiſe of that kind, and Mrs. Reynolds
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:031906_0237_0FEF32B2DD4725D0"/>
had previouſly declared, that this was a ſcheme in contemplation. Reynolds could not fly from fear. The proſecution againſt him was cloſed, and his chief reſource for ſubſiſtence had been by applying to Mr. Hamilton. That he was removed, to keep him from a meeting with Mr. Monroe and his friends, bears the ſtrongeſt marks of probability. It may be ſaid, that the infamous character of Reynolds made him unworthy of credit. Taken by itſelf, his teſtimony was, indeed, worth little; but, when ſupported by various circumſtances, it might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more attention. The profligate manners of the accuſer afforded an additional reaſon why Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, if innocent, ſhould have brought him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſince it would have been proportionably a more eaſy taſk to convince Mr. Monroe of his falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But the ſecretary ſealed the importance of the accuſer's teſtimony, by forbearing to produce him to the gentlemen enquiring after him. When perſons of ſo much weight and reſpectability had entered upon this buſineſs, every principle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe called for the cleareſt explanation. In place of that the chief evidence was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and ſent off, while the maſs of his correſpondence with Mr. Hamilton was, by deſire of the latter, abruptly committed to the flames. You will determine whether theſe fugitive meaſures look moſt like innocence, or like ſomething elſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hamilton, referring to Reynolds and his wife, calls this an <hi>abominable</hi> attempt. Granted. But, ſince the meaſures of himſelf and his party, on the affair of certificates, had excited a very general and violent ſuſpicion, and ſince he well knew that the gentlemen who came forward, were ſuppoſed to be in the number of thoſe who entertained it, every motive of ſelf-love, and of zeal for the honour of his partizans, ſhould have prompted Mr. Hamilton to
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:031906_0238_0FEF44AF40C67C80"/>
tear up the laſt twig of jealouſy. In place of ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering teſtimony, he ſhould have courted it. In place of burning letters, he ſhould have <hi>printed</hi> them. Publicity was the only baſis by which he could main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ground that he was in danger of loſing. Yet this was the very mode of defence which he choſe to avoid. When Randolph was arraigned of miſconduct not more culpable than that imputed by Reynolds to Hamilton, he purſued the accuſer to Rhode-Iſland, and obtained a certificate of his innocence, couched in the ſtrongeſt terms. Yet the federal party, with their uſual fortitude of aſſertion, and infelicity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, have loaded him with reproaches, and the bare ſuppoſition of the poſſibility of his innocence, has been ſcouted as the height of effrontery. Put the caſe that Fauchet, when his apocrypha was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, had been in jail, that Randolph, inſtead of bringing him forward had paid his debts, burnt all his remaining papers, and hurried him out of the country. Every friend to <hi>order,</hi> would have been convinced that Randolph was guilty, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Fauchet, that <q>the pool of corruption might putrify in peace<note n="*" place="bottom">Robert Hall, on the liberty of the preſs.</note>.</q> The force of moral or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive teſtimony does not augment or diminiſh, becauſe the party accuſed happens to be for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the American funding ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Some years ago, the late Preſident was attacked in the newſpapers for conſtantly uplifting his ſalary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it became due. Mr. Hamilton immediately prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a reply that filled nine columns of the Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Gazette. Even the very worſt which could be alledged of Mr. Waſhington amounted only to this practice being irregular, improper, and ſuper-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ridiculous from a man who pretended to do the buſineſs of his country for his mere houſhold

expences. The charge of Reynolds wears a more ſerious aſpect. If he was <hi>one</hi> agent for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of certificates, it may well be conceived, though it cannot <hi>yet</hi> be proved, that our ſecretary had twenty others. Phyſician! heal thyſelf. Before Mr. Hamilton prints any farther defences of other people, before he again arraigns one-half of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens as cut-throats<note n="*" place="bottom">See American Annual Regiſter, chap. x.</note>, let him tell us what has become of Reynolds. Let him obſerve that this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative is explicit; and that, under all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the affair, ſilence will be more fatal to his character, than the moſt feeble vindication.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to ſee why Mr. Hamilton, and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have been permitted to reduce America to its preſent diſagreeable condition. When a merchant refuſes not only to balance his books, but vilifies thoſe who adviſe him to do ſo, it requires no ghoſt from the dead, to foretell for what port he is bound. In pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, it is hardly poſſible to find ſuch a fool; but nations are ſometimes actuated by a degree of madneſs to which, in their individual concerns, it would be impracticable to drive them. Of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, America, during the ſhort period of her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical career, has afforded various examples. The people of other countries are ignorant againſt their will. The citizens of the United States appear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten averſe, and even hoſtile to information. Thus, the federal conſtition, highly reſpectable and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as truth muſt acknowledge it to be, was yet an inſtrument <hi>framed in darkneſs.</hi> When the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who made it met at Philadelphia, they began by ſhutting their doors. This clandeſtine appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance exhibited the worſt auguries imaginable of what they were going to do. Though they had to frame a conſtitution, yet, before it could take effect
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:031906_0240_0FEF454142115F88"/>
it was to be ſubmitted, ſeperately, to each of the thirteen ſtates. To aſſiſt the citizens at large in forming their opinions, the ſafeſt and faireſt method was to have debated with open galleries. If the arguments that ſwayed the deciſion of the delegates were well-founded, they might have had the ſame effect on their conſtituents <note n="*" place="bottom">We have not entirely forgot the mode in which the federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was crammed down the gullet of Pennſylvania. When it firſt appeared, the aſſembly were in ſeſſion. A minority declined accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe they had no ſpecial powers to that purpoſe from their electors; and, to prevent its paſſing, they ſeceded from the houſe. The remaining members did not form a quorum. Here they would have ſtuck, but the friends of <hi>order,</hi> alias, a troop of ruffians, with the captain of a very modern frigate at their head, broke into the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome ſeceding members, ſeized them, dragged them through the ſtreets, with one-half of Philadelphia at their heels, and, by main force, projected them into the aſſembly. Thus a quorum was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the conſtitution accepted, in a way which would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced a gang of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es.</note>. But, to immure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the way in which they did, looked more like a Venetian ſenate, a gang of ſmugglers or coiners, than the Repreſentatives of a free people. The long parliament of England would never have obtained the confidence of their party, they could never have overturned royal deſpotiſm, if they had kept their proceedings and debates a ſecret from the world. In England, a ſtate-trial muſt be carried on in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. The ſpirit of the country would not endure the concealment of ſuch a tranſaction. In the courſe of ordinary affairs, the preſent Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons do not ſhut their doors above once in ſeveral years. But the framing of a conſtitution is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more importance than the uſual routine of buſineſs; the Engliſh people would not, on ſuch an emergency, ſubmit to excluſion. The Scots union was previouſly known to be deteſted by all ranks of people; and brought the country to the brink of a revolution. Yet the Scots parliament debated
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:031906_0241_0FEF44F9E4F8A538"/>
with open doors. The acquieſcence of our citizens in the Tiberian privacy of their delegates, has mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a peculiarity in the American character.</p>
               <p>The arrival of Jay's treaty afforded another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſame kind. In London, public impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience would, by ſuch a circumſtance, have been wounded up to the higheſt degree; and the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miniſter muſt have found his popularity inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in an early communication. But at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, there was even a parade of ſecrecy. The treaty reached the Preſident on the 7th of March, 1795. Inſtead of laying it before the public, who were ultimately to bear its conſequences, and who could have made light break in upon every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſuppreſſed its contents from mankind, till the meeting of the Senate. Thirty gentlemen then ſhut themſelves up, like the tranſlators of the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint, as if they had been to act by inſpiration. Without raſhneſs it may be ſaid, that this <hi>ſuperior</hi> branch of government, as Mr. Fenno calls it, did not collectively know as much about commerce, and its foreign relations, as general Smith and John Swanwick. The reſolution of the Senate to ratify, tranſpired on the 24th of June 1795, three months and an half after the Preſident had got the treaty. This long ſuppreſſion did not excite an audible murmur. Nay, after the ratification, the federal party diſplayed ſtill more ſtrongly their manly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of government. The Senate had juſt one member, general Maſon, of ſufficient civility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the public, to ſend a copy of the treaty to the newſpapers. This violated an injunction of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy paſt by the Senate. The federal cat calls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan inſtantly to ſqueak; and, if the general had been forging bank notes, they could hardly have made much more noiſe. Thus the Plymouth reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the 30th of October, 1795, charged him
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:031906_0242_0FEF454D61087390"/>
with "a notorious breach of official confidence<note n="*" place="bottom">Carey's Remembrancer, vol. iii. p. 311.</note>." Inſtead of this language, they ſhould have thanked him for his intelligence. If it had been communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated three months more early, much of the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent bad conſequences might have been prevented. He ſhould, alſo, have printed Jay's inſtructions, with minutes of the notable harangues about the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> of the United States<note n="†" place="bottom">American Annual Regiſter, chap. v.</note>. With open doors, no ſenator durſt have broached a doctrine of ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous attrocity. <hi>The maſter's eye makes a fat horſe,</hi> ſays the proverb. In public affairs, the ſame caſe holds good. The more that a nation knows about the mode of conducting its buſineſs, the better chance has that buſineſs of being properly conducted. This maxim appears very plain; and, in his domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic concerns, every man approves of it. On a great national ſcale, we are the firſt free people who have rejected it, and that is one of the principal reaſons why ſome parts of our federal adminiſtration have ſucceeded ſo very ill. Secrecy is a favourite doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine with our financial Mahomet; and its triumph hath enſured his own.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of the laſt chapter, the word <hi>conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi> has been employed. It ſounds harſhly, but it has been inſerted on the cleareſt evidence, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtricteſt conſideration. To be convinced of an executive plot, for involving America in a French war, we have only to look at a report from ſecretary Pickering to Preſident Adams, and which, on the 22d of June, 1797, was ſent by the latter to Congreſs. The title page profeſſes to ſtate <q>
                     <hi>the</hi> depredations committed on the commerce of the United States ſince the 1ſt of October, 1796.</q> Conſiſtency with this profeſſion required, that, as
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031906_0243_0FEF45504FA64578"/>
much time ſhould have been beſtowed on the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Britiſh captures, as on that of French ones. Apparently grounding on this idea, Mr. Adams, in his meſſage accompanying the papers, hath theſe words: <q>I directed a collection to be made of ALL ſuch information as ſhould be found in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the government.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The report and documents fill about an hundred and ſixty pages. The liſt of French captures is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Philadelphia and United States ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zettes. Of the Britiſh, Mr. Pickering writes thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Captures and loſſes by <hi>Britiſh</hi> cruiſers, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary preſumes, have not been <hi>numerous;</hi> for, citizens of the United States having, theſe three years paſt, been accuſtomed to look up to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for aid in proſecuting their claims, it is not to be doubted, that generally theſe caſes have been reported to the department of ſtate. An abſtract of ſuch as have been communicated, is annexed.</q> Report, p. 5. This liſt amounts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>ten</hi> veſſels. They are diſpatched in <hi>two</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. That of captures by the republic occupies about <hi>an hundred and forty.</hi> As an apology for this diſproportion of bulk, Mr. Pickering, on p. 9, gives a moſt curious reaſon. <q>This examination was chiefly made <hi>prior</hi> to the call of the houſe of Repreſentatives for a report on this ſubject, with a view to aſcertain the number of French cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the circumſtances attending them; and the reſult of the whole is annexed. It is regretted, that the time did not permit a re-examination of thoſe papers to aſcertain likewiſe the captures made by the Britiſh cruiſers.</q> The call of the houſe was dated the 10th of June. The papers were laid before the houſe on the 22d, being at an interval of <hi>twelve</hi> days. As the French liſt had been made out beforehand, the ſecretary had the more
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031906_0244_0FEF44B391308EF8"/>
time to compile the Britiſh liſt. Six active clerks, like thoſe in his own office, could, with great eaſe, have completed the buſineſs in forty-eight hours at fartheſt. Where was the mighty affair of turning over two files of newſpapers for the laſt eight months? With ſome diligence, the whole might have been finiſhed in a ſingle afternoon. In a city like Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, full of public offices, and able tranſcribers, the ſecretary, if he had been in earneſt, could have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected forty proper aſſiſtants, on an hour's warning; and even admitting the Britiſh liſt to be as bulky as the French one, each of theſe auxiliaries would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have found an hour's employment. But the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary himſelf ſays, that Britiſh captures were not <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</hi> Be it ſo. Then it would have taken the leſs time to make them out. Yet it ſeems that, with a ſpace of ten or twelve days before him, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary could not accompliſh this Lilliputian taſk.</p>
               <p>Thus does our ſecretary trifle with the orders of the legiſlature; and Mr. Adams, by the acceptance of ſo abſurd an excuſe, exemplifies the proverb, <hi>like maſter, like man.</hi> But, to be plain with Mr. Picker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch palpable ſophiſtication will not go down. All people know very well why the Britiſh liſt of captures was not made out. It would have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <q>The editors of thoſe two gazettes agree in ſaying, that no great attention was paid to the ſubject, for the purpoſe of inſerting accounts of all the captures which were publiſhed in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other newſpapers; yet the number collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted exceeds three hundred, of which but few eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape condemnation.</q> The Gazette of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States is, and long has been, as much an engine of the American executive, as that of London is to

an Engliſh premier<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtead of trying to turn the ſpeech of Barras into an inſtrument for a French war, Mr. Adams might have bought a ſet of this <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive newſpaper,</hi> and ſent it over as a preſent to the Directory at Paris. For every ſyllable in the whole ſpeech of Barras, they would have found themſelves paid beforehand with a column of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective.</note>. Mr. Fenno, beyond all queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſerted every French capture that he could find. As to the Philadelphia Gazette, the preſent editor has only held it ſince laſt February; and, previous to that time, he knows not how it was conducted. When Congreſs wanted informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was the duty of Mr. Pickering to have looked at a wide variety of newſpapers. But he was well aware, that Mr. Fenno had collected about every thing of the kind. The object of Mr. Pickering is, to inſinuate that many French captures have eſcaped notice. <hi>Yet the number collected ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds</hi> THREE HUNDRED. So long ago as September, 1794, a liſt was publiſhed, <hi>by authority,</hi> of <hi>Britiſh</hi> captures. They were about three hundred and ſixty.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The conduct of the public agents, ſays Mr. Pickering, and of the commiſſioned cruiſers there, has ſurpaſſed <hi>all former examples</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>The perſons alſo of our citizens have been beaten, inſulted, and cruelly impriſoned; and, in the forms uſed towards priſoners of war, they have been exchanged with the Britiſh for French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</q> This is very bad, but the French are only following the example that England, for above two years, had ſet before them, and at this moment continues to give them. When complaints of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:031906_0246_0FEF44FE9ABA6458"/>
were made againſt England, the federal party did their utmoſt to quell the ſtory. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, Mr. Tracy, and others, would gladly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Britiſh impreſſments had taken place, and Webſter wondered why American printers ſhould trouble themſelves about the matter<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra, chapters v. and vi.</note>. This was the uniform language of the whole party.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There have been frequent accounts of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to effect condemnations by bribing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and ſeamen of our veſſels to ſwear falſely; but it was reſerved to theſe times, when offered bribes were refuſed, and threats deſpiſed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to accompliſh the object by <hi>torture.</hi>
                  </q> Report p. 10. American ſeamen have been flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by dozens at a Britiſh gangway. This alſo was torture.

                  </gap>ate French outrages, but merely to prove the groſs partiality of our executive in ſhewing only the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries perpetrated upon one ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulo majora canamus.</hi> If Mr. Pickering has diſplayed groſs partiality, Preſident Adams has not acted, in the ſmalleſt degree, better. On the 23d of June, 1797, general Smith was reciting in Congreſs the ſteps purſued by the friends of order, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a French war. He ſaid, that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive had called Congreſs, and had complained of the French; for the ſpeech did not contain a ſingle word of reference to any other nation. He next recommended the fitting out of frigates, with which he propoſed to convoy American commerce. Our merchant ſhips are to be armed, and, on arriving in a French port, the queſtion is put, <hi>againſt whom are
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:031906_0247_0FEF44BA95B13130"/>
you armed?</hi> The French would ſay, <hi>we have read your Preſident's ſpeech. By theſe preparations, he can only mean to fight us.</hi> Your envoys, arriving in France at the ſame time, are ſure of being turned back again. General Smith farther obſerved, that Dr. Smith and Mr. Harper had avowed the deſign of employing the frigates to force a trade into ports of the Weſt-Indies which the French have juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be in a ſtate of rebellion. Such was port Jeremie. General Smith affirmed, that theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures led directly to war. He believed that gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>wanted to lead us into war.</hi> The member was right; there can be no doubt of it. This aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeſſion of Congreſs hath afforded a whole dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary of evidence. Sir John Brute ſays, <q>every thing I ſee, every thing I hear, every thing I feel, and every thing I taſte, methinks, has <hi>wife</hi> in it.</q> So at preſent with the federal party, every thing has <hi>war</hi> in it. A combination more culpable, more hateful, hath not occurred ſince the age of Cataline or Fieſco.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pickering complains of the French mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating American ſeamen. His party have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Britiſh to impreſs them. In proof of this, attend to general Smith, who is no violent demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat, for he profeſſed in Congreſs great concern, when Mr. Hamilton retired from office. On the 27th of May, 1797, this gentleman ſaid, in the houſe, that members had affected to treat the law for the protection of our ſeamen with lightneſs. It conferred the higheſt honour on Mr. Livingſton, who introduced it. It was oppoſed in both houſes by thoſe who are always combating for an increaſe of power and influence in the executive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Senate mutilated that law, ſo as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it of its moſt ſalutary proviſions. After all, <hi>the Senate refuſed their aſſent to a law for protecting
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:031906_0248_0FEF45522249BD90"/>
American ſeamen from impreſſment, and from being whipped on the bare back at the gang-way of a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh man of war. They refuſed to adopt it, until it was ſo much mutilated, that the executive, to render it in any ſhape effectual, was obliged to enforce it with a ſupplementary part.</hi> Thus far general Smith.</p>
               <p>If this majority in the Senate had been ſelected from the Divan of Algiers, they could not have more completely diſgraced their ſtation. At the ſame time, Meſſrs. Tracy and Harper, below ſtairs, were attempting to deny the reality of Britiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſments; and Webſter and Ruſſel inveighed againſt every one who mentioned their exiſtence. Theſe things are part of a ſyſtem for degrading America into a Britiſh footſtool. <hi>What kind of an</hi> AMERICAN <hi>Senate is that which refuſes its conſent to a law for the protection of</hi> AMERICAN <hi>ſeamen?</hi> The very idea looks ſo monſtrous that one is apt to think himſelf in a dream when he endeavours to revolve it. The circumſtances of their refuſal to concur in the bill, ſtand recorded on the journals of both houſes. The full detail ſhall ſoon be given to the world. The journals of the Britiſh houſe of peers afford no precedent for ſuch horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity. England has hitherto ſtood upon her own legs. Her repreſentatives and legiſlators, though often extremely corrupted, have never been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of ſervility to a foreign nation; and, a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial inſtance excepted<note n="*" place="bottom">In the reign of Charles the ſecond. See Sir John Dalrymple's Memoirs, and Hume's Hiſtory of England, in the lateſt editions.</note>, they have not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to auction for foreign gold. Their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, at leaſt, have not alledged that they ever did ſo; and this forms a ſtrong preſumption of their innocence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Harriſon Otis cants about French impreſſments, and Mr. Harper on the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:031906_0249_0FEF459FAF6B8AA8"/>
of Mr. Monroe, by French gold. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and ignorance, Otis may be looked upon as the lineal ſucceſſor of Samuel Dexter. As for Harper, he is ſaid to be in embarraſſed circumſtances; and, while he prattles about foreign gold, one might aſk him, who pays for the printing of his eternal pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>During the two laſt ſeſſions, it is computed that this gentleman coſt the country at leaſt ten thouſand dollars worth of time, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuperfluous motions, for the ſake of making uſeleſs ſpeeches about them. In the ſeſſion of December, 1796, he repeated one ſpeech, about augmenting the duties on imports, at four different times, in the courſe of little more than a month.</p>
                     <p>He has a very pretty delivery, if any obliging friend would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with a ſuitable ſtock of ideas. If he could be contented with repeating the ſame thoughts not oftener than five times in the courſe of fifteen minutes, he would not ſo barbarouſly drive the members from their ſeats, nor run himſelf into ſo many ſcrapes with the ſpeaker, as to wandering from the queſtion. In an antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Congreſs, when people lived to the age of a thouſand years, one might have found leiſure for hearing him to an end. Our ſpan of threeſcore and ten is too narrow for the torrent of his eloquence.</p>
                  </note>? By land, our intereſt has been as groſsly betrayed as by ſea. This appears from the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement conſtantly given to the defence of the Indian frontier. On that head, the following narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will repay a peruſal.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of November, 1794, Preſident Waſhington, in his ſpeech to Congreſs, has theſe words. <q>Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendſhip been ſpared. The Creeks, in particular, are <hi>covered from encroachment</hi> by the interpoſition of the general government, and that of Georgia.</q> It would have been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for the people of Tenneſſee, if the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had covered them from the encroachments of the Creeks. Reſpecting the behaviour of the Creeks, previous to the delivery of that ſpeech, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation for the preſent work has been derived from two ſources, the public newſpapers, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:031906_0250_0FEF44BC50257028"/>
manuſcript communicated by Mr. Andrew Jackſon, Repreſentative from the ſtate of Tenneſſee in the fourth Congreſs. An examination of theſe details will aſſiſt in aſcertaining what ſort of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Creeks deſerved, and to what ſide the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of protection ought to have leaned.</p>
               <p>The account given in the newſpapers amounts in ſubſtance to what follows. Continual ſkirmiſhes had been taking place for a long time. In one of theſe, on the 13th of Auguſt, 1794, lieutenant M'Clellan, with thirty-ſeven men, had been attacked on the Cumberland path, eighteen miles from South-Weſt-Point, by above an hundred Creeks. He had four men killed, and four miſſing. He likewiſe loſt thirty-one horſes, with ſeveral other articles. A multitude of murders by the Indians are mentioned. Of theſe, it would be needleſs here to attempt a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue. A letter from Knoxville, dated 22d of September, 1794, ſays, that the general aſſembly of Tenneſſee had then been in ſeſſion for ſeveral weeks. They had prepared another memorial to Congreſs with a liſt of the citizens killed, wounded, or taken priſoners by the Creeks and Cherokees, ſince the 1ſt of March laſt, the date of a former ſtatement to Congreſs. The number of citizens was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-ſeven, beſides which the Indians had ſtolen four hundred and ſeventy-four horſes. Theſe thefts and murders had been chiefly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted while a party of the Lower Cherokees were at Philadelphia, giving the ſtrongeſt promiſes of peace, and while major Seagrove, an agent for Indian affairs, was making aſſurances of the friendſhip of the Creeks. The letter concludes with an account of ſome freſh murders which had, at that moment, been received. They were ſaid to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the 16th of September current. Nicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jack and Running Water were two of the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:031906_0251_0FEF45A6448420C0"/>
of the Lower Cherokee towns. They were ſituated cloſe on the ſouth bank of the Tenneſſee, below a place called the Suck. They were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal croſſing-places for the Creeks over the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſee, when they wanted to make war on Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Kentucky. They had co-operated with the warriors of Look-out Mountain, and Will's towns for ſeveral years paſt. They boaſted of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſecurity from their ſituation. They were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on three ſides by mountains, and protected on the north by the ſouth branch of the Tenneſſee. They were alſo formidable by their numbers.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of September, major Ore marched from Naſhville to attack the ſavages. He had with him five hundred and fifty militia, of whom an hundred and fifty were from Kentucky. They arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the bank of the Tenneſſee, oppoſite to Nicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jack, and undiſcovered, in the duſk of the evening. About eleven o'clock at night, a part of them croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the river on rafts, and ſurrounded the town, while another party lay in ambuſh on the oppoſite ſide of the river. The attack began about day break. Many of the ſavages plunged, according to their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, into the water, and having got almoſt to the oppoſite ſhore, the militia in reſerve roſe from their covert, and diſcharged a volley at the fugitives in the river. The victory was compleat. Nine ſquaws and children were taken. About forty or forty-five warriors were killed. Accounts differ about their exact numbers. As no particular detail is offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Running Water, but barely that it was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time with Nickajack, it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they ſtood very near to each other. In theſe towns two freſh ſcalps were found; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others dry, that had been hung up as trophies. Many articles of property were recovered which the militia knew to have been taken from their owners
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031906_0252_0FEF450205AD2000"/>
when killed by the Indians, in the courſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding twelve months. Among theſe were found a number of letters. They had been carried off when the Kentucky mail was robbed and the poſt murdered. In Nickajack was found a quantity of powder and lead, that had juſt been received from the Spaniſh government, as alſo a commiſſion to Braeth, chief of the town, who was among the ſlain.</p>
               <p>The priſoners confeſſed that ſixty Creek and Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rokee warriors had paſſed through Nickajack, only nine days before, on their way to make war againſt the United States. Two nights previous to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Running Water, a ſcalp dance was held in it. Among others, John Watts was preſent; and it was there reſolved to carry on the war with additional vigour. This the white people learned from the priſoners. The towns were burnt, and every thing deſtroyed. Such is the ſubſtance of the newſpaper account. That received from Mr. Jackſon is to the following effect.</p>
               <p>Major James Ore was, in the cloſe of Auguſt, 1794, ordered by governor Blount to march to the diſtrict of Mero, to defend its frontier; and, on the 6th of September, was ordered, by general Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertſon to march to the Lower Cherokee towns, and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is proper for me here to obſerve, ſays Mr. Jackſon, that the Indians inhabiting thoſe towns were daily killing our citizens, and our officers, tranſmitting a <hi>Roſtrum</hi> of the captured, killed, and wounded to the ſecretary at war<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Henry Knox.</note>; and the anſwers returned were, <hi>not to purſue on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count acroſs the Indian boundary,</hi> or carry on any offenſive meaſures againſt the Indians; <hi>conſtruing</hi> the word offenſive to be an act of croſſing the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:031906_0253_0FEF4542F9CBB720"/>
Indian boundary in the purſuit of depredating parties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Major Ore obeyed the orders of general Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He marched to Nickajack and Running Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſwept them with the beſom of deſtruction, and killed about thirty warriors. It is neceſſary here to ſtate ſome facts. The night before major Ore made the attack on Nickajack, the Indians held the ſcalp dance over two freſh ſcalps, which they had taken on the frontier. Ore had purſued the track of this party. On the very day that he made the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack twenty-two Indians fell upon the ſtation of the widow Hays, killed one man, and wounded three; and the evening before, they had burnt captain John Donelſon's ſtation. At the time that general Robertſon iſſued the order to Ore, he had infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of an intended <hi>general</hi> attack, contemplated on that frontier. This was well ſubſtantiated, and the expedition of Ore was the only circumſtance which prevented it, and eſtabliſhed peace on the frontier.</p>
               <p>The pay of theſe troops hath been ſuſpended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they croſſed the Indian boundary, although they preciſely purſued the orders given by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Robertſon. The muſter and pay roll's were, in the latter end of the year 1794, depoſited with colonel David Henly, agent of the war de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment at Knoxville. Governor Blount, in 1794, tranſmitted to Mr. Knox general Robertſon's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, authorizing and commanding the expedition, and on the 19th of December of that year this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was laid before Congreſs. Yet though frequent applications have been made at the office of the ſecretary at war for payment, they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been refuſed. After a delay of more than two years, Mr. Jackſon, in the laſt ſeſſion of the fourth Congreſs, has applied to Mr Pickering to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031906_0254_0FEF4506531B4410"/>
recover the neceſſary papers, that he might lay the ſubject before the Houſe of Repreſentatives. <q>I am informed by him, ſays Mr. Jackſon, that he knows <hi>nothing of the buſineſs.</hi>
                  </q> Here the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtood, on the 22d of February, 1797.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackſon further adds that this is not a ſingle inſtance. In 1794, major Thomas Johnſton com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a party of Tenneſſee militia who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to purſue a gang of Indians. The latter had murdered colonel John Montgomery, and the Titſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth family. In the purſuit, they croſſed into the Kentucky territory. Colonel H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly gave that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſuſpending their pay. Theſe were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two parties of Tenneſſee militia, whoſe arrears have not been paid up, excepting thoſe comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the appropriation act for 1797.</p>
               <p>Many parts of the union lie beyond the reach of public information. The country newſpapers are commonly very barren. To remedy this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, ſome members of Congreſs ſend printed circular letters to their conſtituents on the exiſting condition of the political world. Mr. Samuel J. Cabell, of Virginia, tranſmitted two of ſuch letters. One of them was dated the 11th, and the other the 23d of January, 1797. They contained nothing uncommon. They mentioned the brilliant and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible progreſs of the French arms, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate chagrin which had taken place between France and the United States, and the deplorable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that would enſue to this country from an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rupture. Mr. Pickering's letter to Pinckney was referred to as more likely to promote than prevent a French quarrel. Mr. Cabell expreſſed his regret at the election of Mr. Adams as Preſident, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as a conſolation, that of Mr. Jefferſon.</p>
               <p>On the 22d of May, 1797, judge Iredell, of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral court, delivered a charge at Richmond to the
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:031906_0255_0FEF4509432E25E0"/>
grand jury, for the diſtrict of Virginia. It conveyed encomiums on the government, and a ſtrong recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of confidence in it. The jury immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gave in the following preſentment.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We, of the grand jury of the United States for the diſtrict of Virginia, preſent, as a real evil, the circular letters of ſeveral members of the late Congreſs, and particularly letters with the ſignature of Samuel J. Cabell, endeavouring, at a time of real public danger, to diſſeminate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded calumnies againſt the happy government of the United States, and thereby to ſeparate the people therefrom; and to increaſe or produce a foreign influence, ruinous to the peace, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and independence of theſe United States.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The jurors themſelves were evidently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting calumny. The phraſe of <hi>ſeveral members</hi> was caſting their ſtink-pot in the dark. As to Mr. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, they ſhould have ſpecified the calumnies. When the grand jury of Chatham county, Georgia, arraigned judge Wilſon as a land-jobber, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended on matters notoriouſly true<note n="*" place="bottom">It was upon the queſtionable evidence of this judge, that the preſident declared the four weſtern counties of Pennſylvania to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> a ſtate of inſurrection.</note>. When a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of Maryland cenſures judge Chaſe, he begins with a hiſtory of the bankrupt law. If Mr. Cabell declared his diſſatisfaction at the election of Mr. Adams, one half of the American citizens were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame. This did not produce the ſmalleſt confuſion or embarraſſment on the ſide of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is unfortunate for the union, that Mr. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell had ſo much foundation for regret. The out-ſet of the new Preſident has been marked by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to hurry his conſtituents into an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary war, while ſecretary Pickering has been wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſecretary Wolcot has been encouraging

others to write invectives againſt the French nation<note n="*" place="bottom">Britiſh Honour and Humanity, p. 55.</note>. America needs not to hope for a ſincere peace with France, while either Mr. Adams or his preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters remain in office.

                     </note>."</l>
               </q>
               <p>On the 31ſt of May, 1797, Mr. Cabell ſent a third letter to his conſtituents. <q>It has, ſays he, been a regular practice of the federal judges, to make political diſcourſes to the grand jurors.— They have become a band of political preachers.</q> This is true, and their ſermons are often very dull. In Britain, judges have generally been foremoſt to undermine the liberties of the people, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the encroachments of the crown. There is a country where ſpeculators occupy, in part, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme bench of juſtice. There, the aſſertion of a public officer, whoſe want of probity is proverbial, has been taken as complete evidence, that four coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were in a ſtate of rebellion. It would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be very wrong in a private citizen to conteſt the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031906_0257_0FEF450AF6B07148"/>
purity of ſuch legiſlators. In a ſubſequent letter of June 5th, Mr. Cabell ſays, upon an aſſurance of the fact from general Smith, that the juſt claims of America, for French depredations, do not exceed a million of dollars, and that the accuracy of his ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is confirmed by the preſident of the American In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance Company. In the Congreſs debates on Jay's treaty, dr. Ames computed Britiſh depredations at <hi>five</hi> millions, and the account hath ſince been augmented.</p>
               <p>The federal party naturally wiſh to drive out of their way every man who dares to think for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus Monroe was recalled from France be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, without orders from Mr. Waſhington, he had obtained the releaſement of Thomas Paine from the Luxembourg; and becauſe he had retained with the directory a degree of that confidence which Mr. Waſhington had loſt. Thus captain Montgomery, of one of the revenue cutters of this port, hath been diſmiſſed from his office becauſe he voted for the Jefferſon ticket. Mr. Beckley hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been diſcharged and attacked from the preſs, but even from the poſt-office. An elegant and polite letter came to him a few days after his diſmiſſion. It is printed here for an odd enough reaſon. The character is feigned, but ſtill, on a careful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, it has a ſtrong likeneſs to the hand writing of MR. OLIVER WOLCOT, as the Saracen's head, in ſpite of diſguiſe, reſembled ſir Roger de Coverly<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Spectator.</note>.</p>

               <p>Nine years ago, the ſuppoſed writer of this piece was copying in the office of the treaſurer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, at ſeventy-five cents per day.

Indeed no audible complaint has been made about it. Dr. William Smith, at the head of his regiment of forty, declined argument, and obtained a ſilent vote. Where any thing can be ſaid, the doctor is not a niggard of accuſation. <hi>That government whoſe bread you have eaten,</hi> which has <hi>now caſt you off.</hi> The bread was not eaten for nothing. The ſalary was moderate, and the duties laborious. As to the <hi>caſting off,</hi> it was by the odd vote of Dr. Smith, who is, it ſeems, <hi>government.</hi> As for <hi>giving them all the aid, and not throwing impediments in their way,</hi> they cannot ſurely have apprehenſions from a diſcarded clerk, who has to provide for his family by the toilſome profeſſion of the law? If government fear impediments from Mr. Beckley, their ſituation muſt be very frail. That ſomething is wrong will appear from what follows.</p>
               <p>Alexander Hamilton calls it an <hi>abominable</hi> attempt in Reynolds to charge him with dealing in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of certificates. Thus, by his own admiſſion, the fact, if proved upon him, would be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Colonel Wadſworth ſpoke of it, as above quoted, exactly in the ſame way. But if this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was indefenſible in a ſecretary of the treaſury, it was juſt as criminal in a member of Congreſs. There is no difference, or, if there be, the caſe of the member differs for the worſe. The ſecretary could only make a <hi>report</hi> in favour of funding the half-crown certificates at twenty ſhillings. But the member <hi>voted</hi> for it. The one drew the ſword; the other drove it up to the hilt. Hence, by a very ſhort and plain proceſs of reaſoning, if one of our legiſlators was concerned in theſe ſpeculations, he committed an abominable crime. The heroes of the piece are ſenſible of this fact. Their conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of transfers at the treaſury, and the bank of the United States of the names and amount of ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031906_0260_0FEF450E09442D58"/>
proves an irreſiſtible and diſgraceful evidence of their internal condemnation. What are you to think of a perſon who calls himſelf your creditor, but refuſes to tell his name, or the amount of his debt? Such was the plan of the renowned leeches of the Nabob of Arcot. Bonds to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſum were conſtantly produced, yet the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of creditors conſtantly varied. This rule at the treaſury is like the crape over a highwayman's face, or the dark lanthorn of a houſe-breaker. The public creditors of England wear no ſuch maſk. Mr. Rayment printed their names to the number of an hundred and twenty-ſeven thouſand. When Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans begin to think upon this ſubject, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay one cent more of intereſt upon the public funds, till they ſhall have torn aſunder the veil that ſhrouds the ſyſtem. To the great maſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent holders the diſcovery would be indifferent or welcome. It is only the patriarchal, the congreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional ſharks of ſtockholding, who can wiſh for mountains to cover them, the men whoſe actions Meſſrs. Wadſworth and Hamilton, have, by the cleareſt implication, declared to be <hi>abominable.</hi> Mr. Adams, by the way, holds the funding ſyſtem in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence<note n="*" place="bottom">See particulars in the American Annual Regiſter, chap. 6.</note>, and he will put an end to it, if he can get into his French war. While Americans entruſt and admire ſuch leaders, they diſplay a <hi>temporal</hi> likeneſs to the inhabitants of Neufchatel.

The character of the vote itſelf, which conſtituted the majority is eaſily given.—Of the thirty-five, twenty-one were ſtockholders, or dealers in the funds, and three of theſe latter bank directors<note n="*" place="bottom">

Smith pledged himſelf for the <hi>ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> purity of Mr. Hamilton. Supra, chap. 6. Though the number of ſtockholding members is ſpecified in the text, it appears, afterwards, to have been but a conjecture. The writer gives a liſt of thirty-four members of the two houſes, who were <hi>believed</hi> to be ſtockholders; but their names are carefully blanked, as if he had thought himſelf liable to proſecution. With ſuch unexampled oſtentation of ſecrecy, there muſt be ſome dirty ſyſtem that needs concealment.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The great cry of the party is about <hi>the ſacred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of public faith,</hi> which they alledge to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by funding the domeſtic debt. This conſiſted of arrears of pay due to the army, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors for ſupplies, of loans made to government, and of the remnant of old paper money then in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Now, we muſt recollect, that, during the revolution, this country had been covered with emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of paper. When the old Congreſs borrowed money, they took part of this paper back <hi>in loan,</hi> but not at the value for which they themſelves had iſſued it out. They allowed credit only for what was its current price in the market. The difference was frequently as forty to one. Thus a farmer got four
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031906_0262_0FEF4559A2AE8270"/>
thouſand dollars worth of government paper for his wheat. After the value of paper fell, he came to lend it to them, and they would only give him cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for the fortieth part of its nominal value, being one hundred dollars. This ſhocking fraud could be excuſed only by the omnipotence of neceſſity. But farther, <q>a part of the paper remained unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at the cloſe of the war, and has been fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the rate of <hi>one hundred</hi> for <hi>one</hi> under the preſent government<note n="*" place="bottom">Gallatin, p. 89.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus taking America for a merchant who has three creditors, one of them is paid with a fortieth, and a ſecond with a hundredth part of the ſum that he lent. A third receives full payment. But a debt contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ten years ago, and ſtill unpaid, is as fairly due as if it had been incurred but yeſterday. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of 1776, who was paid with one-tenth, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, fortieth, or hundredth part of his juſt claim, was quite as meritorious as the other of 1781, whoſe debt has been bought up and funded, in the name of Theodore Sedgwick, at twenty ſhillings in the pound. A brief conſideration will convince you, that this poſition agrees with the eſſence of juſtice.</p>
               <p>If the continent had been ſold by an hour glaſs, its utmoſt value would perhaps have fallen ſhort of ſatisfaction to the honeſt demands of public creditors. The greater part of the United States had been ſwindled or plundered to a degree that exceeds the deſcriptive talents of the moſt powerful mind. Funds could not be had to ſatisfy all the creditors, or even a twentieth part of them. It remains, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be proved what was the <hi>ſuperior</hi> merit of that claſs of creditors, whoſe claims were ultimately admitted, at their full value, as a debt on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. The common ſaying is, that they were <hi>old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="unknown:031906_0263_0FEF44C44BC06C40"/>
A great number of them were ſo, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the higheſt merit. A large portion of certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates was alſo held by contractors, and perſons who had furniſhed various kinds of ſupplies, but who were not in the army. The country was full of widows and orphans, whoſe fathers and huſbands had been killed in the war, and who, to this day, have received no compenſation. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of ſoldiers had been alſo diſcharged from want of health, or from wounds, and who in equity, though not perhaps in name, were creditors to the public. Hence, if it had been poſſible to clear off all the laſt claſs of creditors, they were not more deſerving than a ſtill greater proportion of military ſufferers who got nothing. The whole hiſtory of American public credit, during the war, holds up a picture of inevitable but enormous iniquity. Three-fourths of the citizens of the United States were, in real truth, creditors to government. The loſs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated paper was prodigious and next to univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. If it could have been poſſible to pick out all the ſoldiers or their families, and give them a higher proportion of payment than others, it would have been well. But to give one part of them their whole demand, and nothing to the reſt, was not ſtrict juſtice. The widow and orphan of one old ſoldier were actually taxed to pay the wages of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When the federal party clamour ſo loudly on public faith, let them revolve theſe particulars. Let them look at the annual bundles of petitions refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the committee of claims, and then they may bluſh at the very mention of American <hi>public faith.</hi>

               <p>Some perhaps think that the friends of order have been treated with too little ceremony in point of of ſtile. Obſerve a few ſpecimens of their own. Mr. Fenno's gazette, of the 26th of April, 1796, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a piece wherein the members of Congreſs who
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:031906_0264_0FEF4517B74CB530"/>
oppoſed the treaty, are termed the <hi>war-whoop party.</hi> If they carry their point, <q>
                     <hi>it will</hi> murder all your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, privileges and properties.</q> Again, refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Mr. Albert Gallatin, <q>Let the mighty Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, with his ſtilletto and bowl of poiſon come on.</q> This piece concludes with ſaying that the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans deſpiſe all <hi>incendiaries;</hi> and it is ſubſcribed ORDER.</p>
               <p>An extract of a letter in the ſame newſpaper has the following words. <q>I want to know how Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has accounted for his <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> and <hi>dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of conduct. How long will the people of America be <hi>duped</hi> by this man.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion to be here aſked is, whether ſuch <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> and <hi>duplicity</hi> exiſt? No details are attempted, and no evidences are offered. There never was an active and diſtinguiſhed member in any legiſlative aſſembly, farther above impeachment than Mr. Madiſon. The marked attention which this gentleman obtained in Congreſs, is a tribute of eſteem which all parties pay not more to his abilities than his virtues, to the irreproachable tenor of a life, that, ſince his firſt entrance on the political career, has remained without a ſtain, and which is far above the ordure of Mr. Fenno's correſpondents.</p>
               <p>As for the deſtruction of privileges and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no party ever diſplayed greater tameneſs on that head than the Hamiltonians. After the Britiſh had, for, many months, been capturing American veſſels without provocation, and almoſt without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the Repreſentatives, on the 21ſt of April, 1795, paſt a reſolution prohibiting, from and after the 1ſt of November then next, <q>all commercial intercourſe between the United States and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Britain, or the citizens or ſubjects of any other nation, ſo far as reſpects articles of <hi>the growth or manufacture of Britain or Ireland.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="257" facs="unknown:031906_0265_0FEF45A7E8A88DD8"/>
This would have been a moſt effectual blow to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh commerce; and, as ſix months were to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene before the commencement of its operation, full time would have been given for a mutual explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and compromiſe. The Britiſh majority in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Congreſs rejected this propoſal, ſo cheap, ſo ſimple, and ſo deciſive. Jay, that executioner of his country, was, at the ſame time, diſpatched to Britain. He there, by a clauſe of the treaty, tied up the hands of America, and deſtroyed all chance of adopting ſuch a reſource in future. The fifteenth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle has theſe words. <q>Nor ſhall any prohibition be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two nations reſpectively, which ſhall not <hi>equally</hi> extend to all other nations.</q> Thus we cannot prohibit the importation of Engliſh manufactures, without alſo prohibiting thoſe of <hi>all other nations;</hi> and that is impracticable.</p>
               <p>This article has the appearance of reciprocity, but not the ſubſtance. Suppoſing that England ſhould entirely prohibit all intercourſe with this country, her loſs would be an hundred times greater than ours. The deſolation of her Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would be the firſt conſequence, and a general bankruptcy among her Weſt-Indian merchants, and her manufacturers for the American market, would be the ſecond. On the contrary, the inconvenience and loſs to the United States would be very ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. We ſhould begin to manufacture more among ourſelves. American produce would ſoon find other markets. Other nations would learn to ſupply our wants, while the artiſts of England would croud over to this country in queſt of employment. More commmanding ground could not be deſired. Yet Jay jumped from his eminence to waddle in the ſlough of pretended reciprocity, to betray every principle of official truſt, and to trample on every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:031906_0266_0FEF32B46735C010"/>
of his inſtructions. The reader will infallibly abhor ſuch ignorance or treachery, unleſs he has been a Britiſh commiſſary during the laſt war, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat correſpondent with James Reynolds ſince it, unleſs he has a ſuit of compenſation depending at London, unleſs he expects to be made an officer in the cuſtoms, a director of the mint, a chaplain to Congreſs, a printer to the Senate, or an ambaſſador to Berlin; or, unleſs he has twenty bills lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted at the bank of the United States, and his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſticking together by the nod of Mr. Thomas Willing.</p>
               <p>While the reſolution of the 21ſt of April, 1794, was under debate, and frequently before that time, in the ſame ſeſſion, the gentlemen on the oppoſite ſide of the queſtion, ſaid that the Britiſh would not feel the want of our commerce, becauſe the three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſterling of exports from Britain to North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, formed only one-ſixth part of her total exports. This reaſoning reſembled that of ſuppoſing, that a perſon worth ſix thouſand dollars, will not regret the loſs of one thouſand, becauſe he has five times that number behind; or, if you will, that a man would not feel the amputation of one of his fingers, if the other ſeven are ſafe and ſound. Another circumſtance muſt be attended to. One-half of the commerce of Britain had been deſtroyed by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the French war, ſo that the loſs of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can commerce would then have been equal to the annihilation of one third or fourth part of her whole foreign trade.</p>
               <p>What effect theſe reſolutions, if adopted, were likely to produce in Britain, may be perfectly aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon the authority of Dr. Adam Smith, who was, on a point of this kind, a judge above excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The paſſage now to be quoted, is of conſiderable length, but it ſerves to illuſtrate the preſent ſubject
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031906_0267_0FEF45AB281CD450"/>
ſo completely, that an apology would be unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for its inſertion. After deſcribing ſome of the numerous inconveniences which Britain met with, in attempting to monopolize the commerce of her North-American colonies, the doctor proceeds thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Her commerce, inſtead of running in a great number of ſmall channels, has been taught to run principally in one great channel. But the whole ſyſtem of her induſtry and commerce has thereby been rendered leſs ſecure; the whole ſtate of her body politic leſs healthful, than it otherwiſe would have been. In her preſent condition, Britain reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles one of thoſe unwholeſome bodies, in which ſome of the vital parts are overgrown, and which, upon that account, are liable to many dangerous diſorders, ſcarce incident to thoſe in which all the parts are more properly proportioned. A ſmall ſtop in that great blood-veſſel which has been artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſwelled beyond its natural dimenſions, and through which an unnatural proportion of the induſtry and commerce of the country has been forced to circulate, is very likely to bring on the moſt dangerous diſorders upon the whole body politic. The expectation of <hi>a rupture with the colonies,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, has ſtruck the people of Britain with more terror than they ever felt <hi>for a Spaniſh armuda, or a French inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> It was this terror, whether well or ill-grounded, which rendered <hi>the repeal of the ſtamp act,</hi> among the merchants, at leaſt, a popular meaſure.

The blood, of which the circulation is ſtopt in ſome of the ſmaller veſſels, eaſily diſgorges itſelf into the greater, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out occaſioning any dangerous diſorder; but, when it is ſtopt in any of the greater veſſels, convulſions, apoplexy, or death, are the immediate and unavoidable conſequences. If but one of theſe overgrown manufactures, which by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:031906_0268_0FEF45ACE2314BC0"/>
markets, have been artificially raiſed up to an unnatural height, finds ſome ſmall ſtop or interruption in its employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it frequently occaſions a mutiny and diſorder <hi>alarming to government,</hi> and embarraſſing even <hi>to the deliberations of the legiſlature.</hi> How great, therefore, would be the diſorder and confuſion, it was thought, which muſt neceſſarily be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a ſudden and entire ſtop in the employment of ſo great a proportion of our principal manufacturers!</q>
               </p>
               <p>In deſpite of this overwhelming narrative, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs could ſtand up and make ſpeeches, by the hour, to prove, that an interruption of her commerce with America would not be ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by Britain. If ſhe was ſo deeply afraid of America in 1766, when victorious, and at peace with all the world, her alarm would, of courſe, be vaſtly greater in 1794, when her public debt had doubled ſince the former time; when her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on the continent were extirpated; when her manufacturing claſſes were already ſtarving by thouſands<note n="*" place="bottom">A letter from a merchant in Mancheſter to his friend in this city, written about that time, obſerved, that, <hi>if it was not for America, they would have wanted</hi> BREAD TO THEIR MOUTHS.</note>; and when her trade to the United States was computed to be at twice the amount of what it had been twenty years before. This turn of circumſtances went directly in favour of America. In 1766, England was more deeply alarmed than ſhe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The exports from Britain to America, were, in 1794, about three millions ſterling<note n="†" place="bottom">On the 18th of April, 1796, Pitt ſaid, in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that the total exports of Britain, amounted to twenty-four millions ſterling; and in 1795, to twenty-ſeven millions, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy thouſand pounds ſterling.</note>; being, as above ſtated, equal to about a ſixth part of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported manufactures. Let us ſuppoſe that every
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:031906_0269_0FEF44C76C9D7688"/>
manufacturer in Britain requires fifteen pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per annum to ſupport him; and that one-half of the price of the commodities exported from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to America conſiſts in the wages of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Here then we have abſtracted from the fund of ſubſiſtence for the labouring part of the people of Britain, ONE MILLION AND FIVE HUNDRED THOU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAND POUNDS STERLING. Of theſe manufacturers, a conſiderable number muſt be married, and have families of children. It may ſeem ſtrange in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, but it is abſolutely true, that in Britain, or at leaſt in Scotland, a journeyman manufacturer has raiſed his family on ſix ſhillings ſterling a week, which is only fifteen pounds twelve ſhillings per annum. Let us compute then that one-fourth part of the hundred thouſand manufacturers above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are married, and that each has three children. This eſtimate gives us two hundred thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reduced to beggary at a ſingle ſtroke. We muſt likewiſe take into the account, that many thouſands of Britiſh tradeſmen depend entirely for their ſubſiſtence upon the cuſtom of thoſe two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand people; ſo that the whole number deprived of employment may be conjectured at two hundred and fifty thouſand. To this we muſt add the deſtruction of revenue, the confuſion, alarm, and bankruptcy of merchants, and the fall of the ſtocks, which muſt be the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and then let any body ſay, whether the loſs of the commerce of America muſt not be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerious object to Britain.</p>
               <p>This act, prohibiting the importation of Britiſh goods, was loſt in the Senate, by the caſting vote of Mr. John Adams. All the advantages that it would have produced, have been thrown away, and all the miſchiefs attending Jay's treaty have been ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally cauſed by the fatal rejection of the vice-preſident.
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:031906_0270_0FEF44C936BA8750"/>
The advocates againſt the prohibition diſcovered a great want of information, of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, or of judgment. There cannot be a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poſition than that now before us. Adam Smith was, perhaps, the beſt informed political writer that Britain ever had. He affirmed, that an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the United States would affright her more effectually than a Spaniſh armada, or a French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. The Adamites denied all this; and their ignorance, their factious ſpirit, or their treachery, has coſt American trade at leaſt ſeven or eight mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars. The conſtant cry was, that the Britiſh would declare war. Some weeks before that time, when Madiſon's reſolutions were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, general Smith aſked one of theſe bawlers, what made him apprehenſive that England would attack us? He replied, that he had no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch a thing, but ſome of his neighbours were afraid of it, and he <hi>wanted to pleaſe them.</hi> General Smith told this in Congreſs, on the 27th of May, 1797. This would be one of thoſe impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who went home and told their conſtituents, that Madiſon wanted to deſtroy the government.</p>
               <p>Among the ridiculous arguments advanced in Congreſs for accepting the Britiſh treaty, one was, that it would prevent the renewal of an Indian war. On the 29th of April, 1796, Mr. Dayton ſaid, that, by rejecting Jay's treaty, it <q>might be calculated upon as <hi>inevitable,</hi> and the conſequent expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fourteen hundred thouſand dollars annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but in carrying the treaty into effect, and poſſeſſing the (Weſtern) poſts with the troops, they ſhould be free from any danger of a ſerious rupture with the ſavages<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache's Debates, vol. ii. p. 347.</note>.</q> That the Weſtern
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031906_0271_0FEF44CC006D3120"/>
poſts would firmly bridle the Indians, was, at that time, a received opinion.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ames took up the ſubject in a higher ſtrain. The tories were ready to ſpit in any man's face who did not admire his ſpeech on that occaſion. On the Indian war, he ſets out as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>On this theme, my emotions are unutterable: if I could find words for them, if my powers bore any proportion to my zeal, I would ſwell my voice to ſuch a note of remonſtrance, it ſhould reach every log-houſe beyond the mountains. I would ſay to the inhabitants, wake you from your falſe ſecurity. Your cruel dangers, your more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el apprehenſions are ſoon to be renewed: the wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again. In the day time, your path through the woods will be ambuſhed. The darkneſs of midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. —You are a father—the blood of your ſons ſhall fatten your cornfield.—You are a mother— the war-whoop ſhall wake the ſleep of the cradle. On this ſubject, you need not ſuſpect any decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on your feelings. It is a ſpectacle of horror which cannot be over drawn. If you have nature in your hearts, it will ſpeak a language compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with which all I have ſaid or can ſay, will be poor and frigid.</p>
                  <p>Will it be whiſpered that the treaty has made me a new champion for the protection of the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers? It is known that my voice as well as vote have been uniformly given in conformity with the ideas I have expreſſed. Protection is the right of the frontiers; it is our duty to give it.</p>
               </q>
               <p>All this is very fine. The concluſion implies an internal doubt in the mind of the orator that he was liable to the cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge of inconſiſtency. Indeed, on the 6th of June, 1794, Dr. Ames ſpoke thus, in
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031906_0272_0FEF45475DC3EF20"/>
Congreſs: <q>I am not one of thoſe who think that there are too many Indians, any more than too many wild beaſts. The one may, by ſkilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, be rendered as harmleſs as the other.</q> In 1794, when the doctor uſed this language, he thought only of injuries that Indians have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from white people. In April, 1796, he thought only of injuries that white people ſuffer from Indians. In the latter inſtance, Dr. Ames proved more than he foreſaw. A refuſal to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate would not have juſtified England in breaking the peace of 1783; and hence her ſtimulating the ſavages to murder, would have been an act of the blackeſt perfidy. The doctor looked upon this conſequence as certain. Jacobiniſm can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe. This proves the folly of thinking Frenchmen more barbarous than Britons. The doctor ſays, that <q>his voice as well as vote has been <hi>uniform.</hi>
                  </q> NO. He was an advocate for that ſyſtem, which ended with refuſing payment to the militia of Tenneſſee, for having done their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet the capture of Nickajack was nearly as important as Wayne's victory on the banks of the Miamis. Of the former, nobody ſpeaks. For the latter, America has rung with exultation.</p>
               <p>Again, if the Indians are ready to break a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when a governor of Canada <hi>ſhall bid them</hi> do ſo, we have certainly <hi>too many</hi> of ſuch neighbours, and ſyſtematic treachery makes it hardly worth while to negociate with them. This picture of perſidy does not agree with what Dr. Ames had ſaid only a few minutes before. <q>I ſee no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſpect that is paid among nations to the law of <hi>good faith.</hi> If there are caſes in this <hi>enlightened</hi> period when it is violated, there are none where it is decried. It is the philoſophy of politics, the religion of governments. It is
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:031906_0273_0FEF32B84693CEB0"/>
obſerved by barbarians. A whiff of tobacco-ſmoke, or a ſtring of beads, gives not merely binding force, but <hi>ſanctity</hi> to treaties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By the ſubſequent account of the gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the beads and tobacco were both to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at the nod of England. <hi>No exception to the reſpect to the law of good faith!</hi> Modern hiſtory is as full as it can be of the violation of good faith. The Britiſh orders of the 8th of June, and 6th of November, 1793, and 8th of January, 1794, were all breaches of treaty. The extravagance of the or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r's ſtyle is too evident for detection. He then puts the ſuppoſition that England <q>refuſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the treaty, after we have done every thing to carry it into effect.—What would you ſay, or rather what would you not ſay?</q> He then, in a ſtrain of lofty declamation, tells what might be ſaid! The only remark worth making would be that <hi>a blackamoor cannot eaſily waſh himſelf white;</hi> and that no man verſant in hiſtory would feel ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at ſuch national baſeneſs. Dr. Ames makes repeated reference to the ſtates of Barbary, as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected</hi> of breaking treaties. <hi>A ſhort hiſtory of Algiers,</hi> printed ſome years ago by Mr. Mathew Carey, will give him a precious catalogue of ſuch matters. Jay's treaty itſelf is regarded by the French as a violation of our treaty with them. The remarks on this ſpeech may be ſhortened, for the treaty has <hi>de facto</hi> died. This can be proved in a few words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There is no poſition better ſettled, than that the breach of <hi>any</hi> article of a treaty by one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gives the other an option to conſider the <hi>whole</hi> treaty as annulled<note n="*" place="bottom">Camillus, No. viii.</note>.</q> Now, as England is on the verge of a general bankruptcy, our merchants
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:031906_0274_0FEF324A5EDBD378"/>
have no chance to recover their five millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. This was the temptation for accepting the treaty; and, when that viſion has vaniſhed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, by the admiſſion of Camillus himſelf, are at liberty to declare it void. They could do nothing better.</p>
               <p>His majeſty's moſt faithful ſubjects in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia toil hard to prove that England will recover her credit. The preſent diſtreſs hath not come of a ſudden. In April, 1796, a committee of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants waited on Mr. Pitt. At this interview it came out that the bank of England had advanced fourteen millions ſterling for government, Sixteen millions ſterling of caſh and bullion had, within three years, been exported from the kingdom. Gambling in the funds had been excited by Pitt's exorbitant premiums to ſuch a pitch, that twenty, thirty, and forty per cent were given for money to carry it on. Manufacturers or merchants could no longer borrow money at five per cent, ſo that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trade was not to be ſupported. All theſe were the ſtrongeſt cauſes and ſymptoms which could be conceived of approaching ruin. France hath only to reſt on her arms, to exclude, as ſhe hath done, Engliſh commerce from almoſt every port in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and then to permit England to proceed with an annual loan of twenty millions ſterling. Hence it is of little concern whether Britain profeſſedly ſtops payment in this year or the next. The event is certain. The delay is but like a fortnight's reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite from the gibbet. The predictions of Gerald and Palmer have not been long unfulfilled; nor have their wrongs been long unavenged.</p>
               <p>Recurring to Dr. Ames, we can now anſwer one of his queries. <q>The articles ſtipulating the redreſs of our injuries by captures, are ſaid to be deluſive. <hi>By whom is this ſaid?</hi>
                  </q> By every body</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:031906_0275_0FEF45196DDF35B8"/>Dr. Ames has been ſucceded in the fifth Congreſs by a diligent imitator. Of all that might have been ſpared in the repreſentative of Boſton we find a faithful copy. But from his comprehenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, his pathetic vivacity, his acuteneſs of remark, his chaſte, yet luxuriant elegance of expreſſion, the honourable Harriſon Gray Otis of Maſſachuſetts keeps, and forever will keep, at an immeaſurable diſtance.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt of July, 1797, an amendment was propoſed in Congreſs to the ſtamp-duty bill. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dollars were to be charged for a certificate of citizenſhip to an emigrant. On this occaſion, Mr. Otis made, as uſual, a ſpeech of conſiderable length. Mr. Loyd took an extenſive ſketch of it. But as the commodities of this orator are not much in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Mr. Loyd has not yet preſumed to incumber his newſpaper with the copy. Mr. Bache gave a ſhort account of it, and as Mr. Otis has complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bitterly of the negligence of reporters, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing extract of the moſt ſhining paſſages has been here inſerted, <hi>cum notis variorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr Otis defended the ſtamp duty. <q>We did not want population now.</q> [The United ſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain above a million of ſquare miles, and about five millions of people. Making large allowance for water, and for uſeleſs land, their territory could with much eaſe accommodate twenty times their preſent number of people. An immenſe wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond the Miſſiſſippi remains alſo to be filled up. We need an increaſe of numbers more than any other nation. It is momentous to our political ſafety. In the A. B. C. of American politics, Mr. Otis might have learned this leſſon.] <q>He made ſome obſervations on the relative manners of Europe and this country. He could not agree
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031906_0276_0FEF44D39A73E190"/>
that there was this <hi>ſimilarity</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gallatin had ſaid that we were in fact an European nation, that the manners of the people, on both ſides of the water, were eſſentially the ſame.</note>, at leaſt in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtracted ſtate of Europe; when morality and religion, and every veſtige of what was great and amiable, was endeavoured to be ſwept from the ſurface of the earth.</q> [In ſome parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, in Portugal and Ruſſia, for example, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man character is degraded by deſpotiſm. But in every country where any degree of freedom can be found, the people of Europe will bear, in all reſpects, a compariſon with thoſe of America. How ſhould it be otherwiſe? The United States have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inhabited by a ſucceſſion of chips from the old block of European population. They have not been long enough in the New world to attain any important diſtinction of character. During this debate, an Iriſh repreſentative remarked to a ſtranger in the lobby, that nearly one fourth part of the members then preſent were natives of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. To the ſouth of New-England, at leaſt one half of the citizens are either emigrants from thence, or the ſons or grandſons of ſuch emigrants. As for the attempt to ſweep <hi>morality</hi> and <hi>religion,</hi> every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige of all that is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth, this is only a round-about way of profeſſing that Mr. Otis is an enemy to the French revolution. Had he been born in due time, he would ſurely have reſiſted that of America; for the French had received at leaſt five millions of provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Americans could produce one. It is to be inferred that Mr. Otis laments the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Baſtile, the abolition of the Gabelle, the rack, the wheel, monarchy, nobility, and that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of abominations—an epiſcopal <hi>eſtabliſhment by law.</hi> He thinks that to let every man believe what
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031906_0277_0FEF451C0C5282B0"/>
creed, and employ what prieſt he pleaſes, is the way to ſweep <hi>religion</hi> from the earth. To deſtroy ariſtocracy is to deſtroy <hi>morality.</hi> This muſt be his meaning.] <q>He wiſhed to place a bar in the way of the admiſſion of thoſe reſtleſs people who could not be tranquil and happy in their own country; thoſe who had unfurled the ſtandard of rebellion at home. He profeſſed an eſteem for ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants to this country; but he did not wiſh <hi>a horde of wild Iriſhmen to be let looſe upon us;</hi> who were now endeavouring to effect a revolution in their own country. He did not wiſh the introduction here of their revolutionary principles. He was <hi>willing to fraternize with thoſe emigrants who might be admitted among us now,</hi> but he wiſhed a bar placed to further migrations, and he did not think twenty dollars too much.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The term of <hi>wild,</hi> as here applied excluſively to Iriſhmen, is highly impertinent. In thoſe parts of Ireland where the peace and property of the ſubjects have formerly been protected, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral caſt of manners was fully as good as that in New-England. A great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were however kept in a ſtate of inceſſant ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation by the preſſure of their landed ariſtocracy, and their blood-ſucking church of England hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. Of theſe unfortunate victims it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to eſtimate the morals, till they ſhall enjoy a political ſyſtem, whereby induſtry is encouraged, and property ſecured. Fortune has never ſported more cruelly, than by ſubjecting that hoſpitable and generous nation to the monopolizing jealouſy, and the ſyſtematic barbarity of an Engliſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An Iriſh revolution is now expected, and in its triumphant iſſue, Ireland, ſpurning the yoke of hereditary tyrants, will aſſume her proper rank and dignity among the powers of Europe.</p>

                  <q>Thoſe, ſays Mr. Otis, who have unfurled the ſtandard of rebellion AT HOME.</q> A gang of banditti from the town of Boſton began the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican revolution, by unfurling the ſtandard of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy. They wantonly deſtroyed three hundred and forty-two cheſts of tea, in preſence, and with the approbation of an immenſe crowd of ſpectators. The act of parliament for ſhutting up the port of Boſton, was the natural and ſuitable conſequence of that ſhameful tranſaction. The burning of the Gaſpee ſchooner, at Providence, in Rhode-Iſland, becauſe it obſtructed ſmuggling, was another wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton outrage, that muſt be reprobated by every man who is fit for living under a civilized government. The whole continent was dragged prematurely into war, to ſave the factious townſmen of Boſton from a chaſtiſement that ſome of them very highly deſerved. The friends of America in England, could no longer defend their proceedings. The cauſe of liberty was diſgraced and injured by the unbecoming inſolence of its advocates. The townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Belfaſt have invaded no man's property. The burden of actual oppreſſion cruſhes them to the earth. The wrongs of America were chiefly in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination. She was more lightly taxed than any other country in the world. If the people of New-England had behaved with equal moderation and dignity as thoſe of Virginia, it is likely enough that we might ſtill have been Britiſh colonies, and in a happy ſituation, without any revolution at all. When once the conteſt had begun, there could be no medium between independence and ſlavery, but that does not leſſen the extreme want of ſenſe and honeſty in burning the tea. It very ill becomes ſuch people to rail at reformers in Europe. The whole ſpeech proves that Mr. Otis is unworthy even to reſide in a free country, and infinitely more ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031906_0279_0FEF452118176F48"/>
it. Nature intended him for a keeper of the Conciergerie, or a led captain to ſome prince of Wales. After all, Otis only betrayed the real ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his whoſe party; and under ſuch leaders, we cannot wonder at the contemptible and pitiable fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which the United States do at preſent make.</p>
               <p>The unexpected length to which ſome articles in this volume are found to extend, has of neceſſity prevented the publication of others. This devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the firſt deſign is more fully explained in the preface. The following miſcellaneous remarks have, however, been inſerted, as a relief to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the ſameneſs of political details. They refer to ſubjects of univerſal intereſt, and which, in the moſt expreſſive manner, demand reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, the 12th of March, 1796, two ſtage coaches, ſet out at ſix o'clock in the morning, from Frenchtown for Newcaſtle. The diſtance is only ſeventeen miles, and yet the drivers did not reach the latter place till twelve o'clock. They took ſix hours to travel a ſpace, which a healthy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man would have walked over with eaſe, in four and an half. The road through which the coaches had to go, was very tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. One of the drivers, when near Newcaſtle, attempted a kind of quicker pace than uſual. The wretched harneſſing inſtantly gave way; the two foremoſt horſes broke looſe, and ſet off at full gallop: one of them was near breaking his neck.</p>
               <p>When the paſſengers arrived at Newcaſtle, the wind was fair, the tide was making, and the boat for Philadelphia was ready and waiting; yet they were detained an hour and an half. The only conceivable reaſon for this delay was, that <hi>the innkeeper might ſcrub the paſſengers out of the price of a dinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt the boat got off, and with a fair wind came up within leſs than two miles of Glouceſter point; but the wind and tide failing, the veſſel was obliged to come to anchor. If ſhe had left Newcaſtle but an hour more early, ſhe might have come with eaſe to the wharf at Cheſnut-ſtreet, by ſix o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="unknown:031906_0280_0FEF455B3ABF2770"/>Seven or eight of the paſſengers, who were anxious to get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, were obliged to pay half-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-dollar each to the ſailors to row them aſhore. If the owners of theſe boats are capable of ſhame, which is extremely doubtful, they muſt bluſh at ſuch multiplied inſtances of negligence, inſolence and extortion.</p>
               <p>Another tide was expected to begin about one o'clock in the morning. The maſter, whoſe name is Mitchell, ſate up, drinking grog, playing at cards with ſome paſſengers, and making an intolerable noiſe, till the hour above-mentioned; he then went to bed. About four in the morning, ſome of his men came down to tell him that the tide was ebbing, and that the boat was run aground. It was a long time before they could make him underſtand them.</p>
               <p>Finally, the boat came up to Arch-ſtreet wharf on Sunday evening, with the tide, having performed a paſſage in <hi>twenty-eight</hi> hours, which, with the utmoſt eaſe, might have been executed in <hi>ſix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The above appeared in a Baltimore newſpaper. Some of the parties felt themſelves angry, and ſaid ſo; but they did not attempt to contradict the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it was only a ſpecimen of their daily practice.</p>

                     <head>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to his friend in Baltimore, dated <date>25th of April, <hi>1796.</hi>

                     </head>
                     <p>In the Maryland Journal of the 28th of March laſt, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an account of an expedition from Frenchtown to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle in the ſtage coach, and from the latter place to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia by the ſtage boat. The writer complains that the coach took ſix hours to drive ſeventeen miles over a tolerable road; that the boat ſpent <hi>twenty-eight</hi> hours on a voyage up the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware, which might have been ended in <hi>ſix</hi> hours; that Mitchell, the maſter of the boat, got drunk; that his ſailors fleeced ſome of the paſſengers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This malcontent muſt undoubtedly be a foreigner, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he never would have attempted to grumble, for two ſolid reaſons. Firſt, becauſe, with a few exceptions, brutality, negligence and filching, are as naturally expected by people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to travelling in America, as a mouth, a noſe, and two eyes, are looked for in a man's face. Secondly, becauſe legal redreſs, and individual reformation, are equally hopeleſs. The
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:031906_0281_0FEF4525DCD6EB58"/>
former would require ſuch a waſte of time and money, with ſo extreme an uncertainty of the iſſue, that no perſon of common prudence ever thinks of it. As for the ſecond, there are excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both as to landlords and drivers, between this place and Baltimore; and others may be found in different parts of the country. But the blanks in this lottery are more numerous than the prizes; and to hope reformation or amendment of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, among the worthleſs, would be the moſt viſionary of all viſions.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſtanding the caſe, this gentleman, inſtead of grumbling, ſhould rather be very thankful to have rode from Frenchtown to Newcaſtle, without getting his limbs broke, and his trunk, if he had one with him, ſhattered to pieces, or pitched a yard deep into the mire. Mitchell, the boatman from Newcaſtle to Philadelphia, did not endanger the lives of his paſſengers. He only kept them about five times longer than was neceſſary on the water. If his ſailors took half-a-dollar a piece for row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the paſſengers on ſhore, they ſhould have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grateful that the boat was not overſet. Permit me to relate ſome of my own trials and troubles of this nature.</p>
                     <p>In June 1794, I had occaſion to go to New-York. Two rival coaches came near the town of Brunſwick, at the ſame time. The one in which I was, got the ſtart of the other by a few yards; and entered the town at full gallop. I expected every moment when the coach would break down, or ſome of the horſes fall dead under the fatigue. Moſt of our paſſengers were as fond of this triumph as the driver himſelf, and did every thing in their power to encourage him to break their necks. At Elizabeth-town, a young lady, well mounted, came up behind us, and attempted to ride by. Six or eight of us inſtantly raiſed a halloo, frightened her horſe, and almoſt unſeated her. On attempting to expoſtulate, I ſoon found that I might preſently be treated ſtill worſe than ſhe was. The whole cargo roared out, <hi>What? Suffer any body to take the road of us?</hi> They reviled the lady in the moſt ſhameful ſtile. One of them I learned to be a merchant in New-York, and a man not of an obſcure ſituation. A ſecond was a quaker. I tried to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with him on the principles of his ſociety, on the vileneſs and cowardice of hazarding the life or limbs of a fellow creature for ſuch a jockey piece of ettiquette. I had a ſurly anſwer, and was at the ſame time, taken up ſhort by a clergyman from the north of Ireland, who conſtantly kept himſelf in a ſtate of elevation during the laſt ſixty miles of our journey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="unknown:031906_0282_0FEF452774BDC908"/>At New-York, I was lodged with two others, in a back room, on the ground floor. This was a dirty hole about three yards and an half ſquare.—What can be the reaſon for that vulgar hoggiſh cuſtom, common in America, of ſqueezing three, ſix, or eight beds into one room? No ſuch thing is ſeen in the Britiſh iſlands. Among genteel or decent people, every perſon has not only a bed, but even a room to himſelf, and very frequently locks the door.</p>
                     <p>The back yard, into which the window of our cell opened, was about ſix yards wide every way. Within this ſpace, and juſt oppoſite to our window ſtood a little brick kitchen, and cheek by jowl, an edifice of the moſt <hi>neceſſary</hi> nature. They were ſeparated by a brick partition about ſix or nine inches thick. The delicacy of this arrangement muſt ſtrike every perſon of ſuperior taſte. Having occaſion to viſit the temple, I found that the roof had tumbled in. It was about noon, and a very ſultry day, and before I could get out again, I had well nigh fainted with the moſt horrible ſtench that ever aſſailed my noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>If the continent of America were only ten miles broad, there might be ſome excuſe for jamming buildings together in ſuch a diſguſting, aukward and dangerous way. I call it diſguſting, as the ſcene juſt deſcribed might turn the ſtomach of a Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot. It is aukward, for when theſe receptacles of filth come to be emptied, matters are often ſo badly laid out, that the only paſſage to get the naſtineſs away, is through the very middle of the houſe itſelf. Such is not univerſally the mode of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it occurs, in too many inſtances. Now it is ſurely aukward to be thus, almoſt in a literal ſenſe, entrenched up to the teeth in human excrement; and it is the more extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as the Americans are highly and juſtly commended for the general cleanlineſs of their domeſtic economy. Can any body wonder that a city, under the fortieth degree of latitude, ſhould be viſited by the yellow fever, when a part of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are permitted to render it a centre of putrefaction? The <hi>danger</hi> of ſqueezing houſes together like herrings in a barrel, is readily ſeen in caſes of fire. A houſe burnt down laſt winter in Philadelphia near the corner of Arch-ſtreet; and ſuch was its ſituation that it was either almoſt, or entirely inacceſſible to fire-engines. I know a city in Europe larger than Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, that did not ſuffer ſo much by fire in fifteen years, as I have repeatedly ſeen the latter do in a ſingle evening. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe this diſgreſſion. I now return to my travels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="275" facs="unknown:031906_0283_0FEF452A0033AA90"/>In coming back from New-York to this city, I preferred going by water.—The maſter of a ſtage-boat, which took us over an arm of the ſea to New-Jerſey, gave an eminent proof of attention to his duty. He ſuffered our boat to be very nearly run down on a ſmooth calm ſea, in broad day light, by a veſſel of much larger bulk than ours, that was coming up in full ſail. At laſt, when within perhaps twenty yards of her, the ſhouting of her crew awaked him from his torpor; but after all, we miſſed only by a few feet, a ſtroke that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably would have ſent us to the bottom. Thus were the lives of twenty or thirty people brought into the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent riſk, becauſe the boat was entruſted with a blockhead, who had not common ſenſe enough to drive a dung cart.</p>
                     <p>At Amboy, part of our baggage was forgot, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the injunctions which we gave, and the aſſurances which we received, that the whole would be carefully packed. So great was the politeneſs of the houſe, that though we had paid for ſeats over-night, the coach was on the point of ſetting off without giving notice to five or ſix of us, who were in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable danger of being left behind.</p>
                     <p>In our paſſage acroſs Jerſey, the drivers did every thing in their power to kill the horſes, by making them go at a hand gallop, for ſix or ſeven miles together, without ſtopping, over a deep ſandy road, and in a very hot day. If the owners of theſe coaches had the leaſt ſenſe even of their own intereſt, they would flog ſuch barbarous villains, in place of paying them wages.</p>
                     <p>At Bordenton, we went into a ſecond boat, where we met with very ſorry accommodation. This was about four o'clock in the afternoon. We had about twenty miles down the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware to reach Philadelphia. The <hi>captain,</hi> who had a moſt provoking tongue, was a boy about eighteen years of age. He, and a few companions, diſpatched a dozen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen bottles of porter. We ran three different times againſt other veſſels that were coming up the ſtream. The women and children lay all night on the bare boards of the cabin floor. A little boy, one of the paſſengers from New-York, lingered at the brink of the grave, during ſeveral months, in conſequence of this mode of travelling. We reached Arch-ſtreet wharf, about eight o'clock on the Wedneſday morning, having been about ſixteen hours on a voyage of twenty miles. Compared to ſuch navigators as thoſe two, whom I have juſt given you an

               <p>The buildings of Baltimore, New-York, and Philadelphia, contain in their conſtruction ſo great a proportion of wood, that if a flame has once fairly caught, nothing but the moſt vigorous efforts can ſtop its progreſs.</p>
               <p>If the ground ſtory of one of our houſes catches fire, a family reſiding in the ſecond floor, may run the utmoſt hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either ſuffocated by the ſmoke, or burnt alive in the flames. Their only ſnift is to jump out of the windows, at the expence of breaking half their bones, unleſs, which does not always happen, ladders are brought to their aſſiſtance. Even in that caſe, from hurry and confuſion, the riſk is conſiderable. In many places, houſes are heaped together in ſuch a manner, that in caſe of a fire, either exit or acceſs would be almoſt imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable.</p>
               <p>Every man who ſees a conflagration in an American town, muſt remark the facility with which it ſpreads from one roof to another. This is one of the great and leading cauſes, which make our fires ſo generally deſtructive. The firſt reaſon is, that our houſes are roofed with wood; and ſecondly, a moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ſtupid practice among houſe-carpenters, has multiplied the hazard in a ten-fold proportion.</p>
               <p>When two houſes of equal height are built cloſe together, it is very common for the planks of each roof <hi>to croſs over and join with thoſe of the other.</hi> By this means, whenever one roof kindles, the flame, if it gets not oppoſition, from a water engine, ſpreads immediately to the next. In Dublin, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are roofed with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate or tile, and each roof is ſeparated from others by a little parapet of ſtone, which is raiſed about nine or twelve inches above the roof, being in fact, the top of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition wall between the two buildings. This incombuſtible boundary, makes the conflagration ſpread far more tardily than it otherwiſe would do.</p>
               <p>When a traveller from Europe firſt lands in the United States, he is amazed at the blindneſs and infatuation of perſiſting in this practice of running the wooden roofs acroſs each other, a
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:031906_0285_0FEF44D946271A90"/>
practice ſo pregnant with danger and ruin. A few years of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit reconcile him to it, and if he builds a houſe for himſelf, he is not ambitious of looking wiſer than other people.</p>
               <p>We often hear of fires in London, and they are ſometimes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible. But London is about ſeven or eight times more populous than the five largeſt ſea-port towns in America put together, ſo that if we compare the number of buildings with the number of fires, in theſe different places, it will be found that thoſe of London are of much inferior frequency.</p>
               <p>In Edinburgh, the houſes are far more durably built than either in London or Dublin. In the two latter, the walls are almoſt univerſally formed of brick, and the ſtairs of wood. In Edinburgh the walls and ſtairs are of ſtone, and every ſtair is arched quite round with ſtone, ſo firmly compacted, that the wooden parts of the houſe might be conſumed twenty times over, and the ſtair-caſe itſelf remain without damage. No wooden roof is to be ſeen; and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate roofs are invariably ſeparated by a parapet wall. The reſult from this ſtyle of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture is, that a well built houſe can hardly burn to the ground, on any account. A dirty chimney may kindle, cauſe occaſional alarm, and produce petty damage; but the burning out of a family is a very uncommon accident.</p>

all, many articles are left out, which were originally propoſed for inſertion. Though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a regular ſeries, yet a conſiderable part of the moſt important events of the preſent year, have been related. Our maritime hiſtory, that is to ſay, an account of the French and Britiſh depredations, for the firſt five months of 1796, have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled with tolerable completeneſs. The preſent chapter is to give a ſketch of the principal procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in Congreſs, during that part of their ſeſſion, which began with the 1ſt of January, 1796. Of many of the moſt intereſting ſpeeches, there have already been inſerted large ſpecimens.</p>
               <p>The affair of Randall and Whitney belongs, moſt properly, to the year 1795. A full account of it has been recently given in the American Annual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter. It is ſufficient here to ſay, that Robert Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and Charles Whitney, did, in 1795, conceive a project, in conjunction with ſome Britiſh ſettlers in Canada, for purchaſing from Congreſs that ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious peninſula, which lies between lakes E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, Michigan, and Huron. It contains about twenty millions of acres. With this view they came to Philadelphia. Randall made ſome improper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to certain members of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, in order to gain their intereſt. Having, no doubt, heard of the pilot-boat hiſtory, he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among others, upon Dr. William Smith. He was apprehended, brought to the bar of the houſe, and for a ſhort time confined in priſon. Whitney had done nothing wrong. He was ſent to jail, and then diſmiſſed without examination. In this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the houſe acted without regularity, without judgment, and without juſtice.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of January, they took up the bill of appropriations for the current year. Mr. Williams moved to ſtrike out of it all the ſums allotted for
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031906_0287_0FEF44E2D0970A30"/>
the mint. After a very hard ſtruggle, the mint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted its exiſtence, under the ſevereſt repobation of its management from every ſide of the houſe. The plan of this eſtabliſhment came from Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton. Large ſums had been expended to very little purpoſe. One deſign of it ſeems to have been the erection of a board of ſinecures for the ſake of increaſing the executive influence.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of January, the houſe went into a committee of the whole, on a report from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee that had been appointed to find out a ſhort hand writer who was to take down their debates at full length, and print them. A perſon had, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two preceding ſeſſions, attended the houſe to take minutes of its proceedings for the Philadelphia Gazette. In this wilderneſs of ſcribbling, many particulars tranſpired, which members were aſhamed to confeſs and afraid to deny. Four gentlemen were eſpecially irritated, viz. Theodore Sedgwick, Dr. William Smith, Samuel Dexter, and Robert Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe Harper. Meſſrs. Dexter and Sedgwick were not able to forgive the figure that they had made in the nobility debates, as well as on ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Harper had diſputed with col. James White, delegate from Tenneſſee, on the defence of the South-Weſtern frontier; and the particulars, which were not to his advantage, had been related with unfeeling accuracy. But Dr. Smith, was by far more rancorous than the other gentlemen collectively. During the debate on Madiſon's reſolutions, Mr. Abraham Clarke of New-Jerſey ſaid, turning round to his right hand, and <hi>looking at Mr. William Smith,</hi> that a ſtranger in the gallery might ſuppoſe there was a Britiſh agent in the houſe. The nickname of <hi>Britiſh agent</hi> became general. Mr. Smith was burnt in effigy at Charleſton. On the riſing of the ſeſſion, he found it convenient to ſhun a meeting with
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:031906_0288_0FEF44E56688E9F8"/>
his conſtituents by a tour for the enſuing ſummer, into the eaſtern ſtates. The blame of this whole ſcandal was imputed to the pen of the guilty taker of minutes for the Philadelphia Gazette. Influence was employed, but in vain, to procure his diſmiſſion. This occurred in January, 1794.</p>
               <p>But on the 2d and 3d of March, 1795, the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives met in the evening, and ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of unuſual vivacity, Smith and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aroſe and complained bitterly of the minutes in the Philadelphia Gazette. Neither of them ſaid, becauſe neither of them durſt ſay, that any thing of their own had been miſrepreſented. The late Mr. Andrew Brown, knowing that miſtakes were unavoidable, had uniformly advertiſed that he was ready to receive and print corrections. The two members cloſed by propoſing a reſolution for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a committee to examine a ſtenographer. It paſt by twenty-eight votes againſt twenty-ſix.</p>
               <p>All this was in March, 1795. On the 29th of January, 1796, Mr. Giles and Dr. Smith, who had been appointed a committee, reported in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Mr. Robertſon, a Scotſman, from Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, in Virginia. He demanded four thouſand dollars. Congreſs were to give him two thouſand nine hundred, and Mr. Brown undertook for the reſt of the ſum. The debates were to be printed firſt in his newſpaper. This would likewiſe anſwer the object of Mr. Smith in ſeparating Mr. Brown and his preſent reporter.</p>
               <p>The plan was attacked from every part of the houſe, as impracticable, if uſeful; and as uſeleſs if it could be practicable. Mr. Baldwin ſaid that he had ſeen many printed ſketches of ſpeeches made in that houſe, and which he would not wiſh to ſee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done. Mr. Swanwick had often heard of <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous compoſitions,</hi> but the ſtrangeſt of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanies
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:031906_0289_0FEF32B9D839ACE8"/>
that he ever heard of, was for the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a country to run ſhares with a printer in the publication of their proceedings. Even Mr. Sedgwick, alſo, oppoſed the plan. He honeſtly ſaid, that gentlemen were apt to get into a paſſion, and then they were angry at ſeeing their expreſſions in print. Mr. Nicholas was for the appointment. He complained that a perſon who came often to that houſe, and who had a very good ſtyle of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, once publiſhed a ſpeech as his. <q>The language was much better than I could have made,</q> ſaid Mr. Nicholas, and here the member was miſtaken. <q>The ſpeech did not contain a ſingle ſentiment that I would have diſowned, but ſtill the ſpeech was not mine.</q> Mr. Harper attacked the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the Philadelphia Gazette, as diſgraceful to the country, and full of falſehoods. He prattled away at this rate, for a conſiderable time. He had never complained of inaccuracy but once; and his correction was immediately adopted. Mr. Harper poſſeſſes a readineſs of invention, and a confidence of affirmation, which the public eſtimate at their proper value.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles ſpoke in favour of the report; but he ſeemed to loſe courage on finding that a large majority in the houſe entirely diſapproved of the plan. He expreſſed regret at having been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. As an excuſe, he complained, for the firſt time, of the inaccuracy of the debates. He had never before dropt a hint of that nature. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is, that it was now brought forward to help him out with a lame argument. He felt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent chagrin at finding himſelf entangled in this prodigal and abſurd project. The committee roſe without a diviſion. On the 2d of February, 1796, the ſubject was diſcharged by a reſolution of the houſe. Mr. Robertſon had come ſome hundreds
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:031906_0290_0FEF455DB080BB98"/>
of miles, from a lucrative employment, at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſire of the ſpecial committee, and had ſtaid in Philadelphia waiting on this buſineſs, at a conſiderable expence. He was diſmiſſed without compenſation. The houſe ought at leaſt to have paid the charges of his journey.</p>
               <p>On the 8th of January, the Preſident had ſent a meſſage to Congreſs. It incloſed a memorial from the commiſſioners appointed for inſpecting the buildings at the federal city. The object was, to obtain a loan of money, under the ſanction of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in order to complete the public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at that place. The loan was to be ſecured on the public property in the city. The United States were to pledge themſelves that, in caſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty proving inadequate for diſcharging the loan, government was to make good the deficiency.</p>
               <p>A committee was appointed to report on this meſſage. After ſeveral diſcuſſions, a bill reſpecting it paſſed the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the 31ſt of March, 1796. The Preſident was thereby au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to borrow three hundred thouſand dollars on the plan above ſtated. The bill went through, by ſeventy-two votes againſt twenty-one. Thus a freſh bliſter is applied to the back of our national debt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coit, Mr. Sitgreaves, Mr. Havens, and Mr. Swanwick, did themſelves the honour of oppoſing this <hi>annihilation</hi> of the public money; for, that theſe three hundred thouſand dollars will finally come out of the federal treaſury, and never more return to it, is tolerably certain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coit ſaid, that, between three and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand dollars have already been expended; and, as he conceived, to <hi>what was worſe than no purpoſe.</hi> Ninety-ſeven thouſand dollars had been laid out on the Preſident's houſe, and it was eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031906_0291_0FEF45622BC07080"/>
that nearly as much more would be wanted to complete it. When finiſhed, he conceived that a houſe, which would coſt only <hi>fifty thouſand</hi> dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, would better anſwer the purpoſe. About eighty thouſand dollars had been expended on the capitol, and yet, <hi>progreſs was ſcarcely made beyond the foundation.</hi> He expected many <hi>future</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> applications to <hi>the public treaſury</hi> for thoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which he feared would be a laſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pride and folly of this country.—Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeven thouſand dollars for a preſidential palace, that is not yet <hi>more than half completed!</hi> Thus the whole building will coſt at leaſt two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars. If this is not deplorable waſte of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, we ſhould be happy to learn what name it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves? Indeed, unleſs among the parties immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately intereſted in forwarding this houſe, there can hardly be two opinions about it. The abſurdity is too enormous to be endured with tranquility by any man, unleſs his ideas are adulterated by ſelf-intereſt, by prejudice, by the horror of <hi>being left in a minority,</hi> or by ſome other petty motive unconnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the common exerciſe of his underſtanding. The capitol is another ſuperfluous edifice, that, as came out in the debates, has already ſunk <hi>eighty thouſand dollars,</hi> and is ſcarcely raiſed beyond its foundation. Such things are encouraged to go on, while our moſt excellent of all governments can hardly raiſe money to pay the very intereſt of the debts which it is <hi>annually</hi> contracting. It is not a ſeaſon to varniſh the poop, when the wind is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſhrouds, when the ſea is burſting the ſeams, and driving in the cabin windows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sedgwick, in the debate on the 25th of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry declared, with a convenient <hi>rotundity</hi> of aſſertion, that accommodations are to be made for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>without any expence to the public treaſury.</hi> It
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:031906_0292_0FEF452BCEC15418"/>
is certain that they will be erected at a very enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expence, which muſt come in ſome ſhape from the purſes of the people. Every newſpaper is occaſionally filled with advertiſements about the <hi>Waſhington lottery.</hi> This is a tax on the public. In Europe it is univerſally agreed, that a lottery is the moſt ruinous of all methods for raiſing money, and, at the ſame time, the moſt injurious to the morals of the people. When we hear Mr. Sedgwick ſay, that theſe public buildings are to be raiſed <hi>without expence to the public,</hi> one might gueſs that, like the palace in an Arabian tale, they were to riſe by enchantment.</p>
               <p>It is amazing that any gentleman can ſtand up in Congreſs, and talk in ſuch a way. Nay, Mr. Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick went further. He ſaid that the more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent theſe buildings were, ſo much the better. If they exceeded the ſplendour of the palaces of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Americans ought to be <hi>grateful.</hi> It is highly wrong for any legiſlature to encourage, among its citizens, a taſte for gambling. The lottery for <hi>the federal city</hi> does this in a conſiderable degree; it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, what Mr. Coit juſtly ſaid, that between three and four hundred thouſand dollars have been expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to what is worſe than no purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Sedgwick may rant as much as he pleaſes, about the gratification that Americans muſt feel in contemplating the completion, and magnificence of theſe buildings in the federal city. A man with chaſte ideas of political economy, and of national freedom, will conſider them as an equal outrage on the one and the other. The pyramids of Egypt, the amphitheatre of Titus, the pillar of Trajan, and a thouſand other edifices of a ſimilar deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were durable and inſulting teſtimonials of the ſlavery of mankind, with an impreſſion more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:031906_0293_0FEF44EA0145C670"/>
than the pen or the pencil can convey. They atteſted, that the property and induſtry of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people had been ſacrificed to glut the caprice and vanity of a ſingle man. <hi>And who or what was this man?</hi> Some jockey king, or cut throat emperor, who, if ſtript of <hi>a little brief authority,</hi> would, uſually, have been one of the moſt inſignificant of his ſpecies. But it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to enter into general declarations, or appeal to the mournful evidence of Rome and Egypt. The facts admitted in Congreſs ſpeak with ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctneſs.</p>
               <p>If the money had been laid out on a canal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Newcaſtle and Frenchtown, or on a high road between Philadelphia and Baltimore, or in penſions, to ſome of the poor old ſoldiers, who ſold their certificates for half a crown in the pound, there might be ſome conſolation. The caſh had, to be ſure, been raiſed in a bad way, but its expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had anſwered ſome uſeful end; and, though no man of ſenſe would ever have been highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſeeing the rapid ſale of lottery tickets, yet the laudable application of the money, muſt have ſerved as an emolient to the ulcer.</p>
               <p>It is hard to ſay what was the original object of founding this federal city, or what benefit it could be ſuppoſed to anſwer to the country in general. The human faculties are as clear on the banks of the Delaware as on thoſe of the Potomac. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident had already a good houſe in Philadelphia, for which his very large ſalary, of twenty-five thouſand dollars, well enables him to pay a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rent. The apartments wherein Congreſs at preſent aſſemble, in the ſame city, are as roomy and elegant as can be deſired. Philadelphia has a centrical ſituation, and an atmoſphere at leaſt as healthy as the intended new metropolis. We aſk
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:031906_0294_0FEF45B2AC4052C8"/>
then, what could be the uſe or object of theſe buildings? Or why did a government, encumbered with a debt of ſeventy millions of dollars, plunge its citizens into this unfathomable pit of architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of lotteries? An old London bookſeller uſed to ſay, that the <hi>title page</hi> was half of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. In like manner, the <hi>name</hi> of this city has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced more than half the patience with which its expenditures have been endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Endured</hi> is the proper word, for this plan has never excited popular enthuſiaſm. It hardly could. Is there not already in the union a city good enough to accommodate Congreſs? No other city on the continent can expect the ſmalleſt advantage from this removal, and every one of them feels a certain loſs. <q>On the ſame principle, ſaid Mr, Swanwick, the houſe might guarantee loans for all the cities in the union? Why a loan for the city of Waſhington in particular? Was there any <hi>reaſon</hi> why the <hi>different cities</hi> in the union ſhould be <hi>taxed for that city?</hi>
                  </q> He might have ſubjoined, is there any <hi>juſtice</hi> in ſuch a tax? If Waſhington becomes an eminent commercial place, Alexandria, or Norfolk, or Baltimore, will not be one farthing the better for it, but they may chance to be the worſe.</p>
               <p>It is highly expedient that the legiſlature of a nation ſhould aſſemble to do buſineſs in one of the largeſt of its cities. The reaſon is obvious. The eyes of the people are thus more effectually open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its proceedings; and a legiſlature is much more ſafely to be entruſted when under ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of liberty, the penetration to diſcern and fortitude to reſiſt deſpotiſm, have often been found to beat higher in the metropolis of a limited government than in any other place. Thus Charles
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:031906_0295_0FEF4531D93DF1D0"/>
the firſt was blamed for calling the long parliament at London, where his tyranny was deteſted, and conſequently where parliament were ſure of firm and effectual ſupport. His friends regretted that it had not met at Oxford; the miſtake coſt his majeſty the loſs of his head.</p>
               <p>The French revolution began at Paris. The true character of government was much better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood there, by the common people, than by the ſame claſs in moſt other quarters of the kingdom. At Amſterdam, alſo, oppoſition to the corrupting influence of the ſtadtholder was always ſtronger than any where elſe. A very large city is, in almoſt every reſpect, a great nuiſance. Yet, as <hi>it is a bad wind which blows good to nobody,</hi> a ſubordinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may often be traced in the midſt of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical evil.</p>
               <p>Such immenſe capitals as London, Paris, or even Amſterdam, cannot ſubſiſt in America, for centuries to come, but if they did ſo, many reaſons would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that the ſeat of government ſhould alſo reſide in ſuch a ſituation. With ſo many obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to watch its motions, and whoſe very numbers inſpire them with peculiar confidence, the inſolence or corruption of office is more likely to be detected and expoſed than on a more limited field of enquiry. The preſent trifling oppoſition that the abandoned miniſter of England finds in the Houſe of Commons, would, by this time, have moſt likely dwindled alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether away, if the ſpirit of Sheridan and others had not been ſupported by their ſituation in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of a numerous party of the citizens of London.</p>
               <p>Theſe hints tend to point out the propriety of retaining the reſidence of the federal legiſlature in one of the larger cities of the union. On the ſtreets of New-York or Philadelphia, every member of Congreſs meets with fellow citizens as independent

and well-informed as himſelf, and who, without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, will tell him what they think of his conduct. In ſuch a place he has a thouſand opportunities of learning public feelings, which he never could acquire in a ſequeſtered deſart, like the paper-built city of Waſhington, even ſuppoſing that he were to read all the newſpapers in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. We have at this time about an hundred and twenty newſpapers, if not more; and hence, that taſk is, in itſelf, impoſſible. It is by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with mankind that you learn how to legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for them. <hi>In the multitude of counſellors there is ſafety,</hi> ſaid the wiſe man; and in a limited ſenſe, the maxim holds good. It is only by a colliſion of various ſentiments, opinions, habits of thinking and views of life, the light of truth is finally to be ſtruck out.</p>
               <p>There is a large houſe in Philadelphia which the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania had deſigned for the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Mr. Swanwick, in a debate about this fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral city bill, noticed that twenty thouſand dollars were granted to build it; but nearly twice the ſum had been aſked for it ſince, and the houſe is <hi>not yet finiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Veterans who fought battles for America, were glad to accept, as all the world knows, of half-a-crown in the pound for the arrears of their dear-bought wages. Hundreds of petitions are, in the courſe of every ſeſſion, preſented to Congreſs from miſerable objects of all ſorts, who were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to decrepitude and beggary in the continental ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Government cannot relieve all theſe people, but ſtill if they promoted lotteries for that end, the money would be more honourably beſtowed than on a <hi>capitol,</hi> which has already coſt <hi>eighty thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> though it is hardly <hi>viſible above ground!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the palace of the Preſident, the plan muſt
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:031906_0297_0FEF4537D3CB5260"/>
have originated with ſomebody, who wanted to ſet up a political idol. A Preſident is the very laſt man in the community for whom the public ought to build a houſe, becauſe he has a ſalary five times larger than that of any other public officer in the union; and hence can afford better than other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officer to pay the rent of his houſe.</p>
               <p>The money expended on palaces at the federal city, is abſolutely caſt away. The Preſident and Congreſs are already as well accommodated with lodgings as they need wiſh to be, or deſerve to be. There is no uſe for ſuch extravagant buildings. The raiſing of money by lotteries is the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reſource within the range of political inſanity. The erection of ſuch fabrics tends to excite a tone of ariſtocracy and of royalty, to which mankind are already but too much addicted.</p>
               <p>Dr. Samuel Johnſon ſays, that <q>to build is to be <hi>robbed.</hi>
                  </q> We cannot expect that houſes raiſed for a government will be carried on with more economy than thoſe of private perſons. Mr. Coit<note n="*" place="bottom">See debate of the 31ſt of March, 1796.</note> ſays, that the buildings at Waſhington have been commenced on an extravagant plan, and that he hopes the commiſſioners will be obliged to <hi>contract them.</hi> Mr. Sitgreaves, in the ſame debate, alſo declares that the eventual expence of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings is not <hi>within the reach of calculation, or even of conjecture.</hi> What a miſerable proſpect is yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before us!</p>
               <p>Mr. Havens aſked, what was meant when it was ſaid that there exiſted an obligation of going to this new city at the year 1800? If room was not to be had in it, Congreſs might go to Georgetown. They <hi>may juſt as well ſtay where they are.</hi> What would they be at? Poor Richard ſays,
<q>
                     <pb n="290" facs="unknown:031906_0298_0FEF45B73618C528"/>
                     <l>I never ſaw an oft removed tree,</l>
                     <l>Or yet an oft removed family,</l>
                     <l>Which throve ſo well, as thoſe that ſettled be.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let us make a ſuppoſition that, before the end of the year 1800, only two millions of dollars are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the federal city. The buildings, as has been already explained, are on an extravagant ſcale. The United States could do as well without them.</p>
               <p>Put two millions of dollars into any rational ſcheme of domeſtic improvement in the country, ſuch as a well contrived canal. The money will yield a clear profit of ten, twenty or thirty per cent. Take it at the loweſt rate, and with ten per cent. of compound intereſt, a ſum doubles itſelf in ſeven years, fifty-two days and an half. In fifty years, theſe two millions of dollars will double themſelves ſeven times. They will amount to two hundred and fifty-ſix millions. In an hundred years, they will amount to thirty-two thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-eight millions of dollars, which, at that aera, will be the real expence of the city, even if reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to the original two millions. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſhews the folly of ſinking a capital on an object which is both unproductive and ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>At the end of the nineteenth century, the federal <hi>quarries above ground</hi> will not be worth ſo great a ſum; nor indeed worth <hi>what they originally coſt.</hi> They cannot, like a high road, or an improved farm, pay a large intereſt. They are mere unproductive maſſes of brick and lime, and wood and ſtone, the ſpawn of lotteries and land jobbing, for all which fine articles Mr. Theodore Sedgwick imagines it our duty to be <hi>grateful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This project of the federal city has been examined at ſome length, becauſe the ſubject is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood, and becauſe the plan, if comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:031906_0299_0FEF45B8F5F98CF8"/>
muſt end in deſtroying the American conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The monarchical party in the convention of 1787, had the following clauſe thruſt into that paper. <q>The Congreſs ſhall have power to exerciſe EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLUSIVE <hi>legiſlation, in all caſes whatſoever,</hi> over ſuch diſtrict, not exceeding <hi>ten miles ſquare,</hi> as may, by ceſſion of particular ſtates, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Congreſs, become the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States.</q> A like clauſe was never heard of before in the conſtitution, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical adminiſtration of any government in the world.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that, at the Engliſh revolution of 1688, the new parliament had declared themſelves exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive legiſlators over a ſquare of ten miles, and of which St. Stephen's chapel was to be the centre. <hi>Excluſive</hi> legiſlation is but another term for arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, becauſe it confounds the characters of judge and legiſlator. In ſo ſmall a ſpace, where parliament were ſure to ſee every thing, magiſtrates would have been nothing but their tools; and jobs, deſpotiſm, anarchy, and revolt muſt have enſued. The citizens of London and Weſtminſter would, in two or three years at the utmoſt, have laid the new government on its back. But it would be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the character of the Engliſh nation to put the ſuppoſition that a clauſe ſo abſurd, ſo fantaſtical, ſo big with miſchief, and confuſion could ever have paſt in that country. Such an originality was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the fertile brain of Alexander Hamilton. In the convention of bolted doors, this bauble was part of the compromiſe and ſacrifice granted by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon and his friends to the royal faction. Being combined with better materials, it was without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection accepted by the citizens of America. As a parting appeal to their common ſenſe, let us only figure this caſe, that the ſtate of Pennſylvania had ceded to Congreſs a diſtrict of ten miles, <hi>including
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:031906_0300_0FEF479065908FD8"/>
this city.</hi> There is not a man in Philadelphia who wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hes to ſee Congreſs erected into its excluſive le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators.</p>
               <p>Their ignorance, their caprice, the natural inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of unlimited authority, would, in a few years, have thinned the ſtreets of the city. If on the 4th of July, 1795, Congreſs had held excluſive legiſlation in Philadelphia the evening would not have cloſed with a ſhower of brick-bats. The diſmounting and diſarming of captain John Morrell, of the china ware-houſe, in North Front-ſtreet, and his being ſo baſely pitched into Frog-pond at Kenſington, might have produced a general maſſacre of the citizens. The ſale of his ſword for ſixpence, on his declining to reclaim it, might have eaſily been turned into a high crime and miſdemeanour.

               <p>On the 5th of February, 1796, the bill of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation for the current year, having gone

through both houſes, was approved by the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. This approbation is an inſignificant form. The worſt laws, as well as the beſt ones, have, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years paſt, conſtantly received the preſident's; affirmative. In all caſes of importance, however, his will is previouſly underſtood and ſtrictly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a majority of the Senate. There may have been one or two exceptions to this rule, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for a conſiderable time. In the caſe of Madiſon's firſt reſolution, and of Mr. Clarke's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But here it muſt be ſuppoſed, that Mr. Waſhington had kept himſelf in ſuſpence. He had only juſt parted with Jefferſon, and Hamilton was not yet completely fixed in the ſaddle. When the latter fact came to be known, every <hi>federal</hi> meaſure was bolted through by a large majority. After all, when two legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive bodies have agreed to a law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is below their dignity to enquire for the opinion of any ſingle man. By the conſtitution, a preſident who wiſhes to be troubleſome, can raiſe conſiderable confuſion. If he refuſes approbation, the law is ſent back to Congreſs; and, unleſs <hi>two-thirds</hi> of each houſe ſhall afterwards agree to it, the law becomes void. It is very ſeldom that ſo great a majority unites upon an important meaſure. The Senate conſiſts, at preſent, of thirty-two members; and, by this clauſe of the conſtitution, Mr. Adams, ſupported by eleven ſenators, being more than one-third of the whole number, could prevent the paſſing of any bill which he did not like. Thus the veto of twelve perſons, who are not wiſer or better than their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, might in every inſtance overweigh the whole Houſe of Repreſentatives, though ſupported by twenty-one ſenators. This is one of the miſtakes

in our conſtitution. If the citizens of America could, like the bees, create an animal of faculties ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to their own, this <hi>veto</hi> might be uſeful.

                  <pb n="295" facs="unknown:031906_0303_0FEF45D134E8A998"/>On the 9th of February, was preſented the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial above inſerted from the ſnuff-makers of Philadelphia. The act of which they complained exemplifies the remark of Montaigne, that <q>there is nothing ſo commonly or ſo groſsly faulty as <hi>the laws.</hi>
                  </q> The firſt of the two ſtatutes in queſtion required the performance of impoſſibilities. For inſtance, the ſnuff maker was to ſwear to a <hi>daily</hi> jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the ſnuff grinded. To be able to do ſo he muſt have taken down his mill at the end of every day's work, and another entire day was requiſite for putting it again in order. Thus between <hi>taking down</hi> and <hi>ſetting up,</hi> the ſnuff-maker would have ſpent four or five days in the week in hard work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grinding one ounce of ſnuff. Mr. Thomas Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and his fellow ſufferers, had not logic enough to convince Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Sedgwick, and Dr. Smith, of this rule producing a hardſhip. Other clauſes were equally ſtupid, oppreſſive, and imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. A ruinous exciſe on refined ſugar manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured in America had been blended in the ſame law with ſnuff, and it ſtill remains in force. In a proof ſheet of the <hi>ſhort hiſtory of exciſe,</hi> it was ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:031906_0304_0FEF45D665939D18"/>
that, after paying the duty, there would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the refiners of ſugar more than a clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of five per cent. upon the capital embarked in their buſineſs. This circumſtance was related on the authority of ſome of the principal manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in Philadelphia. But, on a reviſal, they choſe to ſtrike it out of the publication, leſt a diſcloſure might alarm their correſpondents, and injure the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral intereſt of the trade. This was in the fall of 1795. Matters have certainly been improved, or elſe the manufacture muſt have ſtopt, as that of ſnuff actually did. The ſugar boilers could have got ſix per cent. for their money in the common rate of intereſt, and ten times that ſum from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting flour merchant.</p>
               <p>One would be apt to believe that the <hi>federal</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs wanted to deſtroy altogether Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican manufactures. The paper money ſyſtem is chiefly theirs. Twenty millions of dollars, fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated out of old rags, are now circulating about the continent. Of theſe, ten millions belong to the bank of the United States. The total dividend of all theſe banks, as ſtated in Congreſs by Dr. Smith and Mr. Gallatin, comes to two millions of dollars per annum. The expences of management can hardly be leſs than five hundred thouſand dollars more. This enormous tax, for juſt nothing at all, and the ſcropholous abundance of money produced by the bank capitals, have tended extremely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the progreſs of American manufactures. Though not the ſole cauſe, they have yet been among the chief cauſes that raiſe the wages of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in America ſo extravagantly beyond its price in Europe. Some leaders of the federal party poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs extenſive concerns in the bank of the United States. But the maturity of American manufactures never can arrive, till wages fall, and that muſt
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:031906_0305_0FEF45DB2C1F22B0"/>
be preceded by a reduction of the maſs of paper. Hence theſe leaders wiſh to encourage the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Britiſh goods. The merchants who import them, alſo, and who, in general, deteſt American rivalſhip, are in conſtant habits of diſcounting at the banks, and it is of conſequence to favour ſuch valuable cuſtomers. Theſe obvious motives tend to make the federal commanders anxious for the cloſeſt connection with England. The ſame ſcale of argument leads them to abhor the French, among whom paper currency has always been deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. Hence, among other reaſons, we find their conſtant inclination to revile France<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Camden, in his hiſtory of Elizabeth, book iv. p. 443, has theſe words. <q>The French lawyers ſay, that whatſoever is once an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the crown of France, doth inſeparably adhere to it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</q> This vindicates the republicans from a ſuſpicion of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they refuſe to reſtore the Low Countries to the emperor.</p>
                     <p>During the time of the French league, Elizabeth was adviſed to attempt the conqueſt of Picardy and Normandy. <q>She heard it, ſays Camden, with regret and diſlike, and rejected it with much indignation, ſaying, <hi>whenſoever the laſt day of the kingdom of France cometh, it will, undoubtedly, be the eve of the deſtruction of England.</hi>
                        </q> Ibid. p. 444.</p>
                  </note>. Hence their enthuſiaſtic zeal, for the completion of Jay's treaty to which the journal of Congreſs hath now brought us.</p>
               <p>Nothing that excited general attention occurred in Congreſs from the trial of Randall till the 1ſt of March. On that day, the Preſident ſent a meſſage to each houſe informing them that ratifications of the Britiſh treaty had been exchanged at London, on the 28th of October, 1795. <q>I have <hi>directed</hi> the ſame to be promulgated,</q> added the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <q>and herewith tranſmit a copy thereof for the <hi>information</hi> of Congreſs.</q> This was clearly the ſtyle of a public officer, who conſidered his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on this point, as independent and unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:031906_0306_0FEF4793D73BA990"/>
He had complied with every formality required by the conſtitution. He had ſelected an ambaſſador for England, and had given him inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as a rule of conduct. The conſtitution ſays <q>he ſhall nominate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſhall appoint ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</q> The preſident had announced his nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to that body. They were mean or ſtupid enough to acquieſce in the appointment, without once aſking for what purpoſe Jay was to be ſent to England, or demanding a copy of his inſtructions. This ſhewed that the meſſage was but an empty form, and that, in the particular details of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, the Preſident ſcorned to hold any prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory communications with them. Here, by the way, comes out, as before obſerved,<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra chap. 3.</note> an evidence of hypocriſy towards Genet. Mr. Waſhington could not negociate with the French envoy, becauſe the Senate were not in ſeſſion. Yet, over their heads, he ſent an envoy to England, without letting them underſtand one line of his directions. This was frankly telling the republic that he rejected their advances. He could not have taken a more ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, a more ungrateful or infatuated ſtep. After ſuch coldneſs and contempt on our part, we ſhould ſpeak with temper about the republic. Frenchmen have never been celebrated for patience; and it can leaſt of all be expected in the midſt of a blaze of victories, which reduce Beliſarius and Hannibal to the rank and file of conquerors.</p>
               <p>From this digreſſion we go back to Jay. Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orders from the Preſident, and a ſanction from the Senate, he went to England and framed a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On its arrival here, the Senate, and Preſident, gave in due time, a ratification. They expreſsly
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:031906_0307_0FEF47965A16BDD0"/>
took the whole burden upon themſelves; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jay obeyed his inſtructions, or broke them, was a queſtion entirely between himſelf and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from whom excluſively he accepted of them. The Senate had, beforehand, reſigned all right of thinking upon the ſubject. They poſſeſſed no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture title to call for the inſtructions. The fit time for that demand had paſſed away. If the treaty proved to be a good one, it was quite a frivolous enquiry, whether the inſtructions were right or wrong. If it was bad, the Preſident ſtood in the gap, and they could diſappoint all bad effects by a rejection. They approved of the whole treaty, one article excepted. It was, thereafter, ratified by the Preſident. Here the character of theſe two branches, or rather of theſe two ſprigs from the trunk of <hi>repreſentation,</hi> was completely embarked.</p>
               <p>There does not appear any ſolid reaſon why the Preſident, in the ſequel, ſubmitted Jay's inſtructions to the Senate, after the treaty had been ratified. The only time for ſuch a communication was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jay ſailed for England. The inſtrument could only ſtand or fall, not by the tenor of the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by its own intrinſic value. The tardy production of Jay's orders reſembled a Chineſe marriage. The lover, it is ſaid, does not ſee his miſtreſs till after the wedding, but has leave to ſend her home again, if he does not like her. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident could only ſend this paper as a matter of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. The Senate had loſt their right of calling for the inſtructions. They had not even a decent pretence to have challenged Jay. He acted as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate agent to Mr. Waſhington, and the Senate had, in plain juſtice, no more to do with him, than the Preſident had with his ſecretary, Mr. Trumbal.</p>
               <p>But farther, Jay was, upon a different ground, placed beyond the reach of perſonal conſequences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="300" facs="unknown:031906_0308_0FEF47982E0670B0"/>
Admitting that he acted with the wildeſt deviation from his orders, yet he neither did nor could do any thing final. If the Preſident diſapproved of the treaty, ſtill he had only to refuſe it. He could have ſent Grenville a copy of his inſtructions to evince that Jay had entirely contradicted them. This muſt have been a full apology for his negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the treaty.</p>
               <p>There ſtill remained one point of view in which Jay might be regarded as reſponſible. Suppoſe that, while he carried on a negociation contrary to the ſpirit of his orders, the relative condition of the two parties had altered, that Britain had become ſtronger, and America weaker, or that ſome change in the condition of a third party had produced a ſimilar effect. In that caſe, the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives might have addreſſed the envoy in terms like theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is true that you acted as an immediate agent for the Preſident, that he had legal authority to employ you, and that he, along with the Senate, has taken upon himſelf the total reſponſibility for your conduct. In common matters an employer, by vindicating his agent, <hi>completely covers him from enquiry;</hi> but, in your affair, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing particular to be ſaid. We <hi>believe</hi> that you diſobeyed your orders, that you treacherouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled the Preſident in a bargain for which you had no powers, and that you thus forfeited that impunity annexed to the character of HIS agent. He received your production with every feeling of ſhame, of alarm, and indignation. Agreeable to law he aſſembled the Senate; and they and he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ratified the treaty, under the dread that if they rejected it, their perfidious and formidable enemy would pervert their refuſal into a pretence for declaring war. So ſtanding the caſe, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:031906_0309_0FEF45DD0566EB58"/>
that in ſubſtantial equity, you have not been the agent of Mr. Waſhington, but of lord Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville; and that the compulſive operation created by your perfidy on the minds of the Senate and Preſident, transferred the conſtitutional reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from them to you. The charges here made againſt you are matters of ſtrong ſuſpicion, but not of certainty. We are in want of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence either to ſupport or to refute them. We can only get that evidence by reſorting to your inſtructions, for you can only be <hi>impeached</hi> on the head of having diſobeyed them, and of your diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienee having thereafter ſhackled the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Preſident and Senate. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of aſcertaining your guilt or innocence, we are going to ſolicit the Preſident. He has ſent theſe papers to the Senate. He cannot, therefore, in common civility, or even decency, deny our requeſt. Yet we have no conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al right of demanding the paper. The power of <hi>making treaties</hi> has been excluſively and jointly veſted in the Senate and in him. No part of the conſtitution requires that he ſhould explain to our houſe his motives, or divulge, unleſs by his own free will, your inſtructions and ſubſequent correſpondence. If he withholds theſe means of information and impeachment, we can only grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ſilence, and bluſh at the contemptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of adulation that, for ſeven years paſt, we have piled on the altar of Mount Vernon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The above is apprehended to contain a ſummary of the arguments that might have been employed in favour of impeaching Jay. The ſtreſs lies on aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaining that the Preſident diſliked the treaty, and gave it a reluctant ratification. On this point, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph affords a copious evidence. <q>My opinion," ſays Mr. Waſhington, "reſpecting the treaty, is
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:031906_0310_0FEF93EC9229F2B8"/>
the ſame now that it was, that is, <hi>not favourable to it,</hi> but that it is better to ratify it in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Senate have adviſed, than to ſuffer matters to remain, as they are, unſettled.—I find endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are not wanting to place it in <hi>all</hi> the odious points of view of which it is ſuſceptible, and in ſome which it will not admit.</q> [This is plain enough.] <q>I have never, ſince I have been in the adminiſtration of the government, ſeen a criſis, which in my judgment has been ſo pregnant of intereſting events, nor one from which more is to be apprehended: whether viewed on <hi>one ſide or the other.</hi>—Scarcely a day paſſed, that he (the Preſident) did not <hi>enumerate many objections to it;</hi> objections going not only to the commercial part, but alſo to the Canada article,—to the omiſſion of compenſation for the negroes and property plundered, and to ſome other parts of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</q> It would be uſeleſs to heap up farther teſtimony that the Preſident diſapproved of Jay and his treaty, and that he agreed to it only to prevent ſome worſe conſequences.</p>
               <p>Having ſettled this point, we proceed with the journal of the Repreſentatives. On the 7th of March, 1796, the houſe took up a reſolution mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Mr. Livingſton. It was in theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Reſolved,</hi> that the Preſident of the United States be requeſted to lay before this houſe, a copy of the inſtructions to the miniſter of the United States who negociated the treaty with the king of Great Britain, communicated by his meſſage of the firſt of March, together with the correſpondence and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther documents relative to the ſaid treaty, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch of ſaid papers as any exiſting negociation may render improper to be diſcloſed.</q> As one <note n="*" place="bottom">Randolph, p. 35, 36, 38.</note>
                  <pb n="303" facs="unknown:031906_0311_0FEF479C4E4820C0"/>
reaſon for this motion, Mr. Livingſton ſaid that the production of the papers would determine the houſe whether <q>an impeachment would be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed adviſeable<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache, vol. i. p. 4.</note>.</q> But his chief reaſon was <q>a firm conviction that the houſe were veſted with a diſcretionary power of carrying the treaty into effect, or refuſing it their ſanction. To guide them in an enlightened determination as to that point, the papers are neceſſary; they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly throw light upon the ſubject, and enable the houſe to determine whether the treaty was <hi>ſuch</hi> as that it ought to be carried into effect<note n="*" place="bottom">Bache, vol. i. p. 4.</note>.</q> Mr. Livingſton calls the latter his <hi>principal</hi> reaſon. He did not ſpeak exactly what he thought. The papers called for could not be needful to guide the determination of the houſe, as to whether they ſhould ſanction the treaty, for nothing but its indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual merits could decide for or againſt it. But, ſecond, if the papers were needful, the houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, had virtually, though not officially ſeen them. They had been lying for ſome time on the table of the Senate. Many Repreſentatives had gone up ſtairs and read them, and every member was acquainted with the eſſence of their contents. Hence, they could not be wanted for the purpoſe of determining an opinion about the treaty, even had its fate reſted on ſuch a diſcloſure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Livingſton well knew that his former reaſon for wanting the papers was almoſt equally hollow. He knew, or he well might have known, that an impeachment was <hi>not</hi> adviſeable. The ſequel of the debates diſcovered the real ſenſe of his party. The project of impeachment was but rarely and faintly dwelt upon. But the democratical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had other and good reaſons for deſiring an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 5.</note>
                  <pb n="304" facs="unknown:031906_0312_0FEF47A025CF88F0"/>
communication of the inſtructions. This would have fixed the perfidy of Jay in departing from them. Popular reſentment at his behaviour would have riſen to the higheſt pitch. His alledged preceptor, Mr. Hamilton, would have been involved in the clamour. The treaty muſt on freſh grounds, have become an object of jealouſy and diſguſt; and this addition to the force of its enemies was to have enſured, in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, a refuſal of money for its fulfilment.</p>
               <p>By an impeachment of Jay, nothing, in common ſenſe, could be expected, but an enormous waſte of time and of congreſſional wages, a pernicious and endleſs delay in the routine of private buſineſs, and finally, a triumphant acquital of the envoy. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of all imaginable teſtimony, the Britiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty majority in the Senate were ſure to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him guiltleſs. Look at their extruſion of Albert Gallatin, at their fraternal embrace of Meſſ. Gunn and Marſhal!</p>
               <p>Thus it appears that Mr. Livingſton could hope for nothing from an impeachment, and he as little needed the inſtructions<note n="*" place="bottom">In the debate of the 21ſt of March, Mr. Williams obſerved that <q>for the ſpace of ten weeks, any member of that houſe might have ſeen them,</q> Bache, vol i. p. 236. But the great loſs was, that no member could, from ſuch inſpection, venture to quote them in the Houſe of Repreſentatives. He would have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to order, and obliged to ſit down.</note> to complete his opinion of the treaty. <hi>That</hi> opinion had been long ſince matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is difficult to keep from ſmiling when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an intelligent legiſlator ſtanding up, and give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all reaſons but the real one, in defence of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The debate laſted, with ſome intervals, from the 7th of March to the 7th of April, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive; and the report occupies three hundred and eighty-ſix cloſe printed octavo pages. This is the
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:031906_0313_0FEF93F1522CB5C0"/>
American mode of managing legiſlative debates. In a Britiſh Houſe of Commons, the queſtion could hardly have been protracted beyond ſix o'clock on a ſecond morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. William Lyman roſe next after Mr. Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton. He defended the reſolution. One of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments was, that poſſibly the papers <q>might throw ſuch light as to produce a very great degree of unanimity relative to that inſtrument (viz. the treaty). Such circumſtances might poſſibly be diſcloſed as to reconcile thoſe now oppoſed to it, and who might otherwiſe remain irreconcilable. If the reſolution tended only to this object it was effecting a valuable purpoſe.</q> Mr. Lyman held the treaty in notorious deteſtation, ſo that this argument was mere hypocritical canting. The <hi>unanimity</hi> which he deſired and expected from a production of the papers was not <hi>for</hi> the treaty, but <hi>againſt</hi> it. As to impeachment, Mr. Lyman ſpoke not one word. Mr. Giles on the ſame ſide, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He did not contemplate impeachment <q>as the <hi>probable</hi> iſſue, but the information might tend, perhaps, to reconcile thoſe now averſe to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</q> This gentleman ſpoke with as little ſincerity as the two former. We may obſerve how very ſoon the Madiſonians began to file away from their impeachment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Murray ſucceeded Mr. Giles. He oppoſed the reſolution. He denied the right of the houſe to intermeddle in treaties, unleſs theſe were alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be <hi>unconſtitutional.</hi> He objected the general impolicy of expoſing ſecrets of ſtate. Mr. Murray is a moderate and ſenſible ſpeaker; but, with all his fondneſs for ſecrecy, he would certainly have voted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the reſolution, if its real object had been to promote the ſucceſs of the treaty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Buck, another friend to Jay, took the ſame ſide, <q>but not from an apprehenſion that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:031906_0314_0FEF47A609C2E6C0"/>
referred to will not <hi>bear the public ſcrutiny,</hi> or from a belief that there would be the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance on the part of the executive to <hi>deliver them.</hi>
                  </q> Here the firſt ſentence of Mr. Buck's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue contained two direct untruths. He knew that the papers would not <hi>bear ſcrutiny</hi>

                     <p>"In all my vaſt reading," as Dr. Wagtail ſays, this pamphlet, both as to ſtile and matter, is conſiderably the beſt which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared either for Jay or againſt him. Candid, elegant, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and conciſe, its accuracy gratifies the moſt informed, while its perſpicuity convinces the plaineſt reader. Yet Mr. Dallas has a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial defect. His extreme reſerve and delicacy are entirely caſt away upon ſuch enemies as Wilcocks, Webſter, Curtius, and Camillus, on the ſtupid malignity too frequent in Mr. Fenno's Gazette, and on the illiterate brutality of the Columbian Centinel.</p>
                  </note>. He knew, and and ſo did every perſon in the houſe, that Mr. Waſhington would be aſhamed and unwilling to give them up. It was for theſe very reaſons, which Mr. Buck ſet out with diſowning, that he oppoſed the reſolution.</p>
               <p>Thus the combatants went on. They interperſed much extraneous matter, with pretended arguments on each ſide, which, as in the five caſes already cited, the orator himſelf held in ſovereign contempt, and which every man who heard him knew that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. Some ſpeeches deſerved a better character, but the limits of this volume do not permit farther criticiſm. At a future time it may be convenient and inſtructive to trace the obliquities of congreſſional diſcuſſion. The pompous petulance and Iſcariot-like malignity of Buck<note n="†" place="bottom">A ſhort memoir of this gentleman, tranſmitted from Vermont, has, for the preſent volume, been laid aſide.</note>, the plauſible ſtupidity and ſelf-important ignorance of Sedgwick, the pregnant

vacuity, and elegant loquacity of Harper, often approaching to good ſenſe, yet almoſt never get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up to it, hold out prominent materials for amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing illuſtration. But the number of reſpectable ſpeakers was greatly ſuperior to that of ſuch phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms as theſe. In general, a member of Congreſs hath ſufficient prudence either to hold his tongue, or to tell his ſentiments in a way which does not make him ridiculous.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, the 24th of March, 1796, a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion took place in a committee of the whole houſe on this reſolution to call for Jay's inſtructions and correſpondence. It paſſed by ſixty-one votes againſt thirty-eight. This was a majority unuſual on great political queſtions. When ſome victim who has been reduced to beggary by the late war, or ſome French officer who neglected to call, in due time, for his arrears of pay, has the weakneſs to ſolicit Congreſs, a negative paſſes with unanimity, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it. But in matters of high political im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the majority runs, for the moſt part, very cloſe. The reſolution paſt in the houſe by ſixty-two votes againſt thirty-ſeven. On the 25th of March, it was preſented to the Preſident. On the 30th, he ſent a refuſal of the papers. His meſſage miſquoted and perverted the requeſt of the houſe into a poſitive <hi>demand,</hi> and then pretended to refuſe what had not been aſked<note n="†" place="bottom">See American Annual Regiſter, chap. xi.</note>. Their behaviour gave Mr. Waſhington reaſon to deſpiſe them. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates that laſted for eight, ten, or twenty days about an anſwer to his annual ſpeech diſhonoured the whole body. His refuſal of the inſtructions was to conceal the diſobedience of Jay, and his own tameneſs in bearing it.</p>
               <p>The majority of ſixty two ought to have received the meſſage with ſilent diſdain, and prohibited their
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:031906_0316_0FEF47AABABF90E8"/>
clerk from inſerting it on the journals. Without oſtenſible interference they could have ſent to preſs a copy of the inſtructions. Theſe would have dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the newſpapers with the velocity of lightning. An abortive attempt to conceal this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per muſt have enſured its univerſal peruſal. A vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the publiſhers was the natural conſequence. The people would have reſented the diſobedience of Jay, the puſillanimous acquieſcence of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and his ill-concerted ſcheme for ſuppreſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. While they ſympathized with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted repreſentatives, a few well written eſſays might have matured into effective ſervice the germ of indignation; and the treaty and its allies had ſunk into the duſt.</p>
               <p>But the majority poſſeſſed not one man with the reſources, firmneſs and activity of colonel Hamilton. The party ſeemed ſtudious to diſplay more than their uſual inferiority of addreſs and boldneſs. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a critical moment more miſerably caſt away. Inſtead of a glowing declaration that they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the refuſal, inſtead of ſome ſpirited harangues to animate their partiſans without doors, their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous and trimming meaſures towards a faction whoſe animoſities are immortal, betrayed their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal want of energy, depreſſed their friends, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged their enemies, and paved the way for their own approaching downfall. They did not perceive that the public had become tired of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that farther haggling and wrangling would only increaſe that diſguſt, and raiſe the meſſage to an unmerited importance, and that ſilent contempt was the plaineſt way to render it deſpicable.</p>
               <p>On the 6th of April two reſolutions <note n="*" place="bottom">See them in Bache's Debates, vol. i. p. 374.</note> were brought forward. The meaning of the firſt was, that the majority, if they could hold themſelves together,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:031906_0317_0FEF47AC50BAD258"/>
would refuſe money for fulfilling Jay's treaty. The ſecond implied, that when the houſe deſired the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive to let them have the inſtructions, they were not obliged to tell for what purpoſe the paper was wanted. Madiſon explained and enforced the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions with that ſuperior knowledge, ingenuity, and eloquence, which have ſo often illuſtrated and adorned the tranſactions of Congreſs. Next day, they were paſt, ayes fifty-ſeven, noes thirty-five. They were not worth one half of the trouble which they coſt. To illuminate and brace the minds of the people it would have been better to propoſe the ſtriking twenty thouſand dollars from the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's ſalary. Mr. Adams, as a premium for his two Britiſh negatives, might have been reſtricted to twelve dollars per day during the ſitting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. This is the allowance to a ſpeaker of the repreſentatives, a character of more real uſe, and who bears more actual drudgery than the Senate and their vice-preſident put together. Such reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions could not have been carried, but the bare propoſal would have conveyed an important hint. A contraſt might have been run between an old ſoldier with the palſy and ſeven dollars and an half per annum, or his widow with ſix ragged children, and Mrs. Waſhington goſſipping for a whole evening at the national expence, with fifty or an hundred and fifty women, while ſnuff-mills and ſugar-bakeries were caſt idle by the <hi>approbation</hi> of her huſband.</p>
               <p>Treaties had, within a ſhort time, been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into by the United States with Britain, with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, with Spain, and with thoſe Indians whom Wayne defeated at fort Miamis. On the 13th of April, 1796, Mr. Sedgwick moved a reſolution that proviſion ſhould be made for carrying theſe treaties into effect. He meant that the houſe ought to vote ſums of money for that end, and his view in bundling the whole four treaties into one reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:031906_0318_0FEF47ADE25978E8"/>
was that they might ſtand or fall together. This reſolution produced warm debates. Several amendments were ſuggeſted and diſcuſſed. Of theſe a particular detail can hardly intereſt an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reader. The whole proceedings have been minutely compiled by Mr. Bache, and deſerve to be ſtudied by every future candidate for a ſeat in Congreſs. For this place, it is enough to ſet in one luminous point of view the actual objects of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite parties. The news of the Spaniſh treaty had been received in America with univerſal exultation. It was to open the navigation of the weſtern waters, of which the king of Spain had hitherto been the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilor. The Indian and Algerine treaties were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient than advantageous, but as their terms gave general ſatisfaction, no doubt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained that money would be voted to fulfil them. A refuſal was, of neceſſity, to ſubject the union to immediate piracy and warfare. But it was, in all reſpects, quite otherwiſe with the Britiſh treaty. A general and violent oppoſition had appeared againſt it. A complexity of principles was involved in its diſcuſſion. Hitherto, moſt repreſentatives had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to diſlike it, and a delay, or even a rejection, could not reaſonably be ſuppoſed to produce war, when, by the conqueſt of Holland, the extirpation of her armies in Europe and the Weſt-Indies, the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of money, and the diſcontent of her people, England was evidently ſtaggering on the brink of ruin.</p>
               <p>The ſcheme of the federal members was to blend theſe negociations in one maſs. Their arguments and motives, when ſtript of the loquacious maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade common to both parties, might be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We have on the table before us four treaties. Of theſe, three are equally acceptable to the whole houſe; but you want to fulfil them, and to reject
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:031906_0319_0FEF47BE78A724B0"/>
the fourth. We are as deſirous as you can be for friendſhip with Spain, and for peace with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers and the Indians. But our Britiſh treaty, that you propoſe to deſtroy, is of infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance in our eyes than all the others col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, and the intereſt and independence of our country into the bargain. Grenville has adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, as American jacobins, and has aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the toad-eating Thomas Pinckney that a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh army ſhall, if we requeſt it, be ſent over to cruſh you. But if we reject this treaty, that aid cannot be expected; and that twilight of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical millenium ſhall be forever extinguiſhed, while ſo ſignal a defeat on the floor of Congreſs will give a mortal blow to the power which we at preſent poſſeſs. Mankind will begin to think and act about us with common ſenſe. They will demand <hi>a publication of the books of the treaſury.</hi> They will no longer pay intereſt for forty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of dollars of domeſtic debt to creditors, till they ſhall have learned <hi>who theſe people are?</hi> And whether William Smith, or Izard, or Hillhouſe, or Sedgwick, has waded fartheſt into the funds? This proſpect is terrible. To avert it we ſhall fall or conquer by the ſide of the treaty. If that cannot be carried, we ſhall rejoice in blocking up the Miſſiſſippi, in whetting the tomohawk, in glutting the pirates of Barbary with the plunder of our commerce.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reſolution was negatived. The three trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were agreed to. A ſecond ſeries of debates occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to the granting of money for fulfilling Jay's treaty. This ended on the firſt of May, 1796. The appropriations paſt, in committee of the whole, by the caſting vote of the chairman, Mr. Muhlenberg, the votes of members being forty-eight on each ſide. In the houſe, this appropriation paſt by fifty-one
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:031906_0320_0FEF47B2A9471BB0"/>
votes againſt forty-eight. Some even of this narrow majority, declared their entire diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the treaty. The general zeal excited in its favour, and the probability that the ſix per cent. citadel of Connecticut would have burſt into actual rebellion<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra, chap. 2d. See alſo, the ſpirit of ſome people in that ſtate, in the American Annual Regiſter, chap. 6th.</note>, were forcible reaſons in favour of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The multitude and ſtile of the addreſſes to Congreſs in its behalf were ſufficient to make thoughtful members doubtful as to rejecting it. Mr. Muhlenberg has been highly blamed for his vote on this queſtion. By an uniform tenor of conduct, ſince 1789, he had already offended the oppoſite party beyond all hope of forgiveneſs. But on this emergency, he preferred the ſecurity of internal peace, even to the approbation of his conſtituents. He had candidly ſtated his ideas in ſeveral private meetings of members previous to the final vote.</p>
               <p>The ſeſſion roſe on the 1ſt of June, 1796. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh depredations did not, as had been fondly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ceaſe after the appropriations had paſt for the treaty. As one of its conſequences the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſoon after to diſturb our trade. The weſtern poſts were, however, delivered up. The general election for Congreſs, and that for a Preſident, the difference between the French miniſter and the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican executive, were among the chief events which occurred till the next meeting of Congreſs, which was on the 5th of December 1796.</p>
