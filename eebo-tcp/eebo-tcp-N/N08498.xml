            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <byline>By STEPHEN CRISP.</byline>
            <p>THE Worſhip of God, of the Great God, is Pure; he is a Holy God, <hi>Of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</hi> and all they who will Worſhip God, whoſe Souls are breathing to have a Return of a Teſtimony in his Sight, muſt offer up pure Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and it muſt come from that which is pure: For that Purpoſe the Greatneſs of the Love of God is made manifeſt in Chriſt Jeſus; and there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing of his Grace and Virtue in the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men, whereby he hath laid a Foundation for his own Worſhip; becauſe his Worſhip muſt be pure. Therefore he hath freely given unto us, through his Son, the Knowledge of that pure Principle of Life and Grace, from whence and out of which, all true Worſhip doth ſpring, and all true Honour to God ariſeth, and real Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his holy Will ſprings forth out of that which is from himſelf.</p>
            <p>And therefore all that will be Worſhipers of God aright, muſt firſt know and be ſenſible wherein the Ability and Capacity ſtands, that may enable them to ſo great and ſo good a Work. Some have conceived it to ſtand in their own Will, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Working of their own Will, they have framed Worſhips, Religions, and Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thinking thereby to pleaſe God: But you know the Apoſtle in a few ſhort Words lays down a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtian Doctrine, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:010868_0004_0F851A8CB13605C0"/>
Now this doth declare and ſignify, that there muſt be ſomething upon which this Faith muſt work, that muſt be the Object and Foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the Creature, worketh upon ſomething; it lays hold upon ſomething in which there is a Capacity of pleaſing God. Now if <hi>we are all by Nature Children of Wrath,</hi> and that no one of himſelf can pleaſe God, then there muſt be ſomething that is ſupernatural that muſt be the Object of that Faith, by which Men alone can pleaſe God; and this muſt be made manifeſt to the Creature for its Help, for to be its Director and Supporter in that Work, that is too mighty for himſelf, too great a Work for a Man or Woman, too deep, too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found for any Man's Abilities, Power, Wiſdom, and Acquirements, that he can attain to in this World, to worſhip God aright: To worſhip God, that is, to perform a pure Worſhip to a pure God; <hi>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean?</hi> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean Worſhip, a pure Worſhip to a pure and Holy God, who hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated us and all Things; where ſhall we have it? Not out of an unclean Heart, not out of a defiled Mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the State and Condition that Men are fallen into by Sin, in which their Minds and Conſciences are defiled, their Hearts are polluted, and their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections depraved and ſet upon wrong Objects; and in this State none can ſerve God aright: That which is pure and holy muſt be firſt made known, revealed, diſcovered and believed before People can perform a right Worſhip to God.</p>
            <p>And therefore in vain it is, to go and drive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this and that Worſhip, and force People to this and that Service and Conformity, upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Worſhip of God. This is vain Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; when they have done all, it is not acceptable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010868_0005_0F851A8D689C60A8"/>
to God; the poor Creature hath no Return from the Lord, for God accepts no Service or Worſhip, but only thro' his Son. And if ſo be, Men cannot pray and preach in the Spirit of his Son, and cannot preſent their Complaints and Supplications to God, but by the Aſſiſtance and Help of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, there is no Reaſon in Religion why Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould expect a Return and Anſwer from God of the Prayers they make: For it is the general Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> That Chriſt Jeſus is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for a Mediator between God and Man, and all the Acceptance we have, or deſire to have, muſt be through him: and therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other Dutys without him; it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to think that ever we ſhould have Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in God's Sight.</p>
            <p>Therefore there is a Neceſſity for every Man and Woman that deſires to be religious, that hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Mind, and is willing to worſhip God, and ſerve God aright, there is a Neceſſity that they come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, who tells us that he is <hi>The Way to the Father:</hi> They that go any other Way, go a wrong Way; but they that go unto God by Chriſt, they do receive from him Power to draw near to God; and through him they receive from God all thoſe Bleſſings that their Souls ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>So here would be an End of all Religions the World is full of, of all the ſeveral Worſhips that Men have made: They have invented and found out ſeveral Ways for People to worſhip and ſerve God: This and the other Ceremony, this and the other Obſervation and Method of Preaching and Praying: If all this be without the Aſſiſtance and Divine Help of the Mediator, thro' whom alone we can juſtly expect Acceptance at God's Hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the firſt Leſſon of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010868_0006_0F851A8EF51D4270"/>
a Chriſtian in Point of Worſhip, is that he come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, by whom, and thro' whom he may expect Favour with God.</p>
            <p>Now ſay ſome People, We are already come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, we have read the Relation in the Goſpel of his Conception, Birth, Life and Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion: Now where this Belief doth give a Man this Kind of Chriſtian Knowledge, that doth open a Door and Way for him into the Preſence of God: This is a Queſtion that ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered, for if we err in this Queſtion, we err in all; this is like ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the Threſhold, and never come into the Houſe. If we miſtake in laying hold of Chriſt, we miſtake in our Worſhip, and in all Matters that relate to Life and Salvation.</p>
            <p>For if we muſt have another Sort of Knowledge of Chriſt, than we can have from the Reports of others; if I muſt have Chriſt revealed in me before I can have the Hope of Glory; if I muſt have the Spirit of Chriſt in me, to help me to put up my Requeſts and Supplications before he can preſent them to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then all literal Knowledge and Faith cannot ſtand Men in any Stead, but this is evident by the Teſtimony of all the Writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Chriſt and his Apoſtles did concurrently ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that the Hope of a Chriſtian, that the Power and Strength of a Chriſtian, it all lies in this, In that they had known the Revelation of Chriſt, and the powerful Operation of the Spirit working in them; this was that which was well pleaſing to God; many Scriptures might be ſpoken of, but you know the Scriptures, and can read them, and ſee in them the concurrent Teſtimony of all Holy Men to this Day, that the Knowledge they had of Chriſt was a divine Knowledge, a ſpiritual Knowledge, it was knowing him after the Spirit, it was a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010868_0007_0F851A8FA57B8908"/>
of Chriſt in them, that ſeparated and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them from Reprobates, even the Knowledge of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt their Lord: Why ſhould not we come to this Knowledge as well as they? The Lord is the ſame, and his Power is the ſame and his <hi>Arm is not ſhortened:</hi> We may ſee as much Need of divine Aſſiſtance, and divine Love as ever Men did; we can perform no Duty, either of Prayer or Preaching, without divine Aſſiſtance; not ſo much as a Sigh or Groan, that may have Acceptance with God, without the Help of his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26 <hi>The Spirit helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> If we go about the Duty of Prayer without divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we ſee what ſad Work we make of it; if we pray not in the Spirit and with the Underſtanding, how can we receive the Thing we pray for? But if we <hi>Pray in the Spirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> then the <hi>Spirit helps our Infirmities;</hi> the Spirit that came from God brings us the Things we ſtand in Need of.</p>
            <p>So that a Chriſtian hath a Foundation for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Chriſtian Performance; what is that Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nothing that is corrupt, if it be, it is good for nothing; for nothing that is corrupted and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files, can be acceptable and pleaſing to God; we are all polluted and defiled by Nature; how can carnal Men worſhip a Spiritual God? Carnal Men that are in Death and Darkneſs, cannot worſhip that God that is Light, and dwells in Light, that is inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that is <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</hi> Carnal Men want a Foundation for their Worſhip, and will do till they come to that Foundation that God hath laid.</p>
            <p>Now, that I may ſpeak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my Heart, I would ſay thus; There
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010868_0008_0F851A91C5FB5388"/>
is an univerſal Benefit and Privilege diſtributed and given freely of God, unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, in their natural State, through his Son, Jeſus Chriſt, in that he hath cauſed his Light to ſhine, and his Grace to be extended to every Man; <hi>for the Grace of God</hi> which bringeth Salvation (for it is not by Works) <hi>hath appeared unto all Men,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Light, by which every Man may ſee how to worſhip God; God hath enlightened every Man, and this Light comes by Chriſt the Mediator; this Mediator is the Way that Men muſt walk in, if they will come back again to God; for Men are run out and departed from God; if Men will draw near to God, and take ſome Footſteps towards the Kingdom of God, from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, they muſt mind the Way, the Way muſt be their Director, they muſt not go which Way they liſt.</p>
            <p>This is that which was propheſied of Chriſt, ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, I will give him for a Leader.</hi> I would fain return to God, and go out of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, to the Kingdom of God: God hath given Chriſt to lead me, if I knew that Way he will lead me in, I would go that Way. As ſoon as a Man takes hold of Chriſt, his Grace, and Spirit, and Life, he will be ready to ſay, I am corrupt, my Senſes are corrupt, my Mind is depraved, my Conſcience defiled and polluted; but I have found out ſomething that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me, that is Eſſential, Holy and Pure, that did never conſent to my Corruption, but is a Witneſs for God againſt it: Here now a Chriſtian lays hold on Chriſt, the Leader; which Way will he lead me? If thou layeſt hold of this Guide, he will lead thee out of Evil, he will teach thee to ceaſe to do Evil, and ſpeak Evil: This Light will lead thee to nothing that will diſhonour God, or defile
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010868_0009_0F851A85530DE630"/>
thy own Soul: But this is not all, we muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe to do Evil, but we muſt be doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; there muſt be a breaking off from Pride, <hi>Fooliſh Jeſting, Evil Communication;</hi> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that Leſſon, <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil.</hi> This Doctrine was preached before Chriſtianity was preached, as it is now preached; the Prophets of old preached this Doctrine to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were under an outward Adminiſtration, <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do well,</hi> then I will plead with you, and diſcourſe with you, ſaith the Lord: <hi>Come now let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſom, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt Leſſon that a true Chriſtian learns in his turning to God, in his Change and Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to ceaſe from that which is Evil:</hi> Here is a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Rebellion, and here is ſome hopes of being reconciled to God; a Man hath been a Rebel againſt his Maker, but he hath now received help to reſiſt thoſe Temptations that prevail over him; But there is no worſhiping yet, there is a forward mind in Men to do ſomething that is pleaſing to God; but there are ſome that are not troubled at all for their Evil Ways, and dread not God's Anger, but make a mock at Sin, that draws others to it, and make themſelves merry in it: But there is a Sort ſo far touched with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Senſe of God's Love to them, that they have alſo a Senſe of his Anger and Indignation, becauſe of their Sin; and they would fain be out of his Anger; and who can blame them? When a Man feels the Anger of God burning like a Fire in his Boſom, who can blame that Man if he deſire Peace with God? If he be under a Senſe of the Diſpleaſure and Indignation of the Almighty, he muſt not haſte too ſoon out of that Condition he is brought into; for this is God's Purpoſe, and this is the Fruit of all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010868_0010_0F851A92986B24F8"/>
his Troubles and Afflictions, to take away Sin: God had no other End or Deſign in the Affliction that came upon him, than to take away Sin; when God hath brought a People into a diſtreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected State for their Sin, the Fruit that God expects, is the <hi>taking away of their Sin,</hi> and he will hide Pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the Purpoſe of God that he intends to purge and purify his People; then ſaith the poor Creature, if God deſign to purify me from Sin, then I will pray to God to ſupport me, and bear me up under his Indignation: That is the Cry of the Soul that he may not be brought too ſoon from under the Judgment of God, but he may be ſupported and hid in the Hollow of God's Hand, until the Time of Remiſſion and Refreſhing comes, that he may behold the Light of God's Countenance.</p>
            <p>Here is Encouragement for every one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this divine Principle of Grace, that will be led by it, and follow it ſo far as to be led out of Evil; then they will be ſitted to do ſomething in the Work of God; every Sigh and Groan that thou haſt, the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God to help thee in, is Part of Worſhip: All thy Brokenneſs of Heart is part of Worſhip; hereby thou acknowledgeſt the great God, that he is able to help thee on in thy Way, and to pardon thy Iniquity, and blot out thy Tranſgreſſion, and give thee all thoſe heavenly Bleſſings that thy Soul doth ſtand in Need of: Then thy Soul will bow down to God in Acts of holy Worſhip, and ſay, with an humble Confidence and Expectation, God will do all thoſe things in me, and for me, that will promote my Salvation. It is nothing in Religion for People to go from Praying and Preaching to Sinning; but God muſt have a holy Sacrifice, and that muſt come out of a pure Heart:
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010868_0011_0F851A92B1A76D00"/>
Now when a Man is brought by the Help of God, and by the divine Aſſiſtance of the Mediator, Jeſus Chriſt, to break off from his Sin, then he ſtands fair to become a Child of God, and to be a Servant of God, and to do ſomething for God in his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to offer to God Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and to perform all other Duties that God ſhall lead him into.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, What, muſt we do any thing? I have deeply weighed that Queſtion, what a poor Man or Woman muſt do, that is come out of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? There is a Propenſity in People to be doing, they would fain do ſomething, they would be doing; they ſay, What ſhall I do? If I do ſomething that pleaſes not God, I had better let it alone; and I can do nothing acceptable to God without divine Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: Such an one that ſees his own Impotency and Inability, will caſt his Care upon God, and will ſay, The Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy Will, O God: Make it clear to me that this is thy Will, and that this is that which thou requireſt, I am ready to do it, tho' it be croſs to mine own Will: He is ready to go on in God's Way, in the Way of Chriſtianity; ſuch an one that hath the true Knowledge of Chriſt, if he ſpeaks, the Spirit of Chriſt ſpeaks in him; if he prays, it is through the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt, through whom God alone is appeaſed and reconciled, and through whom they may receive a Bleſſing from God's Hands: But for Men to run on in their own Wills, and to do a thing becauſe they Will do it, they had better ſit ſtill; this doing in their own Wills, hath filled the World with a Sort of Chriſtians that want Acceptance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the Want of the Guidance of God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is the Miſery and Downfal of Chriſtianity in our Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010868_0012_0F851A93933B5AE8"/>
Therefore it is our Work and Buſineſs to build upon that Foundation which God hath laid; no Worſhip is pleaſing to God, but that which ariſeth from that Spring that is pure and Holy: If I cannot find that which will keep me from all pollution and defilement, if I cannot find that, I muſt ſtay till I can; for to begin a Worſhip and a Religion without that which I know is acceptable to God, it is but loſt Labour, and Time ſpent in vain.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Friends, let every one that deſires to be religious, turn their Mind inward, wait for the Gift of God, which is eſſentially pure, that never did conſent to Evil, that never mixed with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature, but bears witneſs to the Light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you, firſt out of Sin, and then it will lead you into that Worſhip and Religion, and the Performance of thoſe Things that are pleaſing to God, They that are come to this Worſhip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he requires it of them, but they are given up into the Hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort and live according to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>It is hard for People in a carnal State to believe this; but you that are Believers, that are come to know the Gift of God in yourſelves, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being ruled by him; you will believe us, for none elſe will believe us; let us preach to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People and Nations as we will, none will receive us as true Miniſters, but thoſe that have the Truth in their own Hearts; if there be any that deſpiſeth the Grace of God in his own Heart, he hates that which chides and reproves him; if there be ſuch a Man, he will hate me becauſe I am a Miniſter and a Witneſs of the Grace of God, and of that Truth in the inward Parts, which is the Ground and Foundation that Man hath of Acceptance with God.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010868_0013_0F851A981915AD38"/>
A wicked carnal Wretch will ſay, I hate ſuch an one, I hate the Light, that which checks me, and witneſſeth againſt me; thou art ſuch an one as beareſt witneſs againſt me, therefore I hate thee: It is very true, it cannot be otherwiſe: Now our deſire and Labour is, that Men may come to the Love of the Truth in themſelves.</p>
            <p>You know there are a great many other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe Labours are to perſwade People to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they ſay; to lay down a Doctrine, and prove it by Scripture and Reaſon, and ſet it home upon their Minds by ſuch Teſtimony as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affords, and hereupon they prevail upon the Minds and Judgments of People, to believe what they lay down.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to lay down a Poſition, and prove it, and convince People that it muſt be according to Scripture; but when a Perſon is convinced of a Principle of Truth, he is not Regenerate thereby, and come to God; therefore, though he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Doctrine of Truth in Words, yet he can deny it in Works, and doth not rightly come to love it. If People would believe what we ſay, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what Argument we bring for proving a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may be convinced of the Doctrine of Truth, and come to a Profeſſion of it, and yet be Strangers to it, till they come to love it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if it were not for this, we would leave Preaching, if God had not given a Meaſure and Manifeſtation of the Spirit to every Man to profit withal: You have it in yourſelves, we are but as Monitors to you, to put you in Mind of it; you have ſo much Buſineſs in the World, that you have not had leiſure to take Notice of it.</p>
            <p>A Man may have a rich Jewel, and be poor not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, till he comes to know the Value of it. A Man hath a rich and precious Jewel, a Pearl
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010868_0014_0F851A992364AB40"/>
beſtowed upon him that would make him rich in Faith and Love to God, and qualify him for the Kingdom of God, and make him an Heir of it, but he knows not, nor underſtands the Value of it, and eſteems it not; therefore God hath raiſed up Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to put you in mind of it, that you may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py forever, and live in Bleſſedneſs to all Eternity; <hi>Whoever hath an Ear to hear, let him hear;</hi> and when they hear what we ſay, let them take the Benefit of it to their own Souls. We bring not Truth to you, but God hath beſtowed it upon you; you will be rich indeed, if you do as a Man that bought a Field where the precious Pearl was, and digged till he found it. Come to the Foundation upon which you ſhould build all your Hopes of Happineſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon your own Works, or religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, for Acceptance with God; for there is no Acceptance with God, but only through Chriſt, we are only accepted of God through him: Thoſe that will become Chriſtians indeed, and worſhip God as he hath ordained and appointed himſelf to be worſhipped; they muſt come to the Principle of Light and Grace in their own Hearts, which they have in, and through Chriſt, and they will find Acceptance with God.</p>

            <p>YOU have read and heard much concerning the Day of the Lord, as a great and notable Day; many of you are now living Witneſſes that the great and notable Day of the Lord is coming, in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010868_0015_0F851A9997908050"/>
which the Accompliſhment of great and notable Things, the mighty Works of God, which have been propheſied of, may be lawfully expected. It is the Work of every Chriſtian to wait upon the Lord in the Light of this Day, and to be acquainted with the Works of the Lord, both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; for the Day of the Lord is a Day of Power, and that Power of God worketh wonderful Things; and if we were not kept in the Light of that Day, the Lord may work great things, and we not know it; we ſhall be looked upon as careleſs and negligent Witneſſes of the Works of the Lord, as thoſe that do not regard them. If you would be faithful Witneſſes, you muſt have regard to the Works of the Lord, and the Operation of his Hands. One that is minded to be a faithful Witneſs, he will take Notice of what is ſaid and done; you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Witneſſes of the Works of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of his doings; you muſt ſtand where you may hear, and ſee, and underſtand what the Lord is about to do at this Time.</p>
            <p>In your Teſtimony and Witneſs bearing, the greateſt Thing we have to expect in this Day of the Lord is, that God will ſet up the Kingdom of his Son Chriſt Jeſus; and unto this all the Prophets did bear witneſs in their Time, and now it is our Turn to bear witneſs of it by ſenſible and living Experiences of the Accompliſhment of thoſe Things that they propheſied of, that the Lord will ſet up the Kingdom of Chriſt, and bring down and lay waſte the Kingdom of Antichriſt. This our Saviour taught his Diſciples to pray for, ſixteen hundred Years ago, that the Kingdom of God might come; and all the true Diſciples of Chriſt ever ſince have prayed for the coming of this Kingdom, and many of them have ſeen the coming of it, and rejoiced;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010868_0016_0F851A9A2C9237A0"/>
and others have died in the Faith of it, and have been gathered into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But, my Friends, that which chiefly concerns us at this Day, is to behold the Kingdom of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, within us, to go forward and proſper; and the Kingdom of Antichriſt ſuppreſſed and deſtroyed, and utterly laid waſte; and this is wrought two Ways, 1. Inwardly. 2. Outwardly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Inwardly, There is a greater Inclination in the Minds of People, to look more at the Operation of God's Power in this great Work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there muſt be a daily Croſs taken up, and it is my Buſineſs at this Time to tell you in the Name of the Lord, that your Duty and mine is to turn our Minds to the Working of the Power of God in ourſelves, and to ſee that other Kingdom of the Man of Sin weakned and brought down within us; then there is no Fear but he will carry on his Work outwardly, and we ſhall ſee as much of that Work as belongs to our Generation; but the great Matter and chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of you and me, is to ſee the Kingdom of God ſet up within us, which ſtands in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs: Our Buſineſs is to walk till we ſee the Righteouſneſs of this Kingdom ſet up within us in our Hearts and Souls, and to have a real change made.</p>
            <p>We all know, and we muſt confeſs, that we have been ſubject to the Man of Sin, whatſoever we are now. We have ſeen the Reign and Government, the Rage and Tyranny of the Wicked One that hath led us into Rebellion and Diſobedience to the Lord our Maker; how do we like that Government to be ruled by the Devil, and to be led Captive, and to be made to do his Will, and to rebel againſt God that gave us our Life, and our Breath, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010868_0017_0F851A9B008EE220"/>
our Being? How do we like that Government of Satan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was ſo with me, and they that are under the tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Satan, have many Cries and Wiſhes in their Souls that they were freed and delivered from it, and brought under the Government and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt Jeſus; and they were able to ſerve God as they ought to do, that they might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, into the Kingdom of the bleſſed and dearly beloved Son of God.</p>
            <p>This hath been the Cry of ſome ever ſince they have known the World; and I am perſwaded it is the Cry of many at this Day: I have good News to bring you; not that the Day of your Redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the Day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is now come, and there are a great many bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glorifying the Name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the Bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and have more Joy and Delight in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, that made them, than ever they had in the Service of the God of this World.</p>
            <p>But may not ſome ſay, How ſhall this great Work be wrought; for it is a great Work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it? For there are many in this Aſſembly have been try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no Purpoſe, and done what they could in their own Strength, to deliver their own Souls from Death, and yet they find themſelves in Bondage ſtill; nay, they have called in the Help and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe that they thought to be ſtronger than themſelves, and all have ſailed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find themſelves at Liberty to ſerve the Lord as they ought to do.</p>
            <p>I am of this Mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you come to my Experience, to know this as I have done, then
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010868_0018_0F851A9C12514520"/>
I hope you will ſeek after that, and you will ſee good Reaſon for it; and you will then come to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, If the Lord puts not forth his Almighty Power, I muſt then periſh, for there is no other Power can deliver me: When you come to know this, what muſt you do? Why, you muſt wait for the Revelation of that Power that will take you off from all Truſt and Confidence that you have ever had in any Thing elſe; a Man that hath nothing to truſt to but the Almighty Power, and Mercy, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, he puts his whole Truſt and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence therein, or elſe he knows he muſt periſh.</p>
            <p>When a Man or Woman comes to this paſs, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the firſt Ground or Motive of our ſetting up Meetings; and I would to God that this was the uſe that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be juſtly and properly uſed according to the End of the Inſtitution of them at firſt; we ſhould uſe them as poor deſolate help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs People that are broken off from all their own Confidence and Truſt, and have nothing to rely upon but the Mercy and Goodneſs of God; and if he pleaſeth to reveal his Power among us, we know that he is able to ſave us; and we have met with the Revelation of God's Power; and when we have met together in Simplicity of Mind, the Lord was pleaſed to communicate his Spirit to us, and open a Door for us, and diſcover and reveal to us that it was the Day of his Power: And when we came to examine ourſelves whether we were willing in this Day of God's Power (for the Prophet gives us a Note of Diſtinction between the People of God, and other People; <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, God diſcovers and reveals his Power to them, ſuch a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010868_0019_0F851A9C854D7BA0"/>
People are willing to give themſelves over to the Government of it, when we found we were ſubject to it) we had Joy in believing, before we attained the End of our Hope; it was Gladneſs to us we found ourſelves willing; and I am perſwaded that every one of you would be glad to find yourſelves willing to part with that which you cry out of.</p>
            <p>What a Cry is there of our Bondage and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of our being led Captive by our Luſts? We may hear ſuch a Cry from one End of the Kingdom to the other: People cry out of the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Corruption, and of their Subjection to Sin and Satan: I would they were in earneſt; there is not that Earneſtneſs and Reality in Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that God looks for, and ſo there comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. There is no Redemption, and no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a-days into his Preſence, to offer up their Prayers: I would have you to be in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, I wiſh well to you all; and it would be hard to ſay that you do not wiſh well to yourſelves: Here lies your Welfare, that you find yourſelves willing to be ſubject to the Power that made you; you have been ſubject doubtleſs to the Power that deſtroyed you; that Power that never gave you Life and Breath, hath been inſtrumental of your Deſtruction: The Power of the God of this World never did Men good, but deſtroyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their Lives.</p>
            <p>Now if their was but a Willingneſs in every one of us, freely to give up our ſelves to that Power that created us to obey his Will: I am ſure there is never a Man or Woman among us ſhall long be without the knowledge of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If I am but willing to be ſubject to the Law of him that made me, it will not be long before he diſcover it to me, and reveal his Power in me in the Glory and Excellency of it; that Power
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010868_0020_0F851A9D31D3F758"/>
which is more able to preſerve me than all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Men on Earth, or all the Power of the Devils in Hell is able to deſtroy me. When the Lord ſhall diſcover and reveal his Power in you, you will be willing to be ſubject to it.</p>
            <p>But methinks the Sound and Noiſe of Fleſh and Blood grows loud here: I would be ſubject to God, but I would not have him croſs mine Intereſt, and deprive me of that I love and thirſt after; I would not have him imbitter my carnal Delights and Pleaſures, and undo me as to my Reputation in the World.</p>
            <p>You may ſee whence this comes, that you would make a Bargain, and draw a Contract with the God of your Lives about theſe Things, this is a nonſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Thing; becauſe of all People in the World, you are a People that have had a Veneration for the Holy Scriptures, the Scriptures of Truth, and have been acquainted with them ſo familiarly as with any Book in the World, wherein you find Articles drawn, long ago fixed and ſealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my Diſciple, <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Thomas, James</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or whoſoever he be, he muſt take up his Daily-Croſs, and deny himſelf, and follow me. Now here is a Contract made, therefore turn aſide from all Kind of Reaſoning and Conſulting with Fleſh and Blood.</p>
            <p>If you will become ſpiritual, and partake of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings and Benefits, I would adviſe you to turn from all Kind of Reaſonings that come from the Pit of Darkneſs, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you for ever, if you hearken to them: For aſſure yourſelves new Goſpel-Terms no Man can make; and if any come to preach new Goſpel-Terms, count him a Deceiver; for there is no poſſibility of being a Diſciple of Chriſt, but by taking up a Croſs daily, and denying ourſelves, and following him as our Leader and Guide. To him
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010868_0021_0F851A9E8B73ABD0"/>
I muſt go, and go in no other Way, ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he muſt conduct me in my Walking, guide me in my Way, and juſtify me in it: This is to be a true Diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he comes to adhere, and join to the Power of God revealed in his Soul, he ſees the coming of the Kingdom of God, he ſees it at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he ſaith within himſelf, and makes this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I will follow my Captain, I will become ſubject to the Kingdom of Chriſt. If I obey this divine Principle of the Grace of God, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, I ſhall be his Diſciple. I read in his bleſſed Book, <hi>That as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Children of God.</hi> I am not to propoſe new Terms, but accept of the old Terms of the Goſpel of Chriſt: I ſee that the Kingdom of God is to be ſet up, and the Kingdom of the Devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſhould never follow the Devil more; if he would have me lye, I ſhall refuſe, and ſay I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt Communication, and fooliſh Jeſting, that will be a Bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak now to Perſons that live under the Light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and that are ſubdued by his Grace; I would ſpeak that which all the Logick in the World cannot overthrow, that which the moſt cunning Logician, with all his Wit and Quirks, cannot refute and prove erronious. If a Man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot Lie; this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cure for all Men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the Principle of Truth in my own Soul; this will cure and heal me of the Wounds and Maladies of my corrupt Nature, and ſet me at Liberty from my old Maſter; I do not like his Service.</p>

            <p>But where is the Power? You will ſay knocking at the Door of the Heart, and Checks of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we underſtand them; but we undeſtand not where the Power is, to be conformable to the Will of God.</p>

People will never underſtand it while they are in the Kingdom of Satan, and under the Power of the Prince of Darkneſs; the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them.</hi> If Men ſaw the Beauty of the Goſpel, they would run after it, and embrace it; therefore the Devil blinds their Minds, that they ſhould not ſee the Beauty and Amiableneſs of the Goſpel, and like the Terms of it: He hath the Rule and Government of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience. So long as I live in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to that deviliſh helliſh Power, which leads me forth into Sin: I ſhall be a Stranger to God's Power, that would enable me to break off from it.</p>
            <p>You never read in Scripture of any that ever came to be ſaved by the Power of God, but there was Faith mixed with it, that came to join with that Power of God.

            <p>As ſoon as the Soul of Man joins with the Grace of God, he doth forſake the Service of his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Governor, Sin ſhall no longer have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over him; though he may meet with the ſame Temptation, it ſhall not have the ſame Power over him, but he will be enabled, by the Grace of God to withſtand it, and overcome it. If you aſk ſuch a Man how it is that he overcomes that Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that formerly prevailed over him; he will tell you, I have now an Helper, I am now joined to the Grace of God in my Soul, therefore do I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Temptations, and have Power over them. Thus comes the Kingdom of Chriſt to be ſet up in the Soul, and this is that which will fit and prepare
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010868_0024_0F851AA0E6CDD680"/>
us for the everlaſting Kingdom of God: They that do wait upon God, ſhall ſee this Work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by Faith than they can ſee by Senſe.</p>
            <p>I know and am certain, that the Power the Devil hath in the World, ſhall be broken down, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be exalted, and Juſtice and Equity ſhall prevail in the Nations. I ſhall not perhaps live to ſee it, but I may ſee it by Faith; I have ſeen enough for my Generation, and they that live in the next Generation ſhall ſee it alſo, for the Church of God is the ſame from one Generation to another. Now unto us it is given to ſee the Things that in former Generations were propheſied of, God having (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>provided ſome better Thing for us, that they without us ſhall not be made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of God from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have their Meaſure and Degree of Service, and bear their proper Teſtimony, and leave the Reſt to ſucceeding Generations: It concerns us in our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to ſee a Change made inwardly in our Souls, and the Kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us, and the Kingdom of Satan brought down in ourſelves. This doth not concern my Son or Grandſon only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature Age, in their Time it will concern them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is moſt profitable to us, is, that we have ſuch a Station, and ſtand in ſuch a Place in our Time, where we may ſee the Work of God carried on.</p>
            <p>I have conſidered many a Time, that there are many brave Men and Women in this Age, that might have been eminent Witneſſes of God in this World, and born their Teſtimony to his Truth, but their Faith hath been weak and ineffectual: They have diſcovered their unbelieving Hearts, and have joined with the common Herd of the World, becauſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010868_0025_0F851AA223C03CA8"/>
they thought ſuch great Things could never be done, that the Kingdom of Satan could never be pulled down and deſtroyed, and the Kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us. But I would hope better Things of you, Things that accompany Salvation and that he that hath begun a good Work in you will carry it on to Perfection; that living Praiſes and joyful Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings may be rendered to him who alone is worthy, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever; to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>O How happy are they that have Bread in their own Houſes! and that can draw Water out of their own Wells! Theſe have a bleſſed glorious Dwelling-Place, theſe are the Children that their Father provides for: All the divine Treaſures and the Riches of heavenly Things are laid up for theſe; O that all that have a Sight of this bleſſed State, were got into it! that their Minds might not more wander, that People might not be ſcattered in their Thoughts, that when they meet together, they might have their Expectations entirely from that God whom they profeſs to worſhip: <hi>Lord thou haſt ſaid that thou wilt teach thy People thyſelf;</hi> here a Cry goes up to the Lord, and their Expectations thro' Faith pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; they never meet in vain, but a <hi>Well ſprings up,</hi> and <hi>the Water of Life comes</hi> to them, by which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010868_0026_0F851AA2D3C16750"/>
they meet with divine Refreſhments; for, you know, the Promiſe that our Lord made to his Diſciples, <hi>He that drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt more.</hi> Why, will once drinking ſerve? Becauſe I have taſted of the living Water that the Lord Chriſt gives me; will that ſerve? No, but he giveth me a ſubſtantial River, that is the Reaſon why I ſhall thirſt no more, it ſhall be in me a <hi>Well of living Water, ſpringing up to everlaſting Life;</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the Witneſſes of it; theſe are they that are ſatisfied concerning Religion and Doctrine, they are ſatisfied concerning Worſhip, they are looking after no new Things; when they meet together, they meet in the Name of the Lord, and they have their Eyes to him, who is a Fountain, and they diſcern a Brightneſs and a Glory that is unſpeakable: and the Glory that is ſpeakable, that appears many Times through Inſtruments, will not ſatisfy them; there is ſomething beyond that, which muſt ſatisfy; this will never do it: People will never be ſatisfied with hearing, nor never ſatisfied with ſeeing, till they come to hear and ſee <hi>that which is unutterable,</hi> and then they are ſatisfied; Chriſt had preached many Sermons in the hearing of his Diſciples, and there were a great many ſaid, <hi>That there was never any Man ſpake like him,</hi> preached like him; yet one of them that was neareſt to him, and moſt acquainted and intimate with him, after ſome Years meeting and hearing of his Sermons, he cries out, <hi>Shew us the Father and it ſufficeth us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Friends, this comes near to many of your States; many of you have heard long, and have heard the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be ſpoken forth, by the Demonſtration of the Holy Ghoſt, by them <hi>that have received it of the Father;</hi> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a ſerious Search,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010868_0027_0F851AA325B8D088"/>
you will find a Want, you will find ſtill that you have not that Satisfaction that puts you beyond Doubt, beyond Fear; there is ſomething that ſtands in the Way, that hinders your Enjoyment of the unſpeakable Glory of the unſpeakable Word, and this will never be removed, but by your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſubmittting to the Work of the Power of God in your own Hearts, that ſo you may not only be Believers, but come to be really baptized, and then all is out of Doubt; for our Lord ſaid, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he doth not ſay, He may be ſaved, but, He ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Woful Experience hath told us in our Days, That a great many have believed the Truth, and yet they are never like to be ſaved, they <hi>have made ſhipwreck of their Faith;</hi> but if they had been baptized, if they would have endured the Baptiſm, if they would have been buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, they ſhould have been ſaved every one of them; and now there are a great many that remain in the Belief of the Truth, and yet they are not baptized, they are not dead, not buried, notwithſtanding <hi>they have received like precious Faith with us,</hi> that <hi>Faith which is of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God,</hi> and that <hi>is like precious</hi> in its Nature to all that do receive it, and would work the ſame Effect in all too, if it were not obſtructed; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have received Faith towards the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Souls, yet their Souls are Captives, their Souls are ſubject to Luſts, and Pleaſures, and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and unto empty and fooliſh Things, and to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Corruptions, after they have received Faith.</p>
            <p>For if you take one that is a Believer of Truth, that is overtaken with his Luſt, and Paſſions, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he will commonly own that he believeth the contrary, he believeth that theſe Things ſhould not be, that it ought to be otherwiſe: This is the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Truth againſt Untruth: If it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010868_0028_0F851AA3F401FAE8"/>
why is it thus then? Why, he finds a Life to ſpring up in that which is corruptible, that is always contrary to the Life of God, and at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with it: What ſhall I do? I believe the Truth, I know it is an holy Thing, it leads all that ſubmits to it to an holy Life, and there is this and that unholy Thing, this and that corrupt Thing remains, what ſhall I do?</p>
            <p>It is an evident Demonſtration that thou wanteſt the Baptiſm of him in <hi>whom thou believeſt;</hi> thou haſt believed in Chriſt Jeſus that cometh after <hi>John,</hi> and was before him; and now having believed in him, thou wanteſt to be baptized by him, and for want of that, the Pollution and Corruption that was grown up in thy Nature, in the Time of thy Alienation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails ſtill upon thee, contrary to thy Faith; and there is no coming to obtain this Baptiſm, but by ſinking down into that which will ſlay thee, that which will kill thee: But there is ſuch a ſhifting to ſave ones Life, there are ſo many Twiſtings and Twinings of People to ſave their Lives, that at laſt they loſe them; but there are none that could ever find that Life that is eternal, but thoſe that are willing to be given up to the Dead, and ſubmit to this Baptiſm, that is, by the Holy Ghoſt and by Fire: Theſe only do come to Life, they come to the Reſurrection, for you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any that died this Death but they roſe again; it is as impoſſible for Death to hold any one down that is buried in this Baptiſm, as it was impoſſible to hold Chriſt down, when he was in the Grave; <hi>The ſame Power that brought again our Lord Chriſt from the Dead, the ſame Power it is that quickens us,</hi> while we remain in theſe mortal Bodies, after we have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Death and Crucifiction.</p>
            <p>But who can believe this Saying? for <hi>this is a hard Saying, who can bear it?</hi> Is it not enough that I am a Believer, which makes me a Friend, and entitles
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010868_0029_0F851AA62C862D98"/>
me to a Community among you, and as long as I hold the Truth, and profeſs the Truth, I am looked upon as one of your Society? This is very true, this doth entitle People unto the outward Privileges of the Church of Chriſt; but there is another inner Court, that lies under the Angel's Reed, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring-Reed, that is to be meaſured, the Temple is meaſured, and every Worſhipper in the Temple is meaſured; there was an outward Court, that was for repreſenting the Church of God in general, from the particular; the outward Court was not meaſured, that the Gentiles might come in; the unbaptized People, which were never regenerated, they might come ſo far as the outward Court, but this did not entitle them to the Privileges of the Houſe of God, nor to any Worſhip or Sacrifice that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted upon God's Altar.</p>
            <p>It concerns you and me (my Friends) to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about Matters of this Moment and Importance, and not ſpend your Days, and, as it were ſpeak by rote, under an airy Profeſſion, though of Truth itſelf, without conſidering what Progreſs you have made, what Benefit you have obtained, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are come not only to <hi>the Shadow of good Things to come,</hi> but to the very Subſtance of the heavenly Things; <hi>for the Comers to the outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, could never with thoſe Sacrifices they offer'd be made perfect; the Comers thereunto were not made perfect as to the Things pertaining to the Conſcience,</hi> ſpeaking there of the outward Worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. but coming to the heavenly Things, whereof the other were but a Shadow, they made People perfect, as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and did bring them to Salvation. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle alludes to this Baptiſm, for he ſpeaks in a Figure of the <hi>Eight Perſons that were ſaved in</hi> Noah's <hi>Ark;</hi> then he brings down the Allegory to Chriſtian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, not only the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> the Fore-runner of Chriſt, that preached of Chriſt, but to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010868_0030_0F851AA74922E5D0"/>
Baptiſm itſelf; <hi>By the like Figure whereof Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not the putting away of the Filth if the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience.</hi> What doth he mean by Baptiſm ſaving us? He means, <hi>the Anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, through the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead;</hi> ſo that Chriſtian Baptiſm did bring along with it the <hi>cleanſing and putting away of all Sin out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> that might bring them under Doubts and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and then there is an ariſing of Jeſus, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Conſcience, the Mediator that brought them to anſwer for them in the Sight of God; for if People be conſcious of Sin; and do leave off their Sin, this doth not yet cleanſe the Conſcience; for their ſtill remains a Conſcience of Sin; 'tis not the leaving off our Sin that makes our Attonement with God, or that expiates our Guilt, or doth away the Guilt of the Sins that we have committed; but there muſt be a Forſaking and a Leaving off Sin by the Virtue and Power of the Spirit, by which we are enabled, not only to leave off Sin, but are guided and directed to the Mediator, <hi>whoſe Blood alone reconcileth us to God, and cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> If I ſhould never commit a Sin while I live, it is not this ſimply in itſelf that will make me have the Anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Sight of God; for there remains the Guilt of Sin contracted in the Days of Unbelief, which is a Bar and Hindrance that none can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Holy God but in the Attonement and Salvation that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; for all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Goſpel are accepted in Chriſt, and upon the Account of Chriſt's precious Blood, that cleanſeth us from all Sin and Unrighteouſneſs. Whom doth it cleanſe? Thoſe only that forſake their Sins, and by his Power are brought to a holy Life; they by the Virtue of his Power, and the Cleanſing of his Blood, come to have their former Sins removed from them, as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010868_0031_0F851AA7AB1B9178"/>
But what is this to them that remain in their Sins? what is this <hi>to them that are not baptized? for the Dead that have not put off the old Man, nor put on the new Man,</hi> but have only put on the Name and Profeſſion of Chriſt, and put on the Outſide of him, his Garment, but have not put him on, the are not <hi>created again in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> unto <hi>good Works, that they might walk in them?</hi> No wonder there remains a Conſcience of Sin in them, there is a Bar that hinders them from the Sight of the Glory of God, and from real and true Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, concerning their Attonement and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, and this hinders them from the Enjoyment of <hi>that Peace that paſſeth underſtanding;</hi> and it is no Wonder, becauſe they are not come to this Baptiſm that brings the <hi>Anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the Sight of God.;</hi> they are not riſen with Chriſt; how ſhould they? for they are not buried with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as were baptiſed into Chriſt, were baptiſed into his Death; therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life;</hi> here is a Change figured out between them that had partaken of the ſpiritual Baptiſm, and were come again to the Participation of Life in the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt and thoſe that were not baptized.</p>
            <p>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the Truth, and make a Profeſſion of it; there is a Way caſt up, and there is a Door opened for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the grand Queſtion that every one ought to enquire about, and put to themſelves, is, What Progreſs they have made in this Way? Whether they are baptized yet or no? Whether they have <hi>put off the old Man with his Deeds, and put on the new Man and the new Man's Deeds, which are Righteouſneſs and Holineſs?</hi> They that find that, though they are Believers, they are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010868_0032_0F851AA866CAC170"/>
ſhort of this, they do alſo find that their Shortneſs is their Hindrance, their Shortneſs in not coming up to the Pattern that hath been ſhewed them, is their Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, ſo that they enjoy not the things here ſpoken of the being under this Senſe, and really ſitting under this Senſe in a Meeting, though there ſhould be no Man ſpeaking to them outwardly, yet being come to this Faith and made Partakers of this Bapiſm, People would find in their own Boſoms the hidden Word of Life miniſtring to their Condition; they would have enough, there would not be a Famine of the Word unto them, nor they ſhould not need to be in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of going out to this or the other Inſtrument, but they would be ſatisfied when they are met together with the Preſence of the Lord, that the Lord is in the midſt of them, miniſtring them the Word of Life, in his Operating and Working, ſpeaking in a Tongue that every one can underſtand it, ſpeaking with a kind of Voice and Language, that every one may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his own State and Condition; and this is the way that God brought up People from the Beginning, to the Knowledge of Heavenly Things, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Myſteries of Salvation; we had it not of Men but of Jeſus our Lord; he was our great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, we waited upon him, and truſted in him, and he taught us himſelf; he hath miniſtred to us at our ſilent and quiet Waiting upon him thoſe Things that were convenient for us; we might well ſay, <hi>He gave us our Food in due Seaſon;</hi> he hath not only given <hi>ſtrong Meat unto Men,</hi> but hath miniſtred of the <hi>ſincere Milk of his Word unto Babes,</hi> that lived in Sincerity and Self-denial, loving God above all things; and he taught and conducted us in our Way, this Way of Simplicity, until our Underſtandings came to be opened, until our Souls came to be prepared to receive the Myſteries of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In thoſe Days there were ſome that ſtarted up in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010868_0033_0F851AA9254A72A0"/>
Knowledge, and that <hi>built their Neſts on high, and took Flax and Wool, and Silver and Gold, and decked themſelves with them;</hi> but the Lord found them out, and brought them down, and took the Crown from their Head, and cloathed them with Diſhonour: So God doth from Age to Age, his Judgment will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at his own Houſe if you would <hi>Grow in the Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then grow in Humility and Self-denial, and keep a conſtant watch upon your Hearts, examine your Hearts, and <hi>Commune with your ſelves upon your Beds, and be ſtill;</hi> take Heed leſt you ſin againſt the Lord, and provoke him: <hi>There were ſome that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord of old, and they committed two great Evils, What be they? They have gone away and forſaken the Fountain of living Water;</hi> as much as to ſay, they have not their Dependance upon an inviſible Power, as they ought to have; for I am a living Fountain, and 'tis by an inviſible Power that I am able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and teach, direct, and purify and open their Underſtanding; but they have forſaken me, that is one great Evil; and the other is, they would not be without ſomewhat, <hi>they have forſaken the Lord,</hi> and they would have ſomewhat inſtead of God; <hi>They have digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns, that will hold no Water.</hi> And how many in this Age have committed theſe two great Evils?</p>
            <p>My Friends, examine your ſelves; are there not many that have been guilty of theſe two great Evils? They do not keep their cloſe Dependance, Truſt and Reliance upon the inviſible Power of God, as they profeſs they ought to do, but are hurried away from it; ſome by the Love of the World, ſome by Luſts and Pleaſures, ſome by Paſſions, and others by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſts, are drawn away from the Power, to do and ſay that which the Power is againſt: Is not this a Forſaking of the Lord, the living Fountain? What
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010868_0034_0F851AAA8FB43F98"/>
do they do then? Are they not for this and that, and the other Man? for hearing this and the other Man's Word, and <hi>digging to themſelves bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Ciſterns?</hi> And have they not their Truſt and Confidence in going to Meetings, in commending this and the other Way? Have they not their truſt in their Profeſſion outwardly, when it miniſters nothing to their Souls, ſo that they ſecretly wither for all this? If you had all the Men and Angels that were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſent of God, appointed to preach to you, that could not miniſter Life to you, unleſs there be that Faith that ſtands in the Power of God. The Faith that ſtands in any Mans Words, that will not overcome your Luſts: but the Faith that ſtands in the Power <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Hearty,</hi> it will not ſuffer any unclean thing there. As for Preaching, let a Man preach againſt this and the other Luſt and Corruption, there it will remain for all his Preaching, unleſs Men know Gods Power and Life in which there is Righteouſneſs; for Words and Knowledge, and Sight and Speculation, will never give People Victory over their Sins.</p>
            <p>Therefore you know, every one who is ſettled muſt be ſettled where the Foundation of Religion is; it is not coming to Meetings, and owning this and the other Doctrine which is the Foundation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; God hath revealed his Power to every one of us; God hath not given his Spirit to Preachers and Prophets only, for then there would be a <hi>Famine of the Word,</hi> as was in <hi>Iſrael, The Prieſt's Lips pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Knowledge.</hi> If you did take away the Prieſt, you did take away their Knowledge. The Prophets had the Word of God, and they only ſpake the Word of God. If the Prophet was taken away, then the Word of God was taken away. The Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſend a Famine among them, they grieved and vexed, and killed and deſtroyed the Prieſts and Prophets; therefore, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſend a</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:010868_0035_0F851AAAA5DF1D38"/>
               <hi>Famine among you, not of Bread, but of the Word, and they ſhall go from City to City, and enquire for the Word of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was in the Jewiſh Church; if there was a Prophet they would go 30, 40, or 100 Miles to him that had the Word of the Lord; <hi>They ſhall go from City to City to enquire for the Word of the Lord:</hi> But bleſſed be God we are come to another Day, for now the Word of the Lord is manifeſted in the Hearts of all that believe; they know the Word: I do not ſay all that believe do preach the Word, or ought to preach; but the Word preacheth to them; they are not as <hi>broken Ciſterns that can hold no Water;</hi> when they find the Word and hear it, they ſpeak it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently what is miniſtred to their own Condition, that they tell to other Folks; when People come to the Bleſſing of this Diſpenſation that God's Word revealeth in their Hearts, they then know what the Signification of it is, they underſtand the Doctrine of it, the Doctrine preacheth Holineſs to them, not that they ſhould preach Holineſs and yet remain Unholy; not that they ſhould preach Humility, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Proud: It preacheth Holineſs, Humility and Singleneſs of Heart to a Remnant, that like good Scholars and Diſciples learn the Leſſons and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Now when thou haſt learned them well, and art come to ſee the Effect of the Word, and doſt bring forth the Deeds and Works which are the Fruits of Holineſs, <hi>Perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God, and with Humility known and witneſſed in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and art not only meek in Shew, but <hi>meek and low in Heart;</hi> when People come to be meek and lowly, and of a clear Conſcience, <hi>purged front all dead Works to ſerve the living God;</hi> then if the Lord gives them a Word of Exhortation, of Doctrine or Counſel, it is very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and it hath a Savour through the Bleſſing of God, and they come by it to be <hi>built up in their moſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010868_0036_0F851AAB65598600"/>
holy Faith,</hi> and this Word is brought forth in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs in their Lives, and ſhews it ſelf in a Life of Holineſs; then thou wilt ſhine in thy Converſation to all that thou converſeſt with, ſo that they may ſee thee to be ſuch a Man or Woman as haſt been with Jeſus, and learned of Jeſus, and receivedſt <hi>a Word engrafted;</hi> when thou doſt receive the Word into thy Heart, there is the Engrafting of it: If it hath not Root there, then, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My Word doth not abide in you.</hi> If you feel ſomething of this inviſible Word in your Hearts, it brings you to a Reſolution to ſerve God, and to keep your ſelves from Sin, and to anſwer the Profeſſion which you make of God; this is the Effect of the Word of God, if it doth abide in you. Doth it abide? You ſhall know anon or To-morrow, ſo ſoon as a Temptation comes to ſtir you up to Pride or Paſſion, to Fraud or Deceit, then you will ſee whether the Word abide: If it abide, you ſin not.</p>
            <p>This is Scripture, a certain Foundation Doctrine, that may be as ſafely preached as any Doctrine: If the Word abide in you, you ſin not; What of that? Let the Word go, and you will ſin, when ever you are tempted to it. <hi>I write to you young Men, becauſe you have overcome the wicked One, you are ſtrong and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked One.</hi> We ſhall ſee as ſoon as Temptation meets with thee, whether the Word abides in thee; if it abide, thou wilt not Sin, but reſiſt the Tempter. Set thy Foot upon the Temptation, and go over it, and thou wilt have the Dominion; and this will make thee a free Man or Woman, and thou wilt <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth them free, and that they have got Dominion; then <hi>Stand faſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> It is a Liberty not of Luſt and Sin, but a
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010868_0037_0F851AADA3D95288"/>
Liberty of the Soul; the Soul now is not at the Devil's Will and Call.</p>
            <p>For it is a Shame to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, that we profeſs Things, and yet deny them in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: We profeſs that there is a Power in Chirſt to keep and preſerve us out of Sin, and we profeſs to believe that this Power is communicated to them that do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for their Preſervation; that is, he will not with-hold it from them: We profeſs theſe Things in the Face of the whole World; and yet when the Devil calls one Man to Covetouſneſs, and another to defraud his Neighbour, and another to defile himſelf, he is drawn away thereby; what Hypocriſy is here, to profeſs this, and act the contrary? I do not wonder that they who profeſs they cannot live a Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, that they ſhould fall; but they that profeſs to believe there is Power enough in Chriſt, and that it is offered to them; for them to live in Sin and yield to Temptation, this is horrid Wickedneſs. They that are of an upright ſingle Mind, would die before they would ſin, knowing that God is Almighty and gracious, and willing to beſtow his Power and Wiſdom, and Grace upon them that aſk it; they would die rather than ſin againſt God preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: Let it coſt me my Goods, my Eſtate, my Liberty, or my Life, <hi>How can I do this great Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and Sin againſt God?</hi> They love God above all; you never heard them complain that they wanted Power, <hi>For the Lord is at their right Hand, and they ſhall not be moved.</hi> They cannot fall; tho' they are tempted, they will not fall into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They have Power when they ſee the Devil before them, to put him behind them; the Nobility of their Extract, of their new Birth and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puts ſuch a Temper and Diſpoſition into their Souls, that they ſcorn to be at the Devil's Command, as if they were his Children.</p>

Oh! It is a noble and honourable thing to be a Child of God, a very high Dignity to be in ſuch an honourable Relation to God, and to have a Right to the heavenly Manſions, <hi>To ſit down in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I would to God you were all ready for it, that you had the Wedding Garment on, that you might not be <hi>bound Hand and Foot, and caſt into utter Darkneſs.</hi> What is the Reaſon that you do not ſit down in this heavenly Frame and Temper, and draw the Waters of Salvation out of your own Souls: Could the Lord do any Thing more than he hath done, and could his Servants do any more than they have done for your Help? Are not their Labours Demonſtrations of it? We have been <hi>as Epiſtles of Chriſt written in your Conſciences:</hi> We have been teſtifying that there is ſomething want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in too many, the Want of reſigning up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Baptiſm of the Croſs. People are willing to be counted Friends; but they are Friends of God, <hi>that do whatſoever he commandeth them;</hi> that is the Chriſtian Leſſon, not to ſay I will be a Friend to you, and a Friend to the Church, and to ſuch a Sort of People; but I will be a Friend of God, and do whatſoever he commandeth me; whatſoever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand God lays upon you, either to take up a Croſs, or to deny yourſelves and follow him.</p>
            <p>Learn this Leſſon, and you will be Diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and Members of the Church too; not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church privileged outwardly only, but <hi>Members of a Church of the Firſt-born, and you will have your Names written in Heaven;</hi> when one comes to have his Name written in Heaven, he comes to know his Name, 'tis a <hi>white Stone,</hi> not a ſpeckled one; they that have it, they know it, they are not ignorant of one another's Names that are written in this Book; they have a Fellowſhip that no body can declare; their Communion is in that Bread and that

Cup: This is a Cup of Bleſſing indeed, and this hath bleſſed us, and will bleſs us: God will preſerve a People in this Fellowſhip. You that are at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance now, you muſt come nearer to him; God will chuſe a People by whom his Name ſhall be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; becauſe <hi>the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts,</hi> we cannot but deſire this for all, <hi>eſpecially for the Houſhold of Faith;</hi> we cannot but deſire their Perfection, their growing up in the Grace of God, that they might come to be Partakers of Heaven. And in the next Place, our Love is to all People, every where; we would be glad <hi>that all were ſaved;</hi> they that deſpiſe us when we are ſpeaking of heavenly Things, ſpeaking like a Child, like a ſtammering Child, ſpeaking of the glorious Excellencies of God, of the Loving-kindneſs of God, ſpeaking of thoſe Things which God hath ſpoken to our Souls, they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe theſe Things, we would be glad that they might be ſaved: If they were Partakers of theſe Things, they would be glad as well as we, and they would be more really happy in reſpect to this World, for the Time that they are to live here; they would live a happier Life, even in this World, and they would <hi>have everlaſting Life in the World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Love of Chriſt conſtrains Men thus to judge, that every one that hath received like precious Faith,</hi> ought to anſwer that Grace and Faith which God hath miniſtred to them in an holy Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and every one who is a ſtranger to this Thing, ought to be of an enquiring Mind and an open Heart to wait for the Day when God will viſit them with the ſame Grace; when you give up your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a daily Croſs, as Chriſt's Diſciples, you will not be running after any one to teach you to know the Lord, for you will all <hi>know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt;</hi> I that have been but a little convinc'd, ſhall I know the Lord?

This is the Way they reckoned upon in old Time, it is a notable Expreſſion, <hi>The Lord is our Judge;</hi> there is the Beginning, he began there, Judgment began <hi>at the Houſe of God;</hi> thoſe he brings into his Houſe, he brings them under the Diſcipline of his Houſe, <hi>The Lord is our Judge, he is our King and Law-giver, and he will ſave us;</hi> this ſame Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Diſcipline under Judgment brought to them the Faith and Experience of his being their Law-giver, and this brought them to a Faith of the laſt Sentence, we ſhall be ſaved; and the Lord anſwers ſuch a People, That he will bring Salvation to them <hi>Salvation ſhall be for Walls and Bulwarks;</hi> Did the People of this Nation but know Salvation was brought near to them, and that it was their Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, there would not be a Crying up of this and the other rotten Thing for a Bulwark.</p>
            <p>We talk of a Bulwark as well as others; we have a Bulwark, bleſſed be the God of Heaven, made of better Stuff than theirs; for it is the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God which hath kept us from the Pollution of Sin, and from a running <hi>into all Exceſs and Riot</hi> that others have run into; it hath kept us from the Evil, it hath kept Evils out of us, and we have found that certainly true, That <hi>all Things work together for Good, to them that love God, and fear God;</hi> that all the Providences of God together, they have all wrought for our Good; and this is the Bulwark that we have truſted in, and it hath ſerved hitherto, and it will ſerve us and our Poſterity to the End of the World.

waſte: Though all the Powers on Earth, and all the Potentates in this World ſhould agree together, they ſhall not prevail againſt it; we have <hi>Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks;</hi> if I be within theſe Walls, Salvation is round about me; if I am got into this eternal Bulwark, I am ſafe from the Devil and his Inſtruments; here is a Bulwark to be relied upon.</p>
            <p>Many wonder we differ with them in ſome Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; we have that Confidence in this Bulwark, that we deſire not another; God will laſt and abide for ever, ſo will this Bulwark; all the Care that I take, and all the Care that you ſhould take, is to keep within theſe Walls: Do not ſally out, if you go out, the Devil is watching, and <hi>ſeeking continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whom he may devour;</hi> he will catch Straglers; if that People will go out for Profit, or for Pleaſure, or Intereſt, the Devil will catch them: What, ſuch People talk of Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks? the Devil hath got them in his Snare, and they are caught in Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs and other Sins; the Reaſon is, they have gone out of their Bulwark, they have ſallied out of their Walls, for the Devil could never have fetched them out.</p>

that will do us good but our keeping within theſe Walls.</p>
            <p>I remember a notable Saying of the Apoſtle, which hath a great Emphaſis in it, and a great Deal of Doctrine, he writeth to the Church after they were become a People of Proſeſſing Chriſtians, <hi>Take heed leſt you come to be beguiled by the Serpent, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled Eve;</hi> he did not ſpeak of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a wicked Woman; but he ſpoke of <hi>Eve,</hi> a good Woman <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated after the Image of God, in Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> They were come to a Life of Sanctification, to a Life <hi>that was hidden from Ages and Generations;</hi> You muſt look to yourſelves, and look upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as in the State of your Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> a Woman brought forth in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, that might have ſtood in that Primitive State, notwithſtanding all the Subtility of all the Serpents in the World; but letting her Ear hearken to this Old Serpent, ſhe was beguiled; there grew up a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in her reaſoning Part; it may be ſo as he ſaith, I will try.</p>
            <p>So I ſay to you that are come to a State of Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and in ſome meaſure to know the cleanſing Power of God, and that you have not believed in it in vain, but it hath effectually wrought ſome Change and Alteration in you, and is ſtill carrying on the Work of your Salvation: Many Temptations will attend you, and many Snares will be laid in your Way, but God hath preſerved you to this Day: I know the Devil's Wiles and Temptations are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold; they are fitted to every one's Inclinations, fitted to every Opportunity, and to every Occaſion in this World; Men are tryed every Way by the Tempter, to ſee which Way he may enſnare them; he tries every Way to <hi>enſnare</hi> and entangle <hi>the ſimple,</hi> that he may turn them to the right Hand or to the left, that their Souls may be deſtroyed and periſh.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:010868_0043_0F851AB802FE2CA0"/>
I cannot ſpeak to you by a more emphatical Word, by a more familiar Exhortation than this, <hi>Take heed you be not beguiled as Eve was:</hi> many will be tempted as ſhe was; but I would not have you do as ſhe did, and yield to the Temptation: Take heed that you do not defile yourſelves, but <hi>keep your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments white;</hi> you that have been waſhed and cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, labour to <hi>keep yourſelves unſpotted from the World; this is pure Religion and undefiled,</hi> that which hath enlightened many a Nation, and ſhall enlighten many of thoſe whoſe Religion is to be undefiled, and to <hi>keep themſelves unſpotted from the World:</hi> I pray God increaſe the Number of them, that ſo the bleſſed Work of Sanctification, that hath begun in this Way, may be carried on to his Praiſe, and the Salvation of our Souls, to the ſpreading forth of his Glory, and the exalting of his Name; that the Strangers which are ſcattered and deſolate, may be brought into his holy Way, and walk in it; that we all, in a Fellowſhip together, walking in that holy Way, may through the Eternal Spirit, offer Praiſe and Thankſgiving to God, who is worthy to recieve Glory and Honour, Power and Dominion, for ever and even. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Except ye be regenerated and born again, ye cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the Word of the Lord God to all People this Day; this lies not in <hi>airy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and in vain Imaginations, and whatſoever elſe it is that you deck yourſelves withal; you muſt every particular Man and Woman be <hi>born again,</hi> elſe you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This was the Doctrine of Chriſt in that prepared Body wherein he appeared in the World, and preached to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that <hi>ſtanding Doctrine</hi> to this Moment of Time, and <hi>will be ſo</hi> while any Man breathes upon the Earth; there is <hi>no other Way,</hi> no other Gate to enter into Life, but by this great Work of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Now to enforce People to come to this great Work, and to ſet forward from Earth to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all being <hi>driven out of Paradiſe,</hi> by the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim ſet with a flaming Sword, there is no <hi>returning</hi> to that bleſſed Life, but by the <hi>Loſs</hi> of that Life that did grieve the Spirit of God, and which did cauſe Man to be driven out; there is no other Way of returning
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010868_0045_0F851AB8EA300898"/>
again but by this <hi>new Birth.</hi> As <hi>you</hi> are <hi>all</hi> driven and forced out of Paradiſe, and the flaming Sword and the Cherubims are ſet to keep the Way of the Tree of Life, ſo you muſt return into the Favour of God again, by the Light of Chriſt; and you have Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and there a little, to direct your Minds to the Light of Chriſt Jeſus. As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living Soul, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickning Spirit. This know for certain, no Man or Woman can be quickned, and raiſed up into the Life of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> till the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> be taken away from them.</p>
            <p>So now, let every one of you deal plainly with your own Hearts, how you came to be a ſlain Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in which Life there was a Working of the Myſtery of Iniquity in every Part of Man. One cries, Lo here is Chriſt! ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lo there is Chriſt! and every one is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Imagination about the Letter of the Scripture; this is ſtill but the vain Spirit of Man, running and <hi>ſtriving to recover himſelf;</hi> and this is the Cauſe there is ſo much Profeſſion of God, and ſo little of his Nature appearing among the Sons and Daughters of Men. Now all of you that come to be Regenerated, you muſt come to the Light of Chriſt, there is no other Way to it. He will ſearch your Hearts, and try your Reins, and ſet your Sins in Order before you, and trace out the Iniquities that compaſs you about; therefore <hi>you muſt ſee your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a loſt People, a ſinful People,</hi> and ſo come to <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>Weight</hi> of your Sins upon your Conſciences, there is <hi>no other</hi> Way to come to Life; you will never complain of Sin till you be <hi>burthened</hi> with it, till you have a Trumpet ſounding in your Ears, to <hi>awaken</hi> you, that you may ariſe from the Dead, that Chriſt may give you Light; <hi>there is no other Way,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:010868_0046_0F851AB9B63D77B0"/>
dear People; you muſt bring your Deeds to the Light of Chriſt, and <hi>abide in the Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;</hi> if you ſave your Lives, you loſe them; if you will loſe your Lives for Chriſt's Sake, there is no Danger of your eternal Life. <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, Chriſt's Forerunner, declared, <hi>I indeed baptiſe you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me is mightier than I, the Latchet of whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to unlooſe, he ſhall baptiſe you with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire, whoſe Fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his Floor, and will gather his Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable Fire.</hi> What is it the better for you to read the Scripture, if you know not this <hi>Fiery Baptiſm,</hi> which all muſt know that are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; deceive not yourſelves, Chriſt will <hi>appear in flaming Fire, and take Vengeance on all them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtand here as a Witneſs of the Lord of Life this Day; there is no Way for People to come to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but they muſt <hi>know Chriſt</hi> revealed in all their Hearts. What is he doing but <hi>rendering Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> upon the carnal Mind, ſelf-pleaſing and all inordinate Affections; he comes with <hi>Vengeance</hi> to take away thy Life, he will baptiſe thee with the Holy Ghoſt, and with <hi>Fire.</hi> If thou knoweſt not this, <hi>thou art not a true Chriſtian,</hi> thou wilt never look Death in the Face with Joy, nor go down to the Grave with Triumph. If thou liveſt at Home in the Body, and flyeſt for thy Life, and will not be willing to loſe thy Life for Chriſt, if thou art called to it; and if thou <hi>wilt not have Chriſt to waſh thee</hi> (ſome for Shyneſs, and ſome for Self-Love will refuſe this,) if Chriſt doth not waſh thee, thou haſt no Part in him; you muſt come to Chriſt to purify you in the fiery Furnace; <hi>the Day of the Lord
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010868_0047_0F851ABA6B67BD78"/>
ſhall burn as an Oven,</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) this is a dreadful Day, a Day of Vengeance, the Day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who redeemeth his People from their Sins; <hi>Sion is redeemed with Judgment, and eſtabliſhed with Righteouſneſs.</hi> Do not make the Way to Heaven <hi>eaſier</hi> in your Minds and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than indeed it is, and think it not ſufficient to live in an <hi>outward Obſervance</hi> of the Ways of God. If your own Wills be alive, and your Corruptions remain unmortified, the <hi>Judgment of God</hi> will be your Portion; therefore in the Lord's Name come along with me; I am come to declare what I have heard and ſeen of the Father. Come and examine thy Conſcience; haſt thou brought thy Deeds to the Light? Then thou haſt <hi>received Condemnation upon thyſelf,</hi> and thy Haughtineſs is <hi>bowed down,</hi> and <hi>laid low,</hi> and thou <hi>ſeeſt</hi> thyſelf a <hi>poor miſerable Wretch</hi> before the eternal God. Whatſoever thou knoweſt of the Mind of God, haſt thou reformed thy Ways? come along with me, and tell me what is the Ground of thy Faith, and thy Confidence; is it thy <hi>Obedience and Qualifications?</hi> Becauſe thy Obedience is right, and thy Qualifications are right, What uſe doſt thou make of them? Read the Book of Conſcience; Haſt thou no Ground for thy Faith? Thou haſt put on the <hi>reformed</hi> Faith, and liveſt an <hi>unreformed</hi> Life; ſearch and try thy ſelf, Man, or Woman. Doſt thou watch over thyſelf and keep in a Senſe of thy Diſſolution, notwithſtanding all thy Qualifications and <hi>partial</hi> Reformations? Doſt thou <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and the narrow Way?</hi> Here is the loſt Sheep, thou ſeekeſt, the <hi>Life of thy Will,</hi> the Life of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God will not ſuffer thee to <hi>make a Saviour</hi> of thy Duties and Qualifications, and to take God's Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and to <hi>deck thyſelf</hi> with them; <hi>Thou canſt not be ſaved without the Rigteouſneſs of God in Chrſt Jeſus.</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:010868_0048_0F851ABB28109398"/>
What ſaith thy Conſcience, art thou brought to this <hi>Change</hi> of Mind, and of thy Converſation? Are you all willing to part with your Sins, with your <hi>Pride and Haughtineſs?</hi> Are you willing to part with your vile Affections? This is the Work of God's Grace upon you. Doſt thou place thy Confidence in thy Duties and Qualifications, and takeſt God's Jewels and Ornaments, and <hi>deckeſt thyſelf</hi> With them? <hi>Thou tookeſt my Jewels,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and didſt play the Harlot.</hi> If thou return to the Lord, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy ſelf, and get through this Difficulty, thou wilt be happy forever. This Judgment of God, this flaming Sword that turns every Way, will keep thee from returning to Sin, and bring thee to Chriſt, and cut thee off from all Hope of Salvation <hi>but by him,</hi> and make thee to <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>abſolute Need</hi> of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and that thy <hi>Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is God's infinite Goodneſs to Men, that he will <hi>hide Pride</hi> from them, and <hi>humble them</hi> under his mighty Hand. This is the Condition of poor Creatures that are <hi>ſlain</hi> by the Hands of the moſt High. How may I know when I am ſlain and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and come to have Sincerity? They that have this Baptiſm enter into the Heavenly Life. If you love the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, it will be thus with you; God will make ſhort Work in the Earth. He will <hi>ſet thy Sins in Order before thee,</hi> and make thee watchful unto Prayer, and lead thee to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life and Converſation, and make thee <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor thyſelf,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> all the Pomps and Pleaſures and Vanities of this World. When he hath adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with his Graces, then watch for the Light, and in the Light of Chriſt thou ſhalt ſee Light, and that all thou haſt done, and canſt do, is but thy Duty. All this thou oughteſt to do: Thou art God's Creature, <hi>and all this will not juſtifie thee in Order to thy Eternal Salvation,</hi> for theſe Services thou
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010868_0049_0F851ABBE5809DD0"/>
               <hi>oweſt</hi> unto God. If thou diligently wait, thou ſhalt ſee more Light; then the Sword that proceeds out of the Mouth of Chriſt, who is called the Word of God, will <hi>cut thee off</hi> from all thy <hi>Hopes of Salvation</hi> from <hi>any Thing thou haſt done,</hi> from any of thy <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,</hi> from <hi>any Thing</hi> that thou <hi>canſt do,</hi> ſo that thou wilt be a <hi>hopeleſs</hi> Soul, <hi>nothing</hi> in thy own Senſe and Apprehenſion.

Now except we be <hi>born again,</hi> we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; and there is no becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Creatures, till we be ſlain to the old Man. Thou muſt be ſlain to thy Pride and Haughtineſs, and the Corruption of thine own Will, and all Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, thou muſt have God to <hi>burn it up</hi> in thee the Holy Ghoſt will deſtroy and burn up nothing in thee, but that which will bring an <hi>eternal Fire</hi> upon thy Soul.

Now every one that lives at <hi>home</hi> in the <hi>Boſom of Self,</hi> take this with you, tho' you profeſs the Truth, and live in an outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereto, yet if you ſecretly indulge your <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wills,</hi> and live a <hi>Fleſh-pleaſing</hi> Life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with Fleſh and Blood, and are not rent off from your Luſts, you cannot enjoy the Lord of Life; <hi>While I am at home in the Body, I am abſent from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Body of Sin is a Loadſtone to draw you from the Life of God, and from glorying in the Croſs of Chriſt: This is Fleſh and Blood, and <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> For the Lord's Sake, for your Soul's Sake, and for the Sake of your Eternal Happineſs, put not off this Work, but purſue it, and it will be perfected. <hi>See how Chriſt is revealed in you by the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi> God will <hi>redeem you by the Spirit of Judgment and Burning:</hi> It is not ranging abroad with your Minds, but you muſt know <hi>Chriſt is in you except you be Reprobates.</hi> If he hath ſet your Eyes and Hearts upon himſelf, and made you to <hi>water your Couch with your Tears;</hi> if he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your Sleep, ſo as you have cried out, <hi>I ſhall be damned and never come to Salvation;</hi> (this <hi>will be</hi> your Cry; it was once my Cry,) O let not your

Eyes ſlumber, nor your Eyelids take any Reſt, till you be ſure the Lord is your God. If you find theſe Qualifications you are on your Way; otherwiſe you will be like a deceitful Bow, and never abide in Judgment. If you reject the Counſel of God againſt yourſelves, and refuſe to be crucified with Chriſt, and to be baptiſed with his Baptiſm, you will never have Life; but <hi>by his Baptiſm,</hi> and through the <hi>heavenly Operation</hi> of his Spirit, if thou haſt <hi>Faith in Chriſt's Name,</hi> thou ſhalt be married to him in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs.

Now the Matter lies in the Death of your own Wills: When you have done the Will of God, then watch that your own Wills be ſlain, and that your <hi>CURSED SELF</hi> take not the Jewels of God, and his Bracelets and Ornaments, and beſtow them upon Self, and paint and deck <hi>curſed Self;</hi> and take not the Members of Chriſt, and make them the Members of an Harlot: If you be dead to your own Wills you are riſen with Chriſt, and receive a Reſurrection to eternal Life: Crucify <hi>Self,</hi> and ſet the World at nought, and trample upon it, and all Things of it, and count them as Droſs and Dung in Compariſon of Chriſt, that the Father hath revealed to be our Life, in the Days of our Sorrow and Mourning, in the Day of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, in the Day when we cried, <hi>our Hope</hi> is loſt.</p>

Thus it hath been with the holieſt People on Earth. <hi>It is not by Works of Righteouſneſs of thy own</hi> that thou canſt be ſaved; Chriſt comes to cut <hi>all</hi> theſe down, that thou mayſt be ingrafted into him, and <hi>juſtified by his Grace.</hi> Do not make this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Talk, and ſay, I have heard this and that; but look into your own Hearts, and ſee what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Workings are there; what there is of the Power of the Lord Jeſus, that hath made you to loath this World, and the inordinate Love of the Creature, that you may enjoy all theſe Things as if you enjoyed them not. We cannot when we are ſlain and crucified to this World but ſay, My Life is in Chriſt. When we come to <hi>aſcribe Nothing</hi> to our ſelves, and <hi>all</hi> to Chriſt; here is a bleſſed Harmony, <hi>broken Hearts, melted Spirits,</hi> and yet <hi>joyful</hi> Souls; <hi>poor Creatures</hi> that were <hi>mourning</hi> and <hi>ſighing</hi> and <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> before the Lord in retired Places, and yet <hi>rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus. I am riſen with Chriſt; I ſaid, <hi>my Hope is cut off,</hi> I will lie down in thy Will, O God; do what thou wilt with me, it is in thy <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>free Gift,</hi> whether thou give me Life, or deny it to me. There muſt be a Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ourſelves to the Will of God; it was ſo with the Lord Jeſus, and it is ſo with every true Saint of God; you muſt be humbled as little Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Judgment be taken away,</hi> and the Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God ſealed up to your Souls. If you ſeek this Work of God, you will find it; if you ſeek it upon your Beds, in all your Labours and Concernments, in all your Stations; and Relations; if you preſs after the <hi>New Birth,</hi> you muſt uſe this World as if you uſed it not, and live a married Life, as if you were unmarried; for the Faſhion of this World paſſeth away. This is not Rantiſm.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you, a new World comes by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; a Man is not <hi>lifted up</hi> in his own Mind,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010868_0054_0F851AC06687AD90"/>
but <hi>laid low in his own Eyes;</hi> he waits for the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God to govern him, and he is a Steward of the Grace of God, to give to them that ſtand in need. When a Man is <hi>regenerated</hi> and born again, he is as contented with Bread and Water, as with all the Enjoyments of this World: What is the Matter? His own Will is gone, and put down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet, and whatſoever it is that gives Life to all his vain Deſires and Affections; there is an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all within, a Man praiſing of God, and bleſſing his Holy Name; there are no Intanglements ſhall draw away the Heart from ſerving of God, and ſeeking his Glory; and if God ſhall call the Huſband from the Wife, or the Wife from the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for the Glory of his Name, there is no whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or complaining, and crying out, but giving them up, and a praiſing and bleſſing God when they are called to ſuch an Exerciſe; and if they are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that, then they ſet their Hearts to glorify God in their ſeveral Places and Stations; then they have a full Content in a bleſſed Reſignation. Here their Wills are ſlain, but they praiſe God, they have no Deſire, but Lord thy Will be done; always praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, always having the Fear and Glory of God before their Eyes. All the Miſchief is hatch'd in pleaſing Men's own Wills: That is the Counſel of every Heart that Chriſt does not govern: Will you live as the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Then you muſt live contemptibly, the Miſtreſs and Maid are Hail-fellow, well met. No; every one muſt walk in Humility, and live in Acquaintance with the God of Heaven; ſhe that is wrought upon by the ſame Spirit, muſt with all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence behave herſelf as becomes a Servant of the Lord. Here is now a new World, and the Faſhions of the old World are gone; all Pride, Haughtineſs, Croſſneſs, and trampling one upon another are all gone, all ſlain, through the Operation of Chriſt.</p>

What remains now? Chriſt is in me, and we are all one in him. Chriſt laid down his Life for thee and me; now he reigns in me, and he hath prepared my Body to die for the Truth, as his prepared Body was laid down for my Sin. It is a Kind of <hi>fooliſh Profeſſion,</hi> to make Profeſſion of Chriſt, and <hi>live</hi> in <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> Profaneneſs, <hi>Senſuality,</hi> and the like; they that are come to this heavenly Birth ſeek the Things that are above, thou canſt do no other. <hi>Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good.</hi> You muſt be ingrafted into the Vine of <hi>God's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> O! ſlight not the Day of your Viſitation. What was it to me to read of any being born again, till I was <hi>ſlain,</hi> and <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>heavenly Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus? Till I ſaw the <hi>flaming Sword</hi> ready to ſlay me in every Way, in every Turning. The <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt <hi>convinced</hi> me of Sin, and <hi>his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Juſtified</hi> me, and thoſe <hi>Works were abominable</hi> to me, that hindred my Soul's Paſſage to Chriſt. Chriſt Jeſus in marrying my Soul to himſelf, ſeized upon me, and <hi>did work effectually</hi> in me: There is the Teſtimony of Chriſt in me, he hath ſealed up my Soul to the Day of my Redemption: Here is a certain Paſſage, and a certain Way which never any miſs of, that loſe their Lives for Chriſt: If you be not ready and willing to loſe your Lives for Chriſt, you ſhall never come here: The Gate is ſtraight, and the Way is narrow; none come hither but thoſe that die into an heavenly Oneneſs with Chriſt. O Friends, <hi>let us empty ourſelves,</hi> that Chriſt may fill us: <hi>Let us be nothing in our own Eyes,</hi> that we may be all in him, and <hi>receive of his Fulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I commend you to God's Witneſs, that you may remember what hath been ſpoken, among you; but conſider, if you do not hearken to it, it will follow you, and be a Plague to you to all Eternity. If you will not yield up yourſelves to Chriſt, this
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010868_0056_0F851AD1A2B690F0"/>
Day that burns like an Oven, this Fire you muſt dwell with when out of the Body, there will be no quenching of this Fire forever; but if you be ſo wiſe for your Souls, as to reſign yourſelves up to Chriſt, and come to him as little Children, this will not hinder your earthly Concerns. Tho' the World may account thee a Fool, yet thou haſt that Part of heavenly Wiſdom, to do what thou doſt as unto God; thou carrieſt to thy Wife, as in the Sight of God, that ſhe may be ſanctified to thee, and thou to her; and thou carrieſt becomingly to thy Children and Servants, and thou <hi>wilt abound in Grace, and in every good Work,</hi> which will be for thine Eternal Welfare.</p>
            <p>O! I beſeech you People, for the Lord's Sake, wait for the Light of Chriſt to guide you; learn of him to be meek and lowly; then happy are you; for <hi>he dwelleth with the Humble, but he beholdeth the Proud afar off.</hi> This <hi>New Birth,</hi> which is a true Work, a ſincere and heavenly Work, it will make you for ever. O make Room for Chriſt in your Hearts, or elſe he is never like to dwell with you. He loveth to dwell with the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>contrite</hi> Spirit; he abhors the <hi>Proud,</hi> he will <hi>empty</hi> your Souls, that he may fill them.</p>
            <p>And ſo I commend you to God. I have been long held in Durance under great Weakneſs; and I was reſtleſs, till I could come up to this great City of <hi>London,</hi> to preach the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi> among you; and you ſee I am among you here: Pray every one of you turn inward; let not theſe Words paſſing through a <hi>mean Veſſel</hi> be as a bare empty Diſcourſe of Truth to you, which you only hear, and take no further Care of your Salvation. Take heed of deſpiſing the Light that ſhines in the midſt of you, and be preſſing forward to the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Work</hi> that is laid in the <hi>Power of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

even <hi>through Judgment into Death,</hi> and then he will give eternal Life. The Lord confirm this, that it may reſt upon your Hearts, that you may be dead to the Things of the World. <hi>We are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>that genders to Bondage, but we are come to Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>the City of the Living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly, and the Church of the Firſt-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that ſpeaketh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Things than that of</hi> Abel.

with Comfort. This is an eternal Truth of God, and recorded in the holy Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> iii. 16. That <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> God ſo loved the World, he gave his Son to be a <hi>Light</hi> unto the <hi>World,</hi> that all might ſee their Way back to God again: For Sin hath darkened the Underſtanding, and clouded the Mind of Man and Woman, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated them from the <hi>Life of God,</hi> and their Hearts are hardened through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin. But now is the Acceptable Time, now is the Day of Salvation, the Day of God's Grace and favourable Viſitation, wherein he viſits Men and Women, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminates their Minds and Spirits with a <hi>Light</hi> from Heaven, that they might ſee the deplorable State and Condition wherin they are, and what they are doing: It is in this <hi>Light,</hi> that they have a <hi>Day of Grace</hi> vouchſafed to them, that it will be well with them, both here and for ever. They that receive this <hi>Light,</hi> and come out of that which they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from, which is <hi>Sin,</hi> they may come to enjoy <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>God.</hi> It was <hi>Sin</hi> that firſt ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> and it is <hi>Sin</hi> now that hinders Man from Acquaintance with the <hi>Lord,</hi> who brings Peace unto him: It is by this <hi>Light,</hi> that we are to acquaint our ſelves with God, that we may be at Peace. Thus ſaith the Lord by the Prophet, <hi>It is Sin hath ſeparated between me and you: Sin</hi> hath made a <hi>Partition Wall</hi> between God and us, and God hath ſent his Son into the World to break down this <hi>Partition Wall</hi> that <hi>Sin</hi> hath made; that ſo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man might return to God, and come into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> again, out of which Sin hath caſt him.</p>
            <p>Now, none can bring us back to God, and into Favour and Communion with him, but our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> He is the Light and Leader of his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010868_0060_0F851AD4AADA5640"/>
People. There is no Name under Heaven by which we can be ſaved, but the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>JESUS:</hi> It is he that ſaves his People from their Sins; and it is in him alone that we are bleſſed: <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered:</hi> And for the Sake of Chriſt alone it is, that the Lord imputeth not Iniquity to us. Now pray, <hi>Examine yourſelves, whether you be in the Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. <hi>Prove your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates.</hi> Examine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whether you have choſen the Lord for your God, and Chriſt for your Redeemer? And whether you have forſaken your Sins, and turned from your evil Ways, and anſwered the Viſitation of the Love of God in your Souls? Do you believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who came to ſeek and to ſave them that were loſt? He is the <hi>Phyſician of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi> that was wounded to heal our Wounds: He was <hi>wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for our Iniquities, and had the Chaſtiſement of our Peace upon him; that by his Stripes we might be healed:</hi> It is he alone that could do this. Who is ſufficient for theſe Things? The Lord hath found out One that is ſufficient; he hath <hi>laid Help upon One that is Mighty,</hi> that is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him.</hi> God hath given him the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meaſure, and filled him with Grace and Truth, that of his Fulneſs we might all receive, and Grace for Grace: He is mighty to ſave the Sons and Daughters of Men, and to give them Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Children of God.</p>
            <p>This was teſtified of old, <hi>John</hi> i. 12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> Men want <hi>Power</hi> over their Sins: When <hi>Sin</hi> appears to be exceeding ſinful, they would overcome it, and be rid of it, when it is troubleſome: And when
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010868_0061_0F851AD579F9C818"/>
they are under a deep <hi>Conviction</hi> of the Evil of it, and ſee the woful and miſerable State that Sin hath brought Mankind into; how they have loſt the Image of God, and the Favour of God; they then deſire to be reſtored and brought back again into their primitive State. You that know the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſee how the Work goes on in your Hearts; ſee how the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is carrying on upon you. Conſider, that the Lord is a holy God, of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity with Approbation: <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked,</hi> that walk in the broad Way, and grieve the holy Spirit, and do not anſwer his <hi>Divine Call.</hi> There is a two-fold Call concerning Man, a Call to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a Call to <hi>Judgment.</hi> The <hi>Call</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> is in this <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>God's Viſitation;</hi> they that receive it now, that are ſo wiſe, as to anſwer <hi>God's Call,</hi> and believe in the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and in his inward Appearance, that obey his Voice, when they hear his Call, ſaying, <hi>Come away,</hi> come out of thy Sins, come out of the Wickedneſs, Filthineſs, and Pollution of the World; come into the Divine Nature of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> come into his Life: Into what Life? Into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, the Divine Life. Thou haſt been dead to God, and alive to the World: Now that thou mayſt be dead to Sin, and alive to God, come unto him that hath all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him. O come unto Chriſt, the Dear and Bleſſed Son of God, in this Day of Grace and Salvation, and receive Power to overcome thy Sins! Then thou wilt be a Conqueror, and overcome the Devil.</p>
            <p>We are of ourſelves altogether inſufficient for theſe Things, we are weak and impotent; and our Saviour hath told us, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing:</hi> We are juſtified freely by God's Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt; not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010868_0062_0F851AD62BB14998"/>
by our own Works. How great a <hi>Contradiction</hi> is it to Charge them with the Contrary, that ſay, They cannot <hi>Preach nor Pray, but as the Spirit of God moveth them.</hi> Bleſſed be God, that hath made us ſenſible of our own Weakneſs, Emptineſs, and Poverty. Our Help hath been in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who made Heaven and Earth, who hath given us his Son to be an Helper, and an all-ſufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to us; with him he hath given ſufficient Power and Strength, whereby we are enabled to overcome the <hi>Devil,</hi> the Enemy of our Souls: So that we may be enabled to ſtand againſt <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs, and conquer all the Powers of Darkneſs, and fight the <hi>good Fight of Faith,</hi> and finiſh our Courſe with Joy, and keep the <hi>Faith;</hi> ſeeing there is laid up for us a <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall give us at that Day; and <hi>not only to us,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but unto all them that love His Appearing.</hi> We have not an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities; but was in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin: Chriſt, our Redeemer, was tempted, that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted. When the <hi>Devil</hi> tempted our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and could not prevail, he went away and left him: The <hi>Prince</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> found nothing in him, upon which he could faſten his <hi>Temptation.</hi> Chriſt will enable thoſe that believe in him to overcome the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to be more than Conquerors, through him that hath loved them: He came into the World to purge and purify his People, and to be the Author of <hi>Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to all them that believe in him, and obey him. But it is ſaid, <hi>He did not many mighty Works</hi> among ſome to whom he preached the Everlaſting Goſpel, becauſe of their Unbelief: Many will not believe in the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Appearance of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:010868_0063_0F851AD6ED7E4D20"/>
the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Light</hi> of the World; they will neither believe in the <hi>Light,</hi> nor walk in the <hi>Light,</hi> which will enable them to conquer the Evil one, who is the Prince of Darkneſs: It is only through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Great Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that we are victorious.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my Friends, open your Hearts to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, receive this bleſſed <hi>Gift of God,</hi> which he offers to you: And can God give you a greater Gift than the <hi>Son</hi> of his <hi>Love?</hi> And will not you gladly receive him, and that great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath purchaſed for you with his own <hi>Blood?</hi> But, ſay ſome People, we have received Chriſt, and believe in him, and believe the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures. But let me aſk you, Who keeps Houſe all this while? What have you done for Chriſt? Chriſt hath <hi>died</hi> for you; but haſt thou <hi>lived</hi> to him? And haſt thou died to the World, and died to thy Sins and Luſts? Conſider with your ſelves, It is both your Great <hi>Duty</hi> and Intereſt to <hi>die</hi> to Sin, and live to <hi>Chriſt</hi> that died for you. And we muſt ſtand at <hi>Chriſt's Tribunal,</hi> and give an Account to him of whatſoever we have done, whether good or bad; and he will judge us at the great Day of his Appearing. Bleſſed are you, that receive the Bleſſed Son of God, that now ſtands in Spirit at the <hi>Door,</hi> and <hi>Knocks: Open</hi> your Hearts, and make Room for him, and let not the World keep him out, and he will come in, and ſup with you, and you with him: And he will do that for you, which you cannot do for your ſelves. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is willing, but the Fleſh is weak: He will give thee Power over Sin, and over the World, and over the Devil: When ever he ſhall aſſault thee with his Temptations, Say, <hi>Get thee behind me, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, thou favoureſt not the Things that be of God.</hi> When People come to be ſpiritually minded, they will <hi>taſte</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:010868_0064_0F851AD7D44233F8"/>
and <hi>ſavour</hi> the Things that are ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: If they be not <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> do not touch with them, have nothing to do with them; but walk in the Spirit, and ſavour the Things of the Spirit. And hearken to the Counſel of Chriſt, who ſpeaks unto you in the Name of Wiſdom; O <hi>ye Simple Ones underſtand Wiſdom, and ye Fools, be of an underſtanding Heart; hear, for I will ſpeak of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Things, and the Opening of my Lips ſhall be right Things; bleſſed is the Man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the Poſts of my Doors: for whoſo findeth me, findeth Life.</hi> Hearken to the bleſſed <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hear this Voice and obey it: They that do his Will, ſhall know his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</p>
            <p>They that have the <hi>ſaving Knowledge of God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, which is Life eternal,</hi> they will walk in a correſpondent and ſuitable Manner to that <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and be holy in all Manner of Converſation; they will not be only <hi>nominal Chriſtians, but true Chriſtians, Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile: the will receive Chriſt Jeſus, who is <hi>God's Gift,</hi> and know the Operation of his Power in their Souls. Theſe Perſons are fit to <hi>live,</hi> and prepared to <hi>die;</hi> when Chriſt who is their Life, ſhall appear, they ſhall appear with him in Glory. When the Sound of the <hi>Laſt Trumpet</hi> ſhall be heard at the End of the World, <hi>Time</hi> ſhall be no more; <hi>Come away!</hi> that <hi>Day</hi> ſhall not be terrible to them that have put off the <hi>Old Man,</hi> and put on the <hi>New Man;</hi> and have begun to live a new Life, and to have new Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, new Thoughts and Reſolutions, and have laid up their Treaſure in Heaven, where their Hearts are alſo: They have that Peace which the World cannot give, and which Death cannot take away. Bleſſed are they that take Sanctuary in the <hi>Name</hi> of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010868_0065_0F851AD87616C570"/>
               <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as in a ſtrong Tower; they ſhall get Power over their Sins, and over the Vanity of their Minds, that <hi>die</hi> to <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and feel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Power and Efficacy of the Love of Chriſt, who hath loved them and waſhed them from their Sins in his own Blood, and made them <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Friends,</hi> Hear the <hi>Voice of Wiſdom,</hi> who hath ſaid, <hi>Whoſo findeth me, findeth Life, and ſhall obtain Favour of the Lord: But he that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own Soul.</hi> Be you early Seekers: <hi>Seek</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the firſt Place. The Lord calls from Heaven; <hi>My Son, give me thine Heart:</hi> Let thy Anſwer be, Lord, take my Heart, purify and cleanſe it; break it, and make it new, make it fit for thy Acceptance, that I may find Favour in thy Sight. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ye can do Nothing:</hi> Therefore deſire him to do it for thee, and to work in thee both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> of his own good Pleaſure. How dreadful is it to appear at the Bar of God's Juſtice, as <hi>miſerable Sinners!</hi> Thoſe that have not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Great Mediator,</hi> to plead for them, are miſerable indeed; therefore lay hold on Chriſt now; believe in him, lay hold on his Power and Spirit, in this <hi>Day</hi> of your <hi>Viſitation.</hi> If thou art under the Power of Sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> thou mayſt receive Power from Chriſt to overcome all the Power of Darkneſs: If the <hi>ſtrong Man armed</hi> hath got Poſſeſſion of thy Heart, Chriſt will lay Seige to it; and if thou be willing to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Door,</hi> Chriſt will come in and caſt out the <hi>ſtrong Man,</hi> and ſpoil him of all his Goods. Me will caſt out the grand Enemy of thy Soul, and take Poſſeſſion for <hi>Himſelf;</hi> that thou mayſt be delivered from the <hi>Power</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and from the Bondage of Corruption, and brought into the glorious Liberty of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And if the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> make thee free, thou
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010868_0066_0F851AD9262B4168"/>
ſhalt be free indeed. For this End Chriſt came into the World, for this Purpoſe was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that he might deſtroy the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> And he will not loſe the Deſign of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but will <hi>finiſh Tranſgreſſions, and make an End of Sin, and bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us all come to Chriſt, and let none deceive themſelves, and live in their Sins, and yet think to come to Heaven: <hi>Be not deceived</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>God is not mocked; for whatſoever a Man ſows, that he ſhall alſo reap: He that ſows to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption; but he that ſows to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting.</hi> Labour for a ſure grounded <hi>Hope,</hi> a juſt Hope in the Mercy of God for Pardon and Salvation; then you muſt know a <hi>Work</hi> of Chriſt upon you, and the Power of the Spirit of Chriſt within you, ſubduing your Will to a holy Subjection to the <hi>Divine Will;</hi> that you may ſay with the Apoſtle; <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt; nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> Then the <hi>Call</hi> to <hi>Judgment</hi> will be joyful to you; for you ſhall then be juſtified and acquitted before the whole World, at that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general Judgment,</hi> and have an abundant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and it ſhall be well with you for ever, Now, <hi>Say to the Righteous, it ſhall be well with him;</hi> not that it doth ſo appear at preſent; for through many <hi>Tribulations</hi> we muſt expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and many are the <hi>Troubles</hi> of the <hi>Righteous;</hi> but the Lord will deliver them out of them all. So that <hi>if in this Life only</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we have Hope, we are of all Men moſt miſerable;</hi> yet <hi>Say to the Righteous, It ſhall be well with him;</hi> whatſoever their Tryals, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010868_0067_0F851AD9F6CD82B0"/>
and Tribulations are, the Lord will deliver them in the beſt Time; they have Heaven in their Eye, and they look to Recompence of Reward. Now what haſt thou in thine Eye? Is it the <hi>high Calling</hi> in Chriſt? Is this the <hi>Mark</hi> thou aimeſt at, and which thou haſt in View? Is this the <hi>Port</hi> and <hi>Haven</hi> that thou art ſailing to, looking unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finiſher</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the <hi>Croſs,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the <hi>Shame?</hi> Heb. xii. 2. The <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> after he had been ſpeaking of the Suffering and <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of thoſe great <hi>Saints,</hi> of whom the World was not worthy; <hi>Heb.</hi> xi, how that through <hi>Faith</hi> they <hi>ſubdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteouſneſs, obtained Promiſes, ſtopt the Mouths of Lions, quenched the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Fire, eſcaped the Edge of the Sword,</hi> out of Weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in Fight, and turned to flight the <hi>Armies</hi> of the <hi>Aliens;</hi> of <hi>Women,</hi> that received their dead to Life again, and others were <hi>tortured,</hi> not accepting of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that they might obtain a <hi>better</hi> Reſurrection; then he comes to ſpeak of the Sufferings of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and bids us, <hi>Look unto</hi> him. Heb. xii. 1, 2, 3. Wherefore <hi>ſeeing we are compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us lay aſide every Weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us; and let us run with Patience the Race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith: Who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the Shame, and is ſet down at the right Hand of the Throne of God. For Conſider him that endured ſuch Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf, leſt ye be wearied and faint in your Minds.</hi> Bleſſed are they that can <hi>endure</hi> all theſe Things, <hi>Shame, Reproach, Contumely</hi> and <hi>Diſdain, Perſecutions</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> that attend the Teſtimony of Jeſus! Bleſſed are they that can endure the <hi>Croſs,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:010868_0068_0F851ADAB68F8F50"/>
and deſpiſe the <hi>Shame!</hi> It is an internal <hi>Croſs,</hi> which thou muſt endure for Chriſt, or thy own Heart will reprove thee, check thee and condemn thee, for it: But if thou comeſt to know a being <hi>crucified</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thou ſhalt reign with him, and be raiſed up to eternal Glory with him. Unleſs thou knoweſt a Dying to the World, and a being crucified with Chriſt, thou canſt not have a well grounded Hope of everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore now, <hi>Friends,</hi> Examine your ſelves about your <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> It is the Wiſdom and Practice of the World, to examine their <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements,</hi> and to ſee they be ſure, and firm, and ſtable before hand: So we ſhould make ſure for <hi>Heaven</hi> and eternal Glory, and of an <hi>Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> before this earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be diſſolved; then for us to <hi>live,</hi> will be Chriſt, and to <hi>die</hi> will be eternal Gain. Bleſſed are they that bear Record of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that bear his Name and teſtify and join with him againſt the Spirit of the World, and the Prince of the Power of the Air. It is <hi>within,</hi> that thou muſt join with <hi>Chriſt's Appearance,</hi> that ſo thou mayſt be <hi>chriſtianized,</hi> and thy Mind made truly <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> Thou muſt be purified in thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and baptiſed with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and with <hi>Fire,</hi> and know the powerful Operation of the Lord: They that have not Experience of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> they cannot enter into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>my Friends,</hi> ſet before you the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was holy, harmleſs and undefiled; his <hi>Life</hi> was glorious in <hi>Holineſs:</hi> And as it becomes you, ſo it highly concerns you to be <hi>holy</hi> in all Manner of Converſation. For if you imitate not the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you cannot be ſaved <hi>by his Death:</hi> He came into the World, to redeem you from all Iniquity, and to ſave you from Sin and Hell; Labour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010868_0069_0F851ADB6ADEEA20"/>
the Dignity of your <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Holy Calling,</hi> with a Converſation becoming the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for you are called to Glory and Virtue. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Troubles, Temptations</hi> and <hi>Tribulations</hi> may attend you in your Pilgrimage here below. If you be faithful and ſincere, you will have <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>God</hi> through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. In all your <hi>Labours</hi> and <hi>Travels</hi> on this Earth, you may look up with Joy, for you have a <hi>ſerene Heaven over</hi> your Heads: Let Chriſt be precious to you; <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Door</hi> of your Hearts to him, who is the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Glory:</hi> He is oppreſſed in the <hi>Hearts of the Unclean,</hi> but he is exalted and lifted up in the Hearts of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Bleſſed are they that ſet him upon his Throne in their Hearts! O learn of Chriſt to be meek and lowly: Your Humility will exalt him, and will alſo exalt you at the laſt: <hi>Be faithful to the Death, and you ſhall receive a Crown of Life:</hi> Thoſe that have <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life</hi> in their Eye, and depend upon Chriſt alone for Salvation, they have laid a ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. All other Foundations will come to Nothing; they are founded in <hi>Time,</hi> and in <hi>Time</hi> the will come to moulder away: But that <hi>City</hi> that <hi>GOD</hi> is the Builder and Maker of, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had in his Eye, will never decay nor moulder away: Let us have this always in our Eye, that nothing may intercept our View. <hi>We have here</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>no continuing City; we ſeek one that is to come.</hi> In this World we are as <hi>Sheep</hi> among <hi>Wolves: Fear not, little Flock,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>It is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good Pleaſure to give you a Kingdom.</hi> If we be the <hi>Sheep of Chriſt,</hi> we ſhall follow him: For <hi>his Sheep follow him, and know his Voice, and a Stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they know not the Voice of a Stranger. My Sheep</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hear my Voice, and I know them, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Me, and I give unto them eternal Life, and they
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010868_0070_0F851ADC2A3849E0"/>
ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hands.</hi> Here is Encouragement for us to Labour abundantly in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Lord;</hi> for our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. Let us, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> chuſe rather to ſuffer <hi>Affliction</hi> with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, than to enjoy the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Sin for a Seaſon; and eſteem the <hi>Reproach</hi> of Chriſt greater Riches than the <hi>Treaſures</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have Reſpect to the Recompence of Reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friends,</hi> I beſeech you, in the Fear of God, look up unto <hi>JESUS,</hi> the GREAT MEDIATOR of the New Covenant, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith; that by patient Continuance in Well-doing, you may ſeek for Glory, Honour, Immortality, and eternal Life: Which you ſhall obtain, if you perſevere to the End: For he that endureth unto the End, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Be not weary of Well-doing; for in due Time you ſhall reap, if ye faint not. He that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and a mighty Preſerver of his People in all Ages of the World, and hath been ſo both to the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and to all our Chriſtian <hi>Friends</hi> that are gone before us to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reſt, if you faint not but follow them, who through Faith and Patience do inherit the Promiſes, you ſhall lay down your Heads in Peace in him, when you come to die: And when Time ſhall be no more, you ſhall be for ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>To GOD be Praiſe, Honour, and Glory, who hath ſtretched forth his mighty Arm to Save: Who is the <hi>Arm</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> but Chriſt Jeſus, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of Souls? When we had undone our ſelves, and loſt our ſelves, in wandering and departing from the Lord, the true and living God, into Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death, he ſtretched forth his Almighty <hi>Arm</hi> to gather us, and to bring us into the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010868_0071_0F851ADCE59AB198"/>
               <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God again, when we were driven out by our own Sin from the Face and Preſence of the Lord. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Great and Good Shepherd of his Sheep, came to ſeek and to ſave them that were loſt: The <hi>loſt Sheep</hi> that have wandered from him, he will take them on his Shoulder, and bring them to his Fold: And he will make them lie down in <hi>green Paſtures,</hi> and lead them by the <hi>ſtill Waters,</hi> and ſatisfy them with the <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> that are at God's right Hand for evermore. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, That he will feed his Flock like a Shepherd, and gather his Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Boſom: I hope CHRIST JESUS the GREAT SHEPHERD, will find ſome here this Day, that have gone aſtray, and gather them with his <hi>Divine Arm,</hi> and keep them by his mighty Power, through Faith unto Salvation. To Him be all <hi>Praiſe, Honour, Glory, Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving:</hi> For He alone is worthy, who is GOD over all, Bleſſed for ever and Ever! <hi>Amen.</hi>
