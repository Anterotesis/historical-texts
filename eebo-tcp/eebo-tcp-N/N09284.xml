            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I PRESUME to lay before Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the Hiſtory of a Period, which, if the abilities of the Writer were equal to the dignity of the Subject, would not be unworthy the attention of a Monarch, who is no leſs a Judge than a Patron of Literary Merit.</p>
                  <p>HISTORY claims it as her prerogative to offer inſtruction to KINGS, as well as to their people. What reflections the Reign of the Emperor CHARLES V. may ſuggeſt to your Majeſty, it becomes not me to conjecture. But your Subjects cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the various calamities, which that Monarch's ambition to be diſtinguiſhed as a Conqueror, brought upon his dominions, without recollecting the felicity of their own times, and looking up with gratitude to their Sovereign, who, during the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of youth, and amidſt the career of victory, poſſeſſed ſuch ſelf-command, and maturity of judgment, as to ſet bounds

to his own triumphs, and prefer the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of peace to the ſplendour of military glory.</p>
                  <p>POSTERITY will not only celebrate the Wiſdom of Your Majeſty's choice, but will enumerate the many Virtues, which render Your Reign conſpicuous for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred regard to all the duties, incumbent on the Sovereign of a Free People.</p>
                  <p>IT is our happineſs to feel the influence of theſe Virtues; and to live under the dominion of a Prince, who delights more in promoting the Publick Welfare, than in receiving the juſt Praiſe of his royal beneficence. I am,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>NO period in the hiſtory of ones own country can be conſidered as altogether unintereſting. Such tranſactions as tend to illuſtrate the progreſs of its conſtitution, laws or manners, merit the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Even remote and minute events are objects of a curioſity, which, being natural to the human mind, the gratification of it is attended with pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>BUT, with reſpect to the hiſtory of foreign States, we muſt ſet other bounds to our deſire of information. The univerſal progreſs of ſcience during the two laſt centuries, the art of printing, and other obvious cauſes, have filled Europe with ſuch a multiplicity of hiſtories, and with ſuch vaſt collections of hiſtorical materials, that the term of human life is too ſhort for the ſtudy or even the peruſal of them. It is neceſſary, then, not only for thoſe who are called to conduct the affairs of nations, but for ſuch as enquire and reaſon concerning them, to remain ſatisfied with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge of diſtant events, and to confine their ſtudy of hiſtory in detail chiefly to that period, in which the ſeveral States of Europe having become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately connected, the operations of one power are ſo felt by all, as to influence their councils, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their meaſures.</p>
                  <p>SOME boundary, then, ought to be fixed in order to ſeparate theſe periods. An aera ſhould be pointed out, prior to which, each country, little connected with thoſe around it, may trace its own hiſtory apart;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011837_0018_0F9D86FE6FCC2138"/>
after which, the tranſactions of every conſiderable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe become intereſting and inſtructive to all. With this intention I undertook to write the hiſtory of the Emperor CHARLES V. It was during his adminiſtration that the powers of Europe were formed into one great political ſyſtem, in which each took a ſtation, wherein it has ſince remained with leſs variation, than could have been expected after the ſhocks occaſioned by ſo many internal revolutions, and ſo many foreign wars. The great events which happened then have not hitherto ſpent their force. The political principles and maxims, then eſtabliſhed, ſtill continue to operate. The ideas concerning the balance of power, then introduced or rendered gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſtill influence the councils of nations.</p>
                  <p>THE age of CHARLES V. may therefore be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the period at which the political ſtate of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope began to aſſume a new form. I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render my account of it, an introduction to the hiſtory of Europe ſubſequent to his reign. While his numerous Biographers deſcribe his perſonal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and actions; while the hiſtorians of different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries relate occurrences the conſequences of which were local or tranſient, it hath been my purpoſe to record only thoſe great tranſactions in his reign, the effects of which were univerſal, or continue to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
                  <p>AS my readers could derive little inſtruction from ſuch a hiſtory of the reign of CHARLES V. without ſome information concerning the ſtate of Europe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſixteenth century, my deſire of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this has produced a preliminary work, in which I have attempted to point out and explain the great cauſes and events, to whoſe operation all the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the political ſtate of Europe, from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the ſixteenth century, muſt be aſcribed. I have exhibited a view of the progreſs of ſociety in Europe, not only with reſpect to interior government, laws and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but with reſpect to the command of the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal force requiſite in foreign operations; and I have deſcribed the political conſtitution of the principal
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011837_0019_0F9D86FF33A65210"/>
ſtates in Europe at the time when CHARLES V. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his reign.</p>
                  <p>IN this part of my work I have been led into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral critical diſquiſitions, which belong more properly to the province of the lawyer or antiquary, than to that of the hiſtorian. Theſe I have placed near the end of the firſt volume, under the title of Proofs and Illuſtrations. Many of my readers will, probably, give little attention to ſuch reſearches. To ſome they may, perhaps, appear the moſt curious and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the work. I have carefully pointed out the ſources from which I have derived information, and have cited the writers on whoſe authority I rely with a minute exactneſs, which might appear to border upon oſtentation, if it were poſſible to be vain of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read books, many of which nothing but the duty of examining with accuracy whatever I laid before the publick, could have induced me to open. As my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries conducted me often into paths which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure or little frequented, ſuch conſtant recourſe to the authors who have been my guides, was not only neceſſary for authenticating the facts which are the foundations of my reaſonings, but may be uſeful in pointing out the way to ſuch as ſhall hereafter hold the ſame courſe, and in enabling them to carry on their reſearches with greater facility and ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>EVERY intelligent reader will obſerve one omiſſion in my work, the reaſon of which it is neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. I have given no account of the conqueſts of Mexico and Peru, or of the eſtabliſhment of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh colonies in the continent and iſlands of America. The hiſtory of theſe events I originally intended to have related at conſiderable length. But upon a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more attentive conſideration of this part of my plan, I found that the diſcovery of the new world; the ſtate of ſociety among its ancient inhabitants; their characters, manners, and arts; the genius of the European ſettlements in its various provinces, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the influence of theſe upon the ſyſtems of policy or commerce in Europe, were ſubjects ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and important, that a ſuperficial view of them could afford little ſatisfaction; to treat of them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011837_0020_0F9D86FFF3F28DB0"/>
as they merited, muſt produce an epiſode, diſproportionate to the principal work. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſerved theſe for a ſeparate hiſtory; which, if the performance now offered to the public ſhall receive its approbation, I propoſe to undertake.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH, by omitting ſuch conſiderable but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached articles in the reign of CHARLES V. I have circumſcribed my narration within more narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, I am yet perſuaded, from this view of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and nature of the work which I thought it neceſſary to lay before my readers, that the plan muſt ſtill appear to them too extenſive, and the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too arduous. I have often felt them to be ſo. But my conviction of the utility of ſuch a hiſtory prompted me to perſevere. With what ſucceſs I have executed it, the public muſt now judge. I wait, in ſolicitude, for its deciſion; to which I ſhall ſubmit with a reſpectful ſilence.</p>

                  <p>TWO great Revolutions have happened in the political ſtate, and in the manners of the European nations.<note place="margin">The effects of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power on the ſtate of Europe.</note> The firſt was occaſioned by the progreſs of the Roman power; the ſecond by the ſubverſion of the Roman Empire. When the ſpirit of conqueſt led the armies of Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Alps, they found all the countries which they invaded, inhabited by people whom they denominated barbarians, but who were nevertheleſs brave and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. Theſe defended their ancient poſſeſſions with obſtinate valour. It was by the ſuperiority of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, rather than of their courage, that the Romans gained any advantage over them. A ſingle battle did not, as among the effeminate inhabitants of Aſia, decide the fate of a ſtate. The vanquiſhed people reſumed their arms with freſh ſpirit, and their undiſciplined valour, animated by the love of liberty, ſupplied the want of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011837_0023_0F9D87023178A470"/>
conduct as well as of union. During theſe long and fierce ſtruggles for dominion or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">The deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the countries of Europe were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively laid waſte, a great part of their inhabitants periſhed in the field, many were carried into ſlavery, and a feeble remnant, incapable of further reſiſtance, ſubmitted to the Roman power.</p>
                  <p>THE Romans having thus deſolated Europe, ſet themſelves to civilize it.<note place="margin">The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced.</note> The form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which they eſtabliſhed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered provinces, though ſevere, was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and preſerved public tranquillity As a conſolation for the loſs of liberty, they communicated their arts, ſciences, language and manners, to their new ſubjects. Europe began to breathe, and to recover ſtrength after the calamities which it had undergone; agriculture was encouraged; population encreaſed; the ruined cities were rebuilt; new towns were founded; an appearance of proſperity ſucceeded, and repaired, in ſome degree, the havock of war.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſtate, however, was far from being happy, or favourable to the improvement of the human mind.<note place="margin">The bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their dominion.</note> The vanquiſhed nations were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed by their conquerors, and overawed by ſoldiers kept in pay to reſtrain them. They were given up as a prey to rapacious governors, who plundered them with impunity; and were drained of their wealth by exorbitant taxes, impoſed with ſo little attention to the ſituation of the provinces, that the impoſitions were generally increaſed in proportion to their inability to ſupport them. They were deprived of their moſt enterprizing citizens, who reſorted to a diſtant capital in queſt of preferment, or of riches; and were accuſtomed in all their actions to look up to a ſuperior, and tamely to receive his commands. Under all theſe depreſſing circumſtances, it was impoſſible that they could retain vigour or generoſity of mind. The martial and independant ſpirit, which had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their anceſtors, became extinct among all the people ſubjected to the Roman yoke; they loſt not only the habit but even the capacity of deciding for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011837_0024_0F9D8702F358E5C0"/>
themſelves, or of acting from the impulſe of their own minds; and the dominion of the Romans, like that of all great Empires, degraded and debaſed the human ſpecies <note n="[A]" place="bottom">NOTE I.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A SOCIETY in this ſtate could not ſubſiſt long. There were defects in the Roman government,<note place="margin">The irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the barbarous nations.</note> even in its moſt perfect form, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened its diſſolution. Time ripened theſe original ſeeds of corruption, and gave birth to many new diſorders. A conſtitution, unſound, and worn out, muſt have fallen in pieces of itſelf, without any external ſhock. The violent irruption of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarians haſtened this event, and precipitated the downfall of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. New nations ſeemed to ariſe, and to ruſh from unknown regions in order to take vengeance on the Romans for the calamities which they had inflicted on mankind. Theſe fierce tribes either inhabited the various provinces in Germany, which had never been ſubdued by the Romans, or were ſcattered over the vaſt countries in the north of Europe, and north-weſt of Aſia, which are now occupied by the Danes, the Swedes, the Poles, the ſubjects of the Ruſſian Empire, and the Tartars. Their condition, and tranſactions previous to their invaſion of the Empire are but little known.

                  <p>THE prodigious ſwarms which poured in upon the Empire from the beginning of the fourth century to the final extinction of the Roman power, have given riſe to an opinion that the countries whence they

                  <p>THEIR firſt inroads into the Empire proceeded rather from the love of plunder, than from the deſire of new ſettlements.<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their firſt excurſions.</note> Rouſed to arms by ſome enterprizing or popular leader, they ſallied out of their foreſts; broke in upon her frontier provinces with irreſiſtible violence; put all who oppoſed them to the ſword; carried off the moſt valuable effects of the inhabitants; dragged along multitudes of captives in chains; waſted all

before them with fire or ſword; and returned in triumph to their wilds and faſtneſſes. Their ſucceſs, together with the accounts which they gave of the unknown conveniencies and luxuries that abounded in the countries better cultivated, or bleſſed with a milder climate than their own, excited new adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and expoſed the frontier to new devaſtations.</p>
                  <p>WHEN nothing was left to plunder in the adjacent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ravaged by frequent incurſions,<note place="margin">Their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in the countries which they conquered.</note> they marched farther from home, and finding it difficult, or dangerous to return, they began to ſettle in the countries which they had ſubdued. The ſudden and ſhort excurſions in queſt of booty, which had alarmed, and diſquieted the Empire, ceaſed; a more dreadful calamity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. Great bodies of armed men with their wives and children, and ſlaves and flocks, iſſued forth, like regular colonies, in queſt of new ſettlements. People who had no cities, and ſeldom any fixed habitation, were ſo little attached to their native ſoil, that they migrated without reluctance from one place to another. New adventurers followed them. The lands which they deſerted were occupied by more remote tribes of barbarians. Theſe in their turn, puſhed forward into more fertile countries, and like a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent continually increaſing, rolled on,<note place="margin">The extent of their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements.</note> and ſwept every thing before them. In leſs than two centuries from their firſt irruption, barbarians of various names and lineage, plundered and took poſſeſſion of Thrace, Pannonia, Gaul, Spain, Africa, and at laſt of Italy, and Rome itſelf. The vaſt fabrick of the Roman power which it had been the work of ages to perfect, was in that ſhort period overturned from the foundation.</p>
                  <p>MANY concurring cauſes prepared the way for this great revolution, and enſured ſucceſs to the nations which invaded the Empire.<note place="margin">The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the downfal of the Roman Empire.</note> The Roman commonwealth had conquered the world by the wiſdom of its civil max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, and the rigour of its military diſcipline. But, under the Emperors, the former were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011837_0027_0F9D870530F12108"/>
forgotten or deſpiſed, and the latter was gradually relaxed. The armies of the Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries bore ſcarce any reſemblance to thoſe invincible legions which had been victorious wherever they marched. Inſtead of freemen, who voluntarily took arms from the love of glory, or of their country, provincials and barbarians were bribed or forced into ſervice. They were too feeble, or too proud to ſubmit to the fatigue of military duty. They even complained of the weight of their defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armour, as intolerable, and laid it aſide. Infantry, from which the armies of ancient Rome derived their vigour and ſtability, fell into contempt; the effeminate and undiſciplined ſoldiers of later times could ſcarce be brought to venture into the field but on horſeback. Theſe wretched troops, however, were the only guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Empire. The jealouſy of deſpotiſm had deprived the people of the uſe of arms; and ſubjects oppreſſed and rendered incapable of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, had neither ſpirit nor inclination to reſiſt their invaders, from whom they had little to fear, becauſe they could ſcarce make their condition more unhappy. As the martial ſpirit became extinct, the revenues of the Empire gradually diminiſhed. The taſte for the luxuries of the Eaſt increaſed to ſuch a pitch in the Imperial Court, that great ſums were carried into India, from whence money never returns. By the vaſt ſubſidies paid to the barbarous nations a ſtill greater quantity of ſpecies was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from circulation. The frontier provinces waſted by frequent incurſions became unable to pay the cuſtomary tribute; and the wealth of the world, which had long centered in the capital of the Empire, ceaſed to flow thither in the ſame abundance, or was diverted into other channels. The limits of the Empire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be as extenſive as ever, while the ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for its defence declined, and its reſources were exhauſted. A vaſt body, languid, and almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, became incapable of any effort to ſave itſelf, and was eaſily overpowered. The Emperors, who had the abſolute direction of this diſordered ſyſtem, ſunk in the ſoftneſs of Eaſtern luxury, ſhut up within
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011837_0028_0F9D8705F1319508"/>
the walls of a palace ignorant of war, unacquainted with affairs, and governed entirely by women and eunuchs, or by miniſters equally effeminate, trembled at the approach of danger, and under circumſtances which called for the utmoſt vigour in counſel as well as in action, diſcovered all the impotent irreſolution of fear, and of folly.</p>
                  <p>IN every reſpect, the condition of the barbarous nations was the reverſe of that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Among them,<note place="margin">The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſucceſs of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> the martial ſpirit was in full vigour; their leaders were hardy and enterprizing; the arts which had ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the Romans were unknown among them; and ſuch was the nature of their military inſtitutions, that they brought forces into the field without any trouble, and ſupported them at little expence. The mercenary and effeminate troops ſtationed on the frontier, aſtoniſhed at their fierceneſs, either fled at their approach, or were routed in the firſt onſet. The feeble expedient to which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors had recourſe, of taking large bodies of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians into pay, and of employing them to repel new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, inſtead of retarding, haſtened the deſtruction of the Empire. They ſoon turned their arms againſt their maſters, and with greater advantage than ever: for, by ſerving in the Roman armies, they had acquired all the diſcipline, or ſkill in war, which the Romans ſtill retained; and upon adding theſe to their native fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they became altogether irreſiſtable.</p>
                  <p>BUT though from theſe, and many other cauſes, the progreſs and conqueſts of the nations which over-ran the Empire,<note place="margin">The ſpirit with which they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on war.</note> became ſo extremely rapid, they were accompanied with horrible devaſtations, and an incredible deſtruction of the human ſpecies. Civilized nations which take arms upon cool reflection, from motives of policy or prudence, with a view to guard againſt ſome diſtant danger or to prevent ſome remote contingency, carry on their hoſtilities with ſo little rancour, or animoſity, that war among them is diſarmed of half its terrors. Barbarians are ſtrangers to ſuch refinements. They
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011837_0029_0F9D8706B02925B8"/>
ruſh into war with impetuoſity, and proſecute it with violence. Their ſole object is to make their enemies feel the weight of their vengeance, nor does their rage ſubſide until it be ſatiated with inflicting on them every poſſible calamity. It is with ſuch a ſpirit that the ſavage tribes in America carry on their petty wars. It was with the ſame ſpirit that the more powerful and no leſs fierce barbarians in the north of Europe, and of Aſia, fell upon the Roman Empire.</p>
                  <p>WHENEVER they marched, their rout was marked with blood.<note place="margin">The deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they bro't upon Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</note> They ravaged or deſtroyed all around them. They made no diſtinction between what was ſacred, and what was profane. They reſpected no age, or ſex, or rank. What eſcaped the fury of the firſt inundation periſhed in thoſe which followed it. The moſt fertile and populous provinces were converted into deſarts, in which were ſcattered the ruins of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and cities, that afforded ſhelter to a few miſerable inhabitants whom chance had preſerved, or the ſword of the enemy, wearied with deſtroying, had ſpared. The conquerors who firſt ſettled in the countries which they had waſted were expelled or exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by new invaders, who coming from regions farther removed from the civilized parts of the world, were ſtill more fierce and rapacious. This brought new calamities upon mankind, which did not ceaſe until the north, by pouring forth ſucceſſive ſwarms, was drained of people, and could no longer furniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of deſtruction. Famine and peſtilence, which always march in the the train of war when it rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with ſuch inconſiderate cruelty, raged in every part of Europe, and compleated its ſufferings. If a man were called to fix upon the period, in the hiſtory of the world, during which the condition of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race was moſt calamitous and afflicted, he would without heſitation, name that which elapſed from the death of Theodoſius the Great, to the eſtabliſhment of the Lombards in Italy <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Theodoſius died A.

But in order to exhibit a juſt view of the ſtate of Europe at the opening of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, it is neceſſary to look back, and to contemplate the condition of the northern nations upon their firſt ſettlement in thoſe countries which they occupied. It is neceſſary to mark the great ſteps by which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced from barbariſm to refinement, and to point out thoſe general principles and events which by their uniform as well as extenſive operation, conducted all of them to that degree of improvement in policy and in manners, which they had attained at the period when Charles V. began his reign.</p>

There is no nation in Europe whoſe records reach back to this remote period; and there is little information to be got from the uninſtructive and meagre chronicles, compiled by writers ignorant of the true end, and unacquainted with the proper objects of hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>THIS new diviſion of property, however, together with the maxims and manners to which it gave riſe,<note place="margin">The feudal government gradually eſtabliſhed among them.</note> gradually introduced a ſpecies of government formerly unknown. This ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular inſtitution is now diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi>Feudal ſyſtem:</hi> and though the barbarous nations which framed it, ſettled in their new territories at different times, came from different countries, ſpoke various languages, and were under the command of ſeparate leaders, the Feudal policy and laws were eſtabliſhed with little variation, in every kingdom of Europe. This amazing uniformity hath induced ſome authors <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Procop. de Bello Vandal. ap. Script. Byz. edit. Ven. vol. i. p. 345.</note> to believe that all theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithſtanding ſo many apparent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of diſtinction, were originally the ſame people. But it may be aſcribed with greater probability to the ſimilar ſtate of ſociety and of manners to which they were accuſtomed in their native countries, and to the ſimilar ſituation in which they found themſelves on taking poſſeſſion of their new domains.</p>
                  <p>AS the conquerors of Europe had their acquiſitions to maintain, not only againſt ſuch of the ancient inhabitants as they had ſpared,<note place="margin">National defence the great object of feudal policy.</note> but againſt the formidable inroads of new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, ſelf-defence was their chief care, and ſeems to have been the ſole object of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011837_0033_0F9D870A7A0BD148"/>
their firſt inſtitution and policy. Inſtead of thoſe looſe aſſociations, which, though they ſcarce diminiſhed their perſonal independance, had been ſufficient for their ſecurity while they remained in their original countries, they ſaw the neceſſity of confederating more cloſely together, and of relinquiſhing ſome of their private rights in order to attain public ſafety. Every freeman, upon receiving a portion of the lands which were divided, bound himſelf to appear in arms againſt the enemies of the community. This military ſervice was the condition upon which he received and held his lands, and as they were exempted from every other burden, that tenure, among a warlike, people, was deemed both eaſy and honourable, The king or General, who led them to conqueſt, continuing ſtill to be the head of the colony, had, of courſe, the largeſt portion allotted to him. Having thus acquired the means of rewarding paſt ſervices, as well as of gaining new adherents, he parcelled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

His chief officers imitated the example of the ſovereign, and in diſtributing portions of their lands among their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, annexed the ſame condition to the grant. Thus a feudal kingdom reſembled a military eſtabliſhment, rather than a civil inſtitution. The victorious army cantoned out in the country which it had ſeized, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ranged under its proper officers, and ſubordinate to military command.

its beſt and moſt perfect form. They ſoon unfolded themſelves, and ſpreading with rapidity through every part of the ſyſtem, produced the moſt fatal effects. The bond of political union was extremely feeble; the ſources of anarchy were innumerable. The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archical and ariſtocratical parts of the conſtitution, having no intermediate power to balance them, were perpetually at variance, and juſtling with each other The powerful vaſſals of the crown ſoon extorted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation for life of thoſe grants of land, which being at firſt purely gratuitous, had been beſtowed only during pleaſure. Not ſatisfied with this, they prevailed to have them converted into hereditary poſſeſſions. One ſtep more completed their uſurpations, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them unalienable <note n="[H]" place="bottom">NOTE VIII.</note>. With an ambition no leſs enterprizing, and more prepoſterous, they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to themſelves titles of honour, as well as offices of power or truſt. Theſe perſonal marks of diſtinction, which the publick admiration beſtows on illuſtrious merit, or which the publick confidence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers on extraordinary abilities, were annexed to certain families, and tranſmitted like fiefs, from father to ſon by hereditary right. The crown vaſſals having thus ſecured the poſſeſſion of their lands and dignities, the nature of the Feudal inſtitutions, which though found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſubordination, verged to independence, led them to new, and ſtill more dangerous encroachments on the prerogatives of the ſovereign. They obtained the power of ſupreme juriſdiction both civil and criminal within their own territories; the right of coining money; together with the privilege of carrying on war againſt their private enemies in their own name, and by their own authority. The ideas of political ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection were almoſt entirely loſt, and frequently ſcarce any appearance of Feudal ſubordination remained. Nobles who had acquired ſuch enormous power, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider themſelves ſubjects. They aſpired openly at being independent: the bonds which connected the principal members of the conſtitution with the crown, were diſſolved. A kingdom conſiderable in name and

in extent, was broken into as many ſeparate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities as it contained powerful barons. A thouſand cauſes of jealouſy and diſcord ſubſiſted among them, and gave riſe to as many wars. Every country in Europe, waſted or kept in continual alarm during theſe endleſs conteſts, was filled with caſtles and places of ſtrength, erected for the ſecurity of the inhabitants, not againſt foreign force, but againſt internal hoſtilities. An univerſal anarchy, deſtructive in a great meaſure, of all the advantages which men expect to derive from ſociety, prevailed. The people, the moſt numerous as well as the moſt uſeful part of the community, were either reduced to a ſtate of actual ſervitude, or treated with the ſame inſolence and rigour as if they had been degraded into that wretched condition <note n="[I]" place="bottom">NOTE IX.</note>. The King, ſtripped of almoſt every prerogative, and without authority to enact or to execute ſalutary laws, could neither protect the innocent, nor puniſh the guilty. The nobles, ſuperior to all reſtraint, harraſſed each other with perpetual wars, oppreſſed their fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and humbled or inſulted their ſovereign. To crown all, time gradually fixed, and rendered venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this pernicious ſyſtem, which violence had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>

Almoſt all the wars in Europe, during the ages which I have mentioned, were trifling, indeciſive, and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of no conſiderable event. They reſembled the ſhort incurſions of pirates or banditii, rather than the ſteady operations of a regular army. Every baron at the head of his vaſſals carried on ſome petty enterprize to which he was prompted by his own ambition, or revenge.

The ſtate itſelf, deſtitute of union, either remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inactive, or if it attempted to make any effort, that ſerved only to diſcover its impotence. The ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior genius of Charlemagne, it is true, united all theſe disjointed and diſcordant members, and forming them again into one body, reſtored that degree of activity to government which diſtinguiſh his reign, and render the tranſactions of it, objects not only of attention but of admiration to more enlightened times. But this ſtate of union and vigour not being natural to the feudal government, was of ſhort duration.

From that time to the eleventh century, a ſucceſſion of unintereſted events, a ſeries of wars, the motives as well as the conſequences of which were equally unimportant, fill and deform the annals of all the nations in Europe.</p>
                  <p>TO theſe pernicious effects of the feudal anarchy may be added its fatal influence on the character and improvement of the human mind.<note place="margin">The fatal effects of this ſtate of ſociety on ſciences and arts.</note> If men do not enjoy the protection of regular government, together with the certainty of perſonal ſecurity which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flows from it, they never attempt to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſcience, nor aim at attaining refinement in taſte, or in manners. That period of turbulence oppreſſion, and rapine, which I have deſcribed, was ill ſuited to favour improvement in any of theſe. In leſs than a century after the barbarous nations ſettled in their new conqueſt, almoſt all the effects of the knowledge and civility which the Romans had ſpread through Europe diſappeared.

All memory of paſt tranſactions was loſt, or preſerved in annals filled with trifling events, or legendary tales. Even the codes of laws publiſhed by the ſeveral nations which eſtabliſhed themſelves in the different countries of Europe, fell into diſuſe, while in their place, cuſtoms, vague and capricious, were ſubſtituted. The human mind neglected, uncultivated and depreſſed, ſunk into the moſt profound ignorance. Europe did not produce, during four centuries, one author who merits to be read, either on account of the elegance of his compoſition, or the juſtneſs and novelty of his ſentiments. There is ſcarce one invention uſeful or ornamental to ſociety of which that long period can boaſt.</p>
                  <p>EVEN the Chriſtian religion, though its precepts are delivered,<note place="margin">Upon reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> and its inſtitutions are fixed in ſcripture with a preciſion which ſhould have exempted them from being miſinterpreted or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, degenerated during thoſe ages of darkneſs into an illiberal ſuperſtition. The barbarous nations when converted to Chriſtianity changed the object, not the ſpirit of their religious worſhip. They endeavoured to conciliate the favour of the true God by means not unlike to thoſe which they had employed in order to appeaſe their falſe deities. Inſtead of aſpiring to ſanctity and virtue, which alone can render men accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the great author of order and of excellence, they imagined that they ſatisfied every obligation of duty by a ſcrupulous obſervance of external ceremonies <note n="[L]" place="bottom">NOTE XI.</note>.

                  <p>AS the inhabitants of Europe during theſe centuries were ſtrangers to the arts which embelliſh a poliſhed age,<note place="margin">Upon the character and virtues of the human mind.</note> they were deſtitute of the virtues which abound among people who continue in a ſimple ſtate. Force of mind, a ſenſe of perſonal dignity, gallantry in enterpriſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible perſeverance in execution, and contempt of danger and of death, are the characteriſtic virtues of uncivilized nations. But theſe are all the offspring of equality and independence, both which the feudal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions had deſtroyed. The ſpirit of domination corrupted the nobles; the yoke of ſervitude depreſſed the people; the generous ſentiments inſpired by a ſenſe of equality were extinguiſhed, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be a check on ferocity and violence. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety is in its moſt corrupted ſtate at that period when men have loſt their original independence and ſimplicity of manners, but have not attained that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of refinement which introduces a ſenſe of deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and of propriety in conduct, as a reſtraint on thoſe paſſions which lead to heinous crimes. Accordingly, a greater number of thoſe attrocious actions which fill the mind of man with aſtoniſhment and horror, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the hiſtory of the centuries under review, than in that of any period of the ſame extent in the annals of Europe.

In their progreſs towards the Holy Land, the followers of the croſs marched through countries better cultivated, and more civiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than their own. Their firſt rendezvous was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Italy, in which Venice, Genoa, Piſa, and other cities had begun to apply themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and had made ſome advances towards wealth as well as refinement. They embarked there, and landing in Dalmatia, purſued their route by land to Conſtantinople. Though the military ſpirit had been long extinct in the eaſtern empire, and a deſpotiſm of the worſt ſpecies had annihilated almoſt every public virtue, yet Conſtantinople having never felt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive rage of the barbarous nations, was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, as well as the moſt beautiful city in Europe, and the only one in which there remained any image of the ancient elegance in manners, and arts. The naval power of the eaſtern Empire was conſiderable. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of the moſt curious fabrick were carried on in its dominions.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Saracens and Turks had torn from the Empire many of its richeſt provinces, and had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it within very narrow bounds, yet great wealth flowed into the capital from theſe various ſources, which not only cheriſhed ſuch a taſte for magnificence, but kept alive ſuch a reliſh for the ſciences as appear conſiderable when compared with what was known in other parts of Europe. Even in Aſia, the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011837_0044_0F9D8711F116C9A8"/>
who had aſſumed the croſs found the remains of the knowledge and arts which the example and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Caliphs had diffuſed through their empire. Although the attention of the hiſtorians of the Cruſades was fixed on other objects than the ſtate of ſociety and manners among the nations which they invaded, although moſt of them had neither taſte nor diſcernment enough to deſcribe them, they relate, however, ſuch ſignal acts of humanity and generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the conduct of Saladin as well as ſome other lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Mahometans, as give us a very high idea of their manners. It was not poſſible for the Cruſaders to travel through ſo many countries, and to behold their various cuſtoms and inſtitutions without acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing information and improvement. Their views en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; their prejudices wore off; new ideas crowded into their minds; and they muſt have been ſenſible on many occaſions of the ruſticity of their own manners when compared with thoſe of a more poliſhed people. Theſe impreſſions were not ſo ſlight as to be effaced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their return to their native countries. A cloſe intercourſe ſubſiſted between the Eaſt and Weſt dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two centuries; new armies were continually marching from Europe to Aſia, while former adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers returned home and imported many of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms to which they had been familiarized by a long reſidence abroad. Accordingly we diſcover, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commencement of the Cruſades, greater ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in the courts of Princes, greater pomp in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ceremonies, a more refined taſte in pleaſure and amuſements, together with a more romantic ſpirit of enterprize ſpreading gradually over Europe; and to theſe wild expeditions, the effect of ſuperſtition or folly, we owe the firſt gleams of light which tended to diſpel barbarity and ignorance.</p>

more immediate as well as diſcernible. The nobles who aſſumed the croſs, and bound themſelves to march to the Holy Land, ſoon perceived that great ſums were neceſſary towards defraying the expences of ſuch a diſtant expedition, and enabling them to appear with ſuitable dignity at the head of their vaſſals.

No expedient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for levying the ſums requiſite, but the ſale of their poſſeſſions.

The great barons imitated the example of their monarch, and granted like immunities to the towns within their territories. They had waſted ſuch great ſums in their expeditions to the Holy Land, that they were eager to lay hold on this new expedient for raiſing money, by the ſale of theſe charters of liberty. Though the inſtitution of communities was as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their maxims of policy, as it was adverſe to their power, they diſregarded remote conſequences, in order to obtain preſent relief. In leſs than two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies ſervitude was aboliſhed in moſt of the towns in France, and they became free corporations, inſtead of dependant villages without juriſdiction or privileges <note n="[Q]" place="bottom">NOTE XVI.</note>.

The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement of ſlaves became more frequent; and the Monarchs of France prompted by neceſſity, no leſs than by their inclination to reduce the power of the nobles, endeavoured to render it general.

In ſome provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, the perſons who had been ſubject to this ſpecies of bondage, were releaſed; in others, the rigour of their ſtate was mitigated.

THE various expedients which were employed in order to introduce a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, equal and vigorous adminiſtration of juſtice, contributed greatly towards the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſociety. What was the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mode of diſpenſing juſtice in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral barbarous nations which over-ran the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, and took poſſeſſion of its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent provinces, cannot now be determined with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. We may conclude from the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed among them, as well as from their ideas concerning the nature of ſociety, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the magiſtrate was extremely limited, and the independance of individuals proportionably great. Hiſtory and records, as far as they reach back, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy this concluſion, and repreſent the ideas and exerciſe of juſtice in all the countries of Europe, as little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe which muſt take place in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To maintain the order and tranquillity of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety by the regular execution of known laws; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vengeance on crimes deſtructive of the peace and ſafety of individuals, by a proſecution carried on in the name, and by the authority of the community; to conſider the puniſhment of criminals as a public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to deter others from violating the laws; were objects of government little underſtood in theory, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011837_0058_0F9D871D30CCD028"/>
leſs regarded in practice. The magiſtrate could ſcarce be ſaid to hold the ſword of juſtice; it was left in the hands of private perſons. Reſentment was almoſt the ſole motive for proſecuting crimes; and to gratify that paſſion, was the end and rule in puniſhing them. He who ſuffered the wrong, was the only perſon who had a right to purſue the aggreſſor, and to exact or to remit the puniſhment. From a ſyſtem of judicial procedure, ſo crude and defective as ſeems to be ſcarce compatible with the ſubſiſtence of civil ſociety, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and anarchy flowed. Superſtition concurred with this ignorance concerning the nature of government, in obſtructing the adminiſtration of juſtice, or in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it capricious and unequal. To provide reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for theſe evils, ſo as to give a more regular courſe to juſtice, was, during ſeveral centuries, one great object of political wiſdom. The regulations for this purpoſe, may be reduced to three general heads: to explain theſe, and to point out the manner in which they operated is an important article in the hiſtory of ſociety among the nations of Europe.</p>

THE firſt conſiderable ſtep towards eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing an equal adminiſtration of juſtice,<note place="margin">This effected by aboliſhing the practice of private war.</note> was the aboliſhment of the right which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>individuals claimed of waging war with each other, in their own name, and by their own authority.

Nor do men in this ſituation deem that they have a title to redreſs their own wrongs alone; they are touched with the injuries of thoſe with whom they are connected, or in whoſe honour they are intereſted; and are no leſs prompt to avenge them. The ſavage, how imperfectly ſoever he may comprehend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of political union, feels warmly the ſentiments of ſocial affection, and the obligations ariſing from the ties of blood. On the appearance of an injury or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front offered to his family or tribe, he kindles into rage, and purſues the authors of it with the keeneſt

When they came to ſettle in the extenſive provinces which they had conquered, and to form themſelves into great monarchies; when new objects of ambition preſenting themſelves, increaſed both the number and the violence of their diſſenſions, they ought to have adopted new maxims concerning the redreſs of injuries and to have regulated by general and equal laws, that which they formerly left to be directed by the caprice of private paſſion. But fierce and haughty chieftains, accuſtomed to avenge themſelves on ſuch as had inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, did not think of relinquiſhing a right which they conſidered as a privilege of their order, and a mark of their independence. Laws enforced by the authority of Princes and Magiſtrates who poſſeſſed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle power, commanded no great degree of reverence. The adminiſtration of juſtice among rude illiterate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was not ſo accurate or deciſive, or uniform, as to induce men to ſubmit implicitly to its determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Every offended baron buckled on his armour, and ſought redreſs at the head of his vaſſals. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary met him in like hoſtile array. Neither of them appealed to impotent laws which could afford them no protection.

Both truſted to their ſwords for the deciſion of the

It was the intereſt of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſovereign to aboliſh a practice which almoſt annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his authority. Charlemagne prohibited it by an expreſs law, as an invention of the devil to deſtroy the order and happineſs of ſociety <note n="c" place="bottom">Capitul. A. D. 808. Edit. Baluz.

Inſtead of enforcing this prohibition, his feeble ſucceſſors durſt venture on nothing more than to apply pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatives. They declared it unlawful for any perſon to commence war, until he had ſent a formal defiance to the kindred and dependants of his adverſary; they ordained that, after the commiſſion of the treſpaſs or crime which gave riſe to a private war, forty days muſt elapſe before the perſon injured ſhould attack the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011837_0061_0F9D871F71B6B710"/>
vaſſals of his adverſary; they enjoined all perſons to ſuſpend their private animoſities, and to ceaſe from hoſtilities when the king was engaged in any war againſt the enemies of the nation. The church co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated with the civil magiſtrate, and interpoſed its authority in order to extirpate a practice ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity. Various councils iſſued decrees, prohibiting all private wars; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the heavieſt anathemas againſt ſuch as ſhould diſturb the tranquillity of ſociety, by claiming or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing that barbarous right. The aid of religion was called in to combat and ſubdue the ferocity of the times. The Almighty was ſaid to have manifeſted, by viſions and revelations to different perſons, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of that ſpirit of revenge, which armed one part of his creatures againſt the other. Men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in the name of God, to ſheath their ſwords, and to remember the ſacred ties which united them as Chriſtians, and as members of the ſame ſociety. But this junction of civil and eccleſiaſtic authority, though ſtrengthened by every thing moſt apt to alarm and to over-awe the credulous ſpirit of thoſe ages, produced no other effect than ſome temporary ſuſpenſions of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, and a ceſſation from war on certain days and ſeaſons conſecrated to the more ſolemn acts of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The nobles continued to aſſert this dangerous privilege; they refuſed to obey ſome of the laws cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to annul or circumſcribe it; they eluded others; they petitioned; they remonſtrated; they ſtruggled for the right of private war as the higheſt and moſt honourable diſtinction of their order. Even ſo late as the fourteenth century, we find the nobles in ſeveral provinces of France contending for their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent method of terminating their differences by the ſword, in preference to that of ſubmitting them to the deciſion of any judge. The final abolition of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in that kingdom, and the other countries in which it prevailed, is not to be aſcribed ſo much to the force of ſtatutes and decrees, as to the gradual increaſe of the royal authority, and to the imperceptible progreſs

As the right of private war left many of the quarrels among indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals to be decided, like thoſe between na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by arms; the form of trial by judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al combat, which was eſtabliſhed in every country of Europe, baniſhed equity from courts of juſtice, and rendered chance or force the arbiter of their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. In civilized nations, all tranſactions of any importance are concluded in writing.<note place="margin">Defects in the judicial proceedings of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ages.</note> The exhibition of the deed or inſtrument is full evidence of the fact, and aſcertains with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion what each party has ſtipulated to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. But among a rude people, when the arts of reading and writing were ſuch uncommon attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that to be maſter of either, intitled a perſon to the appellation of a clerk or learned man, ſcarce any thing was committed to writing but treaties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Princes, their grants and charters to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or ſuch tranſactions between private parties as were of extraordinary conſequence, or had an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive effect. The greater part of affairs in common life and buſineſs were carried on by verbal contracts or promiſes. This, in many civil queſtions, not only made it difficult to bring proof ſufficient to eſtabliſh any claim, but encouraged falſehood and fraud, by rendering them extremely eaſy. Even in criminal caſes, where a particular fact muſt be aſcertained, or an accuſation be diſproved, the nature and effect of legal evidence was little underſtood by barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To define with accuracy that ſpecies of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which a court had reaſon to expect; to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine when it ought to inſiſt on poſitive proof, and when it ſhould be ſatisfied with a proof from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; to compare the teſtimony of diſcordant wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and to fix the degree of credit due to each; were diſcuſſions too intricate and ſubtile for the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence

of ignorant ages. In order to avoid encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering themſelves with theſe, a more ſimple form of procedure was introduced into courts as well civil as criminal. In all caſes, where the notoriety of the fact did not furniſh the cleareſt and moſt direct evidence, the perſon accuſed, or he againſt whom an action was brought, was called legally, or offered voluntarily to purge himſelf by oath; and upon his declaring his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, he was inſtantly acquitted <note n="e" place="bottom">Leg.

This abſurd practice effectually ſcreened guilt and fraud from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or puniſhment, by rendering the temptation to perjury ſo powerful, that it was not eaſy to reſiſt it. The pernicious effects of it were ſenſibly felt; and in order to guard againſt them, the laws ordained that oaths ſhould be adminiſtered with great ſolemnity, and accompanied with every circumſtance which could inſpire religious reverence, or ſuperſtitious terror <note n="f" place="bottom">Du Cange Gloſſar. voc. <hi>Juramentum,</hi> vol. iii. p. 1607.

This, however, proved a feeble remedy: theſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious rites became familiar, and their impreſſion on the imagination gradually diminiſhed; men who could venture to diſregard truth, were not apt to ſtartle at the ſolemnities of an oath.

To aſſert their own rights by force of arms, to inflict ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on thoſe who had injured or affronted them, were the diſtinction and pride of high-ſpirited nobles. The form of trial by combat coinciding with this maxim, flattered and gratified theſe paſſions. Every man was the guardian of his own honour, and of his own life; the juſtice of his cauſe, as well as his future reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, depended on his own courage and proweſs. This mode of deciſion was conſidered, accordingly, as one of the happieſt efforts of wiſe policy; and as ſoon as it was introuduced, all the forms of trial by fire or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and other ſuperſtitious experiments, fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, or were employed only in controverſies between perſons of inferior rank. The trial by combat was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed over all Europe, and received in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with equal ſatisfaction. Not only queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning uncertain or conteſted facts, but general and abſtract points in law were determined by the iſſue of a combat; and the latter was deemed a method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering truth more liberal as well as more ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than that by examination and argument. Not only might parties, whoſe minds were exaſperated by the eagerneſs and the hoſtility of oppoſition, defy their antagoniſt, and require him to make good his charge, or to prove his innocence, with his ſword; but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who had no intereſt in the iſſue of the queſtion, though called to declare the truth by laws which ought to have afforded them protection, were equally expoſed to the danger of a challenge, and equally bound to aſſert the veracity of their evidence by dint of arms. To complete the abſurdities of this military juriſprudence, even the character of a judge was not ſacred from its violence. Any one of the parties might interrupt a judge when about to deliver his opinion; might accuſe him of iniquity and corruption in the moſt reproachful terms, and throwing down

In other countries of Europe, efforts equally zealous were employed to maintain the eſtabliſhed cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and ſimilar conceſſions were extorted from their reſpective ſovereigns. It continued, however, to be an object of policy with every monarch of abilities or vigour, to explode the trial by combat; and various edicts were iſſued for this purpoſe. But the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was made concerning the right of private war, is equally applicable to the mode of trial under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. No cuſtom, how abſurd ſoever it may be, if it has ſubſiſted long, or derives its force from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and prejudices of the age in which it prevails, was ever aboliſhed by the bare promulgation of laws and ſtatutes. The ſentiments of the people muſt change, or ſome new power ſufficient to counteract it muſt be introduced. Such a change, accordingly, took place in Europe, as ſcience gradually increaſed and ſociety advanced towards more perfect order. In proportion as the prerogative of Princes extended, and came to acquire new force, a power, intereſted in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing every practice favourable to the independance of the nobles, was introduced. The ſtruggle, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, ſubſiſted for ſeveral centuries; ſometimes the new regulations and ideas ſeemed to gain ground; ſometimes ancient habits recurred; and though, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole, the trial by combat went more and more into diſuſe, yet inſtances of it occur, as late as the ſixteenth century, in the hiſtory both of France and of England. In proportion as it declined, the regular adminiſtration of juſtice was reſtored, the proceedings of courts were directed by known laws, the ſtudy of theſe became an object of attention to judges, and the people of Europe advanced faſt towards civility, when this great cauſe of the ferocity of their manners was removed <note n="[Y]" place="bottom">NOTE XXII.</note>.</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the encroachments of the feudal nobles on the prerogative of their Monarchs, their uſurping the adminiſtration of juſtice with ſupreme authority, both in civil and criminal cauſes, within the precincts of their own eſtates, was the moſt ſingular. In other nations, ſubjects have contended with their Princes, and have endeavoured to extend their own power and privileges; but in the hiſtory of their ſtruggles and pretenſions, we diſcover nothing ſimilar to this right which the feudal barons claimed,<note place="margin">Origin of the ſupreme and independent juriſdiction of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. It muſt have been ſomething pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in their genius and manners that ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this idea, and prompted them to inſiſt on ſuch a claim. Among the rude people who conquered the various provinces of the Roman Empire, and eſtabliſhed new kingdoms there, the paſſion of reſentment, too impetuous to bear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, was permitted to remain almoſt unreſtrained by the authority of laws. The perſon offended, as has been obſerved, retained not only the right of proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting but of puniſhing his adverſary. To him it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to inflict ſuch vengeance as ſatiated his rage, or to accept of ſuch ſatisfaction as appeaſed it. But while fierce barbarians continued to be the ſole judges in their own cauſe, their enmities were implacable, and immortal; they ſet no bounds either to the degree of their vengeance, or to the duration of their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The exceſſes which this occaſioned, proved ſo deſtructive of peace and order in ſociety, as forced them to think of ſome remedy. At firſt, arbiters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and by perſuaſion or intreaty prevailed on the party offended to accept of a fine or compoſition from the aggreſſor, and to drop all farther proſecution. But as ſubmiſſion to perſons who had no legal or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial

authority, was altogether voluntary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary to eſtabliſh judges with power ſufficient to enforce their own deciſions. The leader whom they were accuſtomed to follow and to obey, whoſe courage they reſpected, and in whoſe integrity they placed confidence, was the perſon to whom a martial people naturally committed this important preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Every chieftain was the commander of his tribe in war, and their judge in peace. Every baron led his vaſſals to the field, and adminiſtered juſtice to them in his hall. Their high-ſpirited dependants would not have recognized any other authority, or have ſubmitted to any other juriſdiction. But in times of turbulence and violence, the exerciſe of this new function was attended not only with trouble, but with danger. No perſon could aſſume the character of a judge, if he did not poſſeſs power ſufficient to protect the one party from the violence of private revenge, and to compel the other to accept of ſuch reparation as he enjoined. In conſideration of the extraordinary efforts which this office required, judges, beſides the fine which they appointed to be paid as a compenſation to the perſon or family who had been injured, levied an additional ſum as a recompence for their own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and in all the feudal kingdoms the latter was as preciſely aſcertained, and as regularly exacted, as the former.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The extent and bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this privilege.</note>THUS, by the natural operation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances peculiar to the manners or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſtate of the feudal nations, ſeparate and territorial juriſdictions came not only to be eſtabliſhed in every kingdom, but were eſtabliſhed in ſuch a way, that the intereſt of the barons concurred with their ambition in maintaining and extending them. It was not merely a point of honour with the feudal nobles to diſpenſe juſtice to their vaſſals; but from the exerciſe of that power aroſe one capital branch of their revenue; and the emoluments of their courts were frequently the main ſupport of their dignity. It was with infinite zeal that they aſſerted and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this high privilege of their order. By this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, every kingdom in Europe was ſplit
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011837_0072_0F9D872954335B30"/>
into as many ſeparate principalities as it contained powerful barons. Their vaſſals, whether in peace or in war, were ſcarce ſenſible of any authority, but that of their ſuperior lord. They felt themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no other command. They were amenable to no other juriſdiction. The ties which linked together theſe ſmaller confederacies became cloſe and firm; the bonds of public union relaxed, or were diſſolved. The nobles ſtrained their invention in deviſing regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that tended to aſcertain and perpetuate this diſtinction. In order to guard againſt any appearance of ſubordination in their courts to thoſe of the crown, they conſtrained their monarchs to prohibit the royal judges from entering their territories, or from claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any juriſdiction there; and if, either through miſtake, or from the ſpirit of encroachment, any roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al judge ventured to extend his authority to the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of a baron, they might plead their right of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the lord of whom they held could not only reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them out of his hands, but was entitled to legal reparation for the injury and affront offered to him. The juriſdiction of the royal judges ſcarce reached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the narrow limits of the King's demeſnes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a regular gradation of courts, all acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of the ſame general laws, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to theſe as the guides of their deciſions, there were in every feudal kingdom a thouſand independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tribunals, the proceedings of which were directed by local cuſtoms and contradictory forms. The colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of juriſdiction between theſe numerous courts, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten retarded the execution of juſtice: The variety and caprice of their modes of procedure muſt have for ever kept the adminiſtration of it from attaining any degree of uniformity or perfection.</p>
                  <p>ALL the monarchs of Europe perceived theſe encroachments on their juriſdiction,<note place="margin">Expedients employed in order to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it.</note> and bore them with impatience. But the uſurpations of the nobles were ſo firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and the danger of endeavouring to overturn them by open force was ſo manifeſt, that they were obliged to remain ſatisfied with attempts to undermine them. Various expedients were employed for this
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011837_0073_0F9D8729F1B090D8"/>
purpoſe; each of which merit attention, as they mark the progreſs of law and equity in the ſeveral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe. At firſt, Princes endeavoured to circumſcribe the juriſdiction of the barons, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to take cognizance only of ſmaller offences, reſerving thoſe of greater moment, under the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Pleas of the Crown,</hi> and <hi>Royal Cauſes,</hi> to be tried in the King's courts. This affected only the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of inferior note; the more powerful nobles ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a diſtinction, and not only claimed unlimited juriſdiction, but obliged their ſovereigns to grant them charters, conveying or recognizing this privilege in the moſt ample form. The attempt, nevertheleſs, was productive of ſome good conſequences, and paved the way for more. It turned the attention of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the baron whoſe vaſſals they were; it accuſtomed them to the pretenſions of ſuperiority which the crown claimed over territorial judges; and taught them, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by their own ſuperior lord to look up to their ſovereign as their protector. This facilitated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of appeals, by which Princes brought the deciſions of the baron's courts under the review of the royal judges. While trial by combat ſubſiſted in full vigour, no point decided according to that mode, could be brought under the review of another court. It had been referred to the judgment of God; the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of battle had declared his will; and it would have been impious to have called in queſtion the equity of the divine deciſion. But as ſoon as that barbarous cuſtom began to fall into diſuſe, Princes encouraged the vaſſals of the barons to ſue for redreſs, by appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the royal courts. The progreſs, however, of this practice, was ſlow and gradual. The firſt inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of appeals were on account of <hi>the delay,</hi> or <hi>the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of juſtice</hi> in the baron's court; and as theſe were countenanced by the ideas of ſubordination in the feudal conſtitution, the nobles allowed them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced without much oppoſition. But when theſe were followed by appeals on account of <hi>the injuſtice,</hi> or <hi>iniquity of the ſentence,</hi> the nobles then began to be ſenſible, that if this innovation became general, the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011837_0074_0F9D872AB37E24E8"/>
ſhadow of power alone would remain in their hands, and all real authority and juriſdiction would center in thoſe courts which poſſeſſed the right of review. They inſtantly took the alarm, remonſtrated againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, and contended boldly for their ancient privileges. But the monarchs in the different king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe purſued their plan with ſteadineſs and prudence. Though forced to ſuſpend their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on ſome occaſions, and ſeemingly to yield when any formidable confederacy of their vaſſals united againſt them, they reſumed their meaſures, as ſoon as they obſerved the nobles to be remiſs or feeble, and puſhed them with vigour. They appointed the royal courts which originally were ambulatory, and irregular with reſpect to their times of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be held in a fixed place, and at ſtated ſeaſons. They were ſolicitous to name judges of more diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed abilities than ſuch as preſided in the courts of the barons. They added dignity to their character, and ſplendour to their aſſemblies. They laboured to render their forms regular, and their decrees conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Such judicatories became, of courſe, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of public confidence as well as veneration. The people, relinquiſhing the partial tribunals of their lords, were eager to bring every ſubject of conteſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the more equal and diſcerning eye of thoſe whom their ſovereign had choſen to give judgment in his name. Thus Kings became once more the heads of the community, and the diſpenſers of juſtice to their ſubjects. The barons, in ſome kingdoms, ceaſed to exerciſe their right of juriſdiction, becauſe it ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contempt; in others, it was circumſcribed by ſuch regulations as rendered it innocent, or it was entirely aboliſhed by expreſs ſtatutes. Thus the adminiſtration of juſtice taking its riſe from one ſource, and following one direction, held its courſe in every ſtate with more uniformity, and with greater force <note n="[Z]" place="bottom">NOTE XXIII.</note>.</p>

I have enumerated.

But if we contemplate it merely as a code of laws reſpecting the rights and property of individuals, and attend only to the civil effects of its deciſions concerning theſe, we muſt view it in a different, and a much more favourable light.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical uſurpation.</note> In ages of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and credulity, the miniſters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are the objects of ſuperſtitious venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When the barbarians who over-ran the Empire firſt embraced the Chriſtian faith, they found the clergy in poſſeſſion of conſiderable power; and they naturally transferred to theſe new guides the profound ſubmiſſion and reverence which they were accuſtomed to yield to the prieſts of that religion which they had forſaken. They deemed their perſons to be as ſacred as their function; and would have conſidered it as impious to ſubject them to the profane juriſdiction of the laity.

This was not a difficult undertaking, at the period when the clergy carried on their encroachments with the greateſt ſucceſs. That ſcanty portion of ſcience which ſerved to guide men in the ages of darkneſs, was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engroſſed by the clergy. They alone were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to read, to enquire, and to reaſon. Whatever knowledge of ancient juriſprudence had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, either by tradition, or in ſuch books as had eſcaped the deſtructive rage of barbarians, was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only by them. Upon the maxims of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſyſtem, they founded a code of laws conſonant to the great principles of equity. Being directed by fixed and known rules, the forms of their courts were aſcertained, and their deciſions became uniform and conſiſtent. Nor did they want authority ſufficient to enforce their ſentences. Excommunication and other eccleſiaſtical cenſures, were puniſhments more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than any that civil judges could inflict in ſupport of their decrees.</p>
                  <p>IT is not ſupriſing, then,<note place="margin">The good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and adopting it.</note> that eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal juriſprudence ſhould become ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of admiration and reſpect; that exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from civil juriſdiction was courted as a privilege, and conferred as a reward. It is not ſurpriſing, that even to rude people, the maxims of the canon law ſhould appear more equal and juſt than that ill-digeſted juriſprudence which directed all proceedings in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil courts.

by a baron to whom feudal juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, was irremediable, becauſe originally it was ſubject to the review of no ſuperior tribunal; the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical law eſtabliſhed a regular gradation of courts, through all which a cauſe might be carried by appeal, until it was determined by that authority which was held to be ſupreme in the church. Thus the genius and principles of the canon law prepared men for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving theſe three great alterations in the feudal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence which I have mentioned. But it was not with reſpect to theſe points alone that the canon law ſuggeſted improvements beneficial to ſociety. Many of the regulations, now deemed the barriers of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity, or the ſafe-guards of private property, are contrary to the ſpirit, and repugnant to the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the civil juriſprudence, known in Europe dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral centuries, and were borrowed from the rules and practice of the eccleſiaſtical courts. By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the wiſdom and equity of the deciſions in theſe courts, men began to perceive the neceſſity either of deſerting the martial tribunals of the barons, or of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to reform them <note n="[AA]" place="bottom">NOTE XXIV.</note>.</p>

For this reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherever they ſettled the Roman juriſprudence ſoon ſunk into oblivion, and lay buried for ſome centuries under the load of thoſe inſtitutions which the inhabitants of Europe dignified with the name of laws. But towards the middle of the twelfth century, a copy of Juſtinian's Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects was accidently diſcovered in Italy. By that time, the ſtate of ſociety was ſo far advanced, and the ideas of men ſo much enlarged and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the occurrences of ſeveral centuries,<note place="margin">Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the revival of it.</note> during which they had continued in politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union, that they were ſtruck with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of a ſyſtem which their anceſtors could not comprehend. Though they had not hitherto attained ſuch a degree of refinement, as to catch from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients a reliſh for true philoſophy, or ſpeculative ſcience; though they were ſtill inſenſible to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and elegance of claſſical compoſition; they were ſufficiently qualified to judge with reſpect to the merit of their ſyſtem of laws, in which all the points moſt intereſting to mankind, and the chief objects of their attention in every age, were ſettled with diſcernment, preciſion and equity. All men of letters ſtudied this new ſcience with eagerneſs; and within a few years after the diſcovery of the Pandects, profeſſors of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil law were appointed, who taught it publickly in moſt countries of Europe.</p>

ſome countries of Europe the Roman law was adopted as ſubſidiary to their own municipal law; and all caſes to which the latter did not extend, were decided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of the former.

They gradually relinquiſhed their places in courts of juſtice, where their ignorance expoſed them to contempt. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came weary of attending to the diſcuſſion of caſes, which grew too intricate for them to comprehend. Not only the judicial determination of points which were the ſubject of controverſy, but the conduct of all legal buſineſs and tranſactions was committed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons trained by previous ſtudy and application to the knowledge of law. An order of men to whom their fellow-citizens had daily recourſe for advice, and to whom they looked up for deciſion in their moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns, naturally acquired conſideration and influence in ſociety. They were advanced to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which had been conſidered as the peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of military virtue. They were entruſted with offices of the higheſt dignity, and moſt extenſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thus, another profeſſion than that of arms, came to be introduced among the laity, and was reputed honourable. The functions of civil life were attended to.

of Chivalry, which, though conſidered, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a wild inſtitution, the effect of caprice and the ſource of extravagance, aroſe naturally from the ſtate of ſociety at that period, and had a very ſerious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in refining the manners of the European nations. The feudal ſtate was a ſtate of perpetual war,<note place="margin">Origin of chivalry.</note> rapine, and anarchy; during which the weak and unarmed were expoſed every moment to inſults or injuries. The power of the ſovereign was too limited to prevent theſe wrongs; and the adminiſtration of juſtice too feeble to redreſs them. There was ſcarce any protection againſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppreſſion, but what the valour and genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of private perſons afforded. The ſame ſpirit of enterprize which had prompted ſo many gentlemen to take arms in defence of the oppreſſed pilgrims in Paleſtine, incited others to declare themſelves the patrons and avengers of injured innocence at home. When the final reduction of the Holy Land under the dominion of Infidels put an end to theſe foreign expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the latter was the only employment left for the activity and courage of adventurers. To check the inſolence of overgrown oppreſſors; to ſuccour the diſtreſſed; to reſcue the helpleſs from captivity; to protect, or to avenge women, orphans, and eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, who could not bear arms in their own defence; to redreſs wrongs and to remove grievances; were deemed acts of the higheſt proweſs and merit. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, humanity, courteſy, juſtice, honour, were the characteriſtic qualities of chivalry. To theſe were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded religion, which mingled itſelf with every paſſion and inſtitution during the middle ages, and by infuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large proportion of enthuſiaſtic zeal, gave them ſuch force, as carried them to romantic exceſs. Men were trained to knighthood by a long previous diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; they were admitted into the order by ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties no leſs devout than pompous, every perſon of noble birth courted that honour; it was deemed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction ſuperior to royalty; and monarchs were proud to receive it from the hands of private gentlemen.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="unknown:011837_0082_0F9D873270995090"/>THIS ſingular inſtitution,<note place="margin">Its beneficial effects.</note> in which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, gallantry, and religion, were ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blended, was wonderfully adapted to the taſte and genius of martial nobles; and its effects were ſoon viſible in their manners. War was carried on with leſs ferocity, when humanity came to be deemed the ornament of knighthood no leſs than courage. More gentle and poliſhed manners were introduced, when courteſy was recommended as the moſt amiable of knightly virtues. Violence and oppreſſion decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it was reckoned meritorious to check and to puniſh them. A ſcrupulous adherence to truth, with the moſt religious attention to fulfil every engagement, became the diſtinguiſhed characteriſtic of a gentleman, becauſe chivalry was regarded as the ſchool of honour, and inculcated the moſt delicate ſenſibility with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that point. The admiration of theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, together with the high diſtinctions and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives conferred on knighthood in every part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, inſpired perſons of noble birth on ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a ſpecies of military fanaticiſm, and led them to extravagant enterprizes. But they imprinted deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their minds the principles of generoſity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Theſe were ſtrengthened by every thing that can affect the ſenſes, or touch the heart. The wild exploits of thoſe romantic knights who ſallied forth in queſt of adventures, are well known, and have been treated with proper ridicule. The political and permanent effects of the ſpirit of chivalry have been leſs obſerved. Perhaps, the humanity which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies all the operations of war, the refinements of gallantry, and the point of honour, the three chief circumſtances which diſtinguiſh modern from ancient manners, may be aſcribed in a great meaſure to this whimſical inſtitution, ſeemingly of little benefit to mankind. The ſentiments which chivalry inſpired, had a wonderful influence on manners and conduct, during the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth centuries. They were ſo deeply rooted, that they continued to operate after the vigour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the inſtitution itſelf began to decline. Some conſiderable tranſactions, recorded in the following

Some of the moſt eminent perſonages, whoſe characters will be delineated, were ſtrongly tinctured with this romantic ſpirit. Francis I. was ambitious to diſtinguiſh himſelf by all the qualities of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed knight, and endeavoured to imitate the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing genius of chivalry in war, as well as its pomp and courteſy during peace. The fame which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by theſe ſplendid actions, ſo far dazzled his more temperate rival, that he departed on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions from his uſual prudence and moderation, and emulated Francis in deeds of proweſs, or of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note n="[DD]" place="bottom">NOTE.

At the time when their Empire was overturned, the Romans, though they had loſt that correct taſte which has rendered the productions of their anceſtors the ſtandards of excellence, and models for imitation to ſucceeding ages, ſtill preſerved their love of letters, and cultivated the arts with great ardour.<note place="margin">Ignorance of the middle ages.</note> But rude barbarians were ſo far from being ſtruck with any admiration of theſe unknown accompliſhments, that they deſpiſed them.

The convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions occaſioned by their ſettlement in the Empire; the frequent as well as violent revolutions in every kingdom which they eſtabliſhed; together with the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011837_0084_0F9D873486ED5890"/>
interior defects in the form of government which they introduced, baniſhed ſecurity and leiſure; prevented the growth of taſte, or the culture of ſcience; and kept Europe, during ſeveral centuries, in that ſtate of ignorance which has been already deſcribed. But the events and inſtitutions which I have enumerated, produced great alterations in ſociety. As ſoon as their operation, in reſtoring liberty and independence to one part of the community, began to be felt; as ſoon as they began to communicate to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety ſome taſte of the advantages ariſing from commerce, from public order, and from perſonal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, the human mind became conſcious of powers which it did not formerly perceive, and fond of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations or purſuits of which it was formerly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Towards the beginning of the twelfth century, we diſcern the firſt ſymptoms of its awakening from that lethargy in which it had long been ſunk, and obſerve it turning with curioſity and attention towards new objects.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt literary efforts, however,<note place="margin">The firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary efforts ill directed, and the cauſes of this.</note> of the European nations in the middle ages, were extremely ill-directed. Among nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as individuals, the powers of imagination attain ſome degree of vigour before the intellectual faculties are much exerciſed in ſpeculative or abſtract diſquiſition. Men are poets before they are philoſophers. They feel with ſenſibility, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with force, when they have made but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in inveſtigation or reaſoning. The age of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and of Heſiod long preceded that of Thales, or of Socrates. But, unhappily for literature, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors deviating from this courſe which nature points out, plunged at once into the depths of abſtruſe and and metaphyſical inquiry. They had been converted to the Chriſtian faith, ſoon after they ſettled in their new conqueſts. But they did not receive it pure. The preſumption of men had added to the ſimple and inſtructive doctrines of Chriſtianity, the theories of a vain philoſophy, that attempted to penerate into my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and to decide queſtions which the limited fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the human mind are unable to comprehend,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011837_0085_0F9D873532655A18"/>
or to reſolve. Theſe over-curious ſpeculations were incorporated with the ſyſtem of religion, and came to be conſidered as the moſt eſſential part of it. As ſoon, then, as curioſity prompted men to enquire and to reaſon, theſe were the ſubjects which firſt preſented themſelves, and engaged their attention. The ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic theology, with its infinite train of bold diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubtile diſtinctions concerning points which are not the object of human reaſon, was the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ſpirit of enquiry after it began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſome degree of activity and vigour in Europe. It was not this circumſtance alone that gave ſuch a wrong turn to the minds of men, when they began again to exerciſe talents which they had ſo long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. Moſt of the perſons who attempted to revive literature in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, had received inſtruction, or derived their principles of ſcience from the Greeks in the Eaſtern Empire, or from the Arabians in Spain and Africa. Both theſe people, acute and inquiſitive to exceſs, corrupted thoſe ſciences which they cultivated. The former rendered theology a ſyſtem of ſpeculative refinement, or of endleſs controverſy. The latter communicated to philoſophy a ſpirit of metaphyſical and frivolous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety. Miſled by theſe guides, the perſons who firſt applied to ſcience were involved in a maze of intricate inquiries. Inſtead of allowing their fancy to take its natural range, and to produce ſuch works of invention as might have improved their taſte, and refined their ſentiments; inſtead of cultivating thoſe arts which embelliſhed human life, and render it comfortable; they were fettered by authority, they were led aſtray by example, and waſted the whole force of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius in ſpeculations as unavailing as they were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>

                     <note place="margin">They had however conſiderable effects.</note>BUT fruitleſs and ill-directed as theſe ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were, their novelty rouzed, and their boldneſs intereſted the human mind. The ardour with which men purſued theſe unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting ſtudies, was aſtoniſhing. Genuine philoſophy was never cultivated, in any enlightened age, with greater zeal. Schools, upon the model of theſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted

by Charlemange, were opened in every cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, and almoſt in every monaſtery of note. Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and univerſities were erected, and formed into communities or corporations governed by their own laws, and inveſted with ſeparate and extenſive juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over their own members. A regular courſe of ſtudies was planned. Privileges of great value were conferred on maſters and ſcholars. Academical titles and honours of various kinds were invented, as a recompence for both. Nor was it in the ſchools alone that ſuperiority in ſcience led to reputation and authority; it became the object of reſpect in life, and advanced ſuch as acquired it to a rank of no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eminence. Allured by all theſe advantages, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible number of ſtudents reſorted to theſe new ſeats of learning, and crowded with eagerneſs into that new path which was opened to fame and diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>BUT how conſiderable ſoever theſe firſt efforts may appear,<note place="margin">A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which prevented their being more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> there was one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which prevented the effects of them from being as extenſive as they ought to have been. All the languages in Europe, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period under review, were barbarous. They were deſtitute of elegance, of force, and even of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity. No attempt had been hitherto made to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or to poliſh them. The Latin tongue was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated by the church to religion. Cuſtom with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſcarce leſs ſacred, had appropriated it to lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. All the ſciences cultivated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were taught in Latin. All books with reſpect to them were written in that language. To have treated of any important ſubject in a modern language, would have been deemed a degradation of it. This confined ſcience within a very narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The learned alone were admitted into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of knowledge; the gate was ſhut againſt all others, who were allowed to remain involved in their former darkneſs and ignorance.</p>
                  <p>BUT though ſcience was thus prevented,<note place="margin">Its influence on manners merits atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> during ſeveral ages, from diffuſing itſelf through ſociety, and its influence was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed; the progreſs of it may be mentioned,

This commerce, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was extremely limited, nor was the intercourſe conſiderable which it occaſioned between different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Cruſades, by leading multitudes from every corner of Europe into Aſia, opened a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive communication between the Eaſt and Weſt, which ſubſiſted for two centuries; and though the object of theſe expeditions was conqueſt and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; though the iſſue of them proved as unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as the motives for undertaking them were wild and enthuſiaſtic, their commercial effects, as hath been ſhewn, were both beneficial and permanent. During the continuance of the Cruſades, the great cities in Italy and in other countries of Europe acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty, and together with it ſuch privileges as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them reſpectable and independent communities. Thus, in every ſtate there was formed a new order of citizens, to whom commerce preſented itſelf as their proper object, and opened to them a certain path to wealth and dignity. Soon after the cloſe of the Holy war, the mariner's compaſs was invented, which, by rendering navigation more ſecure as well as more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous, facilitated the communication between re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote nations, and brought them nearer to each other.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Firſt among the Italians.</note>THE Italian States, during the ſame peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, eſtabliſhed a regular commerce with the Eaſt in the ports of Egypt, and drew from thence all the rich products of the Indies. They introduced into their own territories manufactures of various kinds, and carried them on with great ingenuity and vigour. They attempted new arts; and tranſplanted from warmer climates, to which they had been hitherto deemed peculiar, ſeveral natural productions which now furniſh the materials of a lucrative and extended commerce. All theſe commodities, whether import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Aſia, or produced by their own ſkill, they diſpoſed of to great advantage among the other people of Europe, who, began to acquire ſome taſte of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance unknown to their anceſtors, or deſpiſed by them. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the commerce of Europe was almoſt entirely in the hands of the Italians, more commonly known in thoſe ages by the name of Lombards. Companies or ſocieties of Lombard merchants ſettled in every different king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They were taken under the immediate protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral governments. They enjoyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive privileges and immunities. The operation of the ancient barbarous laws concerning ſtrangers was ſuſpended with reſpect to them. They became the carriers, the manufacturers, and the bankers of all Europe.</p>

As the nations around the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick were, at that time, extremely barbarous, and infeſted that ſea with their piracies, this obliged the cities of Lubeck and Hamburgh, ſoon after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open ſome trade with theſe people, to enter into a league of mutual defence. They derived ſuch advantages from this union, that other towns acceded to their confederacy, and, in a ſhort time, eighty of the moſt conſiderable cities ſcattered through thoſe vaſt countries which ſtretch from the bottom of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick to Cologne on the Rhine, joined in the famous
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011837_0090_0F9D873936792508"/>
Hanſeatick league, which became ſo formidable, that its alliance was courted, and its enmity was dreaded by the greateſt monarchs. The members of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſociation formed the firſt ſyſtematick plan of commerce known in the middle ages, and conducted it by common laws enacted in their general aſſemblies. They ſupplied the reſt of Europe with naval ſtores, and pitched on different towns, the moſt eminent of which was Bruges in Flanders, where they eſtabliſhed ſtaples in which their commerce was regularly carried on. Thither the Lombards brought the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of India, together with the manufactures of Italy, and exchanged them for the more bulky, but not leſs uſeful commodities of the North. The Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeatick merchants diſpoſed of the cargoes which they received from the Lombards, in the ports of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or carried them up the great rivers into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of Germany.</p>
                  <p>THIS regular intercourſe opened between the North and South of Europe,<note place="margin">Commerce makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Netherlands.</note> made them ſenſible of their mutual wants, and created ſuch new and vaſt demands for commodities of every kind, that it excited among the inhabitants of the Netherlands a more vigorous ſpirit in carrying on the two great manufactures of wool and flax, which ſeem to have been conſiderable in that country as far back as the age of Charlemagne. As Bruges became the centre of communication between the Lombard and Hanſeatick merchants, the Flemings traded with both in that city to ſuch extent as well as advantage, as ſpread among them a general habit of induſtry, which long rendered Flanders and the adjacent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the moſt opulent, the moſt populous, and beſt cultivated countries in Europe.</p>
                  <p>STRUCK with the flouriſhing ſtate of theſe provinces,<note place="margin">And in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</note> of which he diſcerned the true cauſe, Edward III. of England endeavoured to excite a ſpirit of induſtry among his own ſubjects, who, blind to the advantages of their ſituation, and ignorant of the ſource from which opulence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to ſlow into their country, totally neglected commerce, and did not even attempt thoſe manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

By alluring Flemiſh artiſans to ſettle in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, as well as by many wiſe laws for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and regulation of trade, he gave a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the woolen manufactures of England, and firſt turned the active and enterprizing genius of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards thoſe arts which have raiſed the Engliſh to the higheſt rank among commercial nations.</p>

It did not fail of producing great effects. Commerce tends to wear off thoſe prejudices which maintain diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and animoſity between nations.

When we ſurvey the ſtate of ſociety, or the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of individuals, at the opening of the fifteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and then turn back to view the condition of both at the time when the barbarous tribes which overturned the Roman power compleated their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their new conqueſts, the progreſs which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had made towards order and refinement will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear immenſe.</p>

and exert their utmoſt force. They are excited to act not by the diſtant objects, and ſubtile ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which intereſt or affect men in poliſhed ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but by their preſent feelings. The inſults of an enemy kindle reſentment; the ſucceſs of a rival tribe awakens emulation; theſe paſſions communicate from breaſt to breaſt, and all the members of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with united ardour, ruſh into the field in order to gratify their revenge, or to acquire diſtinction. But in widely extended ſtates, ſuch as the great kingdoms of Europe at the beginning of the fifteenth century, where there is little intercourſe between the diſtant members of the community, and where every great enterprize requires previous concert and long prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nothing can rouſe and call forth their united ſtrength, but the abſolute command of a Deſpot, or the powerful influence of regular policy. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the vaſt Empires in the Eaſt are an example; the irreſiſtable mandate of the Sovereign reaches the moſt remote provinces of his dominions, and compels what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever number of his ſubjects he is pleaſed to ſummon, to follow his ſtandard. The kingdoms of Europe, in the preſent age, are an inſtance of the latter; the Prince, by the leſs violent, but no leſs effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of laws and a well regulated government, is enabled to avail himſelf of the whole force of his ſtate, and to employ it in enterprizes which require ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and perſevering efforts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The power of Monarchs very limited</note>BUT, at the opening of the fifteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the political conſtitution in all the kingdoms of Europe was very different from either of theſe ſtates of government. The ſeveral monarchs, though they had ſomewhat enlarged the boundaries of prerogative by ſucceſsful encroachments on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and privileges of the nobility, were poſſeſſed of an authority extremely limited. The laws and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior police of kingdoms, though much improved by the various events and regulations which I have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated were ſtill feeble and imperfect. In every country, a numerous body of nobles, ſtill formidable notwithſtanding the various expedients employed to depreſs them, watched all the motions of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign with a jealous attention, which ſet bounds to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011837_0094_0F9D873CDBCFB488"/>
his ambition, and either prevented his forming ſchemes of extenſive enterprize, or thwarted the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them.</p>
                  <p>THE ordinary revenues of every Prince were ſo extremely ſmall as to be inadequate to any great undertaking.<note place="margin">Their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſmall.</note> He depended for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſupplies on the good will of his ſubjects, who granted them often with a reluctant and always with a ſparing hand.</p>
                  <p>AS the revenues of Princes were inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,<note place="margin">Their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unfit for conqueſt.</note> the armies which they could bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field were unfit for long and effectual ſervice. Inſtead of being able to employ troops trained to ſkill in arms, and to military ſubordination, by regular diſcipline, Monarchs were obliged to depend on ſuch forces as their vaſſals conducted to their ſtandard in conſequence of their military tenure. Theſe, as they were bound to remain under arms only for a ſhort time, could not march far from their uſual place of reſidence, and being more attached to the lord of whom they held, than to the Sovereign whom they ſerved, were often as much diſpoſed to counteract as to forward his ſchemes. Nor were they, even if they had been more ſubject to the command of the monarch, proper inſtruments to carry into execution any great and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous enterprize. The ſtrength of an army formed either for conqueſt or defence lies in infantry. To the ſtability and diſcipline of their legions, conſiſting chiefly of infantry, the Romans during the times of the republick were indebted for all their victories; and when their deſcendants, forgetting the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had led them to univerſal dominion, ſo far altered their military ſyſtem as to place their principal confidence in a numerous cavalry, the undiſciplined impetuoſity of the barbarous nations who fought moſtly on foot, was ſufficient, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to overcome them. Theſe nations ſoon after they ſettled in their new conqueſts, uninſtructed by the fatal error of the Romans, relinquiſhed the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their anceſtors and converted the chief force of their armies into cavalry. Among the Romans this change was occaſioned by the effeminacy of their troops, who could not endure the fatigues of ſervice,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011837_0095_0F9D873D8D67F9F0"/>
which their more virtuous and hardy anceſtors ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eaſe. Among the people who eſtabliſhed the new monarchies into which Europe was divided, this innovation in military diſcipline ſeems to have flowed from the pride of the nobles, who ſcorning to mingle with perſons of inferior rank, aimed at being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them in the field, as well as during peace. The inſtitution of chivalry, and the frequency of Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, in which knights, in complete armour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the liſts on horſeback with extraordinary ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, diſplaying amazing addreſs, and force, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, brought cavalry into ſtill greater eſteem. The fondneſs for that ſervice increaſed to ſuch a degree, that, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the armies of Europe were compoſed almoſt entirely of cavalry. No gentleman would appear in the field but on horſeback. To ſerve in any other manner he would have deemed derogatory to his rank. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, by way of diſtinction, was called <hi>The battle,</hi> and on it alone depended the fate of every action. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, collected from the dregs and refuſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ill armed and worſe diſciplined, was of no account.</p>
                  <p>AS theſe circumſtances rendered the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of particular kingdoms leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and leſs vigorous,<note place="margin">They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of forming any general or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive plan of operation.</note> ſo they long kept the Princes of Europe from giving ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſchemes and tranſactions of their neighbours, as led them to form any regular ſyſtem of public ſecurity. They prevented them from uniting in confederacy, or from acting with concert, in order to eſtabliſh ſuch a diſtribution and balance of power, as ſhould hinder any ſtate from riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſuperiority, which might endanger the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty and independance. During ſeveral centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the nations of Europe appear to have conſidered themſelves as ſeparate ſocieties, ſcarce connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by any common intereſt, and little concerned in each others affairs or operations. An extenſive commerce did not afford them an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and penetrating into the ſchemes of every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtate. They had not ambaſſadors reſiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in every court to watch and give early intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all its motions. The expectation of remote
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011837_0096_0F9D873E31A532B0"/>
advantages, or the proſpect of diſtant and contingent evils were not ſufficient to excite nations to take arms. They only, who were within the ſphere of immediate danger, and unavoidably expoſed to injury or inſult, thought themſelves intereſted in any conteſt, or bound to take precautions for their own ſafety.</p>
                  <p>WHOEVER records the tranſactions of any of the more conſiderable European ſtates dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two laſt centuries,<note place="margin">They were little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with each other.</note> muſt write the hiſtory of Europe. Its various kingdoms, throughout that period, have been formed into one great ſyſtem, ſo cloſely united, that each holding a determinate ſtation, the operations of one are ſo felt by all, as to influence their councils and regulate their meaſures. But previous to the fifteenth century, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when vicinity of territory rendered the occaſions of diſcord frequent and unavoidable, or when national emulation fomented or embittered the ſpirit of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the affairs of different countries are ſeldom inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven. In each kingdom of Europe great events and revolutions happened, which the other powers beheld with the ſame indifference as if they had been uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted ſpectators, to whom the effect of theſe tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could never extend.</p>

The Dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, whom their ſituation would not permit to remain neutral, engaged, it is true, in the conteſt; but they more frequently took the part to which their paſſions prompted them, than that which a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the danger which threatned themſelves and the tranquillity of Europe ſhould have pointed out. The other Princes, ſeemingly unaffected by the alternate ſucceſſes of the contending parties, left them to decide the quarrel, or interpoſed only by feeble and ineffectual negociations.</p>

They permitted a power to ariſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly, and to acquire ſtrength there, which ſoon became formidable to all its neighbours.</p>
                  <p>AMIDST the violent convulſions with which the ſpirit of domination in the See of Rome,<note place="margin">From thoſe of Germany.</note> and the turbulent ambition of the German nobles, agitated the Empire, neither the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Popes, ſeconded by all their artifices and intrigues, nor the ſolicitations of the Emperors, could induce any of the powerful monarchs in Europe, to engage in their quarrel, or to avail themſevles of many favourable opportunities of interpoſing with effect and advantage.</p>
                  <p>THIS amazing inactivity, during tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions ſo intereſting,<note place="margin">This inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſtate of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> is not to be imputed to any incapacity of diſcerning their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conſequences. The power of judging with ſagacity, and of acting with vigour, is the portion of men in every age. The Monarchs who reigned in the different kingdoms of Europe during ſeveral centuries were not blind to their particular intereſt, negligent of the public ſafety, of ſtrangers to the method of ſecuring both. If they did not adopt that ſalutary ſyſtem, which teaches mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern politicians to take the alarm at the proſpect of diſtant dangers, which prompts them to check the firſt encroachments of any formidable power, and which renders each ſtate the guardian, in ſome degree, of the rights and independance of all its neghbours, this was owing entirely to the imperfections and diſorders in the civil government of each country, which made it impoſſible for ſovereigns to act ſuitably to thoſe ideas which the poſture of affairs, and their own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation muſt have ſuggeſted.</p>

                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:011837_0098_0F9D873FB9D5BD88"/>BUT during the courſe of the fifteenth century, various events happened,<note place="margin">Events hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during the 15th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury which rendered the efforts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more powerful and extenſive.</note> which by giving Princes more entire command of the force in their reſpective dominions, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their operations more vigorous and extenſive. In conſequence of this, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of different kingdoms becoming more frequently as well as more intimately connected, they were gradually accuſtomed to act in concert and confederacy, and were inſenſibly prepared for forming a ſyſtem of policy, in order to eſtabliſh or to preſerve ſuch a balance of power as was moſt conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the general ſecurity. It was during the reign of Charles the fifth, that the ideas, on which this ſyſtem is founded, firſt came to be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. It was then, that the maxims by which it has been uniformly maintained ſince that aera were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally adopted. On this account, a view of the cauſes and events which contributed to eſtabliſh a plan of policy more ſalutary and extenſive than any that has taken place in the conduct of human affairs, is not only a neceſſary introduction to the following work, but is a capital object in the hiſtory of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt event,<note place="margin">The firſt of theſe was the depriving the Engliſh of their territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the continent.</note> that occaſioned any conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable alteration in the arrangement of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Europe, was the annexation of the extenſive territories, which England poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the continent, to the crown of France. While the Engliſh were maſters of ſeveral of the moſt fertile and opulent provinces in France, and a great part of its moſt martial inhabitants were bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſtandard, their monarchs conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rather as the rivals, than as the vaſſals of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of whom they held. The Kings of France, circumſcribed and thwarted in their ſchemes and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by an adverſary no leſs jealous than formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, durſt not venture upon any enterprize of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or of difficulty. The Engliſh were always at hand, ready to oppoſe them. They diſputed even their right to their crown, and being able to penetrate, with eaſe, into the heart of the kingdom, could arm againſt them thoſe very hands which ought to have
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011837_0099_0F9D87412D51C2C8"/>
been employed in their defence. Timid counſels, and feeble efforts were natural to monarchs in ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. France, diſmembered and over-awed, could not attain its proper ſtation in the ſyſtem of Europe. But the death of Henry of England, happily for France, and not unfortunately for his own country, delivered the French from the calamity of having a foreign maſter ſeated on their throne. The weakneſs of along minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the diſſenſions in the Engliſh court, together with the unſteady and languid conduct which theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, afforded the French a favourable opportunity of recovering the territories which they had loſt. The native valour of the nobility of France heightened to an enthuſiaſtick confidence, by a ſuppoſed interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven in their behalf; conducted in the field by ſkilful leaders; and directed in the cabinet by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent monarch; was exerted with ſuch vigour and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, during this favourable juncture, as not only wreſted from the Engliſh their new conqueſts, but ſtript them of their ancient poſſeſſions, and reduced them within the narow precincts of Calais, and its petty territory.</p>

In order to obtain ſuch permanent and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective force, as became requiſite during theſe length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened conteſts, the Kings of France took into their pay conſiderable bands of mercenary ſoldiers, levied ſometimes among their own ſubjects, and ſometimes in foreign countries. But as the feudal policy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no ſufficient fund for ſuch extraordinary ſervice, theſe adventurers were diſmiſſed at the cloſe of every campaign, or upon any proſpect of accommodation; and having been little accuſtomed to reſtraints of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, they frequently turned their arms againſt the country which they had been hired to defend, and deſolated it with no leſs cruelty than its foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

Theſe were his only confidents, whom he conſulted in forming his plans, and to whom he committed the execution of them: While the nobles, accuſtomed to be the companions, the favourites, and the miniſters of their ſovereigns, were treated with ſuch ſtudied and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying neglect, that if they would not ſubmit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a court, in which they appeared without any ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of their ancient power, they were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their caſtles, where they remained unemployed and forgotten. Not ſatisfied with having rendered the nobles of leſs conſideration, by taking out of their hands the ſole direction of affairs, Louis added inſult to neglect; and by violating their moſt valuable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, endeavoured to degrade the order, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the members of it to the ſame level with other ſubjects. Perſons of the higheſt rank among them, if ſo bold as to oppoſe his ſchemes, or ſo unfortunate as to awaken the jealouſy of his capricious temper, were proſecuted with rigour, from which all who belonged to the order of nobles had hitherto been exempt; they were tried by judges who had no right to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of their actions; and were ſubjected to torture, or condemned to an infamous death, without regard to their birth or condition.

of any reaſonable propoſition he ſhould make, with reſpect to the diſpoſal of a Princeſs, who was the vaſſal of his crown, and deſcended from the royal blood of France. There were only two propoſitions, however, which he could make with propriety. The one was the marriage of the Dauphin, the other that of the Count of Angouleme, a Prince of the blood, with the heireſs of Burgundy. By the former, he would have annexed all her territories to his crown, and have rendered France at once the moſt reſpectable monarchy in Europe. But the great diſparity of age between the two parties, Mary being twenty, and the Dauphin only eight years old; the avowed reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Flemings, not to chooſe a maſter poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſuch power as might enable him to form ſchemes dangerous to their liberties; together with their dread of falling under the odious and oppreſſive government of Louis, were obſtacles in the way of executing this plan, which it was vain to think of ſurmounting.

But Louis had been accuſtomed ſo long to the intricacies of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſidious policy, that he could not be ſatisfied with what was obvious and ſimple; and was ſo fond of artifice and refinement, that he came to conſider theſe as his ultimate object, not as the means only of conducting affairs. From this principle, no leſs than from his unwillingneſs to aggrandize any of his own ſubjects, or from his deſire of oppreſſing the houſe of Burgundy, which he hated, he neglected the courſe which a Prince leſs able and artful would have taken, and followed one more ſuited to his own genius.</p>

By this acquiſition, the foundation of the future grandeur of Charles V. was laid; and he became maſter of thoſe territories, which enabled him to carry on his moſt formidable and deciſive ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt France. Thus, too, the ſame monarch who firſt united the interior force of France, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it on ſuch a footing as to render it formidable to the reſt of Europe, contributed, far contrary to his intention, to raiſe up a rival power, which, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two centuries, has thwarted the meaſures, oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arms, and checked the progreſs of his ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>THE next event of conſequence in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century,<note place="margin">The next conſiderable event was the invaſion of Italy by Charles VIII A.

This occaſioned revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons no leſs memorable; produced alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, were more immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, both in the military and political ſyſtem; rouſed the ſtates of Europe to bolder efforts; and blended their affairs and intereſts more cloſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The mild adminiſtration of Charles, a weak but generous Prince ſeems to have revived the ſpirit and genius of the French nation,<note place="margin">The motives of this.</note> which the rigid deſpotiſm of his father had depreſſed, and almoſt extinguiſhed. The ardour for military ſervice, natural to the French nobility, returned, and their young monarch was impatient to diſtinguiſh his reign by ſome ſplendid enterprize. While he was uncertain towards what quarter he ſhould turn his arms, the ſolicitations and intrigues of an Italian politician, no leſs infamous on account of his crimes, than eminent for his abilities, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his choice. Ludovico Sforza, having formed the deſign of depoſing his nephew the duke of Milan, and of placing himſelf on the ducal throne, was ſo much afraid of a combination of the Italian powers to thwart this meaſure, and to ſupport the injured Prince, with whom moſt of them were connected by blood or alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011837_0113_0F9D874BC02E47A8"/>
that he ſaw the neceſſity of ſecuring the aid of ſome able protector. The King of France was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom he applied; and without diſcloſing to him his own intentions, he laboured to prevail with him to march into Italy, at the head of a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in order to ſeize the crown of Naples, to which he had pretenſions as heir of the houſe of Anjou. The right to that kingdom, claimed by the Angevian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, had been conveyed to Louis XI. by Charles of Anjou, count of Maine and Provence. But that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious monarch, though he took immediate poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe territories of which Charles was really maſter, totally diſregarded his ideal title to a kingdom, over which another Prince reigned in tranquillity; and uniformly declined involving himſelf in the laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Italian politicks. His ſon more adventurous, or more inconſiderate, embarked eagerly in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; and contemning all the remonſtrances of his moſt experienced counſellors, prepared to carry it on with the utmoſt vigour.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES wanted not power equal to ſuch a great undertaking.<note place="margin">His reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for this enterprize.</note> His father had tranſmitted to him ſuch an ample preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as gave him the entire command of his kingdom. He himſelf had added conſiderably to the extent of his dominions, by his prudent marriage with the heireſs of Bretagne, which rendered him maſter of that province, the laſt of the great fiefs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be annexed to the crown. He ſoon aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled forces which he thought ſufficient; and ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was he to enter on his career as a conqueror, that ſacrificing what was real, for what was chimerical, he reſtored Rouſillon to Ferdinand, and gave up part of his father's acquiſitions in Artois to Maximilian, with a view of inducing theſe Princes not to moleſt France, while he was carrying on his operations in Italy.</p>
                  <p>BUT ſo different were the efforts of the States of Europe in the fifteenth century,<note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it.</note> from thoſe which we ſhall behold in the courſe of this hiſtory, that the army, with which Charles undertook this great enterprize, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed twenty thouſand men. The train of artillery,

however, the ammunition, and warlike ſtores of every kind provided for its uſe, were ſo great as to bear ſome reſemblance to the immenſe apparatus of modern war <note n="h" place="bottom">Mezeray Hiſt. tom. ii. 777.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the French entered Italy,<note place="margin">Its ſucceſs.</note> they met with nothing able to reſiſt them. The Italian powers having remained, during a long period, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by the invaſion of any foreign enemy, had formed a ſyſtem with reſpect to their affairs, both in peace and war, peculiar to themſelves. In order to adjuſt the intereſts, and balance the power of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates into which Italy was divided, they were engaged in perpetual and endleſs negociations with each other, which they conducted with all the ſubtlety of a refining and deceitful policy. Their conteſts in the field, when they had recourſe to arms, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided in mock battles, by innocent and bloodleſs victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Upon the firſt appearance of the danger which now impended, they had recourſe to the arts which they had ſtudied, and employed their utmoſt ſkill in intrigue in order to avert it. But this proving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, their effeminate mercenaries, the only mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force that remained in the country, being fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the parade of ſervice, were terrified at the aſpect of real war, and ſhrunk at its approach. The impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſity of the French valour appeared to them irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Florence, Piſa, and Rome opened their gates as the French army advanced. The proſpect of this dreadful invaſion ſtruck one King of Naples with ſuch panic terror, that he died, (if we may believe hiſtorians) of the fright. Another abdicated his throne from the ſame puſillanimous ſpirit. A third fled out of his dominions, as ſoon as the enemy appeared on the Neapolitan frontiers. Charles after marching thither from the bottom of the Alps, with as much rapidity, and almoſt as little oppoſition, as if he had been on a progreſs through his own dominions, took quiet poſſeſſion of the throne of Naples, and intimida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or gave law to every power in Italy.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Its effects, particularly in giving riſe to the ſyſtem concerning a balance of power.</note>SUCH was the concluſion of this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which muſt be conſidered as the firſt great exertion of thoſe new powers which the Princes of Europe had acquired, and now began to exerciſe. Its effects were no leſs conſiderable than its ſucceſs had been aſtoniſhing. The Italians, unable to reſiſt the impreſſion of the enemy which broke in upon them, permitted him to hold on his courſe undiſturbed. They quickly perceived that no ſingle power, which they could rouſe to action, was an equal match for a monarch, who ruled over ſuch extenſive territories, and was at the head of ſuch a martial people; but that a confederacy might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what the ſeparate members of it durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. To this expedient, the only one that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver or to preſerve them from the yoke, they had recourſe. While Charles inconſiderately waſted his time at Naples, in feſtivals and triumphs on account of his paſt ſucceſſes, or was fondly dreaming of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conqueſts in the Eaſt, to the empire of which he now aſpired, they formed againſt him a powerful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of almoſt all the Italian ſtates, ſupported by the Emperor Maximilian, and Ferdinand King of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. The union of ſo many powers, who ſuſpended or forgot all their particular animoſities, that they might act with concert againſt an enemy who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formidable to them all, awakened Charles from his thoughtleſs ſecurity. He ſaw now no proſpect of ſafety but in returning to France. An army of thirty thouſand men, aſſembled by the allies, was ready to obſtruct his march; and though the French, with a daring courage, which more than counterbalanced their inferiority in number, broke through that great body, and gained a victory, which opened to their monarch a ſafe paſſage into his own territories, he was ſtripped of all his conqueſts in Italy in as ſhort a time as it had coſt him to acquire them; and the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſyſtem in that country reſumed the ſame appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as before his invaſion.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011837_0116_0F9D874DF9E6D488"/>
and alarmed them. They had now extended to the affairs of Europe, the maxims of that political ſcience which had hitherto been applied only to regulate the operations of the petty ſtates in their own country. They had diſcovered the method of preventing any monarch from riſing to ſuch a degree of power, as was inconſiſtent with the general liberty; and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the importance of attending to that great ſecret in modern policy, the preſervation of a proper diſtribution of power among all the members of the ſyſtem into which the ſtates of Europe are formed. During all the wars of which Italy now became the theatre, and amidſt the hoſtile operations which the imprudence of Louis XII. and the ambition of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand of Aragon, carried on in that country, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle interruption, from the cloſe of the fifteenth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to that period at which the ſubſequent hiſtory commences, the maintaining a proper balance of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er between the contending parties became the great object of attention to the ſtateſmen of Italy. Nor was the idea confined to them. Self-preſervation taught other powers to adopt it. It grew to be faſhionable and univerſal. From this aera we can trace the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of that intercourſe between nations, which has linked the powers of Europe ſo cloſely together; and can diſcern the operations of that provident policy, which during peace, guards againſt remote and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent dangers; which, in war, hath prevented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and deſtructive conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>THIS was not the only effect of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the great powers of Europe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in Italy.<note place="margin">The wars in Italy render ſtanding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies general.</note> They contributed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a change, as the French had begun to make in the ſtate of their troops, general; and obliged all the Princes, who appeared on this new theatre of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to eſtabliſh the military force of their kingdoms on the ſame footing with that of France. When the ſeat of war came to be remote from the countries which maintained the conteſt, the ſervice of the feudal vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals ceaſed to be of any uſe; and the neceſſity of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying troops regularly trained to arms, and kept in conſtant pay, came at once to be evident.

To theſe Louis XII. added a body of Germans, well known in the wars of Italy by the Black Bands. But neither of theſe monarchs made any account of the feudal militia, or ever had recourſe to that military force which they might have commanded, in virtue of the ancient inſtitutions in their kingdom. Maximilian and Ferdinand, as ſoon as they began to act in Italy, employed the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and truſted the execution of their plans entirely to mercenary troops.</p>

During their long and violent ſtruggles in defence of their liberties againſt the houſe of Auſtria, whoſe armies like thoſe of other conſiderable Princes, conſiſted chiefly of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy armed cavalry, the Swiſs found that their poverty, and the ſmall number of gentlemen reſiding in their country, at that time barren and uncultivated, put it out of their power to bring into the field any body of horſe capable of facing the enemy.

ſimilar either in ancient or modern times. In Venice and Florence, a republican form of government was eſtabliſhed. Milan was ſubject to ſovereigns, who had aſſumed no higher title than that of Dukes.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope was the firſt of theſe powers in dignity,<note place="margin">The papal dignity the higheſt in Europe.</note> and not the leaſt conſiderable by the extent of his territories. In the primitive church, the juriſdiction of Biſhops was equal and co-ordinate. They derived, perhaps, ſome degree of conſideration from the dignity of the See in which they preſided. They poſſeſſed, however, no real au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or pre eminence, but what they acquired by ſuperior abilities, or ſuperior ſanctity. As Rome had ſo long been the ſeat of empire, and capital of the world, its biſhops were upon that account entitled to reſpect; they received it; but during ſeveral ages they claimed and received nothing more. From theſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beginnings, they advanced with ſuch an adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and well-directed ambition, that they eſtabliſhed a ſpiritual dominion over the minds and ſentiments of men, to which all Europe ſubmitted with implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Their claim of univerſal juriſdiction,<note place="margin">Origin and progreſs of the Papal power.</note> as heads of the church, and their pretentions to infallibility in their deciſions, as ſucceſſors of St. Peter, are as chimerical, as they are repugnant to the genius of the Chriſtian religion. But on theſe foundations, the ſuperſtition and credulity of mankind enabled them to erect an amazing ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In all eccleſiaſtical controverſies, their deciſions were received as the infallible oracles of truth. Nor was the plenitude of their power confined to theſe alone; they dethroned monarchs; diſpoſed of crowns; abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubjects from the obedience due to their ſovereigns; and laid kingdoms under interdicts. There was not a ſtate in Europe which had not been diſquieted by their ambition. There was not a throne which they had not ſhaken; nor a Prince, who did not tremble at their power.</p>

                  <p>ENCROACHMENTS were made upon the Papal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only by the uſurpations of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nobility,<note place="margin">and by the turbalence of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people, from A.

The inhabitants of Rome, accuſtomed to conſider themſelves as the deſcendants of the people who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the world, and had given laws to it, were too high-ſpirited to ſubmit with patience to the delegated authority of thoſe perſons, to whom the Popes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the government of the city. On many occaſions they oppoſed the execution of the Papal mandates, and on the ſlighteſt appearance of innovation or oppreſſion, they were ready to take arms in defence of their own immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. Towards the middle of the fourteenth century, being inſtigated by Nicolas Rienzo, a man of low birth and ſeditious ſpirit, but of popular eloquence, and an enterprizing ambition, they drove all the nobility out of the city, eſtabliſhed a democratical form of government, elected Rienzo Tribune of the people, and inveſted him with extenſive authority. But though the frantic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the tribune ſoon overturned this new ſyſtem; though the government of Rome was reinſtated in its antient form; yet every freſh attack contributed to weaken the papal juriſdiction; and the turbulence of the people concurred with the ſpirit of independance among the nobility, to circumſcribe it within very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds <note n="c" place="bottom">Hiſtorie Fiorentine de Giov.

Gregory VII. and other domineering Pontiffs, accompliſhed thoſe great things which rendered them ſo formidable to the Emperors, with whom they contended, not by the force of their arms, or by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their power, but by the dread of their ſpiritual cenſures, and by the effect of their intrigues, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited rivals, and called forth enemies againſt every prince whom they wiſhed to depreſs or to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>MANY attempts were made by the Popes, not only to humble theſe uſurpers,<note place="margin">Alexander VI. and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius II. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Princes.</note> who lorded it over the cities in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, but to break the turbulent ſpirit of the Roman people. Theſe were long unſucceſsful. At laſt Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander VI. with a policy no leſs artful than fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious, ſubdued and extirpated moſt of them, and rendered the Popes maſters of their own dominions. The enterprizing ambition of Julius II. added con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of no inconſiderable value to the patrimony of St. Peter. Thus the Popes, by degrees, became pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful temporal princes. Their territories, in the age of Charles V. were of greater extent than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011837_0130_0F9D8759331141E8"/>
their country was better cultivated, and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous; and as they drew large contributions from every part of Europe, their revenues far exceeded thoſe of the neighbouring powers, and rendered them capable of more ſudden and vigorous efforts.</p>
                  <p>THE genius of the Papal government, however, was better adapted to the exerciſe of ſpiritual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,<note place="margin">Defects in the nature of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</note> than of temporal power. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the former, all its maxims were ſteady and invariable. Every new Pontiff adopted the plan of his predeceſſor. By education and habit eccleſiaſtics were ſo formed, that the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the individual was ſunk in that of the profeſſion; and the paſſions of the man were ſacrificed to the intereſt and honour of the order. The hands which held the reins of adminiſtration might change; but the ſpirit which conducted them was always the ſame. While the meaſures of other governments fluctuated, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at which they aimed varied, the church kept one end in view; and to this unrelaxing conſtancy of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, it was indebted for its ſucceſs in the boldeſt attempts ever made by human ambition.</p>
                  <p>BUT in their civil adminiſtration, the Popes followed no ſuch uniform or conſiſtent plan. There<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in other governments, the character, the paſſions, and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the perſon who had the ſupreme direction of affairs, occaſioned a variation both in objects and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. As few prelates reached the ſummit of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical dignity, until they were far advanced in life, a change of maſters was more frequent in the Papal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions than in other ſtates; and the political ſyſtem was, of courſe, leſs ſtable and permanent. Every Pope was eager to make the moſt of the ſhort period, during which he had the proſpect of enjoying power, in order to aggrandize his family, and to attain his private ends; and it was often the firſt buſineſs of his ſucceſſor to undo all that he had done, and to overturn what he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
                  <p>AS eccleſiaſtics were trained to pacific arts, and early initiated in the myſteries of that policy, by which the court of Rome extended or ſupported its ſpiritual do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, the Popes were apt to conduct their temporal
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011837_0131_0F9D8759F23729E0"/>
affairs with the ſame ſpirit; and in all their meaſures were more ready to employ the refinements of intrigue, than the force of arms. It was in the Papal court that addreſs and ſubtilty in negotiation firſt became a ſcience; and, during the ſixteenth century, Rome was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ſchool in which it could be beſt acquired.</p>
                  <p>AS the decorum of their eccleſiaſtical character pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Popes from placing themſelves at the head of their armies, or taking the command, in perſon, of the military force in their dominions, they were afraid to arm their ſubjects; and in all their operations, whether offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or defenſive, they truſted intirely to mercenary troops.</p>
                  <p>AS their power and dominions could not deſcend to their poſterity, the Popes were leſs ſolicitous than other princes to form or to encourage ſchemes of public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and improvement. Their tenure was only for a ſhort life; preſent advantage was all that they attended to; to ſqueeze and to amaſs, not to meliorate, was their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They erected, perhaps, ſome work of oſtentation, to remain as a monument of their pontificate; they found it neceſſary, at ſome times, to eſtabliſh uſeful inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in order to ſooth and ſilence the turbulent popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Rome; but plans of general benefit to their ſubjects, and framed with a view to futurity, were rarely objects of attention in the papal policy. The patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of St. Peter was worſe governed than any part of Europe; and though a generous Pontiff might ſuſpend for a little, or counter-act the effects of thoſe vices which are peculiar to the adminiſtration of eccleſiaſtics; the diſeaſe not only remained incurable, but has even gone on increaſing from age to age; and the decline of the ſtate has kept pace with its progreſs.</p>
                  <p>ONE circumſtance farther, concerning the Papal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is ſo ſingular, as to merit atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The Popes derive ſome advantages from the union of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal authority.</note> As the ſpiritual ſupremacy and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power were united in one perſon, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly aided each other in their operations, they became ſo blended together, that it was difficult to ſeparate them, even in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The potentates, who found it neceſſary to oppoſe the meaſures which the Popes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued as temporal princes, could not diveſt themſelves of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:011837_0132_0F9D875AB03BE680"/>
the reverence which they imagined to be due to them as heads of the church, and vicars of Jeſus Chriſt. It was with reluctance that they could be brought to a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with them; they were averſe to puſh their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt them to extremity; they liſtened eagerly to the firſt overtures of accommodation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and were willing to procure it almoſt upon any terms. Their conſciouſneſs of this encouraged the enterprizing pontiffs, who filled the Papal throne about the beginning of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, to engage in ſchemes ſeemingly the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. They truſted, that if their temporal power was not ſufficient to carry them through with ſucceſs, the reſpect paid to their ſpiritual dignity would enable them to extricate themſelves with facility and with honour <note n="d" place="bottom">The manner in which Louis XII of France undertook and carried on war againſt Julius II. remarkably illuſtrates this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

Though his clergy authorized the war, yet Anne of Bretagne, his queen, entertained ſcruples with regard to the lawfulneſs of it.

If we view the Venetian government as calculated for the order of nobles alone, its inſtitutions are ſo excellent, the deliberative, legiſlative and executive powers are ſo admirably diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted and adjuſted, that it muſt be regarded as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect model of political wiſdom. But if we conſider it as formed for a numerous body of people ſubject to its juriſdiction, it will appear a rigid and partial ariſtocracy, which lodges all power in the hands of a few members of the community, while it degrades and oppreſſes the reſt.</p>
                  <p>THE ſpirit of government, in a commonwealth of this ſpecies, was, of courſe, timid and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.<note place="margin">Defects in its govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with reſpect to its mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> The Venetian nobles diſtruſted their own ſubjects, and were afraid of allowing them the uſe of arms. They encouraged among them the arts of induſtry and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; they employed them in manufactures and in navigation; but never admitted them into the troops which the ſtate kept in its pay. The military force of the republic conſiſted intirely of foreign mercenaries. The command of theſe was never truſted to noble Venetians, leſt they ſhould acquire ſuch influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the army, as might endanger the public li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; or become accuſtomed to the exerciſe of ſuch power, as would make them unwilling to return to the condition of private citizens. A ſoldier of fortune was placed at the head of the armies of the commonwealth; and to obtain that honour, was the great object of the Italian Condottieri, or leaders of bands, who, in the fifteenth and ſixteenth centuries, made a trade of war, and raiſed and hired out ſoldiers to different ſtates. But the ſame ſuſpicious policy, which induced them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe adventurers, prevented their placing intire confidence in them. Two noblemen, appointed by the ſenate, accompanied their army when it took the field, with the appellation of Proveditori, and, like the field-deputies of the Dutch republic in later times, obſerved

                  <p>IT is not, however, by its military, but by its naval and commercial power,<note place="margin">Excellence of its naval inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that the importance of the Venetian commonwealth muſt be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated. In the latter, the real force and nerves of the ſtate conſiſted. The jealouſy of government did not extend to this department. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was apprehended from this quarter that could prove formidable to liberty.

                  <p>THE conſtitution of Florence was perfectly the reverſe of that of Venice.<note place="margin">The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Florence.</note> It partook as much of the democratical turbulence and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the other of ariſtocratical rigour. Florence, however, was a commercial, not a military democracy. The nature of its inſtitutions were favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to commerce, and the genius of the people was turned towards it. The vaſt wealth which the family of Medici had acquired by trade; added to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, the generoſity, and the virtue of the firſt Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, gave him ſuch an aſcendant over the affections, as well as the councils of his countrymen, that though the forms of popular government were preſerved, though the various departments of adminiſtration were filled by magiſtrates diſtinguiſhed by the ancient names, and elected in the uſual manner, he was in reality the head of the commonwealth, and in the ſtation of a private citizen he poſſeſſed ſupreme authority. Coſmo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a conſiderable degree of this power to his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; and during the greater part of the fifteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the political ſtate of Florence was extremely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. The appearance of republican government ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, the people were paſſionately attached to it, and on ſome occaſions contended warmly for their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and yet they permitted a ſingle family to aſſume a direction of their affairs, almoſt as abſolute as if it had been formally inveſted with ſovereign power.

of the Florentines, in putting the military force of the republic upon the ſame footing with that of the other Italian ſtates.

                  <p>IN the kingdom of Naples, to which the ſovereignty of the iſland of Sicily was annexed,<note place="margin">The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples.</note> the feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal government was eſtabliſhed in the ſame form, and with the ſame defects, as in the other nations of Europe. The frequent and violent revolutions which happened in that monarchy, had conſiderably increaſed theſe defects, and rendered them more intolerable. The ſucceſſion to the crown of Naples had been ſo often interrupted or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo many princes of foreign blood had taken poſſeſſion of the throne, that the Neapolitan nobility had loſt, in a great meaſure, that attachment to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of their ſovereigns, as well as that reverence for their perſons, which, in other feudal kingdoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſet ſome bounds to the encroachments of the barons upon the royal prerogative and power. At the ſame time, the different pretenders to the crown, being obliged to court the barons who adhered to them, and on whoſe ſupport they depended for the ſucceſs of their claims, they augmented their privileges by liberal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and connived at their boldeſt uſurpations.

                  <p>FROM all theſe cauſes, the kingdom of Naples was the moſt turbulent of any in Europe, and the authority of its monarchs the leaſt extenſive.

The reſentment which theſe outrages excited was ſo violent,<note place="margin">A.D. 1487.</note> and the power of the male-content nobles was ſtill ſo formidable, that to theſe may be aſcribed, in a great degree, the eaſe and rapidity with which Charles VIII. conquered the kingdom of Naples <note n="g" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 414.

Germ. i. 481.</note>. The Popes, from their implacable enmity to the houſe of Swabia, not only refuſed to recognize Manfred's title, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to excite againſt him ſome rival capable of wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſceptre out of his hand. Charles Count of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou, the brother of St. Louis King of France, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this; and he received from the Popes, the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, as a fief held of the Holy See. The Count of Anjou's efforts were crowned with ſucceſs; Manfred fell in battle; and he took poſſeſſion of the vacant throne. But ſoon after, Charles ſullied the glory which he had acquired, by the injuſtice and cruelty with which he put to death, by the hands of the executioner, Conradin, the laſt prince of the houſe of Swabia, and the rightful heir of the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan crown. That gallant young prince aſſerted his title, to the laſt, with a courage worthy of a better fate. On the ſcaffold he declared Peter, at that time Prince, and ſoon after King of Aragon, who had married Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred's only daughter, his heir; and throwing his glove among the people, he entreated that it might be carried to Peter, as the ſymbol by which he conveyed all his

rights to him <note n="i" place="bottom">Giannone, Book xix. ch. 4. Sect. 2.</note>. The deſire of avenging the inſult of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to royalty by the death of Conradin, concurred with ambition, in prompting Peter to take arms in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the title, which he had acquired. From that period, during almoſt two centuries, the houſes of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and Anjou contended for the crown of Naples. Amidſt a ſucceſſion of revolutions more rapid, as well as of crimes more atrocious, than what occur in the hiſtory of almoſt any other kingdom, monarchs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Aragoneſe line, and ſometimes of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevin, were ſeated on the throne.<note place="margin">A.D. 1434.</note> At length the princes of the houſe of Aragon obtained ſuch firm poſſeſſion of this long-diſputed inheritance, that they tranſmitted it quietly to a baſtard branch of their family <note n="k" place="bottom">Giannone, Book xxvi. ch. 2.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE race of the Angevin kings, however,<note place="margin">Pretentions of the French and Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</note> was not extinct; nor had they relinquiſhed their title to the Neapolitan crown.

France, among other expedients for raiſing money, which the calamities of his reign obliged him to employ, condeſcended to give one of his daughters in marriage to John Galeazzo Viſconti the firſt Duke of Milan, from whom he had received conſiderable ſums. Valentine Viſconti one of the children of this marriage married her couſin, Louis Duke of Orleans, the only brother of Charles VI. In their marriage-contract which the Pope confirmed, it was ſtipulated that, upon failure of heirs-male in the family of Viſconti, the dutchy of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan ſhould deſcend to the poſterity of Valentine and the Duke of Orleans. That event took place. In the year one thouſand four hundred and forty-ſeven, Philip Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria the laſt Prince of the ducal family of Viſconti died. Various competitors pretend to the ſucceſſion. Charles Duke of Orleans pleaded his right to it, founded on the marriage-contract of his mother Valentine Viſconti. Alfonſo King of Naples claimed it in conſequenee of a will made by Philip Maria in his favour. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror contended that upon the extinction of male iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in the family of Viſconti the fief returned to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Lord, and ought to be re-annexed to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The people of Milan ſmitten with that love of liberty which prevailed among the Italian States, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the dominion of any maſter, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a republican form of government.</p>
                  <p>BUT during the ſtruggle among ſo many competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the prize for which they contended was ſeized by one from whom none of them apprehended any danger. Francis Sforza, the natural ſon of Jacomuzzo Sforza, whom his courage and abilities had elevated from the rank of a peaſant to be one of the moſt eminent and powerful of the Italian <hi>Condottieri,</hi> having ſucceeded his father in the command of the adventurers who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his ſtandard, had married a natural daughter of the laſt Duke of Milan. Upon this ſhadow of a title Francis founded his pretenſions to the dutchy, which he ſupported with ſuch talents and valour as placed him at laſt on the ducal throne. The virtues as well as abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with which he governed, inducing his ſubjects to forget the defects in his title, he tranſmitted his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions quietly to his ſon; from whom they deſcended
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011837_0141_0F9D8762311E47A0"/>
to his grandſon. He was murdered by his grand uncle Ludovico, ſurnamed the Moor, who took poſſeſſion of the dutchy; and his right to it was confirmed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of the Emperor Maximilian in the year one thouſand four hundred and ninety-four <note n="*" place="bottom">Ripalm hiſt.

                  <p>LOUIS XI. who took pleaſure in depreſſing the Princes of the blood, and who admired the political abilities of Francis Sforza, would not permit the Duke of Orleans to take any ſtep in proſecution of his right to the dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Milan. Ludovico the Moor kept up ſuch a cloſe connection with Charles VIII. that during the greater part of his reign, the claim of the family of Orleans continued to lie dormant. But when the crown of France devolved to Louis XII. Duke of Orleans, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſſerted the rights of his family with the ardour which it was natural to expect. Ludovico Sforza, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of contending with ſuch a rival, was ſtripped of all his dominions in the ſpace of a few days. The King, clad in the ducal robes, entered Milan in triumph; and ſoon after, Ludovico having been betrayed by the Swiſs in his pay, was ſent a priſoner into France, and ſhut up in the caſtle of Loches, where he lay unpitied during the remainder of his days. In conſequence of one of the ſingular revolutions which occur ſo frequently in the hiſtory of the Milaneſe, his ſon Maximilian Sforza was placed on the ducal throne, of which he kept poſſeſſion during the reign of Louis XII.<note place="margin">A. D. 1512.</note> His ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Francis I. was too high-ſpirited and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing tamely to relinquiſh his title. As ſoon as he was ſeated upon the throne, he prepared to invade the Milaneſe; and his right of ſucceſſion to it, appears from this detail, to have been not only more natural but more juſt than that of any other competitor.</p>
                  <p>IT is unneceſſary to enter into any detail with reſpect to the form of government in Genoa, Parma, Modena, and the other inferior States of Italy. Their names, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, will often occur in the following hiſtory. But the power of theſe States themſelves was ſo inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that their fate depended little upon their own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and the frequent revolutions which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011837_0142_0F9D8762F2F22128"/>
were brought about by the operations of the Princes who attacked or defended them, rather than by any thing peculiar in their internal conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>OF the great kingdoms on this ſide of the Alps, Spain is one of the moſt conſiderable; and as it was the hereditary domain of Charles V,<note place="margin">The conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and vernment of Spain.</note> as well as the chief ſource of his power and wealth, a diſtinct knowledge of its political conſtitution is of capital importance towards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the tranſactions of his reign.</p>
                  <p>THE Vandals and Goths, who overturned the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power in Spain, eſtabliſhed a form of government in that country,<note place="margin">Conquered by the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</note> and brought in cuſtoms and laws, perfectly ſimilar to thoſe which were introduced into the reſt of Europe, by the other victorious tribes which acquired ſettlements there. For ſome time, ſociety advanced, among the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Spain, by the ſame ſteps, and ſeemed to hold the ſame courſe, as in other European nations. To this progreſs,<note place="margin">A. D. 712. and by the Moors.</note> a ſudden ſtop was put by the invaſions of the Saracens or Moors. The Goths could not withſtand the efforts of their enthuſiaſtick valour, which ſubdued Spain, with the ſame impetuous rapidity that diſtinguiſhes all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their arms. The conquerors introduced into the country in which they ſettled the Mahometan reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Arabick language, the manners of the Eaſt, together with that taſte for the arts, and that love of elegance and ſplendour, which the Caliphs had begun to cultivate among their ſubjects.</p>

While they puſhed on their attacks with the unremitting ardour excited by zeal for religion, by the deſire of vengeance, and by the hope of reſcuing their country from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; while they conducted their operations with the courage natural to men who had no other occupation but war, and who were ſtrangers to all the arts which corrupt or enfeeble the mind, the Moors gradually loſt many of the advantages, to which they had been indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their firſt ſucceſs.

The Moors, however, continued ſtill to be a gallant people, and poſſeſſed great reſources. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the magnificent ſtile of the Spaniſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, eight centuries of almoſt uninterrupted war elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">1492.</note> and three thouſand ſeven hundred bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, were fought before the laſt of the Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kingdoms in Spain ſubmitted to the Chriſtians arms.</p>
                  <p>AS the Chriſtians made their conqueſts upon the Mahometans at various periods, and under different leaders,<note place="margin">The union of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</note> each formed the territory which he had wreſted from the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, into an independant State. Spain was divided into as many ſeparate kingdoms, as it contained provinces, and in each city of note, a petty monarch eſtabliſhed his throne, and aſſumed all the enſigns of royalty. In a ſeries of years, however, by the uſual events of intermarriages, or legal ſucceſſion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, all theſe inferior principalities were annexed to the more powerful kingdoms of Caſtile and of Aragon, and at length by the fortunate marriage of Ferdinand and Iſabella, the former the hereditary Monarch of Aragon, and the latter raiſed to the throne of Caſtile by

                  <p>FROM this period, the political conſtitution of Spain began to aſſume a regular and uniform ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;<note place="margin">Their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtoms and laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all their revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions;</note> the genius of government may be delineated, and the progreſs of its laws and manners may be traced with certainty. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſingular revolution which had happened in Spain, and the peculiarity of its fate, its being ſo long ſubjected to the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan yoke, the cuſtoms introduced by the Vandals and Goths had taken ſuch deep root, and were ſo thoroughly incorporated with the frame of its government, that in every province which the Chriſtians recovered from the Moors, we find the condition of individuals, as well as the political conſtitution, nearly the ſame as in other nations of Europe.<note place="margin">which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their ſtate in ſome degree ſimilar to that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations of Europe.</note> Lands were held by the ſame tenure; juſtice was diſpenſed in the ſame form; the ſame privileges were claimed by the Nobility; and the ſame power exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by the Cortes, or general aſſembly of the kingdom. Several circumſtances contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſecure this permanence of the feudal inſtitutions in Spain, notwithſtanding the conqueſt of the Moors, which ſeemed to have overturned them. Such of the Spaniards, as preſerved their independance, adhered to their ancient cuſtoms not only from attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, but out of antipathy to the Moors, to whoſe ideas concerning property and government theſe cuſtoms were ſo totally repugnant. Even among the Chriſtians, who ſubmitted to the Mooriſh conquerors, and conſented to become their ſubjects, antient cuſtoms were not entirely aboliſhed. They were permitted to retain their religion; their laws concerning private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; their forms of adminiſtering juſtice; and their mode of levying taxes. The followers of Mahomet are the only enthuſiaſts, who have united the ſpirit of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration with zeal for making proſelytes, and who, at the ſame time that they took arms to propagate the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of their prophet, permitted ſuch as would not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it to adhere to their own tenets, and to practiſe their own rites. To this peculiarity in the genius of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011837_0145_0F9D8765330ED8B8"/>
the Mahometan religion, as well as to the deſire of the Moors to reconcile the Chriſtians to their yoke, it was owing that the ancient manners and laws in Spain ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the violent ſhock of a conqueſt, and continued to ſubſiſt, notwithſtanding the introduction of a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and a new form of government into that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It is obvious from all theſe particulars, that the Chriſtians muſt have found it extremely eaſy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh manners and government on their ancient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, in thoſe provinces of Spain, which they wreſted ſucceſſively from the Moors. A conſiderable part of the people retained ſuch a fondneſs for the cuſtoms, and ſuch a reverence for the laws of their anceſtors, that they wiſhed to ſee them reſtored with full authority, and were not only willing but eager to obſerve the former, and to recognize the authority of the latter.</p>
                  <p>BUT though the feudal form of government, with all the inſtitutions that characterize it,<note place="margin">Certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities in their conſtitution and laws.</note> was thus preſerved entire in Caſtile and Aragon, as well as in all the kingdoms which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on theſe crowns, there were certain pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities in their political conſtitutions which diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of any other country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The regal prerogative, extremely limited in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feudal kingdom, was circumſcribed, in Spain,<note place="margin">The prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative more limited, and the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the people more extenſive.</note> within ſuch narrow bounds, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the power of the Sovereign almoſt to nothing. The privileges of the Nobility were vaſt in proportion, and extended ſo far as to border on abſolute independance. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of the cities were great, they poſſeſſed conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable influence in the Cortes or ſupreme aſſemblies of the nations, and they aſpired at obtaining more. Such a ſtate of Society, in which the political machine was ſo ill adjuſted, and the ſeveral members of the legiſlature ſo improperly balanced, produced interior diſorders in the kingdoms of Spain, which roſe beyond the pitch of turbulence and anarchy, uſual under the feudal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The whole tenor of the Spaniſh hiſtory confirms the truth of this obſervation; and when the mutinous ſpirit, to which the genius of their policy gave birth and vigour, was not reſtrained and overawed by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

dread of the Mooriſh arms, it broke out into more frequent inſurrections againſt the government of their Princes, as well as more outrageous inſults on their dignity, than occur in the annals of any other country. Theſe were accompanied at ſome times with more liberal ſentiments concerning the rights of the people, at other times with more elevated notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the privileges of the nobles, than were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in other nations.</p>

Nor did thoſe who conceived themſelves to be aggrieved addreſs the Cortes in the humble tone of ſupplicants, and petition for redreſs; they demanded it as the birth-right of free-men, and required the guardians of their liberty to decide with reſpect to the points which they laid before them <note n="x" place="bottom">Martel.

His power was exerted with no leſs vigour and effect in ſuperintending the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than in regulating the courſe of juſtice.

He, by his ſole authority, could exclude any of the King's miniſters from the conduct of affairs, and call them to anſwer for their mal-adminiſtration.

                  <p>IT is evident from a bare enumeration of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Aragoneſe Cortes,<note place="margin">The regal power cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits.</note> as well as of the rights belonging to the Juſtiza, that a very ſmall portion of power remained in the hands of the King. The Aragoneſe ſeem to have been ſollicitous that their Monarchs ſhould know and feel this ſtate of impotence to which they were reduced. Even in ſwearing allegiance to their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, an act which ought, naturally, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with profeſſions of ſubmiſſion and reſpect, they deviſed an oath, in ſuch a form, as to remind him of his dependance on his ſubjects. "We," ſaid the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiza to the King in name of his high-ſpirited barons, "who are each of us as good, and who are altogether more powerful than you, promiſe obedience to your government, if you maintain our rights and liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if not, not." Conformably to this oath, they eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it as a fundamental article in their conſtitution, that if the King ſhould violate their rights and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it was lawful for the people to diſclaim him as their ſovereign, and to elect another in his place <note n="a" place="bottom">Hier.

In the preamble to one of their laws, they declare that ſuch was the barrenneſs of their country, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the inhabitants, that if it were not on account of the liberties by which they were diſtinguiſhed from other nations, the people would abandon it, and go in queſt of a ſettlement to ſome more fruitful region <note n="b" place="bottom">Hier. Blanca Com p. 751.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN Caſtile, there were not ſuch peculiarities in the form of government, as to eſtabliſh any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diſtinction between it,<note place="margin">Conſtitution and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Caſtile.</note> and that of the other European nations. The executive part of government was committed to the King, but with a prerogative extremely limited. The legiſlative authority reſided in the Cortes, which was compoſed of the nobility, the dignified eccleſiaſticks, and the repreſentatives of the cities. The aſſembly of the Cortes in Caſtile was very ancient, and ſeems to have been coeval with the conſtitution. The members of the three different orders, who had a right of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, met in one place, and deliberated as one col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective body; the deciſions of which were regulated by the ſentiments of the majority. The right of impoſing taxes, of enacting laws, and of redreſſing grievances belonged to this aſſembly; and in order to ſecure the aſſent of the King to ſuch ſtatutes and regulations, as were deemed ſalutary or beneficial to the kingdom, it was uſual in the Cortes, to take no ſtep towards grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money, until all buſineſs relative to the publick welfare was concluded. The repreſentatives of cities ſeem to have obtained a ſeat very early in the Cortes of Caſtile, and ſoon acquired ſuch influence and credit, as were very uncommon, at a period when the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and pre-eminence of the nobility had eclipſed or annihilated all other orders of men. The number of members from cities bore ſuch a proportion to that of the whole collective body, as rendered them extremely reſpectable in the Cortes <note n="[II]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXII.</note>. The degree of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which they poſſeſſed in the ſtate, may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by one event.<note place="margin">A. D. 1390.</note> Upon the death of John I, a council of regency was appointed to govern the kingdom during the minority of his ſon.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011837_0151_0F9D8769B5B8DA78"/>
It was compoſed of an equal number of noblemen, and of deputies choſen by the cities; the latter were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſame rank, and inveſted with the ſame powers, as prelates and grandees of the firſt order <note n="c" place="bottom">Marian. hiſt lib. 18. c. 15.</note>. But though the members of communities in Caſtile were elevated above the condition wherein they were placed in other kingdoms of Europe; though they had attained to ſuch political importance, that even the proud and jealous ſpirit of the feudal ariſtocracy could not exclude them from ſome ſhare of government; yet the nobles, notwithſtanding theſe acquiſitions of the commons, continued to aſſert the privileges of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in oppoſition to the crown, in a tone extremely high. There was not any body of nobility in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope more diſtinguiſhed for independance of ſpirit, haughtineſs of deportment, and bold pretenſions, than that of Caſtile. The hiſtory of that monarchy affords the moſt ſtriking examples of the vigilance with which they obſerved, and of the vigour with which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed every ſcheme of their Kings, that tended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on their juriſdiction, to diminiſh their dignity, or to abridge their power. Even in their ordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with their Monarchs, they preſerved ſuch a conſciouſneſs of their rank, that the nobles of the firſt order claimed it as a privilege to be covered in the royal preſence, and approached their ſovereigns rather as equals than as ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>THE conſtitution of the ſubordinate monarchies, which depended on the crowns of Caſtile and Aragon, nearly reſembled that of the kingdom to which they were annexed. In all of them, the dignity and independance of the nobles were great; the immunities and power of the cities were conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>AN attentive obſervation of the ſingular ſituation of Spain,<note place="margin">Various cauſes of the limited au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Spaniſh Monarchs.</note> as well as of the various events which occurred there, from the invaſion of the Moors to the union of its kingdoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ferdinand and Iſabella, will diſcover thoſe cauſes, to which all the peculiarites in its political conſtitution, that I have pointed out, ought to be aſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="unknown:011837_0152_0F9D876A7101C6C0"/>AS the provinces of Spain were wreſted from the Mahometans gradually and with difficulty, the nobles, who followed the ſtandard of any eminent leader in theſe wars, conquered not for him alone, but for themſelves. They claimed a ſhare in the lands which their valour had torn from the enemy, and their proſperity and power increaſed, in proportion as the territory of the Prince extended.</p>
                  <p>DURING their perpetual wars with the Moors, the Monarchs of Spain depended ſo much on their nobles, that it became neceſſary to conciliate their good will by ſucceſſive grants of new honours and privileges. By the time that any Prince could eſtabliſh his dominion in a conquered province, the greater part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was parcelled out by him among his barons, with ſuch juriſdiction and immunities as raiſed them almoſt to ſovereign power.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time, the kingdoms erected in ſo many different corners of Spain were extremely inconſiderable. The petty Monarch was but litttle elevated above his nobles. They, feeling themſelves to be almoſt his equals, acted as ſuch. The Kings of ſuch limited do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains could neither command much reſpect, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs great power; and noblemen, ſo nearly on the ſame level, could not look up to them with that reverence, with which the ſovereigns of the great monarchies in Europe were viewed by their ſubjects <note n="[KK]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THESE circumſtances concurred in exalting the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and in depreſſing the royal authority; there were others, which raiſed the cities in Spain to conſideration and power.</p>
                  <p>AS the open country, during the wars with the Moors, was perpetually expoſed to the excurſions of the enemy, with whom no peace or truce was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent as to prove any laſting ſecurity, ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obliged perſons of all ranks to fix their reſidence in places of ſtrength. The caſtles of the barons, which, in other countries, afforded a commodious retreat from the depradations of banditti, or from the tranſient vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of any interior commotion, were unable to reſiſt
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011837_0153_0F9D876B3143E870"/>
an enemy whoſe operations were conducted with regular and perſevering vigour. Cities, in which great numbers united for their mutual defence, were the only places to which people could retire with any proſpect of ſafety. To this was owing the rapid growth of thoſe cities in Spain of which the Chriſtians recovered poſſeſſion. All who fled from the Mooriſh yoke reſorted to them, as to an aſylum; and there, the greater part of thoſe, who took the field againſt the Mahometans, eſtabliſhed their families.</p>
                  <p>EACH of theſe cities, during a longer or ſhorter courſe of years, was the capital of a little ſtate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all the advantages, which accelerate the increaſe of inhabitants in every place that is the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>THE number of cities in Spain, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, was conſiderable, and they were peopled far beyond the proportion which was common in other parts of Europe, except in Italy and the Low-Countries. The Moors had introduced manufactures into theſe cities, while under their dominion. The Chriſtians, who, by intermixture with them, had learned their arts, continued to cultivate theſe. The trade of ſeveral of the Spaniſh towns appears to have ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; and the ſpirit of commerce continued to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the number of their inhabitants, as the ſenſe of danger had firſt induced them to crowd together.</p>
                  <p>AS the Spaniſh cities were populous, many of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were of a rank ſuperior to thoſe who reſided in towns in other countries of Europe. That cauſe which contributed chiefly to their population, affected equally perſons of every condition, who flocked thither promiſcuouſly, in order to find ſhelter, or in hopes of making a ſtand there againſt the enemy, with greater advantage than in any other ſtation. The perſons elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their repreſentatives in the Cortes by the cities, or promoted to offices of truſt and dignity in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the community, were often, as will appear from tranſactions which I ſhall hereafter relate, of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable rank in the kingdom, as reflected luſtre on their conſtituents, and on the ſtations wherein they were placed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="unknown:011837_0154_0F9D876BF0F14430"/>AS it was impoſſible to carry on a continual war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moors, without ſome other military force, than that which the barons were obliged to bring into the field, in conſequence of the feudal tenures, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>became neceſſary to have ſome troops, particularly a body of light cavalry, in conſtant pay. It was one of the privileges of the nobles, that their lands were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the burden of taxes. The charge of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the troops requiſite for the publick ſafety, fell wholly upon the cities; and their Kings, being obliged frequently to apply to them for aid, found it neceſſary to gain their favour by conceſſions, which extended their immunities, and added to their wealth and power.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the influence of all theſe circumſtances, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Spain, is added to the general and common cauſes which contributed to aggrandize cities in other countries of Europe, this will fully account for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive privileges which they acquired, as well as the extraordinary conſideration to which they attained, in all the Spaniſh kingdoms <note n="[LL]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXIV.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BY theſe exorbitant privileges of the nobility, and this unuſual power of the cities in Spain,<note place="margin">Meaſures of different Princes in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their power, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of Ferdinand and Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> the royal prerogative was hemmed in on every hand, and reduced within very narrow bounds. Senſible of this, and impatient of ſuch reſtraint, different Monarchs endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at various junctures, to enlarge their own juriſdiction, and to circumſcribe that of their ſubjects. Their power, however, or their abilities were ſo unequal to the undertaking, that their efforts were attended with little ſucceſs. But when Ferdinand and Iſabella found themſelves at the head of all the united kingdoms of Spain, and delivered from the danger and interruption of domeſtick wars, they were not only in a condition to reſume, but were able to proſecute with advantage, the ſchemes of extending the prerogative, which their anceſtors had attempted in vain. Ferdinand's profound ſagacity in concerting his meaſures, his perſevering induſtry in conducting them, and his uncommon addreſs in carrying them into
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011837_0155_0F9D876CB194D348"/>
execution, fitted him admirably for an undertaking which required all theſe talents.</p>
                  <p>AS the overgrown power, and high pretenſions of the nobility were what the Monarchs of Spain felt moſt ſenſibly,<note place="margin">Ferdinand's different ſchemes for abridging the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and power of the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and bore with the greateſt impatience, the great object of Ferdinand's policy was to reduce theſe within more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bounds. Under various pretexts, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by violence, more frequently in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of decrees obtained in the courts of law, he wreſted from the barons a great part of the lands, which had been granted to them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate bounty of former Monarchs, particularly during the feeble and profuſe reign of his predeceſſor Henry IV. He did not give the entire conduct of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to perſons of noble birth, who were accuſtomed to occupy every department of importance in peace or in war, as if it had been a privilege peculiar to their order, to be employed as the ſole counſellors and miniſters of the crown. He often tranſacted buſineſs of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence without their intervention, and committed many offices of power and truſt to new men, devoted to his intereſt <note n="d" place="bottom">Zurita anales de Arag. tom. vi. p. 22.</note>. He introduced a degree of ſtate dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into his court, which being unknown in Spain, while it remained ſplit into many ſmall kingdoms, taught the nobles to approach their ſovereign with more ceremony, and gradually rendered him the object of greater deference and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>THE annexing the maſterſhips of the three military orders of St. Jago, Calatrava, and Alcantara, to the crown,<note place="margin">Particularly by annexing the grand-maſterſhips of the three orders to the crown;</note> was another expedient, by which Ferdinand greatly augmented the revenue and power of the Kings of Spain. Theſe orders were inſtituted in imitation of thoſe of the Knights Templars and of St. John of Jeruſalem, on purpoſe to wage perpetual war with the Mahometans, and to protect the pilgrims who viſited Compoſtella, or other places of eminent ſanctity in Spain. The zeal and ſuperſtition of the ages, in which they were founded, prompted perſons of every rank to beſtow
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011837_0156_0F9D876DA956DAF0"/>
ſuch liberal donations on theſe holy warriors, that, in a ſhort time, they engroſſed a conſiderable ſhare in the property and wealth of the kingdom. The maſterſhips of theſe orders came to be ſtations of the greateſt power and opulence to which a Spaniſh nobleman could be advanced. Theſe high dignities were in the diſpoſal of the Knights of the Order, and placed the perſons on whom they conferred them almoſt on a level with their ſovereign <note n="[MM]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXV.</note>. Ferdinand, unwilling that the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whom he conſidered as already too formidable, ſhould derive ſuch additional credit and influence from poſſeſſing the government of theſe wealthy fraternities, was ſolicitous to wreſt it out of their hands, and to veſt it in the crown. His meaſures for accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this, were wiſely planned,<note place="margin">A. D. 1476. and 1493.</note> and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with vigour <note n="e" place="bottom">Marian. hiſt. lib. xxv. c. 5.</note> By addreſs, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by threats, he prevailed on the Knights of each Order to place Iſabella and him at the head of it. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent VIII. and Alexander VI. gave this election the ſanction of papal authority <note n="f" place="bottom">Zurita anales tom. v p. 22. Aelii. Anton.

                  <p>WHILE Ferdinand, by this meaſure, diminiſhed the power and influence of the nobility, and added new luſtre or authority to the crown,<note place="margin">And by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the nobility.</note> he was taking other important ſteps, with a view to the ſame object. The ſovereign juriſdiction which the feudal barons exerciſed within their own territories, was the pride and diſtinction of their order. To have invaded openly a privilege which they prized ſo highly, and in defence of which they would have run ſo eagerly to arms, was a meaſure too daring for a Prince of Ferdinand's cautious temper. He took advantage, however, of an opportunity which the ſtate of his kingdoms and the ſpirit of his people preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, in order to undermine what he durſt not aſſault. The inceſſant depredations of the Moors, the want of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011837_0157_0F9D876E3054A670"/>
diſcipline among the troops which were employed to oppoſe them, the frequent civil wars between the crown and the nobility, as well as the undiſcerning rage with which the barons carried on their private wars with each other, filled all the provinces of Spain with diſorder. Rapine, outrage, and murder, became ſo common, as not only to interrupt commerce, but in a great meaſure to ſuſpend all intercourſe between one place and another. That ſecurity and protection which men expect from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into civil ſociety ceaſed almoſt totally. Interior order and police, while the feudal inſtitutions remained in vigour, were ſo little objects of attention, and the adminiſtration of juſtice was ſo extremely feeble, that it would have been in vain to have expected relief from the eſtabliſhed laws or the ordinary judges. But the evil became ſo intolerable, and the inhabitants of cities, who were the chief ſufferers, grew ſo impatient of this anarchy, that ſelf preſervation forced them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to an extraordinary remedy.<note place="margin">1260.</note> About the middle of the thirteenth century, the cities in the kingdom of Aragon, and after their example thoſe in Caſtile, formed themſelves into an aſſociation, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi>Holy Brotherhood.</hi> They exacted a certain contribution from each of the aſſociated towns; they levied a conſiderable body of troops, in order to protect travellers, and to purſue criminals; they appointed judges, who opened their courts in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the kingdom. Whoever was guilty of murder, robbery, or of any act that violated the publick peace, and was ſeized by the troops of the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> was carried before their own judges, who, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any regard to the excluſive and ſovereign juriſdiction which the lord of the place might claim, tried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the criminals. By means of this, the prompt and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice was reſtored; and together with it, internal tranquillity and order began to return. The nobles alone murmured at this ſalutary inſtitution. They complained of it as an encroachment on one of their moſt valuable privileges. They remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt it in an high tone; and, on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, refuſed to grant any aid to the crown, unleſs it were aboliſhed. Ferdinand, however, was ſenſible not

only of the good effects of the Holy Brotherhood with reſpect to the police of his kingdoms, but perceived its tendency to abridge, and at length to annihilate the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial juriſdiction of the nobility.

                  <p>BUT though Ferdinand by theſe meaſures conſiderab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged the boundaries of prerogative,<note place="margin">Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe, the government of Spain ſtill extremely free.</note> and acquired a degree of influence and power far beyond what any of his predeceſſors had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, yet the limitations of the royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the barriers againſt its encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, continued to be many and ſtrong. The ſpirit of liberty was vigorous among the people of Spain; the ſpirit of independance was high among the nobility; and though the love of glory, peculiar to the Spaniards in every period of their hiſtory, prompted them to ſupport Ferdinand with zeal in his foreign ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and to afford him ſuch aid as enabled him not only to undertake but to execute great enterprizes; he reigned over his ſubjects with a juriſdiction leſs exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than that of any of the great monarchs in Europe. It will appear from many paſſages in the following hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that, during a conſiderable part of the reign of his ſucceſſor Charles V. the prerogative of the Spaniſh crown was equally circumſcribed.</p>
                  <p>THE ancient government and laws in France ſo nearly reſembled thoſe of the other feudal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,<note place="margin">Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of France.</note> that ſuch a detail with reſpect to them as was neceſſary, in order to convey ſome idea of the nature and effects of the peculiar inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which took place in Spain, would be ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In the view which I have exhibited of the means by which the French monarchs acquired ſuch full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the national force of their kingdom, as enabled

them to engage in extenſive ſchemes of foreign opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have already pointed out the great ſteps by which they advanced towards a more ample poſſeſſion of political power, and a more uncontrouled exerciſe of their royal prerogative. All that now remains is to take notice of ſuch particulars in the conſtitution of France, as ſerve either to diſtinguiſh it from that of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or tend to throw any light on the tranſactions of that period to which the following hiſtory extends.</p>
                  <p>UNDER the French monarchs of the firſt race; the royal prerogative was very inconſiderable. The General Aſſemblies of the nation,<note place="margin">Power of the General Aſſemblies under the firſt race of Kings.</note> which met annually at ſtated ſeaſons, extended their authority to every department of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The power of electing Kings, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting laws, of redreſſing grievances, of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing judgment in the laſt reſort, with reſpect to every perſon and to every cauſe, and of conferring donations on the Prince, reſided in this great convention of the nation.<note place="margin">Under the ſecond.</note> Under the ſecond race of Kings, notwithſtanding the power and ſplendor which the conqueſts of Charlemagne added to the crown, the general aſſemblies of the nations continued to poſſeſs extenſive authority. The right of determining which of the royal family ſhould be placed on the throne was veſted in them. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs elected by their ſuffrage were accuſtomed regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to call and to conſult them with reſpect to every affair of importance to the ſtate, and without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> was paſſed, and no new tax was levied.</p>
                  <p>BUT, by the time that Hugh Capet, the father of the third race of Kings, took poſſeſſion of the throne of France,<note place="margin">Under the third.</note> ſuch changes had happened in the political ſtate of the kingdom, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably affected the power and juriſdiction of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly of the nation. The royal authority in the hands of the degenerate poſterity of Charlemagne, had dwindled into inſignificance and contempt. Every conſiderable proprietor of land had formed his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory into a barony, almoſt independant of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. The dukes or governors of provinces, the counts or governors of towns and ſmall diſtricts, and the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011837_0160_0F9D877072AB15A8"/>
great officers of the crown, had rendered theſe dignities, originally granted only during pleaſure or for life, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary in their families. Each of theſe had uſurped all the rights which hitherto had been deemed the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of royalty, particularly the privileges of diſpenſing juſtice within their own domains, of coining money, and of waging war. Every diſtrict was governed by local cuſtoms, acknowledged a diſtinct lord, and purſued a ſeparate intereſt. The formality of doing homage to their ſovereign, was almoſt the only act of ſubjection which haughty barons would perform, and that bound them no farther than they were willing to acknowledge its obligation <note n="[OO]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXVII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN a kingdom broken into ſo many independant ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies, hardly any common principle of union remained;<note place="margin">The power of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly leſs conſiderable and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</note> and the general aſſembly in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations could ſcarce conſider the nation as forming one body, or eſtabliſh common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations to be of equal force in every part. Within the immediate domains of the crown the king might publiſh laws, and they were obeyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there he was acknowledged as the only lord. But if he had aimed at rendering theſe general, that would have alarmed the barons as an encroachment upon the independance of their juriſdiction. The barons, with no leſs care, avoided the enacting of general laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the execution of them muſt have been veſted in the King, and would have enlarged that paramount power which was the object of their jealouſy. Thus, under the deſcendants of Hugh Capet, the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (for that was the name by which the ſupreme aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the French nation came then to be diſtinguiſhed) loſt their legiſlative authority, or at leaſt entirely relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the exerciſe of it. From that period, the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the States General extended no farther than to the impoſition of new taxes, the determination of queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reſpect to the right of ſucceſſion to the crown, the ſettling of the regency when the preceeding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had not fixed it by his will, and the preſenting

remonſtrances enumerating the grievances of which the nation wiſhed to obtain redreſs.</p>
                  <p>AS, during ſeveral centuries, the monarchs of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ſeldom demanded extraordinary ſubſidies of their ſubjects, and the other events which required the interpoſition of the States, rarely occurred, their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in France were not frequent. They were ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed occaſionally by their Kings, when compelled by their wants or by their fears to have recourſe to their aid; but they did not, like the Diet in Germany, the Cortes in Spain, or the Parliament in England, form an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial member of the conſtitution, the regular exertion of whoſe powers was requiſite to give vigour and order to government.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the ſtates of France ceaſed to exerciſe legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority,<note place="margin">The crown begins to acquire le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</note> the Kings began to aſſume it. They ventured at firſt on acts of legiſlation with great reſerve; and after taking every precaution that could prevent their ſubjects from being alarmed at the exerciſe of a new power. They did not at once iſſue their ordinances in a tone of authority and command. They treated with their ſubjects; they pointed out what was beſt; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured them to comply with it. By degrees, however, as the prerogative of the crown extended, and as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme juriſdiction of the royal courts came to be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, the Kings of France aſſumed more openly the ſtile and authority of law-givers, and before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifteenth century, the complete legiſlative power was veſted in them <note n="[PP]" place="bottom">NOTE XXXVIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAVING ſecured this important acquiſition, the ſteps that led to the right of impoſing taxes were rendered few and eaſy.<note place="margin">and the power of levying taxes.</note> The people, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſee their ſovereigns, by their ſole authority, iſſue ordonances which regulated points of the greateſt conſequence with reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their ſubjects, were not alarmed when they were required, by the royal edicts, to contribute certain ſums towards ſupplying the exigencies of government, and carrying forward the meaſures of the nation. When
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011837_0162_0F9D8771F1ADBE30"/>
Charles VII. and Louis XI. firſt ventured to exerciſe this new power, in the manner which I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the gradual increaſe of the royal authority had ſo imperceptibly prepared the minds of the people of France for this innovation, that it excited no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the kingdom, and ſeems ſcarce to have given riſe to any murmur or complaint.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the Kings of France had thus engroſſed every power which can be exerted in government;<note place="margin">Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of France be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical.</note> when the right of making laws, of levying money, of keeping an army of mercenaries in conſtant pay, of declaring war and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding peace centered in the crown, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the kingdom, which, under the firſt race of Kings, was nearly democratical, which, under the ſecond race, became an ariſtocracy, terminated, under the third race, in a pure monarchy. Every thing that tended to preſerve the appearance, or revive the memory of the ancient mixed government, ſeems from that period to have been induſtriouſly avoided. During the long and active reign of Francis I. the variety as well as extent of whoſe operations obliged him to lay many heavy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on his ſubjects, the States General of France were not once aſſembled, nor were the people once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to exert the power of taxing themſelves, which, according to the original ideas of feudal government, was a right eſſential to every free-man.</p>
                  <p>TWO things, however, remained, which moderated the exerciſe of the regal prerogative,<note place="margin">The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the nobility.</note> and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it within ſuch bounds as preſerved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of France from degenerating into mere deſpotiſm. The rights and privileges claimed by the nobility muſt be conſidered as one barrier againſt the abſolute dominion of the crown. Though the nobles of France had loſt that political power which was veſted in their order as a body, they ſtill retained the perſonal rights and pre-eminence which they derived from their rank. They preſerved a conſciouſneſs of elevation above other claſſes of citizens; an exemption from burdens to which they were ſubject; a contempt of the occupations in which they were engaged; the privilege of aſſuming enſigns
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011837_0163_0F9D8772B07C9518"/>
that indicated their dignity; a title to be treated with a certain degree of deference during peace; and a claim to various diſtinctions when in the field. Many of theſe pretenſions were not founded on the words of ſtatutes, or derived from poſitive laws; they were defined and aſcertained by the maxims of honour, a title more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, but no leſs ſacred. Theſe rights, eſtabliſhed and protected by a principle equally vigilant in guarding, and intrepid in defending them, are to the Sovereign himſelf objects of reſpect and veneration Wherever they ſtand in its way, the royal prerogative is bounded. The violence of a Deſpot may exterminate ſuch an order of men; but as long as it ſubſiſts, and its ideas of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal diſtinction remain entire, the power of the Prince has limits <note n="g" place="bottom">Des Eſprits des Loix, liv. ii. c. 4. Dr. Ferguſon's Eſſay on the Hiſt. of Civil Society, part. i. ſec. 10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AS in France, the body of nobility was very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and retained an high ſenſe of their own pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, to this we may aſcribe, in a great meaſure, the mode of exerciſing the royal prerogative which peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly diſtinguiſhes the government of that kingdom. An intermediate order was placed between the Monarch and his other ſubjects, and in every act of authority it became neceſſary to attend to its privileges, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to guard againſt any real violation of theſe, but to avoid any ſuſpicion of its being poſſible that they might be violated. Thus a ſpecies of government was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in France, unknown in the ancient world, that of a monarchy, in which the power of the ſovereign, though unconfined by any legal or conſtitutional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, has certain bounds ſet to it by the ideas which one claſs of his ſubjects entertain concerning their own dignity.</p>
                  <p>THE juriſdiction of the Parliaments of France, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of Paris,<note place="margin">And by the juriſdiction of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, particularly that of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> was the other barrier which ſerved to confine the exerciſe of the royal prerogative within certain limits. The parliament of Paris was originally the court of the Kings of France, to which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſupreme adminiſtration of juſtice
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011837_0164_0F9D877372A48210"/>
within their own domains, as well as the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding with reſpect to all caſes brought before it by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from the courts of the barons. When the time and place of its meeting were fixed, when not only the form of its procedure, but the principles on which it decided, were rendered regular and conſiſtent, when every cauſe of importance was finally determined there, and when the people became accuſtomed to reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the ſupreme temple of juſtice, the parliament of Paris roſe to high eſtimation in the kingdom, its members acquired dignity, and its decrees were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, with deference. The Kings of France, when they firſt began to aſſume the legiſlative power, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reconcile the minds of their people to this new exertion of prerogative, produced their edicts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donances in the parliament of Paris, that they might be approved of and regiſtered there, before they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and declared to be of authority in the kingdom. During the intervals between the meetings of the States General of the kingdom, or under thoſe reigns when the States General were not aſſembled, the Monarchs of France were accuſtomed to conſult the parliament of Paris with reſpect to the moſt arduous affairs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and frequently regulated their conduct by its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in declaring war, in concluding peace, and in other tranſactions of publick concern. Thus there was erected in the kingdom a tribunal which became the great depoſitory of the laws, and by the uniform tenor of its decrees it eſtabliſhed principles of juſtice and forms of proceeding which were conſidered as ſo ſacred, that even the ſovereign power of the Monarch durſt not venture to diſregard or to violate them. The members of this illuſtrious body, though they neither poſſeſs le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority, nor can be conſidered as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, have availed themſelves of the reputation and influence which they had acquired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their countrymen, in order to make a ſtand to the utmoſt of their ability againſt every unprecedented and exorbitant exertion of the prerogative. In every period of the French hiſtory, they have merited the praiſe of

                  <p>THE kingdom extends to the confines of the German Empire from which Charles V. derived his title of higheſt dignity.<note place="margin">Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the German Empire.</note> In explaining the political conſtitution of this vaſt and complex body at the beginning of the ſixteenth century, I ſhall avoid entering into ſuch a detail as would involve my readers in that inextricable labyrinth, which is formed by the multiplicity of its tribunals, the number of its members, their interfering rights, and by the endleſs diſcuſſions or refinements of the publick law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of Germany with reſpect to all theſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Empire of Charlemagne was a ſtructure erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo ſhort a time that it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.<note place="margin">Its ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne and his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</note> Under his immediate ſucceſſor it began to totter: and it ſoon fell to pieces. The crown of Germany was ſeparated for ever from that of France, and the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of Charlemagne eſtabliſhed two great monarchies ſo ſituated as to give riſe to a perpetual rivalſhip and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between them. But the Princes of the race of Charlemagne, who were placed on the Imperial throne, were not altogether ſo degenerate, as thoſe of the ſame family who reigned in France. In the hands of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the royal authority retained ſome vigour, and the nobles of Germany, though poſſeſſed of extenſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges as well as ample territories, did not ſo early attain independance. The great offices of the crown conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be at the diſpoſal of the ſovereign, and during a long period, fiefs remained in their original ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out becoming hereditary and perpetual in the families to which they had been granted.</p>
                  <p>AT length the German branch of the family of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne became extinct,<note place="margin">Other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Imperial dignity.</note> and his feeble deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants who reigned in France had ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch contempt, that the Germans, without looking towards them, exerciſed the right inherent in a free people; and in a general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the nation elected Conrad Count of Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia

Emperor.<note place="margin">A. D. 911.</note> After him Henry of Saxony and his deſcendants the three Othos, were placed, in ſucceſſion, on the Imperial throne, by the ſuffrages of their countrymen. The extenſive territories of the Saxon Emperors, their eminent abilities and enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing genius not only added new vigour to the imperial dignity, but raiſed it to higher power and pre-eminence. Otho the Great marched at the head of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army into Italy,<note place="margin">A. D. 952.</note> and after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Charlemagne, gave law to that country. Every power there recognized his authority. He created Popes and depoſed them by his ſovereign mandate. He annexed the kingdom of Italy to the German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Elated with his ſucceſs, he aſſumed the title of Caeſar Auguſtus <note n="h" place="bottom">Annaliſta Saxo, &amp;c. ap. Struv. Corp. vol. i. p. 246.</note>; and a Prince born in the heart of Germany pretended to be the ſucceſſor of the Emperors of ancient Rome, and claimed a right to the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and prerogative.</p>
                  <p>BUT while the Emperors, by means of theſe new titles, and new dominions, gradually acquired additional power and ſplendour,<note place="margin">The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acquire independant and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> the nobility of Germany went on at the ſame time extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their privileges and juriſdiction. The ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of affairs was favourable to their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. The vigour which Charlemagne had given to government quickly relaxed. The inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſome of his ſucceſſors was ſuch, as would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged vaſſals leſs enterprizing than the nobles of that age, to have claimed new rights and to have aſſumed new powers. The civil wars in which other Emperors were engaged, obliged them to pay perpetual court to their ſubjects, on whoſe ſupport they depended, and not only to connive at their uſurpations, but to permit and even to authorize them. Fiefs became gradually here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, They were tranſmitted not only in the direct, but in the collateral line.

They aimed, however, at undermining their power, and inconſiderately beſtowed additional territories, and accumulated new honours on the clergy, in hopes that this order might ſerve as a counterpoiſe to that of the nobility in any future ſtruggle <note n="k" place="bottom">Pſeffel. abrege, p. 154.</note>.</p>

                  <p>THIS act of humiliation degraded the Imperial dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Nor was the depreſſion only momentary. The conteſt between Gregory and Henry gave riſe to the two great factions of the Guelfs and Ghibellines; the

former of which ſupporting the pretenſions of the Popes, and the latter defending the rights of the Emperor, kept Germany and Italy in perpetual agitation during three centuries. A regular ſyſtem for humbling the Emperors and circumſcribing their power was formed, and adhered to uniformly throughout that period. The Popes,<note place="margin">The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declines.</note> the free States in Italy, the nobility and eccleſiaſticks of Germany, were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in its ſucceſs; and notwithſtanding the return of ſome ſhort intervals of vigour, under the adminiſtration of a few able Emperors, the Imperial authority continued to decline. During the anarchy of the long interregnum ſubſequent to the death of William of Holland,<note place="margin">A.

                  <p>DURING this period of turbulence and confuſion the conſtitution of the Germanick body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went a total change.<note place="margin">A total change in the political conſtitution of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note> The ancient names of courts and magiſtrates, together with the original forms and appearance of policy were preſerved; but ſuch new privileges and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction were aſſumed, and ſo many various rights eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that the ſame ſpecies of government no longer ſubſiſted.

adminiſtration and police of their domains. They enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed laws, impoſed taxes, coined money, declared war, concluded peace, and exerted every prerogative peculiar to independant States. The ideas of order and political union which had formed the various provinces of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many into one body were entirely loſt; and the ſociety muſt have diſſolved, if the forms of feudal ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not preſerved ſuch an appearance of connection or dependance among the various members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as preſerved it from falling to pieces.</p>
                  <p>THIS bond of union, however, was extremely feeble; and no principle remained in the German con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſufficient force to maintain pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic order,<note place="margin">Expedients for putting an end to this ſtate of anarchy.</note> and hardly to aſcertain perſonal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. From the acceſſion of Rodulph of Hapſburgh, to the reign of Maximilian, the immediate predeceſſor of Charles V. the Empire felt every cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which a ſtate muſt endure when the authority of government is ſo much relaxed as to have loſt all vigour. The cauſes of diſſention among that vaſt number of members which compoſed the Germanick body, were infinite and unavoidable. Theſe gave riſe to perpetual private wars, carried on with all the violence of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when unreſtrained by ſuperiour authority, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, outrage and exactions, became univerſal.

It was a complex body, formed by the aſſociation of ſeveral States, each of which poſſeſſed ſovereign and independant juriſdiction within its own territories. Of all the members which compoſed this united body, the Emperor was the head. In his name, all decrees and regulations with reſpect to points of common concern, were iſſued; and to him the power of carrying them into execution was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But this appearance of monarchical power in the Emperor was more than counterbalanced by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and authority of the Princes and States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in every act of adminiſtration. No law extending to the whole body could paſs, no reſolution that affected the general intereſt could be taken, without the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Diet of the Empire. In this aſſembly, every ſovereign Prince and State of the Germanick body had a right to be preſent, to deliberate, and to vote. The decrees or <hi>Receſſes</hi> of the Diet were the laws of the Empire, which the Emperor was bound to ratify and enforce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="unknown:011837_0172_0F9D877971F732E0"/>UNDER this aſpect the conſtitution of the Empire appears a regular confederacy,<note place="margin">Peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the nature of this aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> ſimilar to the Achaean league in ancient Greece, or to that of the United Provinces and of the Swiſs cantons in modern times. But if viewed in another light, ſtriking peculiarities in its political ſtate preſent themſelves. The Germanick body was not formed by the union of members altogether diſtinct and independant. All the Princes and States joined in this aſſociation, were originally ſubject to the Emperors, and acknowledged them as ſovereigns. Beſides this, they originally held their lands as Imperial fiefs, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this tenure owed the Emperors all thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which feudal vaſſals are bound to perform to their liege lord. But though this political ſubjection was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at an end, and the influence of the feudal relation much diminiſhed, the ancient forms and inſtitutions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced when the Emperors governed Germany with authority, not inferior to that which the other monarchs of Europe poſſeſſed, ſtill remained. Thus an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was eſtabliſhed between the genius of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the forms of adminiſtration in the German Empire. The former conſidered the Emperor only as the head of a confederacy, the members of which, by their voluntary choice, have raiſed him to that dignity; the latter ſeemed to imply, that he is really inveſted with ſovereign power. By this circumſtance,<note place="margin">The defects in the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Empire.</note> ſuch principles of hoſtility and diſcord were interwoven in the frame of the Germanick body, as affected each of its members, rendering their interior union incomplete, and their external efforts feeble and irregular. The effects of this vice or diſorder inherent in the conſtitution of the Empire are ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that, without attending to them it is impoſſible to comprehend many tranſactions in the reign of Charles V. or to form juſt ideas concerning the genius of the German government.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperors of Germany, at the beginning of the ſixteenth century,<note place="margin">Ariſing from the limited power of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</note> were diſtinguiſhed by the moſt pompous titles, and by ſuch enſigns of dignity as intimated their authority to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011837_0173_0F9D877A30C7AFA8"/>
to that of all other monarchs. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Princes of the Empire attended and ſerved them on ſome occaſions, as the officers of their houſhold. They exerciſed prerogatives which no other ſovereign ever claimed. They retained pretenſions to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive powers which their predeceſſors had enjoyed in any former age. But at the ſame time, inſtead of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing that ample domain which had belonged to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Emperors of Germany, and which ſtretched from Baſil to Cologne, along both banks of the Rhine <note n="n" place="bottom">Pfeffel. Abrege, &amp;c. p. 241.</note>, they were ſtript of all teritorial property, and had not a ſingle city, a ſingle caſtle, foot of land, that pertained to them as heads of the Empire. As their domain was alienated, their ſtated revenues were reduced almoſt to nothing; and the extraordinary aids which on a few occaſions they obtained, were granted ſparingly, and paid with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The Princes and States of the Empire, though they ſeemed to recognize the Imperial authority, were ſubjects only in name each of them poſſeſſing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat municipal juriſdiction within the precincts of his own territories.</p>
                  <p>FROM this ill-compacted frame of government, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that were unavoidable reſulted.<note place="margin">From the nature of their title and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> The Emperors, dazzled with the ſplendour of their titles, and the exterior ſigns of vaſt authority, were apt to imagine themſelves to be the real ſovereigns of Germany, and were led to aim continually at recovering the exerciſe of thoſe powers and prerogatives which the forms of the conſtitution ſeemed to veſt in them, and which their predeceſſors Charlemagne and the Otho's had actually enjoyed. The Princes and States, aware of the nature as well as extent of their pretenſions, were perpetually on their guard, in order to watch all the motions of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al court, and to circumſcribe its power within limits ſtill more narrow. The Emperors, in ſupport of their claims, appealed to ancient forms and inſtitutions, which the States held to be obſolete. The States found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their rights on recent practice and modern privileges, which the Emperors conſidered as uſurpations.</p>

During a long period, all the members of the Germanick body aſſembled, and made choice of the perſon whom they appointed to be their head. But amidſt the violence and anarchy which prevailed for ſeveral centuries in the Empire, ſeven Princes who poſſeſſed the moſt extenſive territories, and who had obtained a hereditary title to the great offices of the State, acquired the excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of nominating the Emperor. This right was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by the Golden Bull; the mode of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing it was aſcertained, and they were dignified with the appellation of <hi>Electors.</hi> The nobility and free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being thus ſtripped of a privilege which they had once enjoyed, were leſs connected with a Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whoſe elevation they had not contributed by their ſuffrages, and came to be more apprehenſive of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The Electors, by their extenſive power, and the diſtinguiſhing privileges which they poſſeſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came formidable to the Emperors, with whom they were placed almoſt on a level in ſeveral acts of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus the introduction of the Electoral college into the Empire, and the authority which it acquired, inſtead of diminiſhing, contributed to ſtrengthen the principles of hoſtility and diſcord in the Germanick conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>THESE were further augmented by the various and repugnant forms of civil policy in the ſeveral States which compoſed the Germanick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.<note place="margin">From the different forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed in the ſtates which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Germanick body.</note> It is no eaſy matter to render the union of independant States perfect and entire, even when the genius and forms of their reſpective governments happen to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimilar. But in the German Empire, which was a confederacy of Princes, of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, and of free cities, it was impoſſible that they could incorporate thoroughly. The free-cities were ſmall republicks, in which the maxims and ſpirit
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:011837_0175_0F9D877BB1283E68"/>
peculiar to that ſpecies of government prevailed. The Princes and nobles to whom ſupreme juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, poſſeſſed a ſort of monarchical power within their own territories, and the forms of their interior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration nearly reſembled thoſe of the great feudal kingdoms. The intereſts, the ideas, the objects of States ſo differently conſtituted, cannot be the ſame. Nor could their common deliberations be carried on with the ſame ſpirit, while the love of liberty and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to commerce were the reigning principles in the cities; and ardour for military glory, together with the deſire of power, were the governing paſſions of the Princes and nobility.</p>
                  <p>THE ſecular and eccleſiaſtical members of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were as little fitted for union as the free cities and the nobility.<note place="margin">From the oppoſition between the ſecular and eccleſiaſtical members.</note> Vaſt territories were annexed to ſeveral of the German biſhopricks and abbeys, and the dignified eccleſiaſticks held ſome of the higheſt offices in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by hereditary right. The younger ſons of noblemen of the ſecond order, who had devoted themſelves to the church, were commonly promoted to theſe ſtations of eminence and power; and it was no ſmall mortification to the Princes and great nobility to ſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons raiſed from an inferior rank to the ſame level with themſelves, or even exalted to ſuperior dignity. The education of theſe churchmen, the genius of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and their connection with the court of Rome, rendered their character as well as intereſt different from thoſe of the other members of the Germanick body, with whom they were called to act in concert. Thus another ſource of jealouſy and variance was opened, which ought not to be overlooked when we are ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the nature of the German conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>TO all theſe cauſes of diſſention may be added one more,<note place="margin">From the unequal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of wealth and power among the members.</note> ariſing from the unequal diſtribution of power and wealth among the States of the Empire. The electors, and other nobles of the higheſt rank, not only poſſeſſed ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign juriſdiction, but governed ſuch exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, populous, and rich countries, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them great Princes. Many of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011837_0176_0F9D877C7191FCB8"/>
though they enjoyed all the rights of ſovereignty, ruled over ſuch petty domains, that their real power bore no proportion to this high prerogative. A well-compacted and vigorous confederacy could not be formed of ſuch diſſimilar ſtates. The weaker were jealous, timid, and unable, either to aſſert or to defend their juſt privileges. The more powerful were apt to aſſume and to become oppreſſive. The Electors and Emperors endeavoured by turns to extend their own authority, by encroaching on the rights of theſe feeble members of the Germanick body; and they, over-awed or corrupted, tamely gave up their privileges, or meanly favoured the deſigns formed againſt them <note n="[SS]" place="bottom">NOTE XLI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AFTER contemplating all theſe principles of diſunion and oppoſition in the conſtitution of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,<note place="margin">All theſe render the Germanick body incap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</note> it will be eaſy to account for the want of concord and uniformity, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in its councils and proceedings. That ſlow, dilatory, diſtruſtful and irreſolute ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which characterizes all its deliberations, will appear natural in a body, the junction of whoſe members was ſo incompleat, the different parts of which were held together by ſuch feeble ties, and ſet at variance by ſuch powerful motives. But the Empire of Germany, nevertheleſs, comprehended countries of ſuch vaſt extent, and was inhabited by ſuch a martial and hardy race of men, that when the abilities of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or zeal for any common cauſe, could rouſe this unwieldy body to put forth its ſtrength, it acted with ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible force. In the following hiſtory we ſhall find, that as the meaſures on which Charles V. was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, were often thwarted or rendered abortive by the ſpirit of jealouſy and diviſion peculiar to the Germanick conſtitution; ſo it was by the influence which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired over the Princes of the Empire, and by engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to co-operate with him, that he was enabled to make ſome of the greateſt efforts which diſtinguiſh his reign.</p>
                  <p>THE Turkiſh hiſtory is ſo blended, during the reign of Charles V. with that of the great nations in Europe,<note place="margin">View of the Turkiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> and the Ottoman Porte interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo often, and with ſuch deciſive influence,

in the wars and negociations of the Chriſtian Princes, that ſome previous account of the ſtate of government in that great empire, is no leſs neceſſary for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of my readers, than theſe views of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of other kingdoms which I have already exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to them.</p>
                  <p>IT has been the fate of the more ſouthern and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts of Aſia,<note place="margin">Its origin.</note> at different periods, to be conquered by that warlike and hardy race of men, who inhabit the vaſt country known to the ancients by the name of Scythia, and among the moderns by that of Tartary. One tribe of theſe people, called Turks or Turcomans, extended its conqueſts, under various leaders, and during ſeveral centuries, from the ſhore of the Caſpian to the ſtraits of the Dardanelles. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle of the fifteenth century, theſe formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable conquerors took Conſtantinople by ſtorm, and eſtabliſhed the ſeat of their government in that Imperial city. Greece, Moldavia, Walachia, and the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the ancient kingdoms of Thrace and Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, together with part of Hungary, were ſubjected to their power.</p>
                  <p>BUT though the ſeat of the Turkiſh government was fixed in Europe,<note place="margin">Its deſpotic genius.</note> and the Sultans obtained poſſeſſion of ſuch extenſive dominions in that quarter of the globe, the genius of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy was purely Aſiatick; and may be properly termed a deſpotiſm, in contradiſtinction to theſe monarchical and republican forms of government which we have been hitherto contemplating. The ſupreme power was veſted in Sultans of the Ottoman race, that blood being deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſacred, that no other was thought worthy of the throne. From this elevation, theſe ſovereigns could look down, and behold all their ſubjects reduced to the ſame level before them. The maxims of Turkiſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy admit not any of thoſe inſtitutions, which, in other countries, limit the exerciſe, or moderate the rigour of monarchical power. No great court with conſtitutional and permanent juriſdiction to interpoſe both in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actment and execution of laws. No body of hereditary nobles, whoſe ſenſe of their own pre-eminence, whoſe conſciouſneſs of what is due to their rank and character,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011837_0178_0F9D877DF37A5C28"/>
whoſe jealouſy of their privileges circumſcribe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prince, and ſerve not only as a barrier againſt the exceſſes of his caprice, but ſtand as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate order between him and the people. Under the Turkiſh government, the political condition of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject is equal. To be employed in the ſervice of the Sultan, is the only circumſtance that confers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. Even this diſtinction is annexed ſo cloſely to the ſtations in which perſons ſerve, that it is ſcarce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to thoſe who are placed in them. The higheſt dignity in the Empire does not give any rank or pre-eminence to the family of him who enjoys it. As every man, before he is raiſed to any ſtation of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt go through the preparatory diſcipline of a long and ſervile obedience <note n="o" place="bottom">State of the Turkiſh Empire by Rycaut, p 25.</note>, the moment he is deprived of power, he and his poſterity return to the ſame condition with other ſubjects, and ſink back into obſcurity. It is the diſtinguiſhing and odious characteriſtick of the Eaſtern deſpotiſm, that annihilates all other ranks of men, in order to exalt the monarch; that it leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the former, while it gives every thing to the latter; that it endeavours to fix in the minds of thoſe who are ſubject to it, the idea of no relation between men, but that of a maſter and of a ſlave, the former deſtined to command and to puniſh, the latter formed to tremble and to obey <note n="[TT]" place="bottom">NOTE XLII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT as there are circumſtances which frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or defeat the ſalutary effects of the beſt regulated governments,<note place="margin">Power of the Sultan limited by religion;</note> there are others which contribute to mitigate the evils of the moſt vicious forms of policy. There can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, be no conſtitutional reſtraints on the will of a Prince in a deſpotic government; but there may be ſuch as are accidental. Abſolute as the Turkiſh Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans are, they feel themſelves circumſcribed both by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the principle on which their authority is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="p" place="bottom">Rycaut, p. 8.</note>, and by the army, the inſtrument which they muſt employ in order to maintain it. Wherever religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes, the will of the Sovereign muſt ſubmit to its

decrees. When the Koran hath preſcribed any religious rite; hath enjoined any moral duty; or hath confirmed by its ſanction, any political maxim, the command of the Sultan cannot overturn that which an higher autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath eſtabliſhed. The chief reſtriction, however, on the will of the Sultans, is impoſed by the military power.<note place="margin">and by the military.</note> An armed force muſt ſurround the throne of every Deſpot, to maintain his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to execute his commands.

The <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culy,</hi> or ſoldiery of the Porte, was the only power in the Empire that a Sultan or his Viſier had reaſon to dread. To preſerve the fidelity and attachment of the Janizaries, was the great art of government, and the principal object of attention in the policy of the Ottoman court. Under a monarch, whoſe abilities and vigour of mind fit him for command, they are obſequious inſtruments; execute whatever he enjoins; and render his power irreſiſtible. Under feeble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſuch as are unfortunate, they become turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and mutinous; aſſume the tone of Maſters; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade and exalt Sultans at pleaſure; and teach thoſe to tremble, on whoſe nod, at other times, life or death depend.</p>

He divided his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions into ſeveral diſtricts; he appointed the number of ſoldiers which each ſhould furniſh; he appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain proportion of the lands in every province for their maintenance; he regulated, with a minute accuracy, every thing relative to their diſcipline, their arms, and the nature of their ſervice. He put the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Empire into an orderly train of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; and though the taxes in the Turkiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as well as in the other deſpotic monarchies of the Eaſt, are far from being conſiderable, he ſupplied that defect by an attentive and ſevere oeconomy.</p>

                     <p>THE barbarous nations were not only illiterate, but regarded literature with contempt. They found the inhabitants of all the provinces of the Empire ſunk in effeminacy, and averſe to war. Such a character was the object of ſcorn to an high-ſpirited and gallant race of men.

This degeneracy of manners, illiterate barbarians imputed to their love of learning. Even after they ſettled in the countries which they had conquered, they would not permit their children to be inſtructed in any ſcience; "for, (ſaid they,) inſtruction in the ſciences tends to corrupt, enervate, and depreſs the mind; and he who has been accuſtomed to tremble under the rod of a pedagogue, will never look on a ſword or ſpear with an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye."

                     <p>A REMARKABLE confirmation of both parts of this reaſoning occurs in the hiſtory of England. The Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons carried on the conqueſt of that country with the ſame deſtructive ſpirit, which diſtinguiſhed the other barbarous nations. The ancient inhabitants of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain were either exterminated; or forced to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among the mountains of Wales; or reduced into ſervitude. The Saxon government, laws, manners and language were of conſequence introduced into Britain? and were ſo perfectly eſtabliſhed, that all memory of the inſtitutions previous to their conqueſt was aboliſhed. The very reverſe of this happened in a ſubſequent revolution. A ſingle victory placed Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Norman on the throne of England. The Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inhabitants though oppreſſed, were not exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. William employed the utmoſt efforts of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and policy to make his new ſubjects conform in every thing to the Norman ſtandard; but without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Saxons, though vanquiſhed, were far more numerous than their conquerors; when they began to incorporate, their laws and manners gradually gained ground. The Norman inſtitutions were unpopular and odious; many of them fell into diſuſe; and in the Engliſh conſtitution and language, at this day, many eſſential parts are manifeſtly of Saxon, not of Norman extract.</p>

But as the change, which I have pointed out as a conſequence of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the barbarous nations in the countries for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſubject to the Roman Empire, could not have taken place, if the greater part of the ancient inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants had not been extirpated, an event of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and influence merits a more particular illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This will juſtify me for exhibiting ſome part of that melancholy ſpectacle, over which humanity prompted Procopius to draw a veil. I ſhall not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, diſguſt my readers by a long detail; but reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with collecting ſome inſtances of the devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by two of the many nations, which ſettled in the Empire. The Vandals were the firſt of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians who invaded Spain. It was one of the richeſt and moſt populous of the Roman Provinces; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants had been diſtinguiſhed for courage, and had defended their liberty againſt the arms of Rome, with greater obſtinacy, and during a longer courſe of years, than any nation in Europe. But ſo entirely were they enervated by their ſubjection to the Romans, that the Vandals who entered the kingdom A. D. 409. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the conqueſt of it with ſuch rapidity, that in the year 411, theſe barbarians divided it among them by caſting lots. The deſolation occaſioned by their invaſion is thus deſcribed by Idatius an eye witneſs. "The barbarians waſted every thing with hoſtile cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. The peſtilence was no leſs deſtructive. A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful famine raged, to ſuch a degree, that the living were conſtrained to feed on the dead bodies of their fellow citizens; and all theſe terrible plagues deſolated at once the unhappy kingdoms." Idatii Chron. ap. Biblioth. Patrum. vol. vii. p. 1233. edit. Lugd. 1677 The Goths having attacked the Vandals in their new ſettlements, a fierce war enſued; the country was plundered by both parties; the cities which at firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped were laid in aſhes, and the inhabitants expoſed to ſuffer every thing that the wanton cruelty of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians could inflict.

is given by Iſidorus Hiſpalenſis, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary writers. Iſid. Chron. ap. Grot. hiſt. Goth. 732. From Spain the Vandals paſſed over to Africa, A. D, 428. Africa was, next to Egypt, the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile of the Roman provinces. It was one of the grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Empire, and is called by an ancient writer, the ſoul of the commonwealth. Though the army with which they invaded it, did not exceed 30,000 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men they became abſolute maſters of the province in leſs than two years. A contemporary author gives a dreadful account of the havock which they made: "They found a province well cultivated, and enjoying plenty, the beauty of the whole earth. They carried their deſtructive arms into every corner of it; they diſpeopled it by their devaſtations; exterminating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing with fire and ſword. They did not even ſpare the vines, and fruit trees, that thoſe to whom caves and inacceſſible mountains had afforded a retreat, might find no nouriſhment of any kind. Their hoſtile rage could not be ſatiated, and there was no place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the effects of it. They tortured their priſoners with the moſt exquiſite cruelty, that they might force from them a diſcovery of their hidden treaſures. The more they diſcovered, the more they expected, and the more implacable they became. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the infirmities of age nor of ſex; neither the dignity of nobility, nor the ſanctity of the ſacerdotal office, could mitigate their fury; but the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous their priſoners were, the more barbarouſly they inſulted them. The publick buildings which reſiſted the violence of the flames, they levelled with the ground. They left many cities without an inhabitant. When they approached any fortified place, which their undiſciplined army could not reduce, they gathered together a multitude of priſoners, and putting them to the ſword, left their bodies unburied, that the ſtench of the carcaſſes might oblige the garriſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon it."

of the Vandals in Africa, Beliſarius attacked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed them. Procopius, a contemporary hiſtorian, deſcribes the devaſtation which that war occaſioned. "Africa, ſays he, was ſo entirely diſpeopled, that one might travel ſeveral days in it without meeting one man; and it is no exaggeration to ſay, that in the courſe of the war five millions of perſons periſhed." Proc. hiſt. Arcana cap. 18. ap. Byz. Script. vol. i. 315. I have dwelt longer upon the calamities of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, becauſe they are deſcribed not only by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary authors, but by eye-witneſſes. The preſent ſtate of Africa confirms their teſtimony. Many of the moſt flouriſhing and populous cities with which it was filled, were ſo entirely ruined, that no veſtiges remain to point out where they were ſituated. That fertile territory which ſuſtained the Roman Empire lies in a great meaſure uncultivated; and that province, which Victor in his barbarous Latin called <hi>Specioſitas totius ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae florentis,</hi> is now the retreat of pirates and banditti.</p>
                     <p>WHILE the Vandals laid waſte one part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Huns deſolated the reſt of it. Of all the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous tribes they were the fierceſt and moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Ammianus Marcellinus a contemporary author, and one of the beſt of the later hiſtorians, gives an account of their policy and manners. They nearly reſemble thoſe of the Scythians deſcribed by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and of the Tartars known to the moderns. In ſome parts of their character, and in ſeveral of their cuſtoms, they reſemble the ſavages in North America. Their paſſion for war and action was extreme. "As in poliſhed ſocieties (ſays Ammianus) eaſe and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are courted, they delight in war and dangers. He who falls in battle is reckoned happy. They who die of old age or of diſeaſe are deemed infamous. They boaſt, with the utmoſt exultation, of the number of enemies whom they have ſlain, and as the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all ornaments, they faſten the ſcalps of thoſe who have fallen by their hand to the trappings of their horſes."

barbarous rage, were aſtoniſhed at the cruelty of their devaſtations. Thrace, Pannonia, and Illyricum were the countries which they firſt laid deſolate. As they had no thoughts of ſettling in Europe, their inroads were frequent, and Procopius computes that in each of theſe, at a medium, two hundred thouſand perſons periſhed or were carried off as ſlaves. Procop. hiſt. Arcan. ap. Byz. ſcript. vol. i. 316. Thrace the beſt cultivated province in that quarter of the Empire, was converted into a deſart, and when Priſcus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the ambaſſadors ſent to Attila, there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in ſome of the cities, but a few miſerable people who had taken ſhelter among the ruins of the churches; and the fields were covered with the bones of thoſe who had fallen by the ſword. Priſcus ap. Byz. Script. vol. i. 34. Attila became King of the Huns, A. D. 434. He is one of the greateſt and moſt enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conquerors mentioned in hiſtory. He extended his Empire over all the vaſt countries, comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general names of Scythia and Germany in the ancient diviſion of the world. While he was carrying on his wars againſt the barbarous nations, he kept the Roman Empire under perpetual apprehenſions, and extorted vaſt ſubſidies from the timid and effeminate monarchs who governed it. In the year 451, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Gaul, at the head of an army compoſed of all the various nations which he had ſubdued. It was more numerous than any with which the barbarians had hitherto invaded the Empire. The devaſtations which he commited were horrible; not only the open country, but the moſt flouriſhing cities were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated. The extent and cruelty of his devaſtations are deſcribed by Salvianus de Gubernat. Dei. edit. Baluz. Par. 1669. p. 139, &amp;c. and by Idatius ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra p. 1235.

Italy ſuffered by the Huns exceeded all the calamities which the preceding incurſions of the barbarians had brought upon it. Conringius has collected ſeveral paſſag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the ancient hiſtorians, which prove that the devaſtations committed by the Vandals and Huns in the countries ſituated on the banks of the Rhine, were no leſs cruel and fatal to the human race.

But it is endleſs, it is ſhocking to follow theſe deſtroyers of mankind through ſo many ſcenes of horror, and to contemplate the havock which they made of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>BUT the ſtate in which Italy appears to have been, during ſeveral ages, after the barbarous nations ſettled in it, is the moſt deciſive proof of the cruelty as well as extent of their devaſtations. Whenever any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is thinly inhabited, trees and ſhrubs ſpring up in the uncultivated fields, and ſpreading by degrees form large foreſts; by the overflowing of rivers, and the ſtagnating of waters, other parts of it are converted into lakes and marſhes. Ancient Italy, the ſeat of the Roman elegance and luxury, was cultivated to the higheſt pitch. But ſo effectually did the devaſtations of the barbarians deſtroy all the effects of their induſtry and cultivation, that in the eight century Italy appears to have been covered with foreſts and marſhes of vaſt extent. Muratori enters into a long detail concerning the ſituation and limits of theſe; and proves by the moſt authentick evidence, that great tracts of territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in all the different provinces of Italy, were either overrun with, wood, or laid under water. Nor did theſe occupy parts of the country naturally barren or of little value, but were ſpread over diſtricts, which ancient writers repreſent as extremely fertile, and which at preſent are highly cultivated. Muratori an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitates Italicae medii aevi diſſert. xxi. v. ii. p. 149, 153, &amp;c. A ſtrong proof of this occurs in a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the city of Modena, by an author of the tenth century. Murat. ſcript. Rerum Italic. vol. ii. pars. ii. p. 691. The ſtate of deſolation in other countries of Europe ſeems to have been the ſame. In many of the moſt early charters now extant, the lands granted to

monaſteries or to private perſons, are diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as are cultivated or inhabited, and ſuch as were <hi>eremi,</hi> deſolate. In many inſtances, lands are granted to perſons becauſe they had taken them from the deſert, <hi>ab eremo,</hi> and had cultivated and planted them with inhabitants. This appears from a charter of Charlemagne, publiſhed by Eckhart de rebus Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae Orientalis. vol. ii. p. 864, and from many charters of his ſucceſſors quoted by Du Cange voc, <hi>Eremus.</hi>

                     <p>MURATORI adds, that during the eighth and ninth centuries, Italy was greatly infeſted by wolves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wild beaſts; another mark of its being deſtitute of inhabitants. Murat. Antiq. vol. ii. p. 163. Thus Italy, the pride of the ancient world for its fertility and cultivation, was reduced to the ſtate of a country new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peopled, and rendered habitable.</p>
                     <p>I AM ſenſible, not only that ſome of the deſcriptions of the devaſtations which I have quoted, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated, but that the barbarous tribes proceeded in different manners, in making their new ſettlements. Some of them ſeemed to be bent on exterminating the ancient inhabitants; others were more diſpoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate with them. It is not my province either to enquire into the cauſes which occaſioned this variety in the conduct of the conquerors, or to deſcribe the ſtate of thoſe countries where the ancient inhabitants were treated moſt mildly. The facts which I have produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are ſufficient to prove that the deſtruction of the human ſpecies, occaſioned by their hoſtile invaſions of the nothern nations, and their ſubſequent ſettlements, was much greater than the generality of writers ſeem to imagine.</p>

perhaps, that ever wrote, of obſerving them with profound diſcernment, and of deſcribing them with propriety and force. The reader muſt perceive that I have Caeſar and Tacitus in my eye. The former gives a ſhort account of the ancient Germans in a few chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſixth book of his commentaries: The latter wrote a treatiſe expreſsly on that ſubject. Theſe are the moſt precious and inſtructive monuments of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to the preſent inhabitants of Europe. From them we learn,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. THAT the ſtate of Society among the ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, was of the rudeſt and moſt ſimple form. They ſubſiſted entirely by hunting or by paſturage. Caeſ. lib. vi. c. 21. They neglected agriculture, and lived chiefly on milk, cheeſe, and fleſh. Ibid. c. 22. Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus agrees with him in moſt of theſe points; de morib. Germ. c. 14, 15, 23. The Goths were equally negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of agriculture. Priſ. Rhet. ap. Byz. Script. v. i. p. 31. B. Society was in the ſame ſtate among the Huns, who diſdained to cultivate the earth, or to touch a plough, Amm. Marcel. lib. xxxi. p. 475. The ſame manners took place among the Alans; ibid. p. 477. While ſociety remains in this ſimple ſtate, men by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together ſcarce relinquiſh any portion of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural independance, Accordinly we are informed, 2. That the authority of civil goverment was extremely limited among the Germans. During times of peace they had no common or fixed magiſtrate, but the chief men of every diſtrict diſpenſed juſtice, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated differences. Caeſ. ibid. c. 23. Their kings had not abſolute or unbounded power; their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſted rather in the privilege of adviſing, than in the power of commanding. Matters of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence were determined by the chief men; affairs of importance by the whole community. Tacit. c. 7., 11. The Huns, in like manner, deliberated in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every buſineſs of moment to the ſociety; and were not ſubject to the rigour of regal authority. Amm. Marcel. lib. xxxi. p. 474. 3. Every individual among the ancient Germans was left at liberty to chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would take part in any military enterprize which was propoſed; there ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ems to have been no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011837_0193_0F9D878931B8D9F0"/>
to engage in it impoſed on him by publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. "When any of the chief men propoſes any expedition, ſuch as approve of the cauſe and of the leader riſe up, and declare their intention of following him; and thoſe who do not fulfil this engagement, are conſidered as deſerters and traitors, and are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as infamous." Caeſ. ibid. c. 23. Tacitus plainly points at the ſame cuſtom, though in terms more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. Tacit. c. 11. 4. As every individual was ſo independant, and maſter in ſo great a degree of his own actions, it became, of conſequence, the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of every perſon among the Germans who aimed at being a leader, to gain adherents, and attach them to his perſon and intereſt. Theſe adherents Caeſar calls <hi>Ambacti</hi> and <hi>Clientes,</hi> i. e. retainers or clients; Tacitus, <hi>Comites,</hi> or companions. The chief diſtinction and power of the leaders, conſiſted in being attended by a numerous band of choſen youth. This was their pride as well as ornament during peace, and their defence in war. The favour of theſe retainers the leaders gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or preſerved by preſents of armour, and of horſes; or by the profuſe, though inelegant hoſpitality, with which they entertained them. Tacit. c. 14, 15. 5. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other conſequence of the perſonal liberty and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which the Germans retained, even after they united in ſociety, was their circumſcribing the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal juriſdiction of the magiſtrate within very narrow limits, and their not only claiming but exerciſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the rights of private reſentment and revenge. Their magiſtrates had not the power either of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, or of inflicting any corporal puniſhment on a free man. Tacit. c. 7. Every perſon was obliged to avenge the wrongs which his parents or friends had ſuſtained. Their enmities were hereditary, but not irreconcileable. Even murder was compenſated by paying a certain number of cattle. Tac. c. 21. A part of the fine went to the King, or ſtate, a part to the perſon who had been injured, or to his kindred. Ibid. c. 12.</p>
                     <p>THESE particulars concerning the inſtitutions and manners of the Germans, though well known to every perſon converſant in ancient literature I have thought,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011837_0194_0F9D8789F5477B08"/>
proper to arrange in this order, and to lay before ſuch of my readers as may be leſs acquainted with theſe facts, both becauſe they confirm the account which I have given of the ſtate of the barbarous nations, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd to illuſtrate all the obſervations that I ſhall have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make concerning the various changes in their government and cuſtoms. The laws and cuſtoms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the barbarous nations into their new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, are the beſt commentary on the writings of Caeſar and Tacitus; and their obſervations are the beſt key to a perfect knowledge of theſe laws and cuſtoms.</p>
                     <p>ONE circumſtance with reſpect to the teſtimonies of Caeſar and Tacitus concerning the Germans, merits at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Caeſar wrote his brief account of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more than an hundred years before Tacitus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his treatiſe de moribus Germanorum. An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years make a conſiderable period in the progreſs of national manners, eſpecially if, during that time, thoſe people who are rude and unpoliſhed have had much communication with more civilized ſtates. This was the caſe with the Germans. Their intercourſe with the Romans began when Caeſar croſſed the Rhine, and increaſed prodigiouſly during the interval between that event and the time when Tacitus flouriſhed. Beſides this, there was a conſiderable difference between the ſtate of ſociety among the different tribes of Germans. The Suiones were ſo much improved, that they began to be corrupted. Tac. cap. 44. The Fenni were ſo barbarous, that it is wonderful how they were able to ſubſiſt. Ibid. cap. 46. Whoever undertakes to deſcribe the manners of the Germans, or to found any politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal theory upon the ſtate of ſociety among them, ought carefully to attend to both theſe circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE I quit this ſubject, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to obſerve, that though ſucceſſive alterations in their inſtitutions, together with the gradual progreſs of refinement, have made an entire change in the manners of the various people, who conquered the Roman Empire, there is ſtill one race of men nearly in the ſame political ſituation with that in which they were when they firſt ſettled in their new conqueſts: I mean the various tribes and nations of Savages in
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011837_0195_0F9D878AB1536930"/>
North-America. It cannot then be conſidered either as a digreſſion, or as an improper indulgence of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to enquire, whether this ſimilarity in their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtate has occaſioned any reſemblance between their character and manners. If the likeneſs turns out to be ſtriking, it is a ſtronger proof, that a juſt account has been given of the ancient inhabitants of Europe, than the teſtimony even of Caeſar or of Tacitus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Americans ſubſiſt chiefly by hunting and fiſhing. Some tribes neglect agriculture entirely. Among thoſe who cultivate ſome ſmall ſpot near their huts, that, together with all works of labour, is performed by the women. P. Charlevoix Journal Hiſtorique d'un Voyage de L'Amerique 49. Par. 1744. p. 334. In ſuch a ſtate of ſociety, the common wants of men being few, and their mutual dependence upon each other ſmall, their union is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely imperfect and feeble, and they continue to enjoy their natural liberty almoſt unimpaired. It is the firſt idea of an American, that every man is born free and independent, and that no power on earth hath any right to diminiſh or circumſcribe his natural liberty. There is ſcarce any appearance of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either in civil or domeſtic government. Every one does what he pleaſes. A father and mother with their children, live like perſons whom chance has brought together, and whom no common bond unites, Their manner of educating their children is ſuitable to this principle. They never chaſtiſe or puniſh them, even during their infancy. As they advance in years, they allow them to be entirely maſters of their own actions, and reſponſable to no body. Id. p. 272, 273—2. The power of their civil magiſtrates is extremely limited. Among moſt of their tribes, the Sachem or chief is elective. A council of old men is choſen to aſſiſt him, without whoſe advice he determines no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of importance. The Sachems neither poſſeſs nor claim any great degree of authority. They propoſe and intreat rather than command, The obedience of their people is altogether voluntary. Id. p. 266, 268—3. They engage in any military enterprizes, not from conſtraint, but choice. When war is reſolved a chief
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:011837_0196_0F9D87CCBA4FF698"/>
ariſes, and offers himſelf to be the leader. They who are willing (for they compel no perſon) ſtand up one after another, and ſing their war ſong. But if after this, any of theſe ſhould refuſe to follow the leader, to whom they have engaged, his life would be in danger, and he would be conſidered as the moſt infamous of all men. Id. p. 217, 218.—4. Such as engage to follow any leader, expect to be treated by him with great attention and reſpect; and he is obliged to make them preſents of conſiderable value. Id. p. 218.—5. Among the Americans, the magiſtrate has ſcarce any criminal juriſdiction. Id. p. 272. Upon receiving any injury, the perſon or family offended may inflict what puniſhment they pleaſe on the perſon who was the author of it. Id. p. 274. Their reſentment and deſire of vengeance are exceſſive and implacable. Time can neither extinguiſh or abate it. It is the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance parents leave to their children; it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from generation to generation, until an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be found of ſatisfying it. Id. p. 309. Sometimes, however, the offended party is appeaſed, A compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is paid for a murder that has been committed. The relations of the deceaſed receive it; and it conſiſts moſt commonly of a captive taken in war, who being ſubſtituted in the place of the perſon who was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aſſumes his name and is adopted into his family. Id. p. 274. The reſemblance holds in many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. It is ſufficient for my purpoſe to have point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the ſimilarity of thoſe great features which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and characterize both people. Bochart, and other philologiſts of the laſt century, who, with more erudition than ſcience, endeavoured to trace the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations of various nations, and who were apt, upon the ſlighteſt appearance of reſemblance, to find an affinity between nations far removed from each other, and to conclude that they were deſcended from the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, would hardly have failed, on viewing ſuch an amazing ſimilarity, to pronounce with confidence "That the Germans and the Americans muſt be the, ſame people" But a philoſoper will ſatisfy himſelf with obſerving, "That the characters of nations depends on the ſtate of ſociety in which they live, and on the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011837_0197_0F9D864FF21EA870"/>
political inſtitutions eſtabliſhed among them; and that the human mind, whenever it is placed in the ſame ſituation, will, in ages the moſt diſtant, and in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the moſt remote, aſſume the ſame form, and be diſtinguiſhed by the ſame manners.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE puſhed the compariſon between the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Americans no farther than was neceſſary for the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſtration of my ſubject. I do not pretend that the ſtate of ſociety in the two countries was perfectly ſimilar. Many of the German tribes were more civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized than the Americans. Some of them were not unacquainted with agriculture; almoſt all of them had flocks of tame cattle, and depended for the chief part of their ſubſiſtance upon theſe. Moſt of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican tribes ſubſiſt by hunting, and are in a ruder and more ſimple ſtate than the ancient Germans. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, however, between their condition is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perhaps than any that we know between two races of men, and this has produced a ſurprizing ſimilarity of manners.</p>

                     <p>THE booty gained by an army belonged to an army. The King himſelf had no part of it but what he acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by lot. A remarkable inſtance of this occurs in the hiſtory of the Franks, the army of Clovis, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the French monarchy, having plundered a church, carried off, among other ſacred utenſils, a vaſe of extraordinary ſize and beauty. The biſhop ſent deputies to Clovis, beſeeching him to reſtore the vaſe, that it might be again employed in the ſacred ſervices to which it had been conſecrated. Clovis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the deputies to follow him to Soiſſons, as their booty was to be divided in that place, and promiſed that if the lot ſhould give him the diſpoſal of the vaſe, he would grant what the biſhop deſired. When he came to Soiſſons, and all the booty was placed in one great heap in the middle of the army, Clovis intreated, that before making the diviſion, they would give him that vaſe over and above his ſhare. All appeared willing to gratify the King, and to comply with his requeſt,

when a fierce and haughty ſoldier lifted up his battle-axe, and ſtriking the vaſe with the utmoſt violence, cried out with a loud voice, "You ſhall receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here but that to which the lot gives you a right."

                     <p>THE hiſtory of the eſtabliſhment and progreſs of the feudal ſyſtem, is an intereſting object to all the nations of Europe. In ſome countries their juriſprudence and laws are ſtill in a great meaſure feudal. In others, many forms and practices eſtabliſhed by cuſtom, or founded on ſtatutes, took their riſe from the feudal law, and cannot be underſtood without attending to the ideas peculiar to it. Several authors of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reputation for genius and erudition, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to illuſtrate this ſubject, but they have left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of it obſcure. I ſhall endeavour to trace, with preciſion, the progreſs and variation of ideas concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property in land among the barbarous nations; and ſhall attempt to point out the cauſes which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe changes, as well as the effects which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon them. Property in land ſeems to have gone through four ſucceſſive changes among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who ſettled in the various provinces of the Roman Empire.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. WHILE the barbarous nations remained in their original countries, they had no fixed property in land, and no certain limits to their poſſeſſions. After feeding their flocks in one diſtrict, they removed with them, their wives and families, to another; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned that likewiſe in a ſhort time. They were not, in conſequence of this imperfect ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, brought under any poſitive or formal obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſerve the community; all their ſervices were purely voluntary. Every individual was at liberty to chuſe how far he would contribute towards carrying on any military enterprize. If he followed a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in any expedition, it was from attachment, not from a ſenſe of obligation. The cleareſt proof of this
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011837_0199_0F9D86513161DC68"/>
has been produced in note VI. While property continued in this ſtate, we can diſcover nothing that bears any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to a feudal tenure, or to the ſubordination and military ſervice which the feudal ſyſtem introduced.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. UPON ſettling in the countries which they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the victorious army divided the conquered lands. That portion which fell to every ſoldier, he ſeized as a recompence due to his valour, as a ſettlement acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own ſword. He took poſſeſſion of it as a freeman in full property. He enjoyed it during his own life, and could diſpoſe of it at pleaſure, or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as an inheritance to his children. Thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in land became fixed. It was at the ſame time <hi>allodial,</hi> i. e. the poſſeſſor had the entire right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and dominion; he held of no ſovereign or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior lord, to whom he was bound to do homage, and perform ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as theſe new proprietors were in ſome danger (as has been obſerved in the text) of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed by the remainder of the ancient inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and in ſtill greater danger of being attacked by barbarians as fierce and rapacious as themſelves, they ſaw the neceſſity of coming under obligations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the community, more explicit than thoſe to which they had been ſubject in their original habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. On this account, immediately upon their fixing in their new ſettlements, every freeman became bound to take arms in defence of the community, and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed or neglected ſo to do, was liable to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble penalty. I do not mean that any contract of this kind was formally concluded, or mutually ratified by any legal ſolemnity. It was, like the other compacts which hold ſociety together, eſtabliſhed by tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and their mutual ſecurity and preſervation made it the intereſt of all to recognize its authority, and to enforce the obſervation of it. We can trace back this new obligation on the proprietors of land to a very early period in the hiſtory of the Franks. Chilperic, who began his reign A. D. 562, exacted a fine, <hi>bannos juſſet exigi,</hi> from certain perſons who had refuſed to accompany him in an expedition. Gregor. Turon. lib. v. c. 26. p. 211. Childibert, who began his reign A.

Charlemagne ordained, that every freeman who poſſeſſed ſive manſi, i. e. ſixty acres of land, <hi>in property,</hi> ſhould march in perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy. Capitul. A. D. 807. Louis le Debonnaire, A. D. 815, granted lands to certain Spaniards who fled from the Saracens, and allowed them to ſettle in his territories, on condition that they ſhould ſerve in the army <hi>like other free men.</hi> Capitul. vol. i. p. 500. By land poſſeſſed <hi>in property,</hi> which is mentioned in the law of Charlemagne, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, according to the ſtile of that age, allodial land; <hi>allodes</hi> and <hi>proprietas, alodum</hi> and <hi>proprium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words perfectly ſynonimous. Du Cange voce Alodis. The cleareſt proof of the diſtinction between allodial and beneficiary poſſeſſion, is contained in two charters publiſhed by Muratori, by which it appears that a perſon might poſſeſs one part of his eſtate as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodial which he could diſpoſe of at pleaſure, the other as a beneficium, of which he had only the uſufruct, the property returning to the ſuperior lord on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

Capitul. lib. i. §. 114.

Capit. Car. magn. ap. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 14 §. 13. p. 539. This expreſſion, according to the law of the Franks, ſeems to imply that both the obligation to ſerve, and the penalty on thoſe who diſregarded it, were coeval with the laws made by the Franks at their firſt ſettlement in Gaul. This fine was levied with ſuch rigour, "That if any perſon was inſolvent, he was reduced to ſervitude, and continued in that ſtate until ſuch time as his labour ſhould amount to the value of the <hi>herebannum.</hi>" Ibid. The Emperor Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius rendered the penalty ſtill more ſevere; and if any perſon poſſeſſing ſuch an extent of property as made it incumbent on him to take the field in perſon refuſed to obey the ſummons, all his goods were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be forfeited, and he himſelf might be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with baniſhment.

                     <p n="3">III. PROPERTY in land having thus become fixed and ſubject to military ſervice, another change was introduced, though ſlowly, and ſtep by ſtep. We learn from Tacitus that the chief men among the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans endeavoured to attach to their perſons and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts certain adherents, whom he calls <hi>Comites.</hi> Theſe fought under their ſtandard, and followed them in all their enterprizes.

The compoſition, which is the ſtandard by which we muſt judge of the rank and condition of perſons in the middle ages, paid for the murder of one <hi>in truſte Dominica,</hi> was triple to that paid for the murder of a freeman. Leg. Salicor. Tit. 44. §. 1. &amp; 2. While the Germans remained in their own country they courted the favour of theſe Comites by preſents of arms and horſes, and by hoſpitality. See note VI. While they had no fixed property in

                        </gap>ed. But upon their ſettling in the countries which they conquered, and when the value of property came to be underſtood among them, inſtead of theſe ſlight preſents, the Kings and chieftains beſtowed a more ſubſtantial recompence in land on their adherents. Theſe grants were called <hi>beneficia,</hi> becauſe they were gratuitous donations; and <hi>honores,</hi> becauſe they were regarded as marks of diſtinction. What were the ſervices originally exacted in return for theſe <hi>beneficia</hi> cannot be determined with abſolute preciſion; becauſe there are no records ſo ancient. When allodial poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were firſt rendered feudal, they were not, at once, ſubjected to the feudal ſervices. The tranſition here, as in all other changes of importance, was gradual. As the great object of a feudal vaſſal was to obtain protection, when allodial proprietors firſt conſented to become vaſſals of any powerful leader, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to retain as much of their ancient independance as was conſiſtent with that new relation. The homage which they did to the ſuperior of whom they choſe to hold, was called <hi>homagium planum,</hi> and bound them to nothing more than fidelity, but without any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation either of military ſervice, or attendance in the courts of their ſuperior. Of this <hi>homagium planum</hi> ſome traces, though obſcure, may ſtill be diſcovered. Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, tom. i. p. 97. Among the ancient writs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by D. D. De Vic &amp; Vaiſette hiſt. de Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued. are a great many which they call homagia. They ſeem to be an intermediate ſtep between the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magium planum mentioned by Bruſſel, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to perform compleat feudal ſervice. The one party promiſes protection, and grants certain caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or lands, the other engages to defend the perſon of the granter, and to aſſiſt him likewiſe in defending his property as often as he ſhall be ſummoned to do ſo. But theſe engagements are accompanied with none of the feudal formalities, and no mention is made of any of the feudal ſervices. They appear ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a mutual contract between equals, than the engagement of a vaſſal to perform ſervices to a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or

M. de Monteſquieu conſiders theſe <hi>beneficia</hi> as fiefs, which originally ſubjected thoſe who held them to military ſervice. L'eſpr. des Loix. l. xxx. c. 3. &amp; 16. M.

But upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their proofs and reaſonings and conjectures, it ſeems to be evident, that as every free man, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his allodial property, was bound to ſerve the community under a ſevere penalty, no good reaſon can be aſſigned for conferring theſe beneficia, if they did not ſubject ſuch as received them, to ſome new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. Why ſhould a King have ſtripped himſelf of his domain, if he had not expected, that, by parcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it out, he might acquire a right to ſervices to which he had formerly no title? We may then warrantably conclude, "That as allodial property ſubjected thoſe who poſſeſſed it to ſerve the community, ſo <hi>beneficia</hi> ſubjected ſuch as held them, to perſonal ſervice and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to him from whom they received theſe lands. Theſe beneficia were granted originally only during pleaſure. No circumſtance relating to the cuſtoms of the middle ages is better aſcertained than this; and innumerable proofs of it might be added to theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in L'eſprit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 16. and by Du Cange voc. <hi>beneficium &amp; feudum.</hi>

A precarious tenure during pleaſure was not ſufficient to ſatisfy and attach thoſe who held it to their ſuperior Lord, they ſoon obtained the confirmation of their benefices during life. Feudor. lib. tit. i. Du Cange produces ſeveral quotations from ancient charters and chronicles in proof of this; Gloſs. voc. <hi>Beneficium.</hi> After this it was eaſy to obtain or extort charters rendering beneficia hereditary, firſt in the direct line, then in the collateral, and at laſt in the female line.

Mably conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with ſome probability, that Charles Martel firſt introduced the practice of granting beneficia for life: Obſervat. tom. i. p. 103, 160; and that Louis le De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnaire was among the firſt who rendered them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, is evident from the authorities to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; Id. 429. Mabillon however has publiſhed a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum of Louis le Debonnaire, A. D. 860. by which it appears that he ſtill continued to grant ſome benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia only during life. De re Diplomatica, lib. vi. p. 353. In the year 889, Odo King of France granted lands to Ricabodo fideli ſuo jure beneficiario &amp; fructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ario during his own life; and if he ſhould die, and a ſon were born to him, that right was to continue dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life of his ſon. Mabillon ut ſupra. p. 556. This was an intermediate ſtep between fiefs merely during life, and fiefs hereditary to perpetuity. While benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia continued under their firſt form, and were held on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during pleaſure, he who granted them not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed the <hi>Dominium</hi> or prerogative of ſuperior Lord; but he retained the property, giving his vaſſal only the <hi>uſufruct.</hi> But under the latter form, when they became hereditary, although feudal lawyers continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to define a beneficium agreeable to its original na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the property was in effect taken out of the hands of the ſuperior Lord, and lodged in thoſe of the vaſſal. As ſoon as the reciprocal advantages of the feudal mode of tenure came to be underſtood by ſuperiors as well as vaſſals, that ſpecies of holding became ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to both, that not only lands, but caſual rents, ſuch as the profits of a toll, the fare paid at ferries, &amp;c. the ſalaries or perquiſites of offices, and even penſions themſelves, were granted and held as fiefs; and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſervice was promiſed and exacted on account of theſe. Morice Mem. pour ſervir de preuves a l'hiſt. de Bretagne. tom. ii. p. 78, 690. Bruſſel, tom. i. p. 41. How abſurd ſoever it may ſeem to grant or to hold ſuch precarious and caſual property as a fief; there are inſtances of feudal tenures ſtill more ſingular. The profits ariſing from the maſſes ſaid at an altar were properly an eccleſiaſtical revenue, belonging to the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:011837_0205_0F9D865671E210B8"/>
clergy of the church or monaſtery which performed that duty, but theſe were ſometimes ſeized by the powerful barons. In order to aſcertain their right to them, they held them as fiefs of the church, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled them out in the ſame manner as other property to their ſub-vaſſals. Bouquet. recueil des hiſt. vol. x. p. 238, 480. The ſame ſpirit of encroachment which rendered fiefs hereditary, led the nobles to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from their ſovereigns hereditary grants of offices. Many of the great offices of the crown became heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in moſt of the kingdoms in Europe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious were monarchs of this ſpirit of uſurpation among the nobility, and ſo ſolicitous to guard againſt it, that, on ſome occaſions, they obliged the perſons whom they promoted to any office of dignity, to grant an obligation that neither they, nor their heirs, ſhould claim it as belonging to them by hereditary right. A remarkable inſtance of this is produced, Mem. de l'Acad. des Inſcript. tom. xxx. p. 595. Another occurs in the Theſaur. annecdot. publiſhed by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene &amp; Durand, vol. i. p. 873.—This revolution in property occaſioned a change correſponding to it in political government; the great vaſſals of the crown, as they acquired ſuch extenſive poſſeſſions, uſurped a a proportional degree of power, depreſſed the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the crown, and trampled on the privileges of the people. It is on account of this connection, that the tracing the progreſs of feudal property becomes an object of attention in hiſtory; for upon diſcovering in what ſtate property was at any particular period, we may determine with preciſion what was the degree of power poſſeſſed by the King or by the nobility at that juncture.</p>
                     <p>ONE circumſtance more, with reſpect to the changes which property underwent, deſerves attention. I have ſhewn that when the various tribes of barbarians divided their conqueſts in the fifth and ſixth centuries, the property which they acquired was allodial; but in ſeveral parts of Europe property had become almoſt entirely feudal by the beginning of tenth century. The former ſpecies of property ſeems to be ſo much better and more deſirable than the latter, that ſuch a
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:011837_0206_0F9D8657380F9FA0"/>
change appears ſurpriſing, eſpecially when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that allodial property was frequently convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into feudal, by a voluntary deed of the poſſeſſor. The motives which determined them to a choice ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the ideas of modern times concerning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, have been inveſtigated and explained by M. de Monteſquieu with his uſual diſcernment and accuracy, lib. xxx. c. 8. The moſt conſiderable is that of which we have an hint in Lambertus Ardenſis, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer quoted by Du Cange, voce <hi>Alodis.</hi> In thoſe times of anarchy and diſorder which became ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in Europe after the death of Charlemagne; when there was ſcarce any union among the different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community; and individuals were expoſed, ſingle and undefended by government, to rapine and oppreſſion, it became neceſſary for every man to have a powerful protector; under whoſe banner he might range himſelf, and obtain ſecurity againſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whom he could not ſingly oppoſe. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he relinquiſhed his allodial independance, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected himſelf to the feudal ſervices, that he might find ſafety under the patronage of ſome reſpectable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior. In ſome parts of Europe, this change from allodial to feudal property became ſo general, that he who poſſeſſed land had no longer any liberty of choice left. He was obliged to recognize ſome liege Lord, and to hold of him. Thus Beaumanoir informs us, that in the counties of Clermont and Beauvois, if the Lord or Count diſcovered any lands within his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for which no ſervice was performed, and which paid to him no tax or cuſtom, he might inſtantly ſeize it as his own; for, ſays he, according to our cuſtom no man can hold allodial property. Couſt. ch. 24. p. 123. Upon the ſame principle is founded a maxim, which has at length become general in the law of France, <hi>Nulle terre ſans Seigneur.</hi> In other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of France allodial property ſeems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained longer unalienated, and to have been more highly valued. A vaſt number of charters containing grants, or ſales, or exchanges of allodial lands in the province of Languedoc are publiſhed Hiſt. gener. de Langued. par D. D. De Vic &amp; Vaiſette, tom. ii.

During the ninth, tenth, and greater part of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century, the property in that province ſeems to have been entirely allodial; and ſcarce any mention of feudal tenures occurs in the deeds of that country. The ſtate of property, during theſe centuries, ſeems to have been perfectly ſimilar in Catalonia, and the country of Rouſſillon, as appears from the original charters publiſhed in the appendix to Petr. de la Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's treatiſe de Marca ſive limite Hiſpanico. Allodial property ſeems to have continued in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to a period ſtill later. During the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, this ſpecies appears to have been of conſiderable extent. Mirae opera Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plom. vol. i. p. 34, 74, 75, 83, 296, 817, 842, 847, 578. Some veſtiges of allodial property appear there as late as the fourteenth century. Ibid. 218. The notions of men with reſpect to property, vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of their underſtandings, and the caprice of their paſſions. At the ſame time that ſome perſons were fond of relinquiſhing allodial property, in order to hold it by feudal tenure, others ſeem to have been ſolicitous to convert their fiefs into allodial property. An inſtance of this occurs in a charter of Louis le Debonnaire, publiſhed by Eckhard, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarii de rebus Franciae Orientalis, vol. ii. p. 885. Another occurs in the year 1299. Reliquiae MSS. om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aevi, by Ludwig, vol. i. p. 209. and even one as late as the year 1337. ibid. vol. vii. p. 40.

                     <p>IN tracing theſe various revolutions of property, I have hitherto chiefly confined myſelf to what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in France, becauſe the ancient monuments of that nation have either been more carefully preſerved, or have been more clearly illuſtrated than thoſe of any people in Europe.</p>
                     <p>IN Italy, the ſame revolutions happened in property, and ſucceeded each other in the ſame order. There is ſome ground, however, for conjecturing that allodial property continued longer in eſtimation among the Italians, than among the French. It appears that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the charters granted by the Emperors in the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:011837_0208_0F9D8658B14DEAF0"/>
ninth century conveyed an allodial right to land. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. antiq. med. aevi. v. i. p. 575, &amp;c. But in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century, we find ſome examples of perſons who reſigned their allodial property, and received it back as a feudal tenure. Ib. p. 610, &amp;c. Muratori obſerves that the word <hi>feudum,</hi> which came to be ſubſtituted in place of <hi>beneficium,</hi> does not occur in any authentic charter previous to the eleventh century. Id. 594. A charter of King Robert of France, A. D. 1008, is the earlieſt deed in which I have met with the word <hi>feudum.</hi> Bouquet recueil des hiſtoriens de Gaule &amp; de la France, tom. x. p. 593. b. This word occurs indeed in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, A. D. 790, publiſhed by Bruſſel, vol. i. p. 77. But the authenticity of that deed has been called in queſtion, and perhaps the frequent uſe of the word <hi>feudum</hi> in it, is an additional reaſon for doing ſo. The account which I have given of the nature both of allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and feudal poſſeſſions receives ſome confirmation from the etymology of the words themſelves. <hi>Alode</hi> or <hi>allodium</hi> is compounded of the German particle <hi>an</hi> and <hi>lot, i. e.</hi> land obtained by lot.

                     <p>THE progreſs of the feudal ſyſtem among the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans was perfectly ſimiliar to that which we have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in France. But as the Emperors of Germany, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after the Imperial crown paſſed from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of Charlemagne to the houſe of Saxony, were far ſuperior to the contemporary Monarchs of France, in abilities, the Imperial vaſſals did not aſpire ſo early to independance, nor did they ſo ſoon obtain the privilege of poſſeſſing their benefices by heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right. Conrad II. on the Salic, was the firſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, according to the compilers of the Libri Feudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, who rendered fiefs hereditary. Lib. i. tit. i.

under whoſe reign, grants of hereditary fiefs were frequent in France, ſucceeded his father, A. D. 814. Not only was this innovation ſo much later in being introduced among the vaſſals of the German Emperors but even after Conrad had eſtabliſhed it, the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued favourable to the ancient practice, and unleſs the charter of the vaſſal bore expreſly that the fief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to his heirs, it was preſumed to be granted only during life. Lib. feud. ibid. Even after the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration made by Conrad, it was not uncommon in Germany to grant fiefs only for life; a charter of this kind occurs as late as the year 1376. Charta ap.

Boeh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. ibid. p. 365. In Germany, as well as in France and Italy, a conſiderable part of the lands continued to be allodial long after the feudal mode of tenure was introduced.

The wretched condition of this numerous race of men will appear from ſeveral circumſtances. 1. Their maſters had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion over their perſons. They had the power of puniſhing their ſlaves capitally, without the intervention of any judge. This dangerous right they poſſeſſed not only in the more early periods, when their manners were fierce, but it continued as late as the twelfth century. Joach. Potgieſſerus de ſtatu ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorum. Lemgov. 1736. 4to. lib. ii. cap. i. §. 4, 10, 13, 24. Even after this juriſdiction of maſters came to be reſtrained, the life of a ſlave was deemed to be of ſo little value, that a very ſlight compenſation attoned for taking it away. Idem, lib. iii. c. 6. If maſters had power over the lives of their ſlaves, it is evident that almoſt no bounds would be ſet to the rigour of the puniſhments which they might inflict upon them. The Codes of ancient laws preſcribed puniſhments for the crimes of ſlaves different from thoſe which were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on free men. The latter paid only a fine or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, the former were ſubjected to corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. The cruelty of theſe was in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exceſſive. Slaves, on very ſlight occaſions, might be put to the rack on queſtion.

                        </gap>2. If the dominion of maſters over the the lives and perſons of their ſlaves was thus extenſive, it was no leſs ſo over their actions and property. They were not originally permitted to marry. Male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſlaves were allowed and even encouraged to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit together. But this union was not conſidered as a marriage, it was called <hi>contubernium,</hi> not <hi>nuptiae</hi> or <hi>matrimonium.</hi> Potgieſſ. lib. ii. c. 2. §. 1. This notion was ſo much eſtabliſhed, that during ſeveral centuries after the barbarous nations embraced the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſlaves who lived as huſband and wife, were not joined together by any religious ceremony, and did not receive the nuptial benediction from a prieſt. Ibid. §. 10, 11. When this conjunction between ſlaves came to be conſidered as a lawful marriage, they were
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:011837_0211_0F9D865AF06A8BE8"/>
not permitted to marry without conſent of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſuch as ventured to do ſo without obtaining that, were puniſhed with great ſeverity, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were put to death. Potgieſſ. ibid. §. 12, &amp;c. Gregor. Turon. hiſtor. lib. v. c. 3. When the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the European nations became more gentle, and their ideas more liberal, ſlaves who married without their maſter's conſent, were ſubjected only to a fine. Potgieſſ. ibid. §. 20. Du Cange Gloſſ. voc. <hi>Foriſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritagium.</hi> 3. All the children of ſlaves, were in the ſame condition with their parents, and became the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the maſter. Du Cange Gloſſ. voc. <hi>ſervus,</hi> vol. 6. p. 450. Murat. antiq. Ital. vol. i. p. 766. 4. Slaves were ſo entirely the property of their maſters, that they could ſell them at pleaſure. While domeſtick ſlavery continued, the property in a ſlave was ſold in the manner with that which a perſon had in any other moveable. Afterwards ſlaves became <hi>adſcripti</hi> glebae, and were conveyed by ſale together with the farm or eſtate to which they belonged. Potgieſſerus has col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the laws and charters which illuſtrate this well known circumſtance in the condition of ſlaves. Lib. ii. c. 4. 5. Slaves had a title to nothing but ſubſiſtance and cloaths from their maſter; all the profits of their labour accrued to him. If a maſter, from indulgence, gave his ſlaves any <hi>peculium</hi> or fixed allowance for their ſubſiſtance, they had no right of property in what they ſaved out of that. All that they accumulated belonged to their maſter. Potgieſſ. lib. ii. c. 10. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. antiq. Ital. vol. 768. Du Cange, voc. <hi>ſervus,</hi> vol. vi. p. 451. Conformable to the ſame principle, all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſlaves belonged to their maſter at their death, and they could not diſpoſe of them by teſtament. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieſſ lib. ii. c. 11. 6. Slaves were diſtinguiſhed from free men by a peculiar dreſs. Among all the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nations, long hair was a mark of dignity and of freedom, ſlaves were for that reaſon obliged to ſhave their heads; and by this diſtinction, how indifferent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be in its own nature, they were reminded every moment of the inferiority of their condition. Potgieſſ. lib. iii. c. 4. For the ſame reaſon it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in the laws of almoſt all the nations of Europe

This diſtinction is marked by Piere de Fontaine's Conſeil. Vie de St. Louis par Joinville, p. 119. edit. de Du Cange. Several caſes decided agreeable to this principle are mentioned by Murat.

the wretched ſtate of the people. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immenſe difference between the firſt of theſe claſſes and the third, ſuch was the ſpirit of tyranny which prevailed among the great proprietors of land, and ſo various their opportunities of oppreſſing thoſe who were ſettled on their eſtates, and of rendering their condition intolerable, that many freemen, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, renounced their liberty, and voluntarily ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves as ſlaves to their powerful maſters. This they did, in order that their maſters might become more immediately intereſted to afford them protection, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the means of ſubſiſting themſelves and their families. The forms of ſuch a ſurrender, or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiatio,</hi> as it was then called, are preſerved by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culfus, lib. ii. c. 28; and by the anonymous collector of <hi>formulae</hi> publiſhed by Bignon, c. 16. together with Marculfus. In both, the reaſon for the <hi>obnoxiatio,</hi> is the wretched and indigent condition of the perſon who gives up his liberty. It was ſtill more common for freemen to ſurrender their liberty to biſhops or abbots, that they might partake of the ſecurity which the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and ſlaves of churches and monaſteries enjoyed, in conſequence of the ſuperſtitious veneration paid to the ſaint under whoſe immediate protection they were ſuppoſed to be taken. Du Cange, voc. <hi>oblatus,</hi> vol. iv. p. 1286. That condition muſt have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable indeed, which could induce a freeman volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to renounce his liberty, and to give himſelf up as a ſlave to the diſpoſal of another. The number of ſlaves in all the nations of Europe was prodigious.

Many charters granted by perſons of the higheſt rank are preſerved, from which it appears that they could not ſubſcribe their names. It was uſual for perſons who could not write, to make the ſign of the croſs in confirmation of a charter. Several of theſe remain, where Kings and perſons of great eminence affix <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num crucis manu propria pro ignoratione literarum.</hi> Du Cange, voc. Crux, vol. iii. p. 1191. From this is derived the phraſe of ſigning inſtead of ſubſcribing a paper. In the ninth century, Herbaud Comes Palatii, though ſupreme judge of the Empire by virtue of his office, could not ſubſcribe his name. Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique par deux Benedictins, 4to. tom. ii. p. 422. So late as the fourteenth century, Du Gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin, conſtable of France, the greateſt man in the ſtate, and one of the greateſt men of his age, could neither read nor write. St. Palaye Memoires ſur l'ancienne Chevalerie, t. ii. p. 82. Nor was this ignorance confined to laymen; the greater part of the clergy was not many degrees ſuperior to them in ſcience. Many dignified eccleſiaſticks could not ſubſcribe the canons of thoſe councils in which they ſat as members. Nouv. Traité de diplom. tom. ii. p. 424. One of the queſtions appointed by the canons to be put to perſons who were candidates for orders was this, "Whether they could read the goſpels and epiſtles, and explain the ſenſe of them, at leaſt literally?" Regino Prumienſis ap. Bruck. Hiſt. Philoſ. v. iii. p. 631. Alfred the Great complained, that from the Humber to the Thames there was not a prieſt who underſtood the liturgy in his mother tongue, or who could tranſlate the eaſieſt piece of Latin; and that from the Thames to the ſea, the eccleſiaſticks were ſtill more ignorant. Aſſerus de rebus geſtis Alfredi, ap. Camdeni. Anglica, &amp;c. p. 25. The ignorance of the clergy is quaintly deſcribed by an author of the dark ages.

ſtate of government and manners, from the ſeventh to the eleventh century, we may add the ſcarcity of books, and the difficulty of rendering them more common during that period. The Romans wrote their books either on parchment or on paper made of the Egyptian papyrus. The latter being the cheapeſt, was of courſe the moſt commonly uſed. But after the Saracens conquered Egypt in the ſeventh century, the communication between that country and the people ſettled in Italy or in other parts of Europe, was almoſt entirely broke off, and the papyrus was no longer in uſe among them. They were obliged, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to write all their books upon parchment, and as the price of that was high, books became extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rare and of great value. We may judge of the ſcarcity of the materials for writing them from one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. There ſtill remains ſeveral manuſcripts of the eighth, ninth, and following centuries, wrote on parchment, from which ſome former writing had been eraſed, in order to ſubſtitute a new compoſition in its place. In this manner, it is probable, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral works of the ancients periſhed. A book of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or of Tacitus might be eraſed, to make room for the legendary tale of a ſaint, or the ſuperſtitious prayers of a miſſal. Murat. Anti. Ital. v. iii. p. 833. P. de Montfaucon affirms, that the greater part of the munuſcripts on parchment which he has ſeen, thoſe of an ancient date excepted, are written on parchment from which ſome former treatiſe had been eraſed. Mem. de L'Acad. des inſcript. tom. ix. p. 325. As the want of materials for writing, is one reaſon why ſo many of the works of the ancients have periſhed, it accounts likewiſe for the ſmall number of manuſcripts of any kind, previous to the eleventh century, when they began to multiply from a cauſe which ſhall be mentioned. Hiſt. Liter. de France, tom. vi. p. 6. Many circumſtances prove the ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of books during theſe ages. Private perſons ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom poſſeſſed any books whatever. Even monaſteries of conſiderable note had only one miſſal. Murat. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. v. ix. p. 789. Lupus, abbot of Ferrieres, in a letter to the Pope, A. D. 855, beſeeches him to lend

him a copy of Cicero de Oratore and Quintilian's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, "for," ſays he, "although we have parts of thoſe books, there is no compleat copy of them in all France." Murat. Ant. v. iii. p. 835. The price of books became ſo high, that perſons of a moderate fortune could not afford to purchaſe them. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of Anjou paid for a copy of the Homilies of Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, biſhop of Halberſtadt, two hundred ſheep, five quarters of wheat, and the ſame quantity of rye and millet. Hiſtoire Literaire de France par des Religieux Benedictins, tom. vii. p. 3. Even ſo late as the year 1471, when Louis XI. borrowed the works of Raſis, the Arabian phyſician, from the faculty of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in Paris, he not only depoſited as a pledge a conſiderable quantity of plate, but was obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a nobleman to join with him as ſurety in a deed, binding himſelf under a great forfeiture to reſtore it. Gabr. Naudè Addit. à l'hiſtoire de Louys XI. par Comines edit. de Freſnoy, tom. iv. p. 281. Many curious circumſtances with reſpect to the extravagant price of books in the middle ages, are collected by that induſtrious compiler, to whom I refer ſuch of my readers as deem this ſmall branch of literary hiſtory an object of curioſity. When any perſon made a preſent of a book to a church or a monaſtery, in which were the only libraries during theſe ages, it was deemed a donative of ſuch value, that he offered it on the altar <hi>pro remedio animae ſuae,</hi> in order to obtain the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſins.

                     <p>In the eleventh century, the art of making paper in the manner now become univerſal, was invented; by means of that not only the number of manuſcripts increaſed, but the ſtudy of the ſciences was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully facilitated. Murat. ib. p. 871. The invention of the art of making paper, and the invention of the art of printing, are two conſiderable events in literary hiſtory. It is remarkable that the former preceded the firſt dawning of letters and improvement in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge towards the cloſe of the eleventh century; the latter uſhered in the light which ſpread over Europe at the aera of the Reformation.</p>

                     <p>All the religious maxims and practices of the dark ages are a proof of this. I ſhall produce one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able teſtimony in confirmation of it, from an author canonized by the church of Rome, St. Eloy or Egidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, biſhop of Noyne, in the ſeventh century. "He is a good chriſtian who comes frequently to church; who preſents the oblation which is offered to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar; who doth not taſte of the fruits of his own induſtry until he has conſecrated a part of them to God; who, when the holy feſtivals ſhall approach, lives chaſtely even with his own wife during ſeveral days, that with a ſafe conſcience he may draw near to the altar of God; and who, in the laſt place, can repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. Redeem then your ſouls from deſtruction while you have the means in your power; offer preſents and tythes to churchmen; come more frequently to church; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly implore the patronage of the ſaints; for if you obſerve theſe things, you may come with ſecurity in the day to the tribunal of the eternal Judge, and ſay, "Give to us, O Lord, for we have given unto thee." Dacherii Specilegium Veter. Script. v. ii. p. 94. The learned and judicious tranſlator of Dr. Moſheim's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, from one of whoſe additional notes I have borrowed this paſſage, ſubjoins a very proper reflection; "We ſee here a large and ample deſcription of a good Chriſtian, in which there is not the leaſt mention of the love of God, reſignation to his will, obedience to his laws, or of juſtice, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and charity towards men."

and credulity. What delighted and edified the latter, muſt diguſt and ſhock the former. Many of theſe rites appear manifeſtly to have been introduced by a ſuperſtition of the loweſt and moſt illiberal ſpecies. Many of them were borrowed, with little variation, from the religious ceremonies eſtabliſhed among the ancient Heathens. Some were ſo ridiculous, that if every age did not furniſh inſtances of the faſcinating influence of ſuperſtition, as well as of the whimſical forms which it aſſumes, it muſt appear incredible that they ſhould ever be received or tolerated. In ſeveral churches of France, they celebrated a feſtival in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Virgin Mary's flight into Egypt. It was called the feaſt of the Aſs. A young girl richly dreſſed, with a child in her arms, was ſet upon an aſs ſuperbly capariſoned. The aſs was led to the altar in ſolemn proceſſion. High Maſs was ſaid with great pomp. The aſs was taught to kneel at proper places; a hymn no leſs childiſh than impious was ſung in his praiſe: And when the ceremony was ended, the prieſt, inſtead of the uſual words with which he diſmiſſed the people, brayed three times like an aſs; and the people inſtead of their uſual reſponſe, We bleſs the Lord, brayed three times in the ſame manner. Du Cange, voc. Feſtum. v. iii. p. 424. This ridiculous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was not, like the feſtival of fools, and ſome other pageants of thoſe ages, a mere farcical enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment exhibited in a church and mingled, as was then the cuſtom, with an imitation of ſome religious rites; it was an act of devotion, performed by the miniſters of religion, and by the authority of the church. However, as this practice did not prevail univerſally in the Catholick church, its abſurdity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed at laſt to aboliſh it.</p>

                     <p>THE expence of conducting numerous bodies of men from Europe to Aſia, muſt have been exceſſive, and the difficulty of raiſing the neceſſary ſums muſt have been proportionally great, during ages when the public revenues in every nation of Europe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſmall. Some account is preſerved of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients employed by Humbert II. Dauphin of Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in order to levy the money requiſite towards equipping him for the Cruſade, A. D. 1346. Theſe I ſhall mention, as they tend to ſhew the conſiderable influence which the Cruſades had, both on the ſtate of property and of civil government. 1. He expoſed to ſale part of his domains; and as the price was deſtined for ſuch a ſacred ſervice, he obtained the conſent of the French King, of whom theſe lands were held, ratifying the alienation. Hiſt. de Dauphinè tom. i. p. 332. 335.—2. He iſſued a proclamation, in which he promiſed to grant new privileges to the nobles, as well as new immunities to the cities and towns, in his territories, in conſideration of certain ſums which they were inſtantly to pay on that account.

                     <p>THE uſual method of forming an opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the comparative ſtate of manners in two different nations, is by attending to the facts which hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians relate concerning each of them. Various paſſages might be ſelected from the Byzantin hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, deſcribing the ſplendor and magnificence of the Greek empire. P. de Montfaucon has produced from the writings of St. Chryſoſtom a very full account of the elegance and luxury of the Greeks in his age. That father in his ſermons enters into ſuch details concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manners and cuſtoms of his contemporaries, as appear ſtrange in diſcourſes from the pulpit. P. de Montfaucon has collected theſe deſcriptions, and ranged them under different heads. The court of the more early Greek Emperors ſeems to have reſembled thoſe of Eaſtern monarchs, both in magnificence and in corruption of manners. The Emperors in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century, though inferior in power, did not
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011837_0224_0F9D86655E038C48"/>
yield to them in oſtentation and ſplendor. Memoires de l'Acad. des Inſcript. tom. xx. p. 197.—But we may decide concerning the comparative ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Eaſtern Empire, and among the nations in the weſt of Europe by another method, which if not more certain, is at leaſt more ſtriking. As Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople was the place of rendezvous for all the armies of the cruſaders, this brought together the people, of the eaſt and weſt as to one great interview. There are extant ſeveral contemporary authors, both among the Greeks and Latins, who were witneſſes of this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular congreſs of people formerly ſtrangers, in a great meaſure, to each other. They deſcribe with ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and candour, the impreſſion which that new ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle made upon their own minds. This may be conſidered as the moſt lively and juſt picture of the real character and manners of each people. When the Greeks ſpeak of the Franks, they deſcribe them as barbarians, fierce, illiterate, impetuous and ſavage. They aſſume a tone of ſuperiority, as a more poliſhed people, acquainted with the arts both of government and of elegance, of which the others were ignorant. It is thus Anna Comnena deſcribes the manners of the Latins, Alexias, p. 224, 231, 237. ap. Byz. Script. vol. xi. She always treats them with contempt as a rude people, the very mention of whoſe names was ſufficient to contaminate the beauty and elegance of hiſtory, p. 229. Nicetas Choniatas inveighs againſt them with ſtill more violence, and gives an account of their ferocity and devaſtations, in terms not unlike thoſe which preceding hiſtorians had employed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the incurſions of the Goths and Vandals. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. Chon. ap. Byz. Script. vol. iii. p. 302, &amp;c. But, on the other hand, the Latin hiſtorians were ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at the magnificence, wealth. and elegance which they diſcovered in the Eaſtern em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. "O what a vaſt city is Conſtantinople (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims Fulcherius Carnotenſis, when he firſt beheld it) and how beautiful! How many monaſteries are there in it, and how many palaces built with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful art! How many manufactures are there in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, amazing to behold! It would be aſtoniſhing to
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:011837_0225_0F9D86657B385EB0"/>
relate how it abounds with all good things, with gold, ſilver, and ſtuffs of various kinds; for every hour ſhips arrive in its port laden with all things neceſſary for the uſe of man. Fulcher. ap. Bongars, vol. i. p. 386. Willermus Archbiſhop of Tyre, the moſt intelligent hiſtorian of the cruſades, takes frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deſcribe the elegance and ſplendour of the court of Conſtantinople, and adds, that what they obſerved there exceeded any idea which they could have formed of it, noſtrarum enim rerum modum &amp; dignitatem excedunt, Willerm. Tyr. ap. Bong. vol. ii. p. 657. 664. Guntherus, a French monk who wrote a hiſtory of the conqueſt of Conſtantinople by the cruſaders in the thirteenth century, ſpeaks of the magnificence of that city in the ſame tone of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, "Structurum autem Aedificiorum in corpore ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis, in eccleſiis videlicit, &amp; turibus, &amp; in domibus magnatorum, vix ullus vel deſcribere poteſt, vel cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere deſcribenti, niſi qui ea oculata fide cognoverit." Hiſt. Conſtantinop. ap. Caniſii Lectiones Antiquas. fol. Antw. 1725. vol. iv. p. 14. Geoffrey de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardouin, a nobleman of high rank, and accuſtomed to all the magnificence then known in the weſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, in ſimilar terms, the aſtoniſhment and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuch of his fellow ſoldiers who beheld Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople for the firſt time: "They could not have believed, ſays he, that there was a city ſo beautiful and rich in the whole world. When they viewed its high walls, its lofty towers, its rich palaces, its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb churches, all appeared ſo great that they could have formed no conception of this ſovereign city, unleſs they had ſeen it with their own eyes." Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toire de la Conquete de Conſtant p. 49. From theſe undiſguiſed repreſentations of their own feelings, it is evident, that to the Greeks, the Latins appeared to be a race of rude, unpoliſhed barbarians; whereas the latter, how much ſoever they might contemn the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warlike character of the former, could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding them as far ſuperior themſelves in elegance and arts—That the ſtate of government and manners was much more improved in Italy than in the other countries of Europe is evident not only from the facts
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:011837_0226_0F9D866632EB9178"/>
recorded in hiſtory, but it appears that the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent leaders of the cruſaders were ſtruck with the difference. Jacobus de Vitriaco, a French hiſtorian of the holy war, makes an elaborate panegyrick on the character and manners of the Italians. He views them as a more poliſhed people, and particularly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrates them for their love of liberty and civil wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in conſiliis circumſpecti, in re ſua publica pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curanda diligentes &amp; ſtudioſi; ſibi in poſterum provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes; aliis ſubjici renuentes; ante omnia libertatem ſibi defendentes; ſub uno quem eligunt capitaneo, communitate ſuae jura &amp; inſtituta dictantes, &amp; ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſervantes.

                     <p>The different ſteps taken by the cities of Italy in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to extend their power and dominion are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As ſoon as their liberties were eſtabliſhed, and they began to feel their own importance, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render themſelves maſters of the territory round their walls. Under the Romans, when cities enjoyed municipal privileges and juriſdiction, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumjacent lands belonged to each town, and were the property of the community. But as it was not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the feudal policy to encourage cities, or to ſhew any regard for their poſſeſſions and immunities, theſe lands had been ſeized, and ſhared among the conquerors. The barons to whom they were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, erected their caſtles almoſt at the gates of the city, and exerciſed their juriſdiction there. Under pretence of covering their ancient property, many of the cities in Italy attacked theſe troubleſome neighbours, and diſpoſſeſſing them, annexed their territories to the communities, and made thereby a conſiderable additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their power. Several inſtances of this occur in the eleventh, and beginning of the twelfth centuries. Murat. antiq. Ital. vol. iv. p. 159, &amp;c. Their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition increaſing together with their power, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards attacked ſeveral barons ſituated at a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from them, and obliged theſe to engage that
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011837_0227_0F9D8666F09823C8"/>
they ſhould become members of their community; that they ſhould take the oath of fidelity to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; that they ſhould ſubject their lands to all burthens and taxes impoſed by common conſent; that they ſhould defend the community againſt all its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and that they ſhould reſide within the city dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain ſpecified time in each year. Murat. ibid. 163. This ſubjection of the nobility to the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal government eſtabliſhed in cities, became almoſt univerſal, and was often extremely grevious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accuſtomed to conſider themſelves as independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. Otto Friſingenſis thus deſcribes the ſtate of Italy under Frederick I. "The cities ſo much affect liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are ſo ſolicitous to avoid the inſolence of power, that almoſt all of them have thrown off every other authority, and are governed by their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. Inſomuch that all that country is now fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with free cities, each of which have compelled their biſhops to reſide within their walls, and there is ſcarce any nobleman, how great ſoever his power may be, who is not ſubject to the laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome city. De Geſtis Frider. I. Imp. lib. ii. c. 13. p. 453. In another place he obſerves of the Marquis of Montſerrat that he was almoſt the only Italian baron, who had preſerved his independance, and had not become ſubject to the laws of any city. See alſo Muratori Antichita Eſtenſi, vol. i. p. 411, 412. That ſtate into which ſome of the nobles were compelled to enter, others embraced from choice. They obſerved that high degree of ſecurity as well as of credit and eſtimation which the growing wealth and dominion of the great communities procured to all the members of them. They were deſirous to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe, and to put themſelves under ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful protection. With this view they voluntarily became citizens of the towns in which their lands were moſt contiguous, and abandoning their ancient caſtles, took up their reſidence in the cities at leaſt during part of the year. Several deeds are ſtill extant, by which ſome of the moſt illuſtrious families in Italy are aſſociated as citizens of different cities. Murat. ib. p. 165, &amp;c. A charter by which Atto de Macerata is
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:011837_0228_0F9D8667AF65CDE8"/>
admitted as a citizen of Oſimo, A. D. 1198. in the Marcha di Ancona is ſtill extant. In this he ſtipulates, that he will acknowledge himſelf to be a burgeſs of that community; that he will to the utmoſt of his power, promote its honour and welfare; that he will obey his magiſtrates; that he will enter into no league with its enemies; that he will reſide in the town dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two months in every year, or for a longer time if required by the magiſtrates. The community, on the other hand, take him, his family, and friends, under their protection, and engage to defend him againſt every enemy. Fr. Ant. Zacharias Anecdota medii aevi. Aug. Taurm. 1755. fol. p. 66. This privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was deemed ſo important, that not only laymen, but eccleſiaſticks of the higheſt rank condeſcended to be adopted as members of the great communities, in hopes of enjoying the ſafety and dignity which that conferred. Murat. ib. 179. Before the inſtitution of communities, perſons of noble birth had no other reſidence but their caſtles. They kept their petty courts there; and the cities were deſerted, having hardly any inhabitants, but ſlaves or perſons of low condition. But in conſequence of the practice which I have mentioned, cities not only became more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but were filled with inhabitants of better rank; and a cuſtom, which ſtill ſubſiſts in Italy, was then introduced, that all families of diſtinction reſide more conſtantly in the great towns, than is uſual in other parts of Europe. As cities acquired new conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and dignity by the acceſſion of ſuch citizens, they became more ſolicitous to preſerve their liberty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance. The Emperors, as ſovereigns, had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently a palace in almoſt every great city of Italy; when they viſited that country they were accuſtomed to reſide in theſe, and the troops which accompanied them were quartered in the houſes of the citizens. This the citizens conſidered both as ignominious and dangerous. They could not help conſidering it as receiving a maſter and an enemy within their walls. They laboured therefore to get free of this ſubjection. Some cities prevailed on the Emperors to engage that they ſhould never enter their gates, but take up
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:011837_0229_0F9D86686F909AF0"/>
their reſidence without the walls, Chart. Hen. IV. Murat. ib. p. 24. Others obtained the imperial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to pull down the palace ſituated within their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, on condition that they built another in the ſuburbs for the reception of the Emperor. Chart. Hen. IV. Murat. ib. p. 25. Theſe various encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Italian cities alarmed the Emperors, and put them on ſchemes for re-eſtabliſhing the imperial juriſdiction over them on its ancient footing. Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Barbaroſſa engaged in this enterprize with great ardour. The free cities of Italy joined together in a general league, and ſtood on their defence; and after a long conteſt, carried on with alternate ſucceſs, a ſolemn treaty of peace was concluded at Conſtance, A. D. 1183, by which all the privileges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities granted by former Emperors to the principal cities in Italy were confirmed and ratified. Murat. diſſert. XLVIII. This treaty of Conſtance was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch an important article in the juriſprudence of the middle ages, that it is uſually publiſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Libri Feudorum at the end of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Juris Civilis. The treaty ſecured privileges of great importance to the confederate cities, and though it reſerved a conſiderable degree of authority and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to the Empire, yet the cities perſevered with ſuch vigour in their efforts in order to extend their immunities, and the conjunctures in which they made them were ſo favourable, that, before the concluſion of the thirteenth century, moſt of the great cities in Italy had ſhaken off all marks of ſubjection to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and were become independant ſovereign repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. It is not requiſite that I ſhould trace the various ſteps by which they advanced to this high degree of power ſo fatal to the Empire, and ſo beneficial to the cauſe of liberty in Italy. Muratori with his uſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry has collected many original papers which illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this curious and little known part of hiſtory. Murat. Antiq.

                     <p>LONG before the inſtitution of communities in France, charters of immunity or Franchiſe were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome towns and villages by the lords on whom they depended. But theſe are very different from ſuch as became common in the twelfth and thirteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. They did not erect theſe towns into corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; they did not not eſtabliſh a municipal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they did not grant them the privilege of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms. They contained nothing more than a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſion of the inhabitants from the yoke of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; an exemption from certain ſervices which were oppreſſive and ignominious; and the eſtabliſhment of a fixed tax or rent which they were to pay to their Lord in place of impoſitions which he could formerly lay upon them at pleaſure. Two charters of this kind to two villages in the county of Rouſillan, one A. D. 974. the other A. D. 1025, are ſtill extant. Petr. de Marca <hi>Marca,</hi> ſive limes Hiſpanicus. app. p. 909. 1038. Such conceſſions, it is probable, were not unknown in other parts of Europe, and may be conſidered as a ſtep towards the more extenſive privileges conferred by Louis the Groſs on the towns within his domains. The communities in France never aſpired to the ſame independance with thoſe in Italy. They acquired new privileges, and immunities, but the right of ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remained entire to the King or baron within whoſe territories the reſpective cities were ſituated, and from whom they received the charter of their freedom. A great number of theſe charters granted both by the Kings of France, and by their great vaſſals are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by M.

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:011837_0231_0F9D8669EF619F98"/>
of redreſſing ſome grievance under which they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured. The charters of communities contain likewiſe the firſt expedients employed for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of equal laws, and regular government. On both theſe accounts they merit particular attention, and therefore inſtead of referring my readers to the many bulky volumes in which they are ſcattered, I ſhall give them a view of ſome of the moſt important articles in theſe charters ranged under two general heads. I. Such as reſpect perſonal ſafety. II. Such as reſpect the ſecurity of property.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. DURING that ſtate of turbulence and diſorder which the corruption of the feudal government intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Europe, perſonal ſafety was the chief object of every individual; and as the great military barons alone were able to give ſufficient protection to their vaſſals, this was one great ſource of their power and authority. But, by the inſtitution of communities, effectual proviſion was made for the ſafety of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als independant of the nobles. For, 1. the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal article in every charter was, that all the members of it bound themſelves by oath to aſſiſt, defend, and ſtand by each other againſt all aggreſſors, and that they ſhould not ſuffer any perſon to injure, diſtreſs, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, any of their fellow citizens. D'Acher. Specil. x. 642. xi. 341, &amp;c.—2. Whoever reſided in any town which was made free, was obliged under a ſevere pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to accede to the community, and to take part in the mutual defence of its members. D'Acher. Spec. xi. 344.—3. The communities had the privilege of carrying arms; of making war on their private ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and of executing by military force any ſentence which their magiſtrates pronounced. D'Ach. Specil. x. 643, 644. xi. 343.—4. The practice of making ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by a pecuniary compenſation for murder, aſſault, or other acts of violence, moſt inconſiſtent with the order of ſociety, and the ſafety of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, was aboliſhed, and ſuch as committed theſe crimes were puniſhed capitally, or with rigour adequate to their guilt. D'Ach. xi. 362. Miraei opera Diplomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, i. 292.—5. No member of a community was bound to juſtify or defend himſelf by battle, or combat, but
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:011837_0232_0F9D866AB0762890"/>
if he was charged with any crime, he could be convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by the evidence of witneſſes, and the regular courſe of legal proceedings. Miraeus, ibid. D'Ach. xi. 375, 349. Ordon. tom. iii. 265.—6. If any man ſuſpected himſelf to be in danger from the malice or enmity of another, upon his making oath to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before a magiſtrate, the perſon ſuſpected was bound under a ſevere penalty to give ſecurity for his peaceable behaviour. D'Ach. xi. 346. This is the ſame ſpecies of ſecurity which is ſtill known in Scotland under the name of <hi>Lawburrows.</hi> In France it was firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among the inhabitants of communities, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been found to contribute conſiderably towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety, it was extended to all the other members of ſociety. Eſtabliſſemens de St. Louis, liv. i. cap. 28. ap. Du Cange vie de St. Louis, p. 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. THE proviſions in the charters of communities concerning the ſecurity of property are not leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than thoſe reſpecting perſonal ſafety. By the ancient law of France no perſon could be arreſted or confined in priſon on account of any private debt. Ordon. des Rois de France, tom. i. p. 72, 80. If any perſon was arreſted upon any pretext, but his having been guilty of a capital crime, it was lawful to reſcue him out of the hands of the officers who had ſeized him. Ordon. iii. p. 17. Freedom from arreſt on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of debt ſeems likewiſe to have been enjoyed in other countries. Gudenus Sylloge Diplom. 473. In ſociety, while it remained in its rudeſt and moſt ſimple form, debt ſeems to have been conſidered as an obligation merely perſonal. Men had made ſome progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards refinement before creditors acquired a right of ſeizing the property of their debtors in order to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver payment. The expedients for this purpoſe were all introduced originally in communities, and we can trace the gradual progreſs of them. 1. The ſimpleſt and moſt obvious ſpecies of ſecurity was, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſold any commodity ſhould receive a pledge from him who bought it, which he reſtored upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving payment. Of this cuſtom there are veſtiges in ſeveral charters of community. D'Ach. ix. 185. xi. 377.—2. When no pledge was given, and the debtor
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:011837_0233_0F9D866C6B2E7950"/>
became refractory or inſolvent, the creditor was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſeize his effects with a ſtrong hand, and by his private authority; the citizens of Paris are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the royal mandate, "ut ubicumque, et quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumque modo potuerunt, tantum capiant, unde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniam ſibi debitam integrè &amp; plenariè habeant, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſibi invicem adjutores exiſtant." Ordon. &amp;c. tom. i. p. 6. This rude practice, ſuitable only to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a ſtate of nature, was tolerated longer than one can conceive to be poſſible in any ſociety, where laws and order were at all known. The ordonance authorizing it was iſſued, A. D. 1134. and that which corrects the law, and prohibits creditors from ſeizing the effects of their debtors, unleſs by a warrrnt from a magiſtrate, and under his inſpection, was not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed until the year 1351. Ordon. tom. ii. 438. It is probable, however, that men were taught, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the diſorders which the former mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding occaſioned, to correct it in practice long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a remedy was provided by a law to that effect. Every diſcerning reader will apply this obſervation to many other cuſtoms and practices which I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. New cuſtoms are not always to be aſcribed to the laws which authorize them. Theſe ſtatutes only give a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſanction to ſuch things, as the experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind has previouſly found to be proper and beneficial. 3. As ſoon as the interpoſition of the magiſtrate became requiſite, regular proviſion was made for attaching or diſtraining the moveable effects of a debtor; and if his moveable were not ſufficient to diſcharge the debt, his immoveable property, or eſtate in land, was liable to the ſame diſtreſs, and was ſold for the benefit of his creditor. D'Ach. ix. p. 184, 185. xi. p. 348. 380. As this regulation afforded the moſt compleat ſecurity to the creditor, it was conſidered as ſo ſevere, that humanity pointed out ſeveral limitations in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. Creditors were prohibited from ſeizing the wearing apparel of their debtors, their beds, the door of their houſe, their inſtruments of huſbandry, &amp;c. D'Ach. ix. 184. xi. 377. Upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when the power of diſtraining effects became more general, the horſe and arms of a gentleman
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:011837_0234_0F9D866CF3CDC7A0"/>
could not be ſeized. D'Ach. ix. 185. As hunting was the favourite amuſement of martial nobles, the Emperor Ludovicus Pius prohibited the ſeizing of a hawk, on account of any compoſition or debt. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. lib. iv. §. 21. But if the debtor had no other move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, even theſe privileged articles might be ſeized. 4. In order to render the ſecurity of property compleat within a community, every perſon who was admitted a member of it, was obliged to buy or build a houſe, or to purchaſe lands, within its precincts, or at leaſt to bring into town a conſiderable portion of his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables <hi>per quae juſtitiari poſſit, ſi quid forté in eum querel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That ſecurity might be as perfect as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; in ſome towns, the members of the community ſeem to to have been bound for each other. D'Ach. x. 644.—6. All queſtions with reſpect to property, were tried within the community by magiſtrates and judges, which the citizens elected or appointed. Their deciſions were more equal and fixed, than the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which depended on the capricious and arbitrary will of a baron, who thought himſelf ſuperior to all laws. D'Ach. x. 644, 646. xi. 344. &amp; paſſim. Ordon. iii. 204. 7. No member of a community could be burdened by any arbitrary tax; for the ſuperior lord who granted the charter of community, accepted of a fixed cenſus or duty in lieu of all demands, Ordon. t. iii. 204. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertates de Calma. Hiſt. de Dauphine, tom. i. p. 19. Libert. St. Georgii de Eſperanchia, ibid. p. 26. Nor could the members of a community be diſtreſſed by an unequal impoſition of the ſum to be levied on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Regulations are inſerted in the charters of ſome communities concerning the method of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the quota of any tax to be levied on each inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. D'Ach. xi. 350, 365. St. Louis publiſhed an ordonance concerning this matter, which extended to all the communities. Ordon. t. i. 186. Theſe regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are extremely favourable to liberty, as they veſt the power of proportioning the taxes in a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of citizens choſen out of each pariſh, who were bound by ſolemn oath to decide according to juſtice.
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:011837_0235_0F9D866DBAFC4BC8"/>
That the more perfect ſecurity of property was one great object of thoſe who inſtituted communities, we learn, not only from the nature of the thing, but from the expreſs words of ſeveral charters, of which I ſhall only mention that granted by Alienor, Queen of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Dutcheſs of Guienne, to the community of Poitiers, "ut ſua propria melius defendre poſſint, &amp; magis integrè cuſtodire." Du Cange voc. <hi>Communia,</hi> v. ii. p. 863.—Such are ſome of the capital regulations eſtabliſhed in communities during the twelfth and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth centuries. Theſe may be conſidered as the firſt rudiments of law and order, and contributed greatly to introduce regular government among all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of ſociety. As ſoon as communities were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, high ſentiments of liberty began to appear. When Humbert, lord of Beaujeu, upon granting a charter of community to the town of Belleville, exacted of the inhabitants an oath of fidelity to himſelf and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, they ſtipulated, on their part, that he ſhould ſwear to maintain their franchiſes and liberties; and for their greater ſecurity, they obliged him to bring twenty gentlemen to take the ſame oath, and to be bound together with him. D'Ach. ix. 183. In the ſame manner, the lord of Moirens in Dauphinè pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a certain number of perſons as his ſureties for the obſervation of the articles, contained in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of community to that town. Theſe were bound to ſurrender themſelves priſoners to the inhabitants of Moirens, if their liege lord ſhould violate any of their franchiſes, and they promiſed to remain in cuſtody until he ſhould grant them redreſs. Hiſt. de Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinè, tom. i. p. 17. If the mayor or chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of a town did any injury to a citizen, he was obliged to give ſecurity for his appearance in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſame manner as a private perſon; and if caſt, was liable to the ſame penalty. D'Ach. ix. 183. Theſe are ideas of equality uncommon in the feudal times. Communities were ſo favourable to freedom, that they were diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Libertates.</hi> Du Cange, v. ii. p. 863. They were, at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely odious to the nobles, who foreſaw what a check they muſt prove to their power and dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Guibert Abbot of Nogent calls them execrable inventions, by which, contrary to law and juſtice, ſlaves withdrew themſelves from that obedience which they owed to their maſters. Du Cange, ib. 862. The zeal with which ſome of the nobles and powerful eccleſiaſticks oppoſed the eſtabliſhment of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and endeavoured to circumſcribe their privileges, was extraordinary. A ſtriking inſtance of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the conteſts between the archbiſhop of Reims, and the inhabitants of that community. It was the chief buſineſs of every archbiſhop, during a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, to abridge the rights and juriſdiction of the community; and the great object of the citizens, eſpecially when the ſee was vacant, to maintain, to recover, and to extend their juriſdiction. Hiſtoire civile &amp; politique de la ville de Reims par M. Anque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, tom. i. p. 287, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE obſervations which I have made concerning the ſtate of cities, and the condition of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, are confirmed by innumerable paſſages in the hiſtorians and laws of the middle ages. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, however, that ſome cities of the firſt order were in a better ſtate, and enjoyed a ſuperior degree of liberty. Under the Roman government, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal government eſtabliſhed in cities was extremely favourable to liberty. The juriſdiction of the ſenate in each corporation, and the privileges of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, were both extenſive. There is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſome of the greater cities which eſcaped the deſtructive rage of the barbarous nations, ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ancient form of government, at leaſt in a great meaſure. They were governed by a council of citizens, and by magiſtrates whom they themſelves elected. Very ſtrong preſumptions in favour of this opinion; are produced by M. l' Abbé De Bos. Hiſt. Crit. de la Mon. Franc. tom. i. p. 18, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 524. edit. 1742. It appears from ſome of the charters of communities to cities, granted in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that they only confirm the privileges poſſeſſed by the inhabitants, previous to the eſtabliſhment of the community. D'Acher. er. Specileg. vol. xi. p. 345. Other cities claimed

their privileges as having poſſeſſed them without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from the times of the Romans. Hiſt. Crit. de la. Mon. Franc. tom. ii. p. 333. But the number of cities which enjoyed ſuch immunities was ſo ſmall, as in no degree to diminiſh the force of my concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the text.</p>

                     <p>HAVING given a full account of the eſtabliſhment, as well as effects of communities in Italy and France, it will be neceſſary to enquire with ſome attention, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the progreſs of cities and of municipal government in Germany. The ancient Germans had no cities. Even in their hamlets or villages, they did not build their houſes contiguous to each other. Tac. de Mor. Germ. cap. 16. They conſidered it as a badge of ſervitude, to be obliged to dwell in a city ſurrounded with walls. When one of their tribes had ſhaken off the Roman yoke, their countrymen required of them, as an evidence of their having recovered liberty, to demoliſh the walls of a town which the Romans had built in their country. Even the fierceſt animals, ſaid they, loſe their ſpirit and courage when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Tacit. Hiſtor. lib. iv. c. 64. The Romans built ſeveral cities of note on the banks of the Rhine. But in all the vaſt countries from that river to the coaſts of the Baltic, there was hardly one city previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ninth century of the Chriſtian aera. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius Exercitatio de Urbibus Germaniae Open. vol. i. § 25, 27, 31, &amp;c. Heineccius differs from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius with reſpect to this. But even after allowing to his arguments and authorities their utmoſt force, they prove only, that there were a few places in thoſe extenſive regions, on which ſome hiſtorians have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the name of towns Elem. Jur. German. lib. i. § 102. Under Charlemagne, and the Emperors of his family, as the political ſtate of Germany began to improve, ſeveral cities were founded, and men became accuſtomed to aſſociate and to live together in one place. Charlemagne founded two archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and nine biſhopricks in the moſt conſiderable
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:011837_0238_0F9D866FF66D3658"/>
towns of Germany. Aub. Miraei Opera Diplomatica, vol. i. p. 16. His ſucceſſors increaſed the number of theſe; and as the biſhops fixed their reſidence in theſe cities and performed religious functions there, that induced many people to ſettle in them. Conring. ibid. § 48. But Henry, ſirnamed the Fowler, who began his reign A. D. 920, muſt be conſidered as the great founder of the cities in Germany. The Empire was at that time infeſted by the incurſions of the hungarians and other barbarous people. In order to oppoſe them, Henry encouraged his ſubjects to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in cities which he ſurrounded with walls and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. He enjoined or perſuaded a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nobility to fix their reſidence in the towns, and thus rendered the condition of citizens more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than it had been formerly. Wittikindus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib. i. ap. Conring. §. 82. From this period the number of cities continued to encreaſe, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more populous and more wealthy. But cities were ſtill deſtitute of municipal liberty or juriſdiction. Such of them as were ſituated in the Imperial demeſnes, were ſubject to the Emperors, and their <hi>Comites, Miſſi,</hi> and other judges preſided in them, and diſpenſed juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Towns ſituated on the eſtate of a baron, were part of his fief, and he or his officers exerciſed a ſimiliar juriſdiction in them. Conring. ibid. §. 73, 74. Heinec. Elem. Jur. Germ. lib. i. §. 104.

Frederick Barbaroſſa was the firſt Emperor who, from the ſame political conſideration that influenced Lewis the Groſs, multiplied communities in order to abridge the power of the nobles. Pfeffel Abregè de l'Hiſtoire &amp; du Droit Publique d'Allemagne, 4to. 297. From the reign of Henry the Fowler, to the time when the German cities acquired full poſſeſſion of their immunities, various circumſtances contributed to their increaſe. The eſtabliſhment of biſhopricks (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned) and the building of cathedrals, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally induced many people to ſettle there. It became the cuſtom to hold councils and courts of judicature

of every kind, eccleſiaſtical as well as civil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in cities. In the eleventh century, many ſlaves were enfranchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the greater part of which ſettled in cities. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mines were diſcovered and wrought in different provinces, which drew together ſuch a concourſe of people, as gave riſe to ſeveral cities. Conring. §. 105. The cities began in the thirteenth century to form leagues for their mutual defence, and for repreſſing the diſorders occaſioned by the private wars among the barons, as well as by their exactions. This rendered the condition of the inhabitants of cities more ſecure than that of any order of men, and allured many to become members of their communities. Conring. §. 94. There were inhabitants of three different ranks in the towns of Germany. The nobles, or familiae, the citizens, or liberi, and the artiſans who were ſlaves, or homines proprii. Knipſchild. lib. ii. cap. 29. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 13. Henry V. who began his reign A. D. 1106, infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed the ſlaves who were artiſans or inhabitants in ſeveral towns, and gave them the rank of citizens, or liberi. Pfeffel, p. 254. Knipſch. lib. ii. c. 29. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 113, 119. Though the cities in Germany did not acquire liberty ſo early as thoſe in France, they extended their privileges much farther. All the Imperial and free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the number of which is conſiderable, acquired the full right of being <hi>immediate;</hi> by which term in the German juriſprudence, we are to underſtand, that they are ſubject to the Empire alone, and poſſeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own precincts all the rights of compleat and independant ſovereignty. The various privileges of the Imperial cities, the great guardians of the Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic liberties, are innumerated by Knipſchild, lib. ii. The great articles are generally known, and it would be improper to enter into any diſquiſition concerning minute particulars.</p>

                     <p>THE Spaniſh hiſtorians are almoſt entirely ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the origin and progreſs of communities in that kingdom; ſo that I cannot fix with any degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty the time and manner of their firſt introduction

there. It appears, however, from Mariana, vol. ii. p. 221, fol. Hagae 1736, that in the year 1350, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen cities had obtained a ſeat in the Cortes of Caſtile. From the account which ſhall be given of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and pretenſions, Sect. III. of this volume, it is evident that their privileges and form of government were the ſame with thoſe of the other feudal corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and this, aswell as the pefect ſimilarity of political inſtitutions and tranſactions in all the feudal kingdoms, may lead us to conclude, that communities were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced there in the ſame manner, and probably about the ſame time, as in the other nations of Europe. In Aragon, as I ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent note, cities ſeem early to have acquired exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive immunities, together with a ſhare in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In the year 1118, the citizens of Saragoſſa had not only attained political liberty, but they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be of equal rank with the nobles of the ſecond claſs; and many other immunities, unknown to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their rank of life in other parts of Europe, were conferred upon them. Zurita Anales de Aragon, tom. i. p. 44. In England, the eſtabliſhment of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or corporations was poſterior to the Conqueſt. The practice was borrowed from France, and the privileges granted by the crown were perfectly ſimilar to thoſe which I have enumerated. But as this part of hiſtory is well known to moſt of my readers, I ſhall, without entering into any critical or minute diſcuſſion, refer them to authors who have fully illuſtrated this intereſting point in the Engliſh hiſtory. Brady's Treatiſe of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs. Madox Firma Burgi, chap. i. ſect. ix. Hume's Hiſtory of England, vol. i. append. i. and ii. It is not improbable that ſome of the towns in England were formed into corporations, under the Saxon Kings, and that the charters granted by the Kings of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race were not charters of enfranchiſement from a ſtate of ſlavery, but a confirmation of privileges which they already enjoyed. See Lord Lyttleton's Hiſtory of Henry II. vol. ii. p. 317. The Engliſh cities, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were very inconſiderable in the twelfth century. A clear proof of this occurs in the hiſtory to which I laſt referred. Fitzſtephen, a contemporary author,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:011837_0241_0F9D86731A547A80"/>
gives a deſcription of the city of London in the reign of Henry II. and the terms in which he ſpeaks of its trade, its wealth, and the ſplendour of its inhabitants, would ſuggeſt no inadequate idea of its ſtate at preſent, when it is the greateſt and moſt opulent city of Europe. But all ideas of grandeur and magnificence are merely comparative. It appears from a contemporary author, Peter of Blois, archdeacon of London, who had good opportunity of being informed, that this city, of which Fitzſtephen gives ſuch a pompous account, contained no more than forty thouſand inhabitants. Ibid. 315, 316. The other cities were ſmall in proportion, and in no condition to extort any extenſive privileges. That the conſtitution of the boroughs in Scotland, in many circumſtances, reſembled that of the towns in France and England, is manifeſt from the Leges Burgorum annexed to the Regiam Majeſtatem.</p>

                     <p>SOON after the introduction of the third eſtate into the national council, the ſpirit of liberty which that excited in France began to produce conſpicuous effects. in ſeveral provinces of France, the nobility and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities formed aſſociations, whereby they bound themſelves to defend their rights and privileges againſt the formidable and arbitrary proceedings of the King. The count de Boulainvilliers has preſerved a copy of one of theſe aſſociations, dated in the year 1314, twelve years after the admiſſion of the deputies from towns into the States General. Hiſtoire de L'ancien gouvernement de la France, tom. ii. p. 94. The vigour with which the people aſſerted and prepared to maintain their rights, obliged their ſovereigns to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them. Six years after this aſſociation, Philip the Long iſſued a writ of ſummons, to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Narbonne, in the following terms: "Philip, by the Grace, &amp;c. to our well-beloved, &amp;c. As we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with all our heart, and above all other things, to govern our kingdoms and people in peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, by the help of God: and to reform our ſaid kingdom in ſo far as it ſtands in need thereof, for the
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:011837_0242_0F9D8673B04A8C80"/>
public good, and for the benefit of our ſubjects, who in times paſt have been aggrieved and oppreſſed in diverſe manners by the malice of ſundry perſons, as we have learned by common report as well as by the information of good men worthy of credit, and we having determined in our council which we have called to meet in our good city, &amp;c. to give redreſs to the utmoſt of our power, by all ways and means poſſible, according to reaſon and juſtice, and willing that this ſhould be done with ſolemnity and deliberation by the advice of the prelates, barons, and good towns of our realm, and particularly of you, and that it ſhould be tranſacted agreeable to the will of God, and for the good of our people, therefore we command," &amp;c. Mably, obſervat. ii. App. p. 386. I ſhall allow theſe to be only the formal words of a public and legal ſtile, but the ideas are ſingular, and much more liberal and enlarged than one could expect in that age. A popular monarch of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain could hardly addreſs himſelf to the parliament, in terms more favourable to public liberty. There occurs in the hiſtory of France a ſtriking inſtance of the progreſs which the principles of liberty had made in that kingdom, and of the influence which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of towns had acquired in the States-General. During the calamities in which the war with England, and the captivity of King John, had involved France, the States-General made abold effort to extend their own privileges and juriſdiction. The regulations eſtabliſhed by the States held A. D. 1355, concerning the mode of levying taxes, the adminiſtration of which they veſted not in the crown, but in commiſſioners appointed by the States; concerning the coining of money; concerning the redreſs of the grievance of purveyance; concerning the regular adminiſtration of juſtice; are much more ſuitable to the genius of a republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than that of a feudal monarchy. This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtatute is publiſhed, Ordon. t. iii. p. 19.

The French hiſtorians repreſent the

biſhop of Laon, and Marcel Provoſt of the merchants of Paris, who had the chief direction of this aſſembly, as ſeditious tribunes, violent, intereſted, ambitious, and aiming at innovations ſubverſive of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government of their country. That may have been the caſe, but theſe men poſſeſſed the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the people; and the meaſures which they propoſed as the moſt popular and acceptable, plainly prove that the ſpirit of liberty had ſpread wonderfully, and that the ideas which then prevailed in France con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning government were extremely liberal. The States general held at Paris A. D. 1355, conſiſted of about eight hundred members, and above one half of theſe were deputies from towns. M. Secourſſe Pref. a Ordon. tom. iii. p. 48. It appears that in all the different aſſemblies of the States, held during the reign of John, the repreſentatives of towns had great influence, and in every reſpect the third State was conſidered as co-ordinate and equal to either of the other two. Ibid. paſſim. Theſe ſpirited efforts were made in France long before the Houſe of Commons in England acquired any conſiderable influence in the legiſlature. As the feudal ſyſtem was carried to its utmoſt height in France ſooner than in England, ſo it began to decline ſooner in the former than in the latter kingdom. In England, almoſt all attempts to eſtabliſh or to extend the liberty of the people have been ſucceſsful; in France they have proved unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. What were the accidental events, or political cauſes which occaſioned this difference, is it not my preſent buſineſs to enquire.</p>

                     <p>IN a former note, No. VIII. I have enquired into the condition of that part of the people who were employed in agriculture, and have repreſented the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hardſhips and calamities of their ſituation. When charters of liberty and manumiſſion were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch perſons, they contained four conceſſions correſponding to the four capital grievances to which men in a ſtate of ſervitude are ſubject. 1. The right
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:011837_0244_0F9D86752FD80C00"/>
of diſpoſing of their perſons by ſale or grant was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed. 2. Power was given to them of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their property and effects by will or any other le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal deed. Or if they happened to die inteſtate, it was provided that their property ſhould go to their lawful heirs in the ſame manner as the property of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 3. The ſervices and taxes which they owed to their ſuperior or liege Lord, which were formerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and impoſed at pleaſure, are preciſely aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. 4. They are allowed the privilege of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever perſon they choſe, as formerly they could contract no marriage without their Lord's permiſſion, and with no perſon but one of his ſlaves. All theſe particulars are found united in the charter granted Habitatoribus Montis-Britonis. A. D. 1376. Hiſt. de Dauphinè, tom. i. p. 81. Many circumſtances concurred with thoſe which I have mentioned in the text in procuring them deliverance from that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate. The gentle ſpirit of the Chriſtian religion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the doctrines which it teaches, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original equality of mankind, as well as the impartial eye with which the Almighty regards men of every condition, and admits them to a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his benefits, are inconſiſtent with ſervitude. But in this, as in many other inſtances, conſiderations of intereſt, and the maxims of falſe policy led men to a conduct inconſiſtent with their principles. They were ſo ſenſible, however, of the inconſiſtency, that to ſet their fellow Chriſtians at liberty from ſervitude was deemed an act of piety highly meritorious and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to heaven. The humane ſpirit of the Chriſtian religion ſtruggled with the maxims and manners of the world, and contributed more than any other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to introduce the practice of manumiſſion. When pope Gregory the Great, who flouriſhed to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards the end of the ſixth century, granted liberty to ſome of his ſlaves, he gives this reaſon for it, "Cum redempter noſter, totius conditor naturae, ad hoc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatus humanam carnem voluerit aſſumere, ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Manumiſſion was frequently granted on death-bed or by latter will. As the minds of men are at that time awakened to ſentiments of humanity and piety, theſe deeds proceeded from religious motives, and are granted <hi>pro redemptione animae,</hi> in order to obtain acceptance with God. Du Cange ubi ſupra, p. 470. &amp; voc. <hi>ſervus</hi> vol. vi. p. 451. Another method of obtaining liberty was by entering into holy orders, or taking the vow in a monaſtery. This was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſome time; but ſo many ſlaves eſcaped, by this means out of the hands of their maſters, that the practice was afterwards reſtrained, and at laſt prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the laws of almoſt all the nations of Europe. Murat. ib. p. 842. Conformably to the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Princes, on the birth of a ſon, or upon any other agreeable event, appointed a certain number of ſlaves to be enfranchiſed, as a teſtimony of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to God for that benefit. Marculfi Form. lib. i. cap. 39. There are ſeveral forms of manumiſſion publiſhed by Marculfus, and all of them are founded on religious conſiderations, in order to procure the favour of God, or to obtain the forgiveneſs of their ſins. Lib. ii. c. 23, 33, 34, edit. Baluz. The ſame obſervation holds with reſpect to the other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of Formulae annexed to Marculfus. As ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of religion induced ſome to grant liberty to their fellow-Chriſtians who groaned under the yoke of ſervitude; ſo miſtaken ideas concerning devotion led others to relinquiſh their liberty. When a perſon conceived an extraordinary reſpect for the ſaint who was the patron of any church or monaſtery in which he was accuſtomed to attend religious worſhip, it was not unuſual among men poſſeſſed with an exceſs of ſuperſtitious reverence, to give up themſelves and their poſterity to be ſlaves of the ſaint. Mabillon. de re Diplomat, lib. vi. 632. The <hi>oblati</hi> or voluntary ſlaves of churches or monaſteries were very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and may be divided into three different claſſes.

They were rather vaſſals than ſlaves, and ſometimes perſons of noble birth found it prudent to ſecure the protection of the church in this manner.

They were called <hi>cenſuales.</hi> The laſt claſs conſiſted of ſuch as actually renounced their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and became ſlaves in the ſtrict and proper ſenſe of the word.

Potgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſerus de ſtatu ſervorum, lib. i. cap. i. §. 6, 7. How zealous the clergy were to encourge the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which led to this practice will appear from a clauſe in a charter by which one gives up himſelf as a ſlave to a monaſtery, "Cum ſit omni carnali ingenuitate generoſius extremum quodcum<expan>

Du Cange, voc. <hi>oblatus,</hi> vol. iv. p. 1286, 1287. It does not appear, that the enfranchiſement of ſlaves was a frequent practice while the feudal ſyſtem preſerved its vigour. On the contrary, there were laws which ſet bounds to this practice as detrimental to ſociety. Potgieſſ. lib. iv. c. 2. § 6. The inferior order of men owed the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their liberty to the decline of that ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal policy, which lodged the moſt extenſive power in

the hands of a few members of the ſociety, and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the reſt. When Louis X. iſſued his ordonance, ſeveral ſlaves had been ſo long accuſtomed to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and their minds were ſo much debaſed by that unhappy ſituation, that they refuſed to accept of their liberty which was offered them. D'Ach. Spicel. v. xi. p. 387. Long after the reign of Louis X. ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the French nobility continued to aſſert their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient dominion over their ſlaves.

Though the genius of the Engliſh conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems early to have favoured perſonal liberty, perſonal ſervitude, nevertheleſs, continued long in England in ſome particular places.

                     <p>THERE is no cuſtom in the middle ages more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular than that of private war. It is a right of ſo great importance, and prevailed ſo univerſally, that the regulations concerning it make a conſiderable figure

in the ſyſtem of laws during the middle ages. M. de Monteſquieu, who has unravelled ſo many intricate points in feudal juriſprudence, and thrown light on ſo many cuſtoms formerly obſcure and unintelligible, was not led by his ſubject to conſider this. I ſhall therefore give a more minute account of the cuſtoms and regulations which directed a practice ſo contrary to the preſent ideas of civilized nations concerning go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order. 1. Among the ancient Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, as well as other nations in a ſimilar ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the right of avenging injuries was a private and perſonal right, exerciſed by force of arms, without any reference to an umpire, or any appeal to a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate for deciſion. The cleareſt proofs of this were produced Note VI. 2. This practice ſubſiſted among the barbarous nations after their ſettlement in the provinces of the Empire which they conquered; and as the cauſes of diſſention among them multiplied, their family feuds and private wars became more frequent.

It was not only allowable for the relations to avenge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of their family, but it was incumbent on them. Thus by the laws of the Angli and Werini, ad quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque hereditas terrae pervenerit, ad illum veſtis bellica id eſt lorica &amp; ultio proximi, &amp; ſolatio leudis, debet pertinere. tit. vi. § 5. ap.

All diſputes between gentlemen and perſons of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or rank were terminated in the ſame manner.

Guido Abbas ap. Du Cange. Ib. p. 179.—4. It was not every injury or treſpaſs that gave a gentleman a title to make war upon his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.

Such crimes as are now puniſhed capitally in civilized nations, at that time juſtified private hoſtilities. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. ch. lix. Du Cange Diſſert. xxix. ſur Joinville, p. 331. But though the avenging of injuries was the only motive that could legally authorize a private war, yet diſputes concerning civil property, often gave riſe to hoſtilities, and were terminated by the ſword. Du Cange Diſſert. p. 332.—5. All perſons preſent when any quarrel aroſe, or any act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was committed, were included in the war which it occaſioned, for it was ſuppoſed to be impoſſible for any man in ſuch a ſituation, to remain neutral, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking ſide with one or other of the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties. Beauman. p. 300.—6. All the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the two principals in the war were included in it, and obliged to eſpouſe the quarrel of the chieftain with whom they were connected. Du Cange, ib. 332. This was founded on the maxim of the ancient Germans, "ſuſcipere tam inimicitias ſeu patris, ſeu propinqui, quam amicitias, neceſſe eſt;" a maxim natural to all rude and ſimple nations, among which the form of ſociety, and political union ſtrengthens ſuch a ſentiment. The method of aſcertaining the

But when the church relaxed ſomewhat of its rigour, and did not extend its prohibition of marrying beyond the fourth degree of affinity, the ſame reſtriction took place in the conduct of private war. Beauman. 303. Du Cange Diſſert. 333.—7. A private war could not be carried on between two full brothers, becauſe both have the ſame common kindred, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither have any perſons bound to ſtand by him againſt the other, in the conteſt; but two brothers of the half blood might wage war, becauſe each of them has a diſtinct kindred. Beauman. p. 299—8. The vaſſals of each principal in any private war were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the conteſt, becauſe by the feudal maxims they were bound to take arms in defence of their chieftain of whom they held, and to aſſiſt him in every quarrel. As ſoon, therefore, as the feudal te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures were introduced, and this artificial connection was eſtabliſhed between vaſſals and the baron of whom they held, vaſſals came to be conſidered as in the ſame ſtate with relations. Beauman. 303—9. Private wars were very frequent for ſeveral centuries. Nothing contributed more to increaſe thoſe diſorders in government, and that ferocity of manners which reduced the nations of Europe to that wretched ſtate which diſtinguiſhed the period of hiſtory which I am reviewing.

                     <p>HAVING thus collected the chief regulations which cuſtom had eſtabliſhed concerning the right and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of private war, I ſhall enumerate in chronological order the various expedients employed to aboliſh or reſtrain this fatal cuſtom. 1. The firſt expedient em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the civil magiſtrate in order to ſet ſome bounds to the violence of private revenge, was the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by law the fine or compoſition to be paid for each different crime. The injured perſon was originally the ſole judge concerning the nature of the wrong which he had ſuffered, the degree of vengeance which he ſhould exact, as well as the ſpecies of attonement or reparation with which he ſhould reſt ſatisfied. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment became of courſe as implacable as it was fierce. It was often a point of honour not to forgive, nor to be reconciled. This made it neceſſary to fix thoſe compoſitions which make ſo great a figure in the laws of barbarous nations. The nature of crimes and offences was eſtimated by the magiſtrate, and the ſum due to the perſon offended was aſcertained with a minute, and often a whimſical accuracy. Rotharis, the legiſlator of the Lombards, who reigned about the middle of the ſeventh century, diſcovers his intention both in aſcertaining the compoſition to be paid by the offender, and in increaſing its value; it is, ſays he, that the enmity may be extinguiſhed, the proſecution

may ceaſe, and peace may be reſtored. Leg. Langob. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. About the beginning of the ninth century, Charlemagne ſtruck at the root of the evil, and enacted, "That when any perſon had been guilty of a crime, or had committed an outrage, he ſhould immediately ſubmit to the penance which the church impoſed, and offer to pay the compoſition which the law preſcribed; and if the injured perſon or his kindred ſhould refuſe to accept of this, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to avenge themſelves by force of arms, their lands and properties ſhould be forfeited. Capitul. A. D. 802. edit. Baluz. vol. i. 371—3. But in this, as well as in other regulations, the genius of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne advanced before the ſpirit of his age. The ideas of his contemporaries concerning regular government were too imperfect, and their manners too fierce to ſubmit to this law. Private wars, with all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities whcih they occaſioned, became more frequent than ever after the death of that great monarch. His ſucceſſors were unable to reſtrain them. The church found it neceſſary to interpoſe. The moſt early of theſe interpoſitions now extant, is towards the end of the tenth century. In the year 990, ſeveral Biſhops in the ſouth of France aſſembled, and publiſhed vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous regulations, in order to ſet ſome bounds to the violence and frequency of private wars; if any perſon within their dioceſſes ſhould venture to tranſgreſs, they ordained that he ſhould be excluded from all Chriſtian privileges during his life, and be denied Chriſtian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial after his death, Du Mont Corps Diplomatique, tom. i. p. 41. Theſe, however, were only partial remedies; and therefore a council was held at Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, A. D. 994. The bodies of the ſaints, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of thoſe ages, were carried thither; and by theſe ſacred relicks men were exhorted to lay down their arms, to extinguiſh their animoſities, and to ſwear that they would not for the future violate the public peace by their private hoſtilites. Bouquet Recueil des Hiſtor. vol. x. p. 49, 147. Several other councils iſſued decrees to the ſame effect. Du Cange Diſſert. 343—4. But the authority of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, how venerable ſoever in thoſe ages, was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:011837_0254_0F9D867D70C00E88"/>
to aboliſh a cuſtom which flattered the pride of the nobles, and gratified their favourite paſſions. The evil grew ſo intolerable, that it became neceſſary to employ ſupernatural means for ſurpreſſing it. A biſhop of Aquitaine, A. D. 1032, pretended that an angel had appeared to him, and brought him a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from heaven, enjoining men to ceaſe from their hoſtilities, and to be reconciled to each other. It was during a ſeaſon of public calamity that he publiſhed this revelation. The minds of men were diſpoſed to receive ſuch pious impreſſions; and willing to perform any thing in order to avert the wrath of heaven. A general peace and ceſſation from hoſtilities took place, and continued for ſeven years; and a reſolution was formed that no man ſhould in times to come attack or moleſt his adverſaries during the ſeaſons ſet apart for celebrating the great feſtivals of the church, or from the evening of Thurſday in each week to the morning of Monday in the week enſuing, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening days being conſidered as particularly holy, our Lord's paſſion having happened on one of theſe days, and his reſurrection on another. A change in the diſpoſition of men ſo ſudden, and which produced a reſolution ſo unexpected, was conſidered as miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and the reſpite from hoſtilities which followed upon it, was called <hi>The Truce of God.</hi> Glaber. Rodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Hiſtor. lib. v. ap. Bouquet, vol. x. p. 59. This, from being a regulation or concert in one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, became a general law in Chriſtendom, and was confirmed by the authority of the Pope, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters were ſubjected to the penalty of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

A ceſſation from hoſtilities during three compleat days in every week, allowed ſuch a conſiderable ſpace for the paſſions of the antagoniſts to cool, and for the people to enjoy a reſpite from the calamities of war, as well as to take meaſures for their own ſecurity, that,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:011837_0255_0F9D867E2FB58810"/>
if this truce of God had been exactly obſerved, it muſt have gone far towards putting an end to private wars. This, however, ſeems not to have been the caſe; the nobles, diſregarding the truce, proſecuted their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels without interruption as formerly. Qua nimirum tempeſtate, univerſae provinciae adeo devaſtationis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuae importunitate inquietantur, ut ne ipſa, pro ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatione divinae pacis, profeſſa ſacramenta cuſtodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur. Abbas Uſpergenſis apud Datt de pace imperii publica, p. 13. No. 35. The violent ſpirit of the nobility could not be reſtrained by any engagements. The complaints of this were frequent; and biſhops in order to compel them to renew their vows and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ceaſing from their private wars, were obliged to enjoin their clergy to ſuſpend the performance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice, and the exerciſe of any religious function within the pariſhes of ſuch as were refractory and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. Hiſt. de Langued. par. D. D. de Vic &amp; Vaiſette, tom. ii. Preuves, p. 118—5. The people, eager to obtain relief from their ſufferings, called in a ſecond time a pretended revelation to their aid. Towards the end of the twelfth century, a carpenter in Guienne gave out that Jeſus Chriſt together with the bleſſed Virgin had appeared to him, and having commanded him to exhort mankind to peace, had given him, as a proof of his miſſion, an image of the Virgin holding her ſon in her arms, with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lamb of God, who takeſt away the ſins of the world, give us peace.</hi> This low fanatic addreſſed himſelf to an ignorant age, prone to credit what was marvellous. He was received as an inſpired meſſenger of God. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prelates and barons aſſembled at Puy, and took an oath, not only to make peace with all their own ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but to attack ſuch as refuſed to lay down their arms, and to be reconciled to their enemies. They formed an aſſociation for this purpoſe, and aſſumed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name of <hi>the Brotherhood of God.</hi> Robertus de Monte Michaele ap. M. de Lauriere Pref. tom. i. Ordon. p. 29. But the influence of this ſuperſtitious terror or devotion was not of long continuance—6. The civil magiſtrate was obliged to exert his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in order to check a cuſtom which threatened the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:011837_0256_0F9D867EF1389218"/>
diſſolution of government. Philip Auguſtus, as ſome imagine, or St Louis as is more probable, publiſhed an ordonance, A. D. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>45, prohibiting any perſon to commence hoſtilities againſt the friends and vaſſals of his adverſary, until forty days after the commiſſion of the crime or offence which gave riſe to the quarrel; declaring, that if any man preſumed to tranſgreſs this ſtatute, he ſhould be conſidered as guilty of a breach of public peace, and be tried and puniſhed by the judge ordinary as a traitor, Ordon. tom. i. p. 56. This was called <hi>the Royal Truce,</hi> and afforded time for the violence of reſentment to ſubſide, as well as leiſure for the good offices of ſuch as were willing to compoſe the difference. The happy effects of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation ſeem to have been conſiderable, if we may judge from the ſolicitude of ſucceeding monarchs to enforce it.—7. In order to reſtrain the exerciſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate war ſtill farther, Philip the Fair, towards the cloſe of the ſame century, A. D. 1296, publiſhed an ordonance commanding all private hoſtilities to ceaſe, whilſt he was engaged in war againſt the enemies of the ſtate. Ordon. tom. i. p. 328, 390. This regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which ſeems to be almoſt eſſential to the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and preſervation of ſociety, was often renewed by his ſucceſſors, and being enforced by the regal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, proved a conſiderable check to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conteſts of the nobles. Both theſe regulations, introduced firſt in France, were adopted by the other nations in Europe.—8. The evil, however, was ſo inveterate, that it did not yield to all theſe remedies. No ſooner was public peace eſtabliſhed in any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than the barons renewed their private hoſtilities. They not only ſtruggled to maintain this pernicious right, but to ſecure the exerciſe of it without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. Upon the death of Philip the Fair, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of different provinces in France formed aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and preſented remonſtrances to his ſucceſſor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the repeal of ſeveral laws, by which he had abridged the privileges of their order. Among theſe, the right of private war is always mentioned as one of the moſt valuable; and they claim, that the reſtraint impoſed by the truce of God, the royal truce, as
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:011837_0257_0F9D867FB015B910"/>
well as that ariſing from the ordonance of the year 1296, ſhould be taken off. In ſome inſtances, the two ſons of Philip who mounted the throne ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eluded their demands; in others they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make conceſſions. Ordon. tom. i. p. 551, 557, 561, 573. The ordonances to which I here refer, are of ſuch length that I cannot inſert them, but they are extremely curious, and may be peculiarly inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to an Engliſh reader, as they throw conſiderable light on that period of Engliſh hiſtory in which the attempts to circumſcribe the regal prerogative were carried on, not by the people ſtruggling for liberty, but by the nobles contending for power. It is not neceſſary to produce any evidence of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and frequency of private wars under the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Philip the Fair.—9. A practice ſomewhat ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the royal truce was introduced, in order to ſtrengthen and extend it. Bonds of aſſurance on mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſecurity, were demanded from the parties at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, by which they obliged themſelves to abſtain from all hoſtilities, either during a time mentioned in the bond, or for ever: and became ſubject to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy penalties, if they violated this obligation. Theſe bonds were ſometimes granted voluntarily, but more frequently exacted by the authority of the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. Upon a petition from the party who felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf weakeſt, the magiſtrate ſummoned his adverſary to appear in court, and obliged him to give a bond of aſſurance. If, after that, he committed any farther hoſtilities, he became ſubject to all the penalties of treaſon. This reſtraint on private war was known in the age of St. Louis. Eſtabliſſemens, liv. i. c. 28. It was frequent in Bretagne, and what is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, ſuch bonds of aſſurance were given mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally between vaſſals and the lord of whom they held. Oliver de Cliſſon grants one to the Duke of Bretagne, his ſovereign. Morace Mem. pour ſervir de preuves à l'hiſt. de Bret. tom. i. p. 846. ii. p. 371. Many examples of bonds of aſſurance in other provinces of France are collected by Bruſſel. tom. ii. p. 856. The nobles of Burgundy remonſtrated againſt this practice, and obtained exemption from it as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:011837_0258_0F9D8680706776D8"/>
on the privileges of their order. Ordon. tom. i. p. 558. This mode of ſecurity was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in cities, and the good effects of it having been felt there, was extended to the nobles. See Note XVI—10. The calamities occaſioned by private wars, became at ſome times ſo intolerable, that the nobles entered into voluntary aſſociations; binding themſelves to refer all matters in diſpute, whether concerning ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil property, or points of honour, to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the majority of the aſſociates. Morice Mem. pour ſervir de preuves à l'hiſt. de Bret. tom. ii. p. 728—11. But all theſe expedients proving ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Charles VI. A. D. 1413, iſſued an ordonance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibiting private wars on any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, with power to the judge ordinary to compel all perſons to comply with this injunction, and to puniſh ſuch as ſhould prove refractory or diſobedient, by impriſoning their perſons, ſeizing their goods, and appointing the officers of juſtice, <hi>Mangeurs &amp; Gaſteurs,</hi> to live at free quarters on their eſtate. If thoſe who were diſobedient to this edict could not be perſonally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ordon. tom. x. p. 138. How ſlow is the progreſs of reaſon and of civil order! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations which to us appear ſo equitable, obvious, and ſimple, required the efforts of civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authority, during ſeveral centuries, to introduce and eſtabliſh them. Even poſterior to this period. Louis XI. was obliged to aboliſh private wars in Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinè, by a particular edict, A. D. 1451. Du Cange diſſert. p. 348.</p>
                     <p>THIS note would ſwell to a diſproportional bulk, if I ſhould attempt to enquire with the ſame minute attention into the progreſs of this pernicious cuſtom in the other countries of Europe. In England, the ideas of the Saxons concerning perſonal revenge, the right of private wars, and the compoſition due to the party offended, ſeem to have been much the ſame with thoſe which prevailed on the continent.

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of private wars among the nobility, occurs more rarely in the Engliſh hiſtory, than in that of any other European nations, and no laws concerning them are to be found in the body of their ſtatutes. Such a change in their own manners, and ſuch a variation from thoſe of their neighbours is remarkable. Is it to be aſcribed to the extraordinary power which Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am the Norman acquired by right of conqueſt, and tranſmitted to his ſucceſſors, which rendered the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of juſtice more vigorous and deciſive, and the juriſdiction of the King's court more extenſive than under the monarchs on the continent? Or, was it ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſettlement of the Normans in England, who having never adopted the practice of private war in their own country, aboliſhed it in the kingdom which they conquered? It is aſſerted in an Ordonance of John King of France, that in all times paſt, perſons of every rank in Normandy have been probibited to wage war, and the practice has been deemed unlawful. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. tom. ii. p. 407. If this fact were certain, it would
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:011837_0260_0F9D8682AFA08910"/>
go far towards explaining the peculiarity which I have mentioned. But as there are ſome Engliſh Acts of Parliament, which, according to the remark of the learned author of the <hi>Obſervations on the Statutes, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more ancient,</hi> which recite falſhoods, it may be added, that this is not peculiar to the laws of that country. Notwithſtanding the poſitive aſſertion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this public law of France, there is good reaſon for conſidering it as a ſtatute which recites a falſhood. This, however, is not the place for diſcuſſing that point. It is an inquiry not unworthy the curioſity of an Engliſh antiquarian.</p>
                     <p>IN Caſtile, the pernicious practice of private war prevailed, and was authoriſed by the cuſtoms and law of the kingdom.

As the Caſtilian no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were no leſs turbulent than powerful, their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and hoſtilities involved their country in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.

                     <p>IN Germany, the diſorders and calamities occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the right of private war, were greater and more intolerable than in any other country of Europe. The Imperial authority was ſo much ſhaken and enfeebled by the violence of the civil wars, excited by the conteſts between the Popes and the Emperors of the Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian and Suabian lines, that not only the nobility but the cities acquired almoſt independant power, and ſcorned all ſubordination and obedience to the laws. The frequency of theſe <hi>faidae</hi> or private wars, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mentioned in the German annals, and the fatal effects of them are moſt pathetically deſcribed, Datt. de pace Imper. pub. lib. i. cap. v. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 30. &amp; paſſim. The Germans early adopted the Treuga Dei, which was firſt eſtabliſhed in France. This, however, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a temporary and ineffectual remedy. The diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders multiplied ſo faſt, and grew ſo enormous, that they threatned the diſſolution of ſociety, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Germans to have recourſe to the only remedy of the evil. viz. an abſolute prohibition of private wars. The Emperor William publiſhed his edict to this purpoſe, A. D. 1255, an hundred and ſixty years previous to the ordonance of Charles VI. in France. Datt. lib. i. cap. 4. n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 20.

The cities and nobles entered into allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and aſſociations, by which they bound themſelves to maintain the public peace, and to make war on ſuch as ſhould violate it. This was the origin of the league of the Rhine, of Suabia, and of many ſmaller confederacies diſtinguiſhed by various names.

During that period, political order, reſpect for the laws, together with the equal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice made conſiderable progreſs in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. But the final and perpetual abolition of the right of private war was not accompliſhed until A. D. 1495. The Imperial authority was by that time more firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the ideas of men with reſpect to government and ſubordination were become more juſt. That barbarous and pernicious privilege which the nobles had ſo long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, was declared to be incompatible with the happineſs and exiſtence of ſociety. In order to terminate any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which might ariſe among the various num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Germanick body, the Imperial chamber was inſtituted with ſupreme juriſdiction, to judge without appeal in every queſtion brought before it.

                     <p>IT would be tedious and of little uſe to enumerate the various modes of appealing to the juſtice of God, which ſuperſtition introduced during the ages of ignorance, I ſhall mention only one, becauſe we have an account of it in a placitum or trial in the preſence of Charlemagne, from which we may learn the imperfect manner in which juſtice was adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered even during his reign. In the year 775, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aroſe between the biſhop of Paris and the abbot of St. Denys, concerning the property of a ſmall abbey. Each of them exhibited deeds and records, in order to prove the right to be in them. Inſtead of trying the authenticity, or conſidering the import of theſe, the point was referred to the <hi>judicium crucis.</hi> Each produced a perſon, who, during the celebration of maſs, ſtood before the croſs with his arms expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and he whoſe repreſentative firſt became weary,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:011837_0263_0F9D8684EF433E40"/>
and altered his poſture, loſt the cauſe. The perſon employed by the biſhop on this occaſion, had ſtrength or leſs ſpirit than his adverſary, and the queſtion was decided in favour of the abbot. Mabillon de re Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomat. lib. vi. p. 498. If a Prince ſo enlightened as Charlemagne countenanced ſuch an abſurd mode of deciſion, it is no wonder that other monarchs ſhould tolerate it ſo long. M. de Monteſquieu has treated of the trial by judicial combat at conſiderable length. The two talents which diſtinguiſh that illuſtrious author, induſtry in tracing all the circumſtaces of ancient and obſcure inſtitutions, and ſagacity in penetrating into the cauſes and principles which contributed to eſtabliſh them, are equally conſpicuous in his obſervations on this ſubject. To theſe I refer the reader, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moſt of the principles by which I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to explain this practice. De l'Eſprit des Loix, lib. xxviii. It ſeems to be probable from the remarks of M. de Monteſquieu, as well as from the facts produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Muratori, tom. iii. Diſſert. xxxviii. that the appeals to the juſtice of God by the experiments with fire and water, &amp;c. were practiſed by the people who ſettled in the different provinces of the Roman Empire, before they had recourſe to the judicial combat. The judicial combat, however, was the moſt ancient mode of terminating any controverſy among the barbarous nations in their original ſettlements. This is evident from Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii. c. 118. who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that all Queſtions which were decided among the Romans by legal trial, were terminated among the Germans by arms. The ſame thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the ancient laws and cuſtoms of the Swedes, quoted by Jo. O. Stiernhöök de Jure Sueonum &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorum vetuſto. 4to. Holmiae, 1682. lib. i. c. 7. It is probable, that when the various tribes which invaded the Empire were converted to Chriſtianity, the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the cuſtom of allowing judicial combats to the precepts of religion, was ſo glaring, that, for ſome time, it was aboliſhed, and by degrees, ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which I have mentioned, led them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems likewiſe to be probable from a law quoted
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:011837_0264_0F9D8685AF7B8098"/>
by Stiernhöök in the treatiſe which I have mentioned, that the judicial combat was originally permitted, in order to determine points reſpecting the perſonal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or reputation of individuals, and was afterwards extended not only to criminal caſes, but to queſtions concerning property. The words of the law are, "if any man ſhall ſay to another theſe reproachful words. "you are not a man equal to other men," or, "you have not the heart of a man," and the other ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, "I am a man as good as you." Let them meet on the highway. If he who firſt gave offence appear, and the perſon offended abſent himſelf, let the latter be deemed worſe than he was called; let him not be admitted to give evidence in judgment, either for man or woman, and let him not have the privilege of making a teſtament. If the perſon offended appear, and he who gave offence be abſent, let him call upon the other thrice with a loud voice, and make a mark upon the earth, and then let him who abſented himſelf, be deemed infamous, becauſe he uttered words which he durſt not ſupport. If both ſhall appear properly arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the perſon offended ſhall fall in the combat, let a half compenſation be paid for his death. But if the perſon who gave the offence ſhall fall, let it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his own raſhneſs. The petulance of his tongue hath been fatal to him.

By the laws of the Salians, if any man called another a <hi>hare,</hi> or accuſed him of having left his ſhield in the field of battle, he was ordained to pay a large ſine. Leg.

fatal effects with which it was attended. De Geſtis Longobard. lib. vi. c. 24. Thus the ideas concerning the point of honour, which we are apt to conſider as a modern refinement, as well as the practice of duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to which it gave riſe, are derived from the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our anceſtors, while in a ſtate of ſociety very little improved.</p>
                     <p>AS M. de Monteſquieu's view of this ſubject did not lead him to conſider every circumſtance relative to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial combats, I ſhall mention ſome particular facts neceſſary for the illuſtration of what I have ſaid with reſpect to them. A remarkable inſtance occurs of the deciſion of an abſtract point of law by combat. A queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aroſe in the tenth century concerning the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>repreſentation,</hi> which was not then fixed, though now univerſally eſtabliſhed in every part of Europe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> It was a matter of doubt and diſpute (ſaith the hiſtorian) whether the ſons of a ſon ought to be reckoned among the children of the family, and ſucceed equally with their uncles, if their father happened to die while their grandfather was alive. An aſſembly was called to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on this point, and it was the general opinion, that it ought to be remitted to the examination and deciſion of judges. But the Emperor following a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courſe, and deſirous of dealing honourably with his people and nobles, appointed the matter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by battle between two champions. He who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in behalf of the right of children to repreſent their deceaſed father, was victorious; and it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a perpetual decree, that they ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhare in the inheritance together with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Wittickindus Corbeins, lib. Annal. ap. M. de Lauriere Pref. Ordon. vol. i. p. xxxiii. If we can ſuppoſe the caprice of folly to lead men to any action more extravagant than this, of ſettling a point in law by combat, it muſt be that of referring the truth or falſhood of a religious opinion, to be decided in the ſame manner, To the diſgrace of human reaſon, it has been capable even of this extravagance. A queſtion was agitated in Spain in the eleventh century, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Muſarabic Liturgy and ritual which had been uſed in the churches of Spain, or that approved of by

See of Rome, which differed in many particulars from the other, contained the form of worſhip moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Deity. The Spaniards contended zealouſly for the ritual of their anceſtors. The Popes urged them to receive that to which they had given their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſanction. A violent conteſt aroſe. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles propoſed to decide the controverſy by the ſword. The King approved of this method of deciſion. Two knights in compleat armour entered the liſts. John Ruys de Matanca, the champion of the Muſarabic Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, was victorious. But the Queen and Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Toledo, who favoured the other form, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on having the matter ſubmitted to another trial, and had intereſt enough to prevail in a requeſt, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the laws of combat, which being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an appeal to God, the deciſion ought to have been acquieſced in as final. A great fire was kindled. A copy of each Liturgy was caſt into the flames. It was agreed that the book which ſtood this proof, and remained untouched, ſhould be received in all the churches of Spain. The Muſarabic Liturgy triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe in this trial, and if we may believe Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigo de Toledo, remained unhurt by the fire, when the other was reduced to aſhes. The Queen and Archbiſhop had power or art ſufficient to elude this deciſion alſo, and the uſe of the Muſarabic form of devotion was permitted only in certain churches. A determination no leſs extraordinary than the whole tranſaction. Rodr. de Toledo, quoted by P. Orleans, Hiſt. de Revol. d'Eſpagne, tom. i. p. 217. Mariana, lib. i. c. 18. vol. i. p. 378.—A remarkable proof of the general uſe of trial by combat, and of the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for that mode of deciſion occurs in the laws of the Lombards. It was a cuſtom in the middle ages, that any perſon might chuſe the law to which he would be ſubjected; and by the preſcriptions of that law he was obliged to regulate his tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without being bound to comply with any prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice authorized by other codes of law. Perſons who had ſubjected themſelves to the Roman law, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the ancient juriſprudence, as far as any knowledge of it was retained in thoſe ages of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:011837_0267_0F9D8687F0070758"/>
were exempted from paying any regard to the forms of proceedings eſtabliſhed by the laws of the Burgundians, Lombards, and other barbarous people. But the Emperor Otho, in direct contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this received maxim, ordained, "That all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, under whatever law they lived, even although it were the Roman law, ſhould be bound to conform to the edicts concerning the trial by combat." Leg. Longob. lib. ii. tit. 55. § 38. While the judicial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat ſubſiſted, proof by charters, contracts, or other deeds, became ineffectual; and even this ſpecies of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, calculated to render the proceedings of courts certain and deciſive, was eluded. When a charter or other inſtrument was produced by one of the parties, his opponent might challenge it, affirm that it was falſe and forged, and offer to prove this by combat. Leg. Longob. ib. § 34. It is true, that among the reaſons enumerated by Beaumanoir, on account of which judges might refuſe to permit a trial by combat, one is, "If the point in conteſt can be clearly proved or aſcertained by other evidence." Couſt. de Beauv. ch. 63. p. 323. But that regulation removed the evil only a ſingle ſtep. For the party who ſuſpected that a witneſs was about to depoſe in a manner unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his cauſe, might accuſe him of being ſuborned, give him the lie, and challenge him to combat; if the witneſs was vanquiſhed in battle, no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was admitted, and the party by whom he was ſummoned to appear loſt his cauſe. Leg. Baivar. tit. 16. § 2. Leg. Burgund. tit. 45. Beauman. ch. 61. p. 315. The reaſon given for obliging a witneſs to accept of a defiance, and to defend himſelf by combat, is remarkable, and contains the ſame idea which is ſtill the foundation of what is called the point of honour; "for it is juſt, that if any one affirms that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knows the truth of any thing, and offers to give oath upon it, that he ſhould not heſitate to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the veracity of his affirmation in combat." Leg. Burgund. tit. 45.</p>
                     <p>THAT the trial by judicial combat was eſtabliſhed in every country of Europe, is a fact well known, and requires no proof. That this mode of deciſion was
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:011837_0268_0F9D8689925ECA10"/>
frequent, appears not only from the codes of ancient laws which eſtabliſhed it, but from the earlieſt writers concerning the practice of law in the different nations of Europe. They treat of this cuſtom at great length; they enumerate the regulations concerning it with minute accuracy; and explain them with much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude. It made a capital and extenſive article in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence. There is not any one ſubject in their ſyſtem of law which Beaumanoir, Defontaines, or the compilers of the aſſiſes de Jeruſalem ſeem to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as of greater importance; and none on which they have beſtowed ſo much attention. The ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation will hold with reſpect to the early authors of other nations. It appears from Madox, that trials of this kind were ſo frequent in England, that fines, paid on theſe occaſions, made no inconſiderable branch of the King's revenue. Hiſt. of the Excheq. vol. i. p. 349. A very curious account of a judicial combat between Meſire Robert de Beaumanoir, and Meſire Pierre Tournemine, in preſence of the duke of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne, A. D. 1385, is publiſhed by Maurice Mem. pour ſervir de preuves à l'hiſt. de Bretagne, tom. ii. p. 498. All the formalities obſerved in ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proceedings are there deſcribed more minutely, than in any ancient monument which I have had an opportunity of conſidering. Tournemine was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Beaumanoir of having murdered his brother. The former was vanquiſhed, but was ſaved from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hanged upon the ſpot, by the generous interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his antagoniſt. A good account of the origin of the laws concerning judicial combat, is publiſhed in the hiſtory of Pavia, by Bernado Sacci, lib. ix. c. 8. in Graev. Theſ. Antiquit. Ital. vol. iii. 743.</p>
                     <p>THIS mode of trial was ſo acceptable, that eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks, notwithſtanding the prohibitions of the church, were conſtrained not only to connive at the practice, but to authorize it. A remarkable inſtance of this is produced by Paſquier Recherches, lib. iv. ch. i. p. 350. The abbot Wittikindus, whoſe words I have produced in this note, conſidered the determination of a point in law by combat, as the beſt and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mode of deciſion.

<pb n="249" facs="unknown:011837_0269_0F9D8689AC9CBEF0"/>
combat was fought in the preſence of the Emperor Henry. The archbiſhop Aldebert adviſed him to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a conteſt which had ariſen between two noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his court, by this mode of deciſion. The vanquiſhed combatant, though a perſon of high rank, was beheaded on the ſpot. Chronic. Ditmari Epiſc. Merſb. chez Bouquet Recueil des Hiſt. tom. x. p. 121. Queſtions concerning the property of churches and monaſteries, were decided by combat. In the year 961, a controverſy concerning the church of St. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, whether it belonged to the abbey of Beaulieu, was terminated by judicial combat. Bouquet Recueil des Hiſt. tom. ix. p. 729. Ibid. p. 612, &amp;c. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Henry I. declares, that his law authoriſing the practice of judicial combats, was enacted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and applauſe of many faithful biſhops. Ibid p. 231. So remarkably did the martial ideas of thoſe ages prevail over the genius and maxims of the canon law, which in other inſtances had ſuch credit and authority with eccleſiaſticks. A judicial combat was appointed in Spain, by Charles V. A. D. 1522. The combatants fought in the Emperor's preſence, and the battle was conducted with all the rites preſcribed by the ancient laws of chivalry. The whole tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is deſcribed at great length by Pontus Heuterus Rer. Auſtriac. lib. viii. c. 17. p. 205.</p>
                     <p>THE laſt inſtance which occurs in the hiſtory of France, of a judicial combat authoriſed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, was the famous one between M. Jarnac and M. de la Chaiſtaignerie, A. D. 1547. A trial by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat was appointed in England, A. D. 1571. under the inſpection of the judges in the court of common pleas; and though it was not carried to the ſame extremity with the former, Queen Elizabeth having interpoſed her authority, and enjoined the parties to compound the matter, yet in order to preſerve their honour, the liſts were marked out, and all the forms previous to the combat were obſerved with much ceremony.

                     <p>THE text contains the great outlines which mark the courſe of private and public juriſdiction in the ſeveral nations of Europe. I ſhall here follow more minutely the various ſteps of this progreſs, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is curious and important enough to merit this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The payment of a fine by way of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the perſon or family injured, was the firſt device of a rude people, in order to check the career of private reſentment, and to extinguiſh thoſe <hi>faidae,</hi> or deadly feuds which were proſecuted among them with the utmoſt violence. This cuſtom may be traced back to the ancient Germans. Tacit. de Morib. Ger. c. 21. and prevailed among other uncivilized nations. Many examples of this are collected by the ingenious and learned author of Hiſtorical Law-Tracts, vol. i. p. 41. Theſe fines were aſcertained and levied in three different manners. At firſt they were ſettled by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agreement between the parties at variance. When their rage began to ſubſide, and they felt the bad effects of their continuing in enmity, they came to terms of concord, and the ſatisfaction made was called a <hi>compoſition,</hi> implying that it was fixed by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent. De l'Eſprit des Loix, lib. xxx. c. 19. It is apparent from ſome of the more ancient codes of laws, that when theſe were compiled matters ſtill remained in that ſimple ſtate. In certain caſes, the perſon who had committed an offence was left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the reſentment of thoſe whom he had injured, until he ſhould recover their favour, quoquo modo potuerit. Lex Friſion. tit. 11. § 1. The next mode of levying theſe fines was by the ſentence of arbiters. An arbiter is called in the Regiam majeſtatem amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis compoſitor. lib. 11. c. 4. § 10. He could eſtimate the degree of offence with more impartiality than the parties intereſted, and determine with greater equity
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011837_0271_0F9D868AEFDAC738"/>
what ſatisfaction ought to be demanded. It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to bring an authentic proof of a cuſtom previous to the records preſerved in any nation of Europe. But one of the Formulae Andegavenſes compiled in the ſixth century, ſeems to allude to a tranſaction car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on not by the authority of a judge, but by the mediation of arbiters. Bouquet Recueil des Hiſtor. tom. iv. p. 566. But as an arbiter wanted authority to enforce his deciſions, judges were appointed with compulſive power to oblige both parties to acquieſce in their deciſions. Previous to this laſt ſtep, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient of paying compoſitions was an imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt the pernicious effects of private reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As ſoon as this important change was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the magiſtrate, putting himſelf in place of the perſon injured, aſcertained the compoſition with which he ought to reſt ſatisfied. Every poſſible injury that could occur in the courſe of human ſociety, was conſidered and eſtimated, and the compoſitions due to the perſon aggrieved were fixed with ſuch minute attention as diſcovers, in moſt caſes, amazing diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and delicacy, in ſome inſtances, unaccountable caprice. Beſides the compoſition payable to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate party, a certain ſum, called a <hi>fredum,</hi> was paid to the King or ſtate, as Tacitus expreſſes it, or to the fiſcus, in the language of the barbarous laws. Some authors, blending the refined ideas of modern policy with their reaſonings concerning ancient tranſactions, have imagined that the fredum was a compenſation due to the community, on account of the violation of the publick peace. But it is manifeſtly the price paid to the magiſtrate for the protection which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded againſt the violence of reſentment. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of this was a conſiderable ſtep towards improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in criminal juriſprudence. In ſome of the more ancient codes of laws, the <hi>freda</hi> are altogether omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſo ſeldom mentioned, that it is evident they were but little known. In the latter codes the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum is as preciſely ſpecified as the compoſition. In common caſes it was equal to the third part of the compoſition. Capitul. vol. i. p. 52. In ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary caſes, where it was more difficult to
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:011837_0272_0F9D868BB02921D0"/>
protect the perſon who had committed violence, the fredum was augmented. Capitul. vol. i. p. 515. Theſe freda made a conſiderable branch in the revenues of the barons; and wherever territorial juriſdiction was granted, the royal judges were prohibited from levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any freda. In explaining the nature of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, I have followed, in a great meaſure, the opinion of M. de Monteſquieu, though I know that ſeveral learned antiquarians have taken the word in a different ſenſe. De l'Eſprit des Loix, lib. xxx. c. 20, &amp;c. The great object of judges was to compel the one party to give, and the other to accept the ſatisfaction preſcribed. They multiplied regulations to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and enforced them by grievous penalties. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. § 34. Ib. tit. 37. § 1, 2. Capitul. vol. i. p. 371. § 22. The perſon who received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was obliged to ceaſe from all farther hoſtility, and to confirm his reconciliation with the adverſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by an oath. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. § 8. As an additional and more permanent evidence of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he was required to grant a bond of ſecurity to the perſon from whom he received a compoſition, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving him from all farther proſecution. Marculfus and the other collectors of ancient writs have preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral different forms of ſuch bonds. Marc. lib. 11. § 18. append. § 23. Form. Sirmandicae, § 39. The <hi>Letters of Slanes,</hi> known in the law of Scotland, are perfectly ſimilar to theſe bonds of ſecurity. By the letters of Slanes, the heirs and relations of a perſon who had been murdered, bound themſelves, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of an <hi>Aſſythment</hi> or compoſition paid to them, to forgive, paſs over, and forever forget, and in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion inter all rancour, malice, revenge, prejudice, grudge and reſentment, that they have or may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive againſt the aggreſſor or his poſterity, for the crime which he had committed, and diſcharge him of all action, civil or criminal, againſt him or his eſtate, for now and ever. Syſtem of Stiles by Dallas of St. Martin's, p. 862. In the ancient form of letters of Slanes, the private party not only forgives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, but pardons and grants remiſſion of the crime. This practice, Dallas, reaſoning according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:011837_0273_0F9D868C70D35808"/>
of his own age, conſiders as an encroachment on the rights of ſovereignty, as none, ſays he, could pardon a criminal but the king. Ibid. But in early and rude times, the puniſhment, and the pardon of criminals, were all deeds of the private perſon who was injured. Madox has publiſhed two writs, one in the reign of Edward I. the other in the reign of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III. by which private perſons grant a releaſe or pardon of all treſpaſſes, felonies, robberies, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed. Formul. Anglican. No. 702, 705. In the laſt of theſe inſtruments, ſome regard ſeems to be paid to the rights of the ſovereign, for the pardon is granted <hi>en quant que en nous eſt.</hi> Even after the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the magiſtrate is interpoſed in puniſhing criminals, the puniſhment of criminals is long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered chiefly as a gratification to the reſentment of the perſons who have been injured. In Perſia a murderer is ſtill delivered to the relations of the perſon whom he has ſlain, who put him to death with their own hands. If they refuſe to accept of a ſum of money as a compenſation, the ſovereign, abſolute as he is, cannot pardon the murderer. Tavernier's voyages, book v. c. 5 and 10. By a law in the kingdom of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon as late as the year 1564, the puniſhment of one condemned to death cannot be mitigated but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the parties who have been injured. Fueros &amp; Obſervancias del Reyno de Aragon, p. 204, 6.</p>
                     <p>IF, after all the engagements to ceaſe from enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I have mentioned, any perſon renewed hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities, and was guilty of any violence, either towards the perſon from whom he had received a compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or towards his relations and heirs, this was deemed a moſt heinous crime, and puniſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary rigour. It was an act of direct rebellion againſt the authority of the magiſtrate, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the interpoſition of all his power. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. § 8, 34. Capit. vol. i. p. 371. § 22. Thus the avenging of injuries was taken out of private hands, a legal compoſition was eſtabliſhed, and peace and amity were reſtored under the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the authority of a judge. It is evident, that at the time when the barbarians ſettled in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:011837_0274_0F9D868D30B33960"/>
of the Roman Empire, they had fixed judges eſtabliſhed among them with compulſive authority. Perſons veſted with this character are mentioned by the earlieſt hiſtorians. Du Cange, voc. <hi>Judices.</hi> The right of territorial juriſdiction was not altogether an uſurpation of the feudal barons. There is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that the powerful leaders who ſeized different diſtricts of the countries which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and kept poſſeſſion of them as <hi>allodial</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, aſſumed at the ſame time the right of juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exerciſed it within their own territories. This juriſdiction was ſupreme, and extended to all cauſes. The cleareſt proofs of this are produced by M. Bouquet. Le Droit publique de France eclairci, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 206, &amp;c. The privilege of judging his own vaſſals, appears to have been originally a right inherent in every baron who held a fief. As far back as the archives of nations can conduct us with any certainty, we find the juriſdiction and fief unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One of the earlieſt charters to a layman which I have met with, is that of Ludovicus Pius, A. D. 814. And it contains the right of territorial juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in the moſt expreſs and extenſive terms. Capitul. vol. ii. p. 1405. There are many charters to churches and monaſteries of more early date, containing grants of ſimilar juriſdiction, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting any royal judge to enter the territories of thoſe churches or monaſteries, or to perform any act of judicial authority there. Bouquet. Recuel. des Hiſt. tom. iv. p. 628, 631, 633. tom. v. p. 703, 710, 752, 762. Muratori has publiſhed many very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient charters containing the ſame immunities. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Ital. Diſſert. lxx. In moſt of theſe deeds, the exacting of <hi>Freda</hi> is particularly prohibited, which ſhews that they conſtituted a valuable part of the publick revenue at that juncture. The expence of obtaining a ſentence in a court of juſtice during the middle ages was ſo conſiderable, that this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alone was ſufficient to render men unwilling to decide any conteſt in judicial form. It appears from a charter in the thirteenth century, that the baron who had the right of juſtice, received the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:011837_0275_0F9D868DF0954950"/>
fifth part of the value of every ſubject, the property of which was tried and determined in his court. If, after the commencement of a law ſuit, the parties terminated the conteſt in an amicable manner, or by arbitration, they were nevertheleſs bound to pay the fifth part of the ſubject conteſted to the court before which the ſuit had been brought. Hiſt. de Dauphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè. Geneve, 1722, tom. i. p. 22. Similar to this is a regulation in the charter of liberty granted to the town of Friburg, A. D. 1120. If two of the citizens ſhall quarrel, and if one of them ſhall complain to the ſuperior Lord, or to his judge, and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing the ſuit ſhall be privately reconciled to his adverſary; the judge, if he does not approve of this reconciliation, may compel him to inſiſt in his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; and all who were preſent at the reconciliation ſhall forfeit the favour of the ſuperior Lord. Hiſtoria Zaringo Badenſis. Auctor. Jo. Dan. Schoepflinus. Carolſr. 1765. 4to. vol. v. p. 55.</p>
                     <p>WHAT was the extent of that juriſdiction which thoſe who held fiefs poſſeſſed originally, we cannot now determine with certainty. It is evident that during the diſorders which prevailed in every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Europe, the great vaſſals took advantage of the feebleneſs of their Monarchs, and enlarged their juriſdictions to the utmoſt. As early as the tenth century, the more powerful barons had uſurped the right of deciding all cauſes, whether civil or crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. They had acquired the <hi>High Juſtice</hi> as well as the <hi>Low.</hi> Eſtabl. de St. Louis, lib. i. c. 24, 25. Their ſentences were final, and there lay no appeal from them to any ſuperior court. Several ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this are collected by Bruſſel. Traité des Fiefs, liv. iii. c. 11, 12, 13. Not ſatisfied with this, the more potent barons got their territories erected into <hi>Regalities,</hi> with almoſt every royal prerogative and juriſdiction. Inſtances of theſe were frequent in France. Bruſſ. ib. In Scotland, where the power of the feudal nobles became exorbitant, they were very numerous. Hiſtorical Law Tracts, vol. i. tract. vi. Even in England, though the authority of the Norman Kings circumſcribed the juriſdiction of the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:011837_0276_0F9D868EB1333ED0"/>
barons more than in any feudal kindom, ſeveral counties palatine were erected, into which the king's judges could not enter, and no writ could come in the King's name, until it received the ſeal of the county palatine. Spelman. Gloſſ. voc. <hi>Commites Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini;</hi> Blackſtone's Commentaries on the Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, vol. iii. p. 78. Theſe lords of regalities had a right to claim or reſcue their vaſſals from the King's judges, if they aſſumed any juriſdiction over them. Bruſſel ubi ſupra. In the law of Scotland this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege was termed the right of <hi>repledging;</hi> and the frequency of it not only interrupted the courſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but gave riſe to great diſorders in the exerciſe of it. Hiſt. Law Tracts, ib. The juriſdiction of the counties palatine was productive of like inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in England.</p>
                     <p>THE remedies provided by Princes againſt the bad effects of theſe uſurpations were various, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applied. Under Charlemagne and his immediate deſcendants, the regal prerogative ſtill retained great vigour, and the <hi>Duces, Comites,</hi> and <hi>Miſſi Dominici,</hi> the former of whom were ordinary and fixed judges, the latter extraordinary and itinerant judges, in the different provinces of their extenſive dominions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed a juriſdiction co-ordinate with the barons in ſome caſes, and ſuperior to them in others. Du Cange voc. <hi>Dux. Comites</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſſi.</hi> Murat. Antiq. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert. viii. &amp; ix. But under the feeble race of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs who ſucceeded them, the authority of the royal judges declined, and the barons uſurped that unlimited juriſdiction which has been deſcribed. Louis VI. of France attempted to revive the function of the <hi>Miſſi Dominici</hi> under the title of <hi>Juges des Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts,</hi> but the barons were become too powerful to bear ſuch an encroachment on their juriſdiction, and he was obliged to deſiſt from employing them. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut. A bregé Chron. tom. ii. p. 730. His ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors (as has been obſerved) had recourſe to expedients leſs alarming. The appeal <hi>de defaute de Droit,</hi> or on account of the refuſal of juſtice, was the firſt which was attended with any conſiderable effect. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the maxims of feudal law, if a baron had
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:011837_0277_0F9D868F71DBCF28"/>
not as many vaſſals as enabled him to try by their peers, the parties who offered to plead in his court, or if he delayed or refuſed to proceed in the trial, the cauſe might be carried, by appeal, to the court of the ſuperior lord of whom the baron held, and tried there. De l'Eſprit des Loix, liv. xxviii. c. 28. Du Cange voc. <hi>defectus Juſtitiae.</hi> The number of Peers or aſſeſſors in the courts of Barons was frequently very conſiderable. It appears from a criminal trial in the court of the viſcount de Lautrec, A. D. 1299, that upwards of two hundred perſons were preſent, and aſſiſted in the trial, and voted in paſſing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hiſt. de Langued. par D. D. De Vic. &amp; Vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette, tom, iv. Preuves, p. 114. As the right of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction had been uſurped by many inconſiderable barons, they were often unable to hold courts. This gave frequent occaſion to ſuch appeals, and rendered the practice familiar. By degrees, ſuch appeals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be taken from the courts of the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful barons, and it is evident, from a deciſion record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Bruſſel, that the royal judges were willing to give countenance to any pretext for them. Traité des Fiefs, tom. i. p. 235, 261. This ſpecies of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal had leſs effect in abridging the juriſdiction of the nobles, than the appeal on account of the injuſtice of the ſentence. When the feudal monarchs were pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and their judges poſſeſſed extenſive authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch appeals ſeem to have been frequent. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. vol. 1. p. 175, 180; and they were made in a manner ſuitable to the rudeneſs of a ſimple age. The perſons aggrieved reſorted to the palace of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and with outcries and loud noiſe called to him for redreſs. Capitul. lib. iii. c. 59. Chronic. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbergienſe ap. Mencken. Script. German, vol. ii. p. 284. b. In the kingdom of Aragon, the appeals to the <hi>Juſtiza</hi> or ſupreme judge were taken in ſuch a form as ſuppoſed the appellant to be in immediate danger of death, or of ſome violent outrage; he ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the preſence of the judge, crying with a loud voice, <hi>Avi, Avi, Fuerza, Fuerza,</hi> thus imploring (as it were) the inſtant interpoſition of that ſupreme judge in order to ſave him.

The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this ſubordination which appeals eſtabliſhed, in introducing attention, equity, and conſiſtency of deciſion into courts of judicature, were ſoon conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous; and almoſt all cauſes of importance were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to be finally determined in the King's courts. Bruſſel, tom. i. 252. Various circumſtances which contributed towards the introduction and frequency of ſuch appeals, are enumerated De l'Eſprit de Loix, liv. xxviii. c. 27. Nothing however, was of ſuch effect as the attention which monarchs gave to the conſtitution and dignity of their courts of juſtice. It was the ancient cuſtom for the feudal monarchs to preſide themſelves in their courts, and to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter juſtice in perſon. Marculf. lib. i. § 25. Murat, Diſſert. xxxi. Charlemagne, whilſt he was dreſſing, uſed to call parties into his preſence, and having heard and conſidered the ſubject of litigation, gave judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning it. Eginhartus vita Caroli magni cited by Madox Hiſt. of Exchequer, vol. 1. p. 91. This could not fail of rendering their courts reſpectable. St. Louis, who encouraged to the utmoſt the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of appeals, revived this ancient cuſtom, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred juſtice in perſon with all the ancient ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. "I have often ſeen the ſaint," ſays Joinville. "ſit under the ſhade of an oak in the wood of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes, when all who had any complaint, freely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him. At other times he gave orders to ſpread a carpet in a garden, and ſeating himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, heard the cauſes that were brought before him." Hiſt. de St. Louis, p. 13. edit. 1761. Princes of inferior rank, who poſſeſſed the right of juſtice, ſometimes diſpenſed it in perſon, and preſided in their tribunals. Two inſtances of this occur with reſpect to the Dauphines of Vienne. Hiſt. de Dauphinè, tom. i. p. 18. tom. ii. p. 257. But as Kings and Princes could not decide every cauſe in perſon, nor bring them all to be determined in the ſame court; they appointed <hi>Baillis,</hi> with a right of juriſdiction, in different diſtricts of their kingdom. Theſe poſſeſſed

Bruſſel, liv. ii. c. 35. When the King had a court eſtabliſhed in different quarters of his dominions, this invited his ſubjects to have recourſe to it. It was the private intereſt of the <hi>Baillis,</hi> as well as an object of public policy, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their juriſdiction. They took advantage of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very defect in the rights of the barons, and of every error in their proceedings, to remove cauſes out of their courts, and to bring them under their own cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. There was a diſtinction in the feudal law, and an extremely ancient one, between the high juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and the low. Capitul. 3. A. D. 812. § 4. A. D. 815. § 3. Eſtabl. de St. Louis, liv. i. c. 40. Many barons poſſeſſed the latter juriſdiction who had no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the former.

This juriſdiction, however, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris acquired very ſlowly, and the great vaſſals of the crown made violent efforts in order to obſtruct the attempts of this parliament to extend its authority. Towards the cloſe of the thirteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Philip the fair was obliged to prohibit his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from taking cogniſance of certain appeals brought into it from the courts of the Count of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne, and to recognize his right of ſupreme and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal juriſdiction. Memoirs pour ſervir de Preuves à l'Hiſtoire de Bretagne par Morice, tom. i. p. 1037. 1074. Charles VI. at the end of the following cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury was obliged to confirm the rights of the Dukes of Bretagne in more ample form. Ibid. tom. ii. p. 580, 581. So violent was the oppoſition of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons to this right of appeal which they conſidered as fatal to their privileges and power, that the authors of the <hi>Encyclopedie</hi> have mentioned ſeveral inſtances in which barons put to death, or mutilated, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated the goods of ſuch as ventured to appeal from the ſentences pronounced in their courts, to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris, tom. xii.

                     <p>THE progreſs of juriſdiction in the other feudal kingdoms was in a great meaſure ſimilar to that which we have traced in France. In England, the territorial juriſdiction of the barons was both ancient and extenſive. Leg. Edw. Conf. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 5 and 9. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Norman conqueſt it became more ſtrictly feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; and it is evident from facts recorded in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh hiſtory, as well as from the inſtitution of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Palatine, which I have already mentioned, that the uſurpations of the nobles in England were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to thoſe of their contemporaries on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The ſame expedients were employed to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe or aboliſh thoſe dangerous juriſdictions. William the Conqueror eſtabliſhed a conſtant court in the hall of his palace; from which the four courts now entruſted with the adminiſtration of juſtice in England took their riſe.

The privileges of the Counties Palatine were gradually limited; with reſpect to ſome points they were aboliſhed; and the adminiſtration of juſtice was brought into the King's courts, or before judges of his appointment.

                     <p>IT is not eaſy to fix with preciſion the period, at which Eccleſiaſticks firſt began to claim exemption from the civil juriſdiction. It is certain, that during the early and pureſt ages of the church, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to no ſuch immunity. The authority of the civil magiſtrates extended to all perſons, and to all cauſes. This fact has not only been clearly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Proteſtant authors, but is admitted by many Roman Catholicks of eminence, and particularly by the writers in defence of the liberties of the Gallican church. There are ſeveral original papers publiſhed by Muratori, which ſhew that in the ninth and tenth centuries, cauſes of the greateſt importance relating to eccleſiaſticks were ſtill determined by civil judges. Antiq. Ital. vol. v. Diſſert. lxx. Eccleſiaſticks did not ſhake off all at once their ſubjection to civil courts. This privilege, like their other uſurpations, was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſlowly, and ſtep by ſtep. This exemption ſeems at firſt to have been merely an act of complaiſance, flowing from veneration for their character. Thus from a charter of Charlemagne in favour of the church of Mans, A. D. 796, to which M. l'Abbe de Foy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in his Notice de Diplomes, tom. i. p. 201, that monarch directs his judges, if any difference ſhould ariſe between the adminiſtrators of the revenues of that church and any perſon whatever, not to ſummon the adminiſtrators to appear in mallo publico; but firſt of all to meet with them, and to endeavour to accommodate the difference in an amicable manner. This indulgence was in proceſs of time improved into a legal exemption; which was founded on the ſame ſuperſtitious reſpect of the laity for the clerical charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and function. A remarkable inſtance of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in a charter of Frederick Barbaroſſa, A. D. 1172, to the monaſtery of Altenburg. He grants them ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium non tantum ſanguinolentis plagae, ſed vitae &amp; mortis; he prohibits any of the royal judges from diſturbing their juriſdiction; and the reaſon which he gives for this ample conceſſion is, nam quorum ex

                     <p>IT is not neceſſary for illuſtrating what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the text, that I ſhould deſcribe the manner in which the code of the canon law was compiled, and ſhew that the doctrines in it moſt favourable to the power of the clergy, are founded on ignorance, or ſupported by fraud and forgery. The reader will find a full account of theſe in Gerard. Van Maſtricht, Hiſtoria Juris Eccleſiaſtici, &amp; in Science de Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment par M. Real, tom. vii. c. 1. &amp; 3. § 2, 3, &amp;c. The hiſtory of the progreſs and extent of eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, with an account of the arts which the clergy employed, in order to draw cauſes of every kind into the ſpiritual courts, is no leſs curious, and would throw a great light upon many of the cuſtoms and inſtitutions of the dark ages; but it is likewiſe foreign from the preſent ſubject. Du Cange in his Gloſſary, voc. <hi>Curia Chriſtianitatis,</hi> has collected moſt of the cauſes with reſpect to which the clergy arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated an excluſive juriſdiction, and refers to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors or original papers, which confirm his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Giannonè in his Civil Hiſtory of Naples, lib. xix. § 3. has ranged theſe under proper heads, and ſcrutinizes the pretenſions of the church with his uſual boldneſs and diſcernment. M. Fleury obſerves, that the clergy multiplied at ſuch a rate, the pretexts for extending the authority of the ſpiritual courts, that it was in their power to withdraw every perſon and every cauſe from the juriſdiction of the civil magiſtrate. Hiſt. Eccleſ. tom. xix. Diſc. Prelim. 16. But how ill founded ſoever the juriſdiction of the clergy may be, or whatever might be the abuſes to which their manner of exerciſing it gave riſe, the principles and forms of their juriſprudence were far more perfect, than that which was known in the civil courts. It is probable, that eccleſiaſticks never ſubmitted during any period of the middle ages, to the laws contained in the codes of the barbarous nations, but were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned entirely by the Roman law. They regulated
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:011837_0284_0F9D869588026A40"/>
all their tranſactions by ſuch of its maxims as were preſerved by tradition, or were contained in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſian code, and other books extant among them. This we learn from a cuſtom which prevailed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in thoſe ages. Every perſon was permitted to chuſe among the various codes of laws then in force, that to which he was willing to conform. In any tranſaction of importance, it was uſual for the perſons contracting to mention the law to which they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it might be known how any controverſy that ſhould ariſe between them was to be decided. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable proofs of this occur in the charters of the middle ages. But the clergy conſidered it as ſuch a valuable privilege of their order to be governed by the Roman law, that when any perſon entered into holy orders, it was uſual for him to renounce the laws to which he had been formerly ſubject, and to declare that he now ſubmitted to the Roman law. Conſtat me Johannem clericum, filium quondam Verandi, qui profeſſus ſum, ex natione mea, lege vivere Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobardorum, ſed tamen, pro honore eccleſiaſtico, lege nunc videor vivere Romana.

                     <p>THE code of the cannon law began to be compiled early in the ninth century. Mem. de l'Acad. des In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. tom. xviii. p. 346, &amp;c. It was above two centuries after that before any collection was made of thoſe cuſtoms, which were the rule of judgment in the courts of the barons. Spiritual judges decided, of courſe, according to written and known laws; Lay judges, left without any fixed guide, were directed by looſe traditionary cuſtoms. But beſides this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral advantage of the canon law, its forms and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were more conſonant to reaſon, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the equitable deciſion of every point in controverſy, than thoſe which prevailed in lay courts. It appears from Notes XXI. and XXII. concerning private wars, and the trial by combat, that the whole ſpirit of eccleſiaſtical juriſprudence was adverſe to theſe ſanguinary cuſtoms which were deſtructive of juſtice;
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:011837_0285_0F9D86962F458060"/>
and the whole force of eccleſiaſtical authority was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted to aboliſh them, and to ſubſtitute trials by law and evidence in their room. Almoſt all the forms in lay courts which contribute to eſtabliſh, and continue to preſerve order in judicial proceedings, are borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the canon law. Fleury Inſtit. du droit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, part iii. c. 6. p. 52. St. Louis in his Eſtabliſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens confirms many of his new regulations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property, and the adminiſtration of juſtice, by the authority of the canon law, from which he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Thus, for inſtance, the firſt hint of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moveables for the recovery of a debt, was taken from the canon law. Eſtabl. liv. ii. c. 21 and 40. And likewiſe the ceſſio bonorum, by a perſon who was inſolvent. Ibid. In the ſame manner he eſtabliſhed new regulations with reſpect to the effects of perſons dying inteſtate, liv. i. c. 89. Theſe and many other ſalutary regulations, the Canoniſts borrowed from the Roman law. Many other examples might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of more perfect juriſprudence in the canon law than was known in lay courts. For that reaſon it was deemed an high privilege to be ſubject to eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction. Among the many immunities, by which men were allured to engage in the dangerous expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the recovery of the Holy Land, one of the moſt conſiderable was the declaring thoſe who took the Croſs to be ſubject only to the ſpiritual courts.

                     <p>THE rapidity with which the knowledge and ſtudy of the Roman law ſpread over Europe, is amazing. The copy of the Pandects was found at Amalphi, A. D. 1137. Irnerius opened a college of civil law at Bologne a few years after Giann. Hiſt. book xi. c. 2. It began to be taught as a part of academical learning in different parts of France before the middle of the century. Vaccarius gave lectures on the civil law at Oxford as early as the year 1147. A regular ſyſtem of feudal law, formed plainly in imitation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man code, was compoſed by two Milaneſe lawyers
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:011837_0286_0F9D8696F38E3E00"/>
about the year 1150. Gratian publiſhed the code of canon law, with large additions and emendations, about the ſame time. The earlieſt collection of theſe cuſtoms, which ſerved as the rules of deciſion in the courts of juſtice, is the <hi>Aſſiſes de Jeruſalem.</hi> They were compiled, as the preamble informs us, in the year 1099, and are called Jus Conſuetudinarium quo regebatur regnum orientale. Willerm. Tyr. lib. xix. c. 2. But peculiar circumſtances were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this early compilation. The victorious Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaders ſettled as a colony in a foreign country, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers from all the different nations of Europe compoſed this new ſociety. It was neceſſary on that account to aſcertain the laws and cuſtoms which were to regulate the tranſactions of buſineſs, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice among them. But there was at that time no collection of cuſtoms, and no attempt to render law fixed in any country of Europe. The firſt undertaking of that kind was by Glanville, Lord Chief Juſtice of England, in his Tractatus de Legibus &amp; Conſuetudinibus Angliae, compoſed about the year 1181. The Regiam Majeſtatem in Scotland, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to David I. ſeems to be an imitation, and a ſervile one of Glanville. Pierre de Fontaines, who tells us that he was the firſt who had attempted ſuch a work in France, compoſed his <hi>Conſeil,</hi> which contains an account of the cuſtoms of the country of Verman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois, in the reign of St. Louis, which began, A. D. 1226. <hi>Beaumanoir,</hi> the author of the <hi>Couſtumes de Beauvoiſis,</hi> lived about the ſame time. The Eſtabliſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of St. Louis, containing a large collection of the cuſtoms which prevailed within the royal domains, were publiſhed by the authority of that monarch. As ſoon as men became acquainted with the advantages of having written cuſtoms and laws to which they could have recourſe on every occaſion, the method of collecting them became common. Charles VII. of France, by an ordonance, A. D. 1453, appointed the cuſtomary laws in every province of France to be collected and arranged. Velly and Villaret. Hiſtoire tom. xvi. p. 113. His ſucceſſor, Louis XI. renewed the injunction. But this ſalutary undertaking hath
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:011837_0287_0F9D8697B4B70A78"/>
never been fully executed, and the French juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence remains more obſcure and uncertain than if theſe prudent regulations of their monarch had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. A practice was eſtabliſhed in the middle ages, which affords the cleareſt proof that judges while they had no other rule to direct their decrees but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written and traditionary cuſtoms, were often at a loſs how to find out the facts and principles, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which they were bound to decide. They were obliged in dubious caſes to call a certain number of old men, and to lay the caſe before them, that they might inform them what was the practice or cuſtom with regard to the point. This was called <hi>Enqueſte par tourbe.</hi> Du Cange, voc. <hi>Turba.</hi> The effects of the revival of the Roman juriſprudence have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by M. de Monteſquieu, liv. xxviii. c. 42. and by Mr Hume, Hiſt. of England, vol. ii. p. 441. I have adopted many of their ideas. Who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to review any ſubject which ſuch writers have conſidered, without receiving from them light and information? At the ſame time I am convinced that the knowledge of the Roman law was not ſo entirely loſt in Europe during the middle ages, as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed. My ſubject does not require me to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this point. Many ſtriking facts with regard to it are collected by Donato Antonio D'Aſti Dal' Uſo e autorita della ragione civilè nelle provincie dell' Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio Occidentale. Nap. 1751. 2 vol. 8vo.</p>
                     <p>THAT the civil law is intimately connected with the municipal juriſprudence in ſeveral countries of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, is a fact ſo well known, that it needs no illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Even in England, where the Common law is ſuppoſed to form a ſyſtem perfectly diſtinct from the Roman code, and although thoſe who apply in that country to the ſtudy of the Common law boaſt, with affectation, of this diſtinction, it is evident that many of the ideas and maxims of the civil law are incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Engliſh juriſprudence. This is well il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the ingenious and learned author or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Statutes, chiefly the more ancient. 2d edit. p. 66.</p>

                     <p>THE whole hiſtory of the middle ages makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that war was the ſole profeſſion of gentlemen, and the only ſubject attended to in their education, Even after ſome change in manners began to take place, and the civil arts of life had acquired ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the ancient ideas with reſpect to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments neceſſary for a perſon of noble birth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long in force. In the Memoires de Fleuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, p. 9. &amp;c. we have an account of the youthful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and occupations of Francis I. and they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together martial and athletic. That father of letters owed his reliſh for them, not to education, but to his own good ſenſe, and good taſte. The manners of the ſuperior order of eccleſiaſtics, during the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ages, furniſh the ſtrongeſt proof, that the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of profeſſions was ſcarce known in Europe. The functions and character of the clergy are obviouſly very different from thoſe of laymen; and among the inferior orders of churchmen, this conſtituted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct character, ſeparate from that of their citizens. But the dignified eccleſiaſtics, who were frequently of noble birth, were above ſuch a diſtinction; they retained the idea of what belonged to them as gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and in ſpite of the decrees of Popes, or the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of counſels, they bore arms, led their vaſſals to the field, and fought at their head in battle. Among them the prieſthood was ſcarce a ſeparate profeſſion; the military accompliſhments which they thought eſſential to them as gentlemen, were cultivated; the theological ſcience, and pacific virtues ſuitable to their ſpiritual function, were neglected and deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>AS ſoon as the ſcience of law became a laborious ſtudy, and the practice of it a ſeparate profeſſion, ſuch as roſe, to eminence in it obtained honours formerly appropriated to ſoldiers. Knighthood was the moſt illuſtrious mark of diſtinction during ſeveral ages, and conferred privileges to which rank or birth alone were not entitled. To this high dignity perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for their knowledge of law were advanced, and

by that were placed on a level with thoſe whom their military talents had rendered conſpicuous. <hi>Miles Juſtitiae, Miles Literatus</hi> became common titles. Matthew Paris mentions ſuch knights as early as A. D. 1251. If a judge attained a certain rank in the courts of juſtice, that alone gave him a right to the honour of knighthood.

                     <p>THE chief intention of theſe notes, was to bring at once under the view of my readers, ſuch facts and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as tend to illuſtrate or confirm what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that part of the hiſtory to which they refer. When theſe lay ſcattered in many different authors, and were taken from books not generally known, or which it would be diſagreeable to conſult, I thought it would be of advantage to collect them together. But when everything neceſſary for the proof or illuſtration of my narrative or reaſonings may be found in any one book which is generally known, or deſerves to be ſo. I ſhall ſatisfy myſelf with referring to it. This is the caſe with reſpect to Chivalry.

                     <p>THE ſubject of my enquiries does not call me to write a hiſtory of the progreſs of ſcience. The facts and obſervations which I have produced are ſufficient to illuſtrate the effects of its progreſs upon manners and
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:011837_0290_0F9D869CEE71F808"/>
the ſtate of of ſociety. While ſcience was altogether extinct in the weſtern parts of Europe, it was cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Conſtantinople and other parts of the Grecian Empire. But the ſubtile genius of the Greeks turned almoſt entirely to theological diſputation. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins borrowed that ſpirit from them, and many of the controverſies which ſtill occupy, and divide Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, took their riſe among the Greeks, from whom the other Europeans derived a conſiderable part of their knowledge. See the teſtimony of Aeneas Sylvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ap Coringium de antiq. academicis, p. 43. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire literaire de France, tom. vii. p. 113, &amp;c. tom. ix. p. 151, &amp;c. Soon after the Empire of the Caliphs was eſtabliſhed in the Eaſt, ſome illuſtrious princes aroſe among them, who encouraged ſcience. But when the Arabians turned their attention to the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature cultivated by the ancient Greeks and Romans, the chaſte and correct taſte of their works of genius appeared frigid, and unanimated to a people of a more warm imagination. It was impoſſible for them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the poets and hiſtorians of Athens, or of Rome. But they were ſenſible of the merit of their philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. The operations of the intellect are more fixed and uniform than thoſe of the fancy or taſte. Truth makes an impreſſion nearly the ſame in every place; the ideas of what is beautiful, elegant, or ſublime, vary in different climates. The Arabians, though they neglected Homer, tranſlated the moſt eminent of the Greek philoſophers into their own language; and, guided by their precepts and diſcoveries, applied themſelves with great ardour to the ſtudy of geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, aſtronomy, medicine, dialectics and metaphyſics. In the three former they made conſiderable and uſeful improvements, which have contributed not a little to advance thoſe ſciences to that high degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have attained. In the two latter, they chooſe Ariſtotle for their guide, and refining on the ſubtle and diſtinguiſhing ſpirit which characterizes his philoſophy, they rendered it altogether frivolous or unintelligible. The ſchools eſtabliſhed in the Eaſt for teaching and cultivating theſe ſciences, were in high reputation. They communicated their love of ſcience
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:011837_0291_0F9D869D0818E810"/>
to their countrymen, who conquered Aſia and Spain; and the ſchools inſtituted there were little inferior in fame to thoſe in the Eaſt. Many of the perſons who diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their proficiency in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were educated among the Arabians. Bruckerus collects many inſtances of this. Hiſtor. Philoſ. v. iii. p. 681, &amp;c. Almoſt all the men eminent for ſcience during ſeveral centuries, were inſtructed in the ſciences by the Arabians. The firſt knowledge of the Ariſtotelian philoſophy in the middle ages, was acquired by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his works out of the Arabick. The Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an commentators were deemed the moſt ſkilful and authentic guides in the ſtudy of his ſyſtem. Conring. antiq. acad. Diſſ. iii. p. 95, &amp;c. Supplem. p. 241, &amp;c. Murat. antiquit. Ital. vol. iii. p. 932, &amp;c. From them the ſchoolmen derived the genius and principles of their philoſophy, which contributed ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the progreſs of true ſcience.</p>
                     <p>THE eſtabliſhment of Colleges or univerſities is a remarkable aera in literary hiſtory. The ſchools in cathedrals and monaſteries confined themſelves chiefly to the teaching of grammar. There were only one or two maſters employed in that office. But in colleges, profeſſors were appointed to teach all the different parts of ſcience. The time that ought to be allotted to the ſtudy of each was aſcertained. A regular form of trying the proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſtudents was preſcribed; and academical titles and honours were conferred on ſuch as acquitted themſelves with approbation. A good account of the origin and nature of theſe is given by Seb. Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meiſterus Antiquitates Roſtochienſes, ſive, Hiſtoria Urbis &amp; Academiae Roſtoch. ap. Monumenta inedita Rer. Germ. per E. J. de Weſtphalen, vol. iii. p. 781. Lipſ. 1743. The firſt obſcure mention of theſe aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical degrees in the Univerſity of Paris, (from which the other univerſities in Europe have borrowed moſt of their cuſtoms and inſtitutions) occurs, A. D. 1215. Crevier. hiſt. de l'univ. de Paris, tom. i. p. 296, &amp;c. They were compleatly eſtabliſhed, A. D. 1231. lb. 248. It is unneceſſary to enumerate the ſeveral
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:011837_0292_0F9D869DDD54AAC0"/>
privileges to which batchelors, maſters and doctors were entitled. One circumſtance is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the high degree of eſtimation in which they were held. Doctors in the different faculties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knights for the precedence, and the diſpute was terminated in many inſtances by advancing the former to the dignity of knighthood, the high prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of which I have mentioned. It was even aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that a doctor had a right to that title without creation. Bartolus taught—doctorem actualiter regentem in jure civili per decennium effici militem ipſo facto. Honore de St. Marie Diſſert. p. 165. This was called Chevalierie de lectures, and the perſons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to that dignity, milites Clerici. Theſe new eſtabliſhments for education, together with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary honours conferred on learned men, greatly increaſed the number of ſcholars. In the year 1262, there were ten thouſand ſtudents in the univerſity of Bologna; and it appears from the hiſtory of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, that law was the only ſcience taught in it at that time. In the year 1340, there were thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in the univerſity of Oxford. Speed's Chron. ap. Anderſon's Chronol. Deduction of Commerce, vol. i. p. 172. In the ſame century, ten thouſand perſons voted in a queſtion agitated in the univerſity of Paris; and as graduates alone were admitted to that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the number of ſtudents muſt have been vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great. Velly Hiſt. de France, tom. xi. p. 147. There were indeed few univerſities in Europe at that time; but ſuch a number of ſtudents may nevertheleſs be produced as a proof of the extraordinary ardour with which men turned to the ſtudy of ſcience in thoſe ages; it ſhows likewiſe that they already began to conſider other profeſſions than that of a ſoldier as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and uſeful.</p>

                     <p>MANY proofs occur in hiſtory of the little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between nations during the middle ages. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the tenth century, Count Bouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard intending to found a monaſtery at St. Maur des Foſſes, near Paris, applied to an Abbot of Clugny in Burgundy, famous for his ſanctity, intreating him to conduct the monks thither. The language in which he addreſſed that holy man is ſingular: He tells him that he had undertaken the labour of ſuch a great journey; that he was fatigued with the length of it, therefore hoped to obtain his requeſt, and that his journey into ſuch a diſtant country ſhould not be in vain. The anſwer of the abbot is ſtill more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: He refuſed to comply with his deſire, as it would be extreamly fatiguing to go along with him into a ſtrange and unknown region. Vita Burchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di venerabiles Comites ap. Bouquet Rec. des Hiſt. vol. x. p. 351. Even ſo late as the beginning of the twelfth century, the monks of Ferrieres in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe of Sens did not know that there was ſuch a city as Tournay in Flanders; and the monks of St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin of Tournay, were equally unacquainted with the ſituation of Ferrrieres. A tranſaction in which they were both concerned, made it neceſſary for them to have ſome intercourſe. The mutual intereſt of both monaſteries prompted each to find out the ſituation of the other. After a long ſearch, which is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcribed, the diſcovery was made by accident. Herimannus Abbas de Reſtauratione St. Martini Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacenſis ap. Dacher. Spicel. vol. xii. p. 400. The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the middle ages with reſpect to the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and geography of remote countries was ſtill more remarkable. The moſt ancient geographical chart which now remains as a monument of the ſtate of that ſcience in Europe during the middle ages, is found in a manuſcript of the Chronique de St. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys. There the three parts of the earth then known
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:011837_0294_0F9D869F3B8ACC40"/>
are ſo repreſented, that Jeruſalem is placed in the middle of the globe, and Alexandria appears to be as near to it as Nazareth. Mem. de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tom. xvi. p. 185, There ſeem to have been no inns or houſes of entertainment for the reception of travellers during the middle ages. Murat. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Ital. vol. iii. p. 581, &amp;c. This is a proof of the little intercourſe which took place between different nations. Among people whoſe manners are ſimple, and who are ſeldom viſited by ſtrangers, hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a virtue of the firſt rank. This duty of hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo neceſſary in that ſtate of ſociety which took place during the middle ages, that it was not conſidered as one of thoſe virtues which men may practiſe or not, according to the temper of their minds, and the generoſity of their hearts. Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was enforced by ſtatutes, and thoſe who neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this duty were liable to puniſhment. Quicumque hoſpiti venienti lectum, aut focum negaverit, trium ſelidorum inlatione mulctetur, Leg. Burgund. tit. xxxviii. § 1. Si quis homini aliquo pergenti in iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere manſionem vetaverit ſexaginta ſolidos componat in publico. Capitul. lib. vi. § 82. This increaſe of the penalty, at a period ſo long after that in which the laws of the Burgundians were publiſhed, and when the ſtate of ſociety was much improved, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. Other laws of the ſame purport are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Jo. Fred. Polac Syſtema Juriſprud. Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicae, Lipſ. 1733. p. 75. The laws of the Slavi were more rigorous than any that he mentions; they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, "that the moveables of an inhoſpitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be confiſcated, and his houſe burnt. They were even ſo ſolicitous for the entertainment of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that they permitted the landlord to ſteal for the entertainment of his gueſt." Quot noctu furatus fueris, eras appone hoſpitibus. Rerum Mecleburgicar. lib. viii. a Mat. Jo. Beehr. Lipſ. 1751. p. 50. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe laws or of that ſtate of ſociety which made it proper to enact them, hoſpitality abounded while the intercourſe among men was inconſiderable, and ſecured the ſtranger a kind reception under every roof where he choſe to take ſhelter. This two proves clearly, that the intercourſe among men was rare
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011837_0295_0F9D869FF08D4688"/>
for as ſoon as this increaſed, what was a pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a burden, and the entertaining of travellers was converted into a branch of commerce.</p>
                     <p>BUT the laws of the middle ages afford a proof ſtill more convincing of the ſmall intercourſe between dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations. The genius of the Feudal ſyſtem, as well as the ſpirit of jealouſy which always accompanies ignorance, joined in diſcouraging ſtrangers from ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in any country. If a perſon removed from one province in a kingdom to another, he was bound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a year and a day, to acknowledge himſelf the vaſſal of the baron in whoſe eſtate he ſettled; if he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to do ſo, he became liable to a penalty, and if at his death he neglected to leave a certain legacy to the baron within whoſe territories he reſided, all his goods were confiſcated. The hardſhips impoſed on foreigners ſettling in a ſtrange country, were ſtill more intolerable. In more early times, the ſuperior lord of any territory, in which a foreigner ſettled, might ſeize his perſon, and reduce him to ſervitude. Very ſtriking inſtances of this occur in the hiſtory of the middle ages. The cruel depredations of the Normans in the ninth century, obliged many inhabitants of the maritime provinces of France, to fly into the interior parts of the kingdom. But inſtead of being received with that humanity to which their wretched condition entitled them, they were reduced to a ſtate of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Both the civil and eccleſiaſtical powers found it neceſſary to interpoſe, in order to put a ſtop to this barbarous practice. Potgieſſer. de Statu Servor. lib. i. c. 1. § 16. In other countries, the laws permitted the inhabitants of the maritime provinces, to reduce ſuch as were ſhipwrecked on their coaſt, to ſervitude. Ibid. § 17. This barbarous cuſtom prevailed in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Europe. The practice of ſeizing the goods of perſons who had been ſhipwrecked, and of confiſcating as the property of the lord on whoſe manor they were thrown, ſeems to have been univerſal. De Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Monum. inedita Rer. Germ. vol. iv. p. 907, &amp;c. et Du Cange, voc <hi>Laganum,</hi> Beehr. Rer. Mecleb. lib. p. 512. Among the ancient Welſh, three ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, a madman, a ſtranger, and a leper, might be
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:011837_0296_0F9D86A0B3024DC8"/>
killed with impunity. Leges Hoel Dda, quoted in obſervat. on the Statutes, chiefly the more ancient, p. 22. M. de Lauriere produces ſeveral ancient deeds which prove, that in different provinces of France, ſtrangers became the ſlaves of the lord on whoſe lands they ſettled. Gloſſaire du Droit Francois, Art. <hi>Aubai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> p. 92. Beaumanoir ſays, "that there are ſeveral places in France, in which, if a ſtranger fixes his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a year and a day, he becomes the ſlave of the lord of the manor. Couſt. de Beauv. ch. 45. p. 254. But as a practice ſo contrary to humanity could not ſubſiſt, the ſuperior lords found it neceſſary to reſt ſatisfied with levying certain annual taxes from aliens, by impoſing upon them ſome extraordinary duties or ſervices. But when any ſtranger died, he could not convey his effects by a will; and all his real as well as perſonal eſtate fell to the king, or to the lord of the barony, to the excluſion of his natural heirs. This is termed in France Droit d'Aubaine. Pref. de Laurier. Ordon. tom. i. p. 15. Bruſſel. tom. ii. p. 944. Du Cange, voc. <hi>Albani.</hi> Paſquier Recherches, p. 367. This practice of confiſcating the effects of ſtrangers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their death, was very ancient. It is mentioned, though very obſcurely, in a law of Charlemagne, A. D. 813. Capitul. Baluz. p. 507. § 5. Not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were born in a foreign country were ſubject to the Droit d'Aubaine, but even ſuch as removed from one dioceſe to another, or from the lands of one baron to another. Bruſſel. vol. ii. p. 947, 949. It is ſcarce poſſible to conceive any law more unfavourable to the intercourſe between nations. Something ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to it, however, may be found in the ancient laws of every kingdom in Europe. With reſpect to Italy, ſee Murat. Ant. vol. ii. p. 14. It is no ſmall diſgrace to the French juriſprudence, that this barbarous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſpitable cuſtom, ſhould ſtill remain in a nation ſo highly civilized.</p>
                     <p>THE confuſion and outrage which abounded under a feeble form of government, incapable of framing or executing ſalutary laws, rendered the communication between the different provinces of the ſame kingdom extremely dangerous. It appears from a letter of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:011837_0297_0F9D86A16F443458"/>
abbot of Ferrieres, in the ninth century, that the highways were ſo much infeſted by banditti, that it was neceſſary for travellers to form themſelves into companies or caravans, that they might be ſafe from the aſſaults of robbers. Bouquet Recueil des Hiſt. vol. vii. 515. The numerous regulations publiſhed by Charles the bald in the ſame century, diſcover the frequency of theſe diſorders; and ſuch acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence were become ſo common, that by many they were hardly conſidered as criminal; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the inferior judges called Centenarii, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to take an oath, that they would neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any robbery themſelves, nor protect ſuch as were guilty of that crime. Capitul. edit. Baluz. vol. ii. p. 63, 68. The hiſtorians of the ninth and tenth centuries give pathetic deſcriptions of theſe diſorders. Some remarkable paſſages to this purpoſe are collected by Mat. Jo. Beehr. Rer. Mecleb. lib. viii. p. 603. They became ſo frequent and audacious, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the civil magiſtrate was unable to repreſs them. The eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction was called in to aid it. Councils were held with great ſolemnity, the bodies of the ſaints were brought thither, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſacred reliques, anathemas were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt robbers, and other violators of the publick peace. Bouquet Recueil des Hiſt. tom. x. p. 360, 431, 536. One of theſe forms of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication iſſued A. D. 988, is ſtill preſerved, and is ſo ſingular, and compoſed with eloquence of ſuch a peculiar kind, that it will not perhaps appear unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a place here. After the uſual introduction, and mentioning the outrage which gave occaſion to the anathema, it runs thus, "Obtenebreſcant occuli veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri, qui concupiverunt; areſcant manus, quae rapue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; debilitentur omnia membra, quae adjuverunt. Semper laboretis, nec requiem inveniatis, fructuque veſtri laboris privemini.

                     <p>WITH reſpect to the progreſs of commerce which I have deſcribed, p. 78, &amp;c. it may be obſerved that the Italian ſtates carried on ſome commerce with the cities of the Greek empire, as early as the age of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne, and imported into their own country the rich commodities of the eaſt. Murat. Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p, 882. In the tenth century, the Venetians had opened a trade with Alexandria in Egypt. Ibid. The inhabitants of Amalphi and Piſa had likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their trade to the ſame ports. Murat. Ib. p. 884, 885. The effects of the Cruſades in increaſing the wealth and commerce of the Italian ſtates, and particularly that which they carried on with the Eaſt, I have already explained in this volume. They not only imported the Indian commodities from the Eaſt, but eſtabliſhed manufactures of curious fabric in their own country. Several of theſe are enumerated by Muratori in his Diſſertations concerning the <hi>arts</hi> and the <hi>weaving</hi> of the middle ages. Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p. 349, 399. They made great progreſs particularly in the manufacture of ſilk, which had long been pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the eaſtern provinces of Aſia. Silk ſtuffs were of ſuch high price in ancient Rome, that only a few perſons of the firſt rank were able to purchaſe them. Under Aurelian, A. D. 270, a pound of ſilk was equal in value to a pound of gold. Abſit ut auro fila penſentur. Libra enim auri tune libra ſerici fuit. Vopiſcus in Aureliano. Juſtinian, in the ſixth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, introduced the art of rearing ſilk-worms into Greece, which rendered the commodity ſomewhat more plentiful, though ſtill it was of ſuch great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as to remain an article of luxury or magnificence, reſerved only for perſons of the firſt order, or for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſolemnities. Roger I. King of Sicily, about the year 1130, carried off a number of artificers in the ſilk trade from Athens, and ſettling them in Palermo, introduced the culture of ſilk into his kingdom, from which it was communicated to other parts of Italy. Gianon. Hiſt. of Naples, b. xi. c. 7. This ſeems to have rendered ſilk ſo common, that about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:011837_0299_0F9D86A2F1E54508"/>
of the fourteenth century, a thouſand citizens of Genoa appeared in one proceſſion clad in ſilk robes. Sugar is likewiſe a production of the Eaſt. Some plants of the ſugar-cane were brought from Aſia; and the firſt attempt to cultivate them in Sicily was made about the middle of the twelfth century. From thence they were tranſplanted into the ſouthern provinces of Spain. From Spain they were carried to the Canary and Madeira iſles, and at length into the new world. Ludovico Guicciardini, in enumerating the goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into Antwerp, about the year 1560, mentions the ſugar which they received from Spain and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal as a conſiderable article. He deſcribes that as the product of the Madeira and Canary iſlands. Deſcritt. de Paeſi Baſſi, p. 180, 181. The ſugar-cane was either not introduced into the Weſt-Indies at that time, or the cultivation of it was not ſo conſiderable as to furniſh an article in commerce. In the middle ages, though ſugar was not raiſed in ſuch quantities, or employed for ſo many purpoſes, as to become one of the common neceſſaries of life, it appears to have been a conſiderable article in the commerce of the Italian ſtates.</p>
                     <p>THESE various commodities with which the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans furniſhed the other nations of Europe, procured them a favourable reception in every kingdom. They were eſtabliſhed in France in the thirteenth century with moſt extenſive immunities. They not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained every indulgence favourable to their commerce, but perſonal rights and privileges were granted to them, which the natives of the kingdom did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Ordon. tom. iv. p. 688. By a ſpecial proviſo, they were exempted from the droit d'aubaine. Ibid, p. 670. As the Lombards engroſſed the trade of every kingdom in which they ſettled, they became maſters of its caſh. Money of courſe was in their hands not only a ſign of the value of their commodities, but became an object of commerce itſelf. They dealt largely as bankers. In an ordonance, A. D. 1295, we find them ſtiled <hi>mercatores</hi> and <hi>campſores.</hi> They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on this as well as other branches of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with ſomewhat of that rapacious ſpirit which is

natural to monopolizers, who are not reſtrained by the concurrence of rivals. An abſurd opinion, which prevailed in the middle ages, was, however, in ſome meaſure, the cauſe, of their exorbitant demands, and may be pleaded in apology for them. Commerce can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carried on with advantage unleſs the perſons who lend a ſum are allowed a certain premium for the uſe of their money, and as a compenſation for the riſk which they run in permitting another to traffick with their ſtock. This premium is fixed by law in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial countries, and is called the legal intereſt of money. But the Fathers of the church prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied the prohibitions of uſury in ſcripture to the payment of legal intereſt, and condemned it as a ſin. The ſchoolmen, miſled by Ariſtotle, whoſe ſentiments they followed implicitly, and without examination, adopted the ſame error, and enforced it. Blackſtone's Commentaries on the laws of England, vol. ii. p. 455. Thus the Lombards found themſelves engaged in a traffick which was deemed criminal and odious. They were liable to puniſhment if detected. They were not ſatisfied, therefore, with that moderate premium, which they might have claimed, if their trade had been open and authoriſed by law. They exacted a ſum proportional to the danger and infamy of a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Accordingly, we find th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About the beginning of that century, the counteſs of Flanders was obliged to borrow money in order to pay her huſband's ranſom.

This is the more extraordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time the commerce of the Italian States was become conſiderable. Memoire Storiche de Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza, tom. viii. p. 134. Piac. 1760. It appears from Lud. Guicciardini, that Charles V. had fixed the rate of intereſt in his dominions in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at twelve per cent. and at the time when he wrote about the year 1560, it was not uncommon to exact more than that ſum. He complains of this as exorbitant, and points out its bad effects both on agriculture and commerce. Deſcritt. di Paeſi Baſſi, p. 172. This high intereſt of money, is alone a proof that the profits on commerce were exorbitant.—The Lombards were likewiſe eſtabliſhed in England, in the thirteenth century, and a conſiderable ſtreet in the city of London ſtill bears their name. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed great privileges, and carried on an extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, particularly as bankers. See Anderſon's Chronol. Deduction, vol. i. p. 137, 160, 204, 231, where the ſtatutes or other authorities, which confirm this are quoted. But the chief mart for Italian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities was at Bruges. Navigation was then ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that a voyage between the Baltick and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean could not be performed in one ſummer. For that reaſon, a magazine or ſtorehouſe half way between the commercial cities in the North, and thoſe in Italy became neceſſary. Bruges was pitched upon as the moſt convenient ſtation. That choice intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vaſt wealth into the Low-Countries. Bruges was at once the ſtaple for Engliſh wool; for the wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and linnen manufactures of the Netherlands; for the naval ſtores, and other bulky commodities of the north; and for the Indian commodities, as well as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick productions imported by the Italian States. The extent of its commerce in Indian goods with Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice alone appears from one fact. In the year 1318, five Venetian galeaſſes laden with Indian commodities arrived at Bruges, in order to diſpoſe of their cargoes at the fair. L. Guic. Deſcritt, di Paeſi Baſſi, p. 174. Galeaſſes were veſſels of very conſiderable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.

It was the greateſt emporium in all Europe. Many proofs of this occur in the hiſtorians and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But inſtead of multiplying quotations, I ſhall refer my readers to Anderſon, vol. i. p. 12, 137, 213, 246, The nature of this work prevents me from entering into any long details, but there are ſome detached facts, which give an high idea of the wealth both of the Flemiſh and Italian commercial ſtates. The Duke of Brabant contracted his daughter to the Black Prince, ſon of Edward III. of England, A. D. 1339, and gave her a portion which would amount to three hundred thouſand pounds of our preſent money. Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Faed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

John Galeazzo Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti Duke of Milan concluded a treaty of marriage between his daughter and Lionel Duke of Clarence Edward's third ſon. A.

Theſe exorbitant ſums ſo far exceeding what was then granted by the moſt powerful monarchs, and which appear extraordinary even in the preſent age, when the wealth of Europe is ſo much increaſed, muſt have ariſen from the riches which flowed into theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from their extenſive and lucrative commerce. The firſt ſource of wealth to the towns ſituated on the Baltick ſea, ſeems to have been the herring fiſhery; the ſhoals of herring frequenting at that time the coaſts of Sweden and Denmark, in the ſame manner as they now reſort to the Britiſh coaſts. The effects of this fiſhery are thus deſcribed by an author of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century. The Danes, ſays he, who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly clad in the poor garb of ſailors, are now cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcarlet, purple and fine linen. For they abound with wealth flowing from their annual fiſhery on the coaſt of Schonen; ſo that all nations reſort to them, bringing their gold, ſilver and precious commodities, that they may purchaſe herrings, which the divine bounty beſtows upon them.

Imper. lib. i. cap. 4. Anderſon has mentioned the chief facts with reſpect to their commercial progreſs, the extent of the privileges which they obtained in different countries, their ſucceſsful wars with ſeveral monarchs, as well as the ſpirit and zeal with which they contended for thoſe liberties and rights, without which it is impoſſible to carry on commerce to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The vigorous efforts of a ſociety attentive only to commercial objects, could not fail of diffuſing over Europe new and more liberal ideas concerning juſtice and order wherever they ſettled.</p>
                     <p>IN England the progreſs of commerce was extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely ſlow; and the cauſes of this are obvious. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saxon heptarchy, England, ſplit into many petty kingdoms, which were perpetually at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with each other, expoſed to the fierce incurſions of the Danes, and other northern pirates, and ſunk in barbarity and ignorance, was in no condition to cultivate commerce, or to purſue any ſyſtem of uſeful and ſalutary policy. When a better proſpect began to open by the union of the kingdom under one monarch, the Norman conqueſt took place. This occaſioned ſuch a violent ſhock, and ſuch a ſudden and total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of property, that the nation did not recover from it during ſeveral reigns. By the time that the conſtitution began to acquire ſome ſtability, and the Engliſh had ſo incorporated with their conquerors as to become one people, the nation engaged with no leſs ardour than imprudence in ſupport of their monarch's pretenſions to the crown of France, and long waſted its vigour and genius in its wild efforts to conquer that kingdom. When by ill ſucceſs and repeated diſappointments, a period was at laſt put to this fatal frenzy, and the nation beginning to enjoy ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, had leiſure to breathe and to gather new ſtrength, the deſtructive wars between the houſes of York and Lancaſter broke out, and involved the kingdom in the worſt of all calamities. Thus, beſides the common obſtructions of commerce occaſioned by the nature of
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:011837_0304_0F9D86A6B23C88E0"/>
the feudal government, and the ſtate of manners dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the middle ages, its progreſs in England was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by peculiar cauſes. Such a ſucceſſion of events adverſe to the commercial ſpirit was ſufficient to have checked its growth, although every other circumſtance had favoured it. The Engliſh were accordingly one of the laſt nations in Europe who availed themſelves of their natural commercial advantages. Before the reign of Edward III. all the wool of England except a a ſmall quantity wrought into courſe cloths for home conſumption, was ſold to the Flemings or Lombards, and manufactured by them. Though Edward, A. D. 1326, began to allure ſome of the Flemiſh weavers to ſettle in England, it was long before the Engliſh were capable of fabricating cloth for foreign markets, and the export of unwrought wool ſtill continued to be the chief article of their commerce. Anderſon paſſim. All foreign commodities were brought into England by the Lombard or Hanſeatick merchants. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ports were frequented by ſhips both from the north and ſouth of Europe, and they tamely allowed foreigners to reap all the profits ariſing from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of their wants. The firſt commercial treaty of England on record, is that with Haquin King or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, A. D. 1217. Anderſ. vol. i. p. 108. But they did not venture to trade in their own ſhips to the Baltick until the beginning of the fourteenth century. Ib. 151. It was after the middle of the fifteenth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent any ſhips into the mediterranean. Ib. p. 177. Nor was it long before this period that their veſſels viſited the ports of Spain or Portugal. But though I have pointed out the ſlow progreſs of the Engliſh commerce, as a fact little attended to, and yet meriting conſideration; the concourſe of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the ports of England, together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication among all the different countries in Europe, which went on increaſing from the beginning of the twelfth century, is ſufficient to juſtify all the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reaſonings in the text concerning the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of commerce on the ſtate of manners, and of ſociety.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE not been able to diſcover the preciſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Juſtiza was appointed, Among the claims of the <hi>junta</hi> or <hi>union</hi> formed againſt James I. A. D. 1264, this was one; that the King ſhould not nominate any perſon to be Juſtiza without the conſent or approbation of the ricos-hombres. Zurita Anales de Aragon, vol. i. p. 180. But the King in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their remonſtrance aſſerts, "that it was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by immemorial practice, and was conformida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the laws of the kingdom, that the King, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his royal prerogative, named the Juſtiza. Zuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Ibid. 181. Blanca, 656. From another paſſage in Zurita, it appears that while the Aragoneſe enjoyed the privilege of <hi>the union,</hi> i. e. the power of confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating againſt their ſovereign as often as they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had violated any of their rights and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. the Juſtiza was not only nominated by the King, but held his office during his pleaſure. Nor was this practice attended with any bad effects, as the privilege of the union was a ſufficient and effectual check to any abuſe of the royal prerogative. But when the privilege of the union was aboliſhed as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the order and peace of ſociety, it was agreed that the Juſtiza ſhould continue in office during life. Several kings, however, attempted to remove the Juſtizas who were obnoxious to them, and they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceeded in the attempt. In order to guard againſt this encroachment, which would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the intention of the inſtitution, and have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Juſtiza the dependant and tool of the crown, inſtead of the guardian of the people, a law was enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cortes, A. D. 1442, ordaining that the Juſtiza ſhould continue in office during life, and ſhould not be removed from it unleſs by the authority of the Cortes. Fueros &amp; Obſervancial del Reyno de Arag. lib. i. p. 22. By former laws the perſon of the Juſtiza had been declared ſacred, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſable only to the Cortes. Ibid. p. 15. b. Zurita and Blanca, who both publiſhed their hiſtories, while
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:011837_0306_0F9D86A82FA30D98"/>
the Juſtiza of Aragon retained the full exerciſe of his privileges and juriſdiction, have neglected to explain ſeveral circumſtances with regard to the office of that reſpectable magiſtrate, becauſe they addreſſed their works to their countrymen, who were well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every particular concerning the functions of a judge, to whom they looked up as to the guardian of their liberties. It is in vain to conſult the latter hiſtorians of Spain, about any point, with reſpect to which the excellent hiſtorians whom I have named are ſilent. The ancient conſtitution of their country was overturned, and deſpotiſm, eſtabliſhed on the ruin of its liberties, when the writers of this and the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing century compoſed their hiſtories, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they had little curioſity to know the nature of thoſe inſtitutions to which their anceſtors owed the enjoyment of freedom, or they were afraid to deſcribe them with much accuracy. The ſpirit with which Mariana, his continuator Miniana, and Ferreras, write their hiſtories, is very different from that of the two hiſtorians of Aragon, from whom I have taken my account of the conſtitution of that kingdom.</p>
                     <p>TWO circumſtances concerning the Juſtiza, beſides thoſe which I have mentioned in the text, are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of obſervation. 1. None of the ricos-hombres, or noblemen of the firſt order, could be appointed Juſtiza. He was taken out of the ſecond claſs or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valleros, who anſwer nearly to gentlemen or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners in Great-Britain. Fueros &amp; Obſervanc. del Reyno, &amp;c. lib. 1. p. 21. b. The reaſon was. By the laws of Aragon, the ricos-hombres were not ſubject to capital puniſhment; but as it was neceſſary for the ſecurity of liberty, that the Juſtiza ſhould be accountable for the manner in which he executed the high truſt repoſed in him, it was a powerful reſtraint upon him to know that he was liable to be puniſhed with the utmoſt rigour. Blanca, p. 657, 756. Zuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, tom. ii. 229. Fueros &amp; Obſervanc. lib. ix. p. 182. b. 183. It appears too from many paſſages in Zurita, that the Juſtiza was appointed to check the domineering and oppreſſive ſpirit of the nobles, as well as to ſet bounds to the power of the monarch,
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:011837_0307_0F9D86A8F2BC6F10"/>
and therefore he was choſen from an order of citizens equally intereſted in oppoſing both.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A MAGISTRATE poſſeſſed of ſuch vaſt powers as the Juſtiza, might have exerciſed them in a manner pernicious to the ſtate, if he himſelf had been ſubject to no controul. A conſtitutional remedy, however, was provided againſt this danger. Seventeen perſons were choſen by lot in each meeting of the Cortes. Theſe formed a tribunal called the court of inquiſition into the office of Juſtiza. This court met at three ſtated terms in each year. Every perſon had liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to it of any inquiry or neglect of duty in the Juſtiza, or in the inferior judges, who acted in his name. The Juſtiza and his deputies were called to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their conduct. The members of the court paſſed ſentence by ballot. They might puniſh by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation, confiſcation of goods, or even with death. The law which erected this court, and regulated the forms of its procedure, was enacted A. D. 1461. Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita Anales, iv. 102. Blanca Comment. Rer. Aragon 770. Previous to this period, inquiry was made into the conduct of the Juſtiza, though not with the ſame formality. He was from the firſt inſtitution of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſubject to the review of the Cortes. The conſtant dread of ſuch an impartial and ſevere inquiry into his behaviour, was a powerful motive to the vigilant and faithful diſcharge of his duty. A remarkable inſtance of the authority of the Juſtiza when oppoſed to that of the King, occurs, in the year 1386. By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Aragon, the eldeſt ſon or heir apparent of the crown poſſeſſed conſiderable power and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the kingdom. Fueros &amp; Obſervan. del Reyno de Arag. lib. 1. p. 16. Peter IV. inſtigated by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wife, attempted to deprive his ſon of this, and enjoined his ſubjects to yield him no obedience. The Prince immediately applied to the Juſtiza; "the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and defence, ſays Zurita, againſt all violence and oppreſſion. The Juſtiza granted him the <hi>firmo de derecho,</hi> the effect of which was, that upon his giving ſurety to appear in judgment, he could not be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of any immunity or privilege, which he poſſeſſed, but in conſequence of a legal trial before the Juſtiza,
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:011837_0308_0F9D86A9B2383B50"/>
and of a ſentence pronounced by him. This was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed throughout the kingdom, and notwithſtanding the proclamation in contradiction to this which had been iſſued by the King, the Prince continued in the exerciſe of all his rights, and his authority was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally recognized.

                     <p>I HAVE been induced by the concurring teſtimony of many reſpectable authors, to mention this as the conſtitutional form of the oath of allegiance, which the Aragoneſe ſwore to their Sovereigns.

All theſe writers poſſeſs a merit, which is very rare among hiſtorians. They are extremely accurate in tracing the progreſs of the laws and conſtitution of their country. Their ſilence with reſpect to this, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſome ſuſpicion concerning the genuineſs of the oath. But as it is mentioned by ſo many authors, who produce the ancient Spaniſh words in which it is expreſſed, it is probable that they have taken it from ſome writer of credit, whoſe works have not fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hands. The ſpirit of the oath is perfectly agreeable to the genius of the Aragoneſe conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>THE privilege of Union which I mentioned in the preceding note, and alluded to in the text, is indeed one of the moſt ſingular which could take place in a regular government, and the oath that I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned expreſſes nothing more than this conſtitutional privilege entitled the Aragoneſe to perform. If the King or his Miniſters violated any of the laws or immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Aragoneſe, and did not grant immediate redreſs in conſequence of their repreſentations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, the nobles of the firſt rank, or <hi>Ricos-hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres de natura. &amp; de meſnada,</hi> the equeſtrian order, or

the nobility of the ſecond claſs, called <hi>Hidalgos &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanciones,</hi> together with the magiſtrates of cities, might either in the cortes, or in a voluntary aſſembly, join in union, and binding themſelves by mutual oaths and the exchange of hoſtages to be faithful to each other, they might require the King, in the name and by the authority of this body corporate, to grant them redreſs. If the King refuſed to comply with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or took arms in order to oppoſe them, they might, in virtue of the privilege of union, inſtantly withdraw their allegiance from the King, refuſe to acknowledge him as their Sovereign, and proceed to elect another Monarch; nor did they incur any guilt, or become liable to any proſecution on that account. Blanca Com. Rer. Arag. 661. 669. This union did not reſemble the confederacies in other feudal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. It was a conſtitutional aſſociation, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to legal privileges, which iſſued its mandates under a common ſeal, and proceeded in all its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by regular and aſcertained forms. This dangerous right was not only claimed, but exerciſed in the year 1287, the Aragoneſe formed an union in oppoſition to Alfonſo III. and obliged the King not only to comply with their demands, but to ratify a privilege ſo fatal to the power of the crown, Zurita Anales, tom. i. p. 322. In the year 1347, an union was formed againſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter IV. with equal ſucceſs, and a new ratification of the privilege was extorted. Zurita, tom. ii. p. 202. But ſoon after, the King having defeated the leaders of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in battle, the privilege of union was finally abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in the Cortes, and all the laws or records which contained any confirmation of it, were cancelled or deſtroyed. The King, in preſence of the Cortes, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the act whereby he had ratified the union, and having wounded his hand with his poiniard, he held it above the record, <q>That privilege, ſays he, which has been ſo fatal to the kingdom, and ſo injurious to royalty, ſhould be effaced with the blood of a King.</q> Zurita, tom. ii. p. 229. The law abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the union is publiſhed. Fueros &amp; Obſervanc. lib. ix. p. 178. From that period the Juſtiza became the conſtitutional guardian of public liberty, and his

power and juriſdiction occaſioned none of thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent convulſions which the tumultuary privilege of the union was apt to produce. The conſtitution of Aragon, however, ſtill remained extremely free. One ſource of this liberty was from the early admiſſion of the repreſentatives of cities into the Cortes. It ſeems probable, from Zurita, that the burgeſſes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent members of the Cortes from its firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

This is the conſtitutional language in which their preſence is declared in the Cortes. after the journals of that court were regularly kept. It is probable, that an hiſtorian ſo accurate as Zurita, would not have uſed theſe words, if he had not taken them from ſome authentick record. It was more than a century after this period before the repreſentatives of cities formed a conſtituent part in the ſupreme aſſemblies of the other European nations. The free ſpirit of the Aragoneſe government is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in many particulars. The Cortes not only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the attempts of their Kings to increaſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, or to extend their prerogative, but they claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right and exerciſed powers which will appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary even in a country accuſtomed to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of liberty. In the year 1286, the Cortes claimed the privilege of naming the members of the King's council and the officers of his houſhold, and they ſeem to have obtained it for ſome time. Zurita, tom. i. p. 303, 307. It was the privilege of the Cortes to name the officers who commanded the troops raiſed by their authority. This ſeems to be evident from a paſſage in Zurita. When the Cortes, in the year 1503, raiſed a body of troops to be employed in Italy, it paſſed an act empowering the King to name the officers who ſhould command them, Zurita, tom. v. p. 274; which plainly implies that without this warrant, it did not belong to him in virtue of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. In the Fueros and Obſervancias del reyno de Aragon, two general declarations of the rights and privileges of the Aragoneſe are publiſhed; the one in the reign of Pedro I. A. D. 1284, the other in that
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:011837_0311_0F9D86ACB0AC7300"/>
of James II. A. D. 1323. They are of ſuch length, that I cannot inſert them, but it is evident from theſe, that not only the privileges of the nobility, but the rights of the people, perſonal as well as political, were, at that period, more extenſive, and better underſtood than in any kingdom in Europe. Lib. 1. p. 7, 9. The oath by which the King bound himſelf to obſerve thoſe rights and liberties of the people, was very ſolemn. Ibid. p. 14. b. &amp; p. 15. The Cortes of Aragon diſcovered not only the jealouſy and vigilance, which are peculiar to free ſtates, in guarding the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts of the conſtitution, but they were ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly attentive to obſerve the moſt minute forms and ceremonies to which they were accuſtomed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſhed laws and cuſtoms of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, no foreigner had liberty to enter the hall in which the Cortes aſſembled. Ferdinand, in the year 1481, appointed his Queen, Iſabella, regent of the kingdom, while he was abſent during the courſe of the campaign. The law required that a regent ſhould take the oath of fidelity in preſence of the Cortes; but as Iſabella was a foreigner, before ſhe could be admitted, the Cortes thought it neceſſary to paſs an act authorizing the ſerjeant-porter to open the door of the hall, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to enter; <q>ſo attentive were they, ſays Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita, to obſerve their laws and forms, even ſuch as may ſeem moſt minute.</q> Tom. iv. p. 313.</p>
                     <p>THE Aragoneſe were no leſs ſolicitous to ſecure the perſonal rights of individuals, than to maintain the freedom of the conſtitution; and the ſpirit of their ſtatutes with reſpect to both was equally liberal. Two facts relative to this matter merit obſervation. By an expreſs ſtatute in the year 1325, it was declared to be unlawful to put any native Aragoneſe to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If he could not be convicted by the teſtimony of witneſſes, he was inſtantly abſolved. Zurita, tom. ii. p. 66. Zurita records the regulation with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction natural to an hiſtorian, when he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the humanity of his countrymen. He compares the laws of Aragon to thoſe of Rome, as both exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed citizens and freemen from ſuch ignominious and cruel treatment, and had recourſe to it only in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:011837_0312_0F9D86AD71ECD2A0"/>
of ſlaves. Zurita had reaſon to beſtow ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium on the laws of his country. Torture was at that time permitted by the laws of every other nation in Europe. Even in England, from which the mild ſpirit of legiſlation has long baniſhed it, torture was not, at that time, unknown. Obſervations on the Statutes, chiefly the more antient, &amp;c. p. 66.</p>
                     <p>THE other fact ſhows, that the ſame ſpirit which influenced the legiſlature, prevailed among the people. In the year 1485, the religious zeal of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand and Iſabella, prompted them to introduce the inquſition into Aragon. Though the Aragoneſe were no leſs ſuperſtitiouſly attached, than the other Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, to the Roman Catholick faith, and no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to root out the ſeeds of error and of hereſy which the Jews and Moors had ſcattered, yet they took arms againſt the inquiſitors, murdered the chief inquiſitor, and long oppoſed the eſtabliſhment of that tribunal. The reaſon which they gave for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, was, that the mode of trial in the inquiſition, was inconſiſtent with liberty. The criminal was not confronted with the witneſſes, he was not acquainted with what they depoſed againſt him, he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to torture, and the goods of perſons condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were confiſcated. Zurita Anales, tom. iv. p. 341.</p>
                     <p>THE form of Government in the kingdom of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia, and principality of Catalonia, which were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the crown of Aragon, was likewiſe extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favourable to liberty. The Valencians enjoyed the privilege of <hi>union</hi> in the ſame manner with the Aragoneſe. But they had no magiſtrate reſembling the Juſtiza. The Catalonians were no leſs jealous of their liberties than the two other nations, and no leſs bold in aſſerting them. But it is not neceſſary for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrating the following hiſtory, to enter into any farther detail concerning the peculiarities in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of theſe kingdoms.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE ſearched in vain among the hiſtorians of Caſtile, for ſuch information as might enable me to trace the progreſs of laws and government in Caſtile, or to explain the nature of the conſtitution with the
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:011837_0313_0F9D86AE2FFBC0A0"/>
ſame degree of accuracy, wherewith I have deſcribed the political ſtate of Aragon. It is manifeſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the hiſtorians of Caſtile, but from its ancient laws, particularly the Fuero Juzgo, that its monarchs were originally elective. Ley 2, 5, 8. They were choſen by the biſhops, the nobility, and the people, ibid. It appears from the ſame venerable code of laws, that the prerogative of the Caſtilian monarchs was extremly limited. Villaldiego in his commentary on theſe laws, produces many facts and authorities in confirmation of both theſe particulars. Dr. Ged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, who was well acquainted with Spaniſh lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, complains that he could find no author who gave a diſtinct account of the Cortes, or ſupreme aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the nation, or who deſcribed the manner in which it was held, or mentioned the preciſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of members who had a right to ſit in it. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, however, from Gil Gonzales d'Avila, who publiſhed a hiſtory of Henry II. the writ of ſummons to the town of Abula, requiring it to chuſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives to appear in the Cortes which he called to meet A. D. 1390. From this we learn, that Prelates, Dukes, Marquiſſes, the maſters of the three military orders, Conde's and Riccos-hombres were required to attend. Theſe compoſed the bodies of eccleſiaſticks and nobles, which formed two members of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. The cities which ſent members to that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cortes, were forty-eight. The number of repreſentatives (for the cities had right to chuſe more or fewer, according to their reſpective dignity) amounted to an hundred and twenty-five. Geddes Miſcellaneous Tracts, vol. i. 331. Zurita having occaſion to mention the Cortes which Ferdinand held at Toro, A.

From that liſt it appears, that only eighteen cities had deputies in this aſſembly. Annales de Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, tom. vi. p. 3.

                     <p>A GREAT part of the territory in Spain was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by the nobility. L. Marinaeus Siculus, who compoſed his treatiſe de Rebus Hiſpaniae during the reign of Charles V. gives a catalogue of the Spaniſh nobility, together with the yearly rent of their eſtates. According to his account, which he affirms was as accurate as the nature the ſubject would admit, the ſum total of the annual revenue of their lands amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one million four hundred and eighty-two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducats. If we make allowance for the vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the value of money in the fifteenth century, from that which it now bears, and conſider that the catalogue of Marinaeus includes only the <hi>Titulados,</hi> or nobility, whoſe families were diſtinguiſhed by ſome honorary title, their wealth muſt appear very great. L. Marinaeus ap. Schotti Scriptores Hiſpan. vol. i. p. 323. The Commons of Caſtile, in their conteſts with the crown, which I ſhall hereafter relate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the extenſive property of the nobility, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pernicious to the kingdom. In one of their manifeſto's they aſſert, that from Valladolid to St. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in Galicia, which was an hundred leagues, the crown did not poſſeſs more than three villages. All the reſt belonged to the nobility, and could be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no public burden. Sandov. Vida del Emperor, Carl. V. vol. 1. p. 422. It appears from the teſtimony of authors quoted by Bovadilla, that theſe vaſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were beſtowed upon the <hi>Ricos-hombres, hidalgos,</hi> and <hi>cavalleros</hi> by the Kings of Caſtile, in reward for the aſſiſtance, which they had received from them in expelling the Moors.

It is probable, that as ſoon as theſe were recovered from the Moors, the inhabitants who fixed their reſidence in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons of diſtinction and credit, had all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of municipal government and juriſdiction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them. Many ſtriking proofs occur of the ſplendour, wealth, and power of the Spaniſh cities. Hieronymus Paulus wrote a deſcription of Barcelona in the year 1491, and compares the dimenſions of the town to that of Naples, and the elegance of its build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the variety of its manufactures, and the extent of its commerce to Florence, Hieron. Paulus ap. Scottum. Script. Hiſp. ii. 844., Marinaeus deſcribes Toledo as a large and populous city. A great number of its inhabitants were perſons of quality, and of illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious rank. Its commerce was great. It applied par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the manufactures of ſilk and wool; and the number of inhabitants employed in theſe two branches of trade, amounted nearly to ten thouſand. Marin. ubi ſupr. p. 308. I know no city, ſays he, that I would prefer to Valladolid for elegance and ſplendour. Ibid. p. 312. We may form ſome eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of its populouſneſs from the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The citizens took arms in the year 1516, in order to oppoſe a meaſure concerted by cardinal Ximenes, and they muſtered in the city, and in the territory which belonged to it, thirty thouſand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men. Sandow. Vida del Emper. Carl. V. tom. i. p. 81. The manufactures carried on in the towns of Spain, were not intended merely for home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, they were exported to foreign countries, and that commerce was a conſiderable ſource of wealth to the inhabitants. The maritime laws of Barcelona, are the foundation of mercantile juriſprudence in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, as the Leges Rhodiae were among the ancients. All the commercial ſtates in Italy adopted theſe laws, and regulated their trade according to them. Sandi Storia Civile Veneziana, vol, ii. 865. It appears from ſeveral ordonances of the Kings of France, that the merchants of Aragon and Caſtile were received on the ſame footing, and admitted to

                     <p>THE military order of St. Jago, the moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and opulent of the three Spaniſh orders, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted about the year 1170. The bull of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Alexander III. is dated A. D. 1176. At that time a conſiderable part of Spain was ſubject to the Moors, and the whole country much expoſed to the depredations, not only of the enemy, but of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti. It is no wonder, then, that an inſtitution, the object of which was to oppoſe the enemies of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith, and to reſtrain and puniſh thoſe who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed the public peace, ſhould be extremely popular, and meet with general encouragement. The wealth and power of the order became ſo great, that one hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian ſays, that the Grand Maſter of St. Jago, was the perſon in Spain of the greateſt power and dignity next to the King. Ael. Anton. Nebriſſenſis, ap. Schott. Scrip. Hiſp. i. 812. Another obſerves, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der poſſeſſed every thing in Caſtile that a King would moſt deſire to obtain. Zurita Anales, v. 22. The knights took the vows of obedience, of poverty, and of conjugal chaſtity. By the former they were bound implicitly to obey the commands of their grandmaſter. The order could bring into the field a thouſand men at arms. Ael. Ant. Nebreſ. p. 813. If theſe men at arms were accompanied as was uſual in that age, this was a formidable body of cavalry. There belonged to this order eighty-four commanderies, and two hundred priories and other benefices.

is eaſy to ſee how formidable to his ſovereign the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of theſe troops, the adminiſtration of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and the diſpoſal of ſo many offices, muſt have rendered a ſubject. The other two orders though, inferior to that of St. Jago in power and wealth, were nevertheleſs very conſiderable. When the conqueſt of Granada deprived the knights of St. Jago of thoſe enemies againſt whom their zeal was originally direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuperſtition found out a new object, in defence of which they engaged to employ their courage. To their uſual oath, they added the following clauſe: "We ſwear to believe, to maintain, and to contend in public and in private, that the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, our Lady, was conceived without the ſtain of original ſin." This ſingular addition was made about the middle of the ſeventeenth century. Honorè de St. Marie Diſſertations, &amp;c. p. 263.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE frequently had occaſion to take notice of the defects in police during the middle ages, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the feebleneſs of Government, and the want of proper ſubordination among the different ranks of men. I have obſerved in a former note, that this greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the intercourſe between nations, and even between different places in the ſame kingdom. The deſcription which the Spaniſh hiſtorians give of the frequency of rapine, murder, and every act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in all the provinces of Spain, are amazing, and preſent to us the idea of Society but little removed from the diſorder and turbulence of that which has been called a ſtate of nature.

Though the acceſs of theſe diſorders rendered the inſtitution of the <hi>Santa Hermandad</hi> neceſſary, great care was taken at firſt to avoid giving any offence or alarm to the nobility. The juriſdiction of the judges of the Hermandad, was expreſsly confined to crimes that violated the public peace. All other offences were left to the cognizance of the ordinary judges. If a perſon was guilty of

Notwithſtanding theſe reſtrictions, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were ſenſible how much the Hermandad would encroach on their juriſdiction. In Caſtile. ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was made to the inſtitution; but Ferdinand had the addreſs to obtain the conſent of the Conſtable to the introduction of the Hermandad into that part of the kingdom where his eſtate lay; and by that means, as well as the popularity of the inſtitution, he ſurmounted every obſtacle that ſtood in its way. Ael. Ant. Nebriſſen. 851. In Aragon the Nobles combined againſt it with greater ſpirit; and Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, though he ſupported it with vigour, was obliged to make ſome conceſſions in order to reconcile them.

unbounded authority belonged to the crown in every period of their monarchy. "The government of France, ſays M. de Real very gravely, is purely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical at this day, as it was from the beginning. Our Kings were abſolute originally as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent." Science du Government, tom. ii. p. 31. It is impoſſible, however, to conceive two ſtates of civil ſociety more unlike to each other, than that of the French nation under Clovis, and that under Louis XV. It is evident from the codes of laws of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tribes which ſettled in Gaul and the countries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent to it, as well as from the hiſtory of Gregory of Tours, and other early annaliſts, that among all theſe people the form of government was extremely rude and ſimple, and that they had ſcarce begun to acquire the firſt rudiments of that order and police which are neceſſary in extenſive ſocieties. The King or leader had the command of ſoldiers or companions, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his ſtandard from choice, not by conſtraint. I have produced the cleareſt evidence of this, Note VI. An event related by Gregory of Tours, lib. iv. c. 14, affords the moſt ſtriking proof of the dependance of the early French Kings on the ſentiments and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their people. Clotaire I. having marched at the head of his army, in the year 553, againſt the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that people, intimidated at his approach ſued for peace, and offered to pay a large ſum to the offended monarch. Clotaire was willing to cloſe with what they propoſed. But his army inſiſted to be led forth to battle. The King employed all his eloquence to perſuade them to accept of what the Saxons were ready to pay. The Saxons, in order to ſooth them, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their original offer. The King renewed his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: But the army enraged, ruſhed upon the King, tore his tent in pieces, dragged him out of it, and would have ſlain him on the ſpot, if he had not conſented to lead them inſtantly againſt the enemy.</p>
                     <p>IF the early monarchs of France poſſeſſed ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited authority, even while at the head of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, their prerogative during peace will be found to be ſtill more confined. They aſcended the throne not

by any hereditary right, but in conſequence of the election of their ſubjects. In order to avoid an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary number of quotations, I refer my readers to Hottomanni Francogallia, cap. vi. p. 47. edit. 1573, where they will find the fulleſt proof of this from Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of Tours, Amoinus, and the moſt authentick hiſtorians of the Merovingian Kings. The effect of this election was not to inveſt them with abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Whatever related to the general welfare of the nation, was ſubmitted to publick deliberation, and determined by the ſuffrage of the people, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual aſſemblies called Les Champs des Mars, and Les Champs de Mai. Theſe aſſemblies were called <hi>Champs,</hi> becauſe, according to the cuſtom of all the barbarous nations, they were held in the open air, in ſome plain capable of containing the vaſt number of perſons who had a right to be preſent.

                     <p>THAT the general aſſemblies exerciſed ſupreme ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all perſons, and with reſpect to all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is ſo evident as to ſtand in need of no proof. The trial of Brunchaut. A. D. 613, how unjuſt ſoever the ſentence againſt her may be, as related by Fredegari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Chron. cap. 42. Bouquet, ibid. 430. is in itſelf ſufficient proof of this. The notorious violence and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the ſentence ſerve to demonſtrate the extent
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:011837_0322_0F9D86B5B3F4DF70"/>
of juriſdiction which this aſſembly poſſeſſed, as a Prince ſo ſanguinary as Clothaire II. thought the ſanction of its authority would be ſufficient to juſtify his rigour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment of the mother and grandmother of ſo many Kings.</p>
                     <p>WITH reſpect to conferring donatives on the Prince, we may obſerve that among nations whoſe manners and political inſtitutions are ſimple, the publick, as well as individuals, having few wants, they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with taxes, and free uncivilized tribes diſdain to ſubmit to any ſtated impoſition. This was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the caſe of the Germans, and of all the various people that iſſued from that country. Tacitus pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces two tribes not to be of the German origin, becauſe they ſubmitted to pay taxes. De Morib. Germ. c. 43; and ſpeaking of another tribe according to the ideas prevalent in Germany, he ſays, "they were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded by the impoſition of taxes." Ibid c. 29. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſettlement in Gaul, we may conclude that while elated with the conſciouſneſs of victory, they would not renounce the high-ſpirited ideas of their anceſtors, or voluntarily ſubmit to a burthen which they regarded as a badge of ſervitude. The evidence of the earlieſt records and hiſtorians juſtify this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. M. de Monteſquieu in the twelfth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent chapters of the thirteenth book of l'Eſprit des Loix, and M. de Mably Obſervat. ſur l'Hiſt. de France, tom. i. p. 247. have inveſtigated this fact with great attention, and have proved clearly that the property of no free-man among the Franks was ſubject to any ſtated tax. That the ſtate required nothing from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this rank but military ſervice at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and that they ſhould entertain the King in their houſes when he was upon any progreſs through his dominions, or his officers when ſent on any public employment, furniſhing them with carriages and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Monarchs ſubſiſted almoſt entirely upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of their own domains, and upon the perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites ariſing from the adminiſtration of juſtice, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a few ſmall fines and forfeitures exacted from thoſe who had been guilty of certain treſpaſſes. It is

foreign from my ſubject to ennumerate theſe. The reader may find them in Obſervat. de M. de Mably, vol. i. p. 267.</p>
                     <p>WHEN any extraordinary aid was granted by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to their ſovereign it was purely voluntary. In the annual aſſembly of March or May it was the cuſtom to make the King a preſent of money, of horſes or arms, or of ſome other thing of value. This was an ancient cuſtom, and derived from their anceſtors the Germans. Mos eſt civitatibus, ultro ac viritim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri principibus vel armentorum vel frugum, quod pro honore acceptum, etiam neceſſitatibus ſubvenit. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. de Mor. Germ. c. 15. Theſe gifts, if we may form a judgment concerning them from the general terms in which they are mentioned by the ancient hiſtorians, were conſiderable, and made no ſmall part of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al revenue. Many paſſages to this purpoſe are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by M. du Cange, Diſſert. iv. ſur Joinville, 153. Sometimes a conquered people ſpecified the gift which they bound themſelves to pay annually, and it was exacted as a debt if they failed. Annales Metenſes, ap. Du Cange, ibid. p. 155. It is probable that the firſt ſtep towards taxation was to aſcertain the value of theſe gifts which were originally gratuitous, and to compel the people to pay the ſum at which they were rated. Still, however, ſome memory of their original was preſerved, and the aids granted to monarchs in all the kingdoms of Europe were termed benevolences or free gifts.</p>
                     <p>THE Kings of the ſecond race in France were raiſed to the throne by the election of the people, Pepinus Rex pius, ſays an author who wrote a few years after the tranſaction which he records, per authoritatem Papae, &amp; unctionem ſancti chriſmatis, &amp; electionem omnium Francorum in regni ſolio ſublimatus eſt. Clauſula de Pepini conſecratione ap. Bouq. Recueil des Hiſtor. tom. v. p. 9. At the ſame time, as the chief men of the nation had transferred the crown from one family to another, an oath was exacted of them that they ſhould maintain on the throne the family which they had now promoted; ut nunquam de alterius lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:011837_0324_0F9D86B7301E2D20"/>
regem in aevo praeſumant eligere. Ibid. p. 10. This oath the nation faithfully obſerved during a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſpace of time. The poſterity of Pepin kept poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the throne; but with reſpect to the manner of dividing their dominions among their children, Princes were obliged to conſult the general aſſembly of the nation. Thus Pepin himſelf, A. D. 768, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his two ſons, Charles and Charlomannus, to reign as joint ſovereigns; but he did this, una cum concenſu Francorum &amp; procerum ſuorum ſeu &amp; epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum, before whom he laid the matter in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly. Conventus apud ſanctum Dionyſium. Capitular. vol. i. p. 187. This deſtination the French confirmed in a ſubſequent aſſembly, which was called upon the death of Pepin; for, as Eginhart relates, they not only appointed them Kings, but by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they regulated the limits of their reſpective ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, Vita Car. Magni. ap. Bouquet Recueil, tom. v. p. 90. In the ſame manner, it was by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſupreme aſſemblies that any diſpute which aroſe among the deſcendants of the royal family was determined. Charlemagne recognizes this important part of their juriſdiction, and confirms it in his charter concerning the partition of his dominions; for he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, that, in caſe of any uncertainty with reſpect to the right of the ſeveral competitors, he whom the people ſhall chuſe, ſhall ſucceed to the crown. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular, vol. i. 442.</p>
                     <p>UNDER the ſecond race of Kings, the aſſembly of the nation, diſtinguiſhed by the name of coventus, Malli, Placita, were regularly aſſembled once a year at leaſt, and frequently twice in the year. One of the moſt valuable monuments of the hiſtory of France is the treatiſe of Hincmarus, archbiſhop of Rheims, de ordine Palatii. He died A. D. 882. only ſixty-eight years after Charlemagne, and he relates in that ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the facts which were communicated to him by Adalhardus, a miniſter and confident of Charlemagne. From him we learn that this great monarch never failed to hold the general aſſembly of his ſubjects every year. In quo placito generalitas univerſorum majorum tam

clericorum quam laicorum conveniebat. Hincm. oper. edit. Sirmondi, vol. ii. c. 29. 211. In theſe aſſemblies, matters which related to the general ſafety and ſtate of the kingdom were always diſcuſſed, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon any private or leſs important buſineſs. Ibid. c. 33. p. 213. His immediate ſucceſſors imitated his example, and tranſacted no affair of importance without the advice of their great council.</p>
                     <p>UNDER the ſecond race of Kings; the genius of the French government continued to be in a good meaſure democratical. The nobles the dignified eccleſiaſtics, and the great officers of the crown, were not the only mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the national council; the people, or the whole body of free-men, either in perſon, or by their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, had a right to be preſent in it. Hincma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, in deſcribing the manner of holding the general aſſemblies, ſays, that if the weather was favourable, they met in the open air, but, if otherwiſe, they had different apartments allotted to them, ſo that the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified clergy were ſeparated from the laity, and the comites vel hujuſmodi principes ſibimet honorificabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a caetera multitudine ſegregarentur. Ibid. p. c. 35. p. 114. Agobardus, archbiſhop of Lyons, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a national council in the year 833, wherein he was preſent. Qui ubique conventus extitit ex reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiſſimis epiſcopis, &amp; magnificentiſſimis viris inlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribus, collegio quoque abatum &amp; comitum, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuaeque aetatis &amp; dignitatis populo. The <hi>caetera multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo</hi> of Hincmarus is the ſame with the <hi>populus</hi> of Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus, and both deſcribe the inferior order of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the ſame who were afterwards known in France by the name of the third eſtate, and in England by the name of commons. The people, as well as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of higher dignity, were admitted to a ſhare of the legiſlative power. Thus, by a law, A. D. 803, it is ordained, "that the queſtion ſhall be put to the people with reſpect to every new law, and if they ſhall agree to it, they ſhall confirm it by their ſignature. Capit. vol. i. 394. There are two capitularia which convey to us a full idea of the part which the people had in the adminiſtration of government. When they felt the weight of any grievance, they had a right to
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:011837_0326_0F9D86B8E349CC58"/>
petition the ſovereign for redreſs. One of theſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which they deſire that eccleſiaſticks might be exempted from bearing arms, and from ſerving in perſon againſt the enemy, is ſtill extant. It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Charlemagne, A. D. 803, and expreſſed in ſuch terms as could have been uſed only by men conſcious of liberty, and of the extenſive privileges which they poſſeſſed. They conclude with requiring him to grant their demand, if he wiſhed that they ſhould any longer continue faithful ſubjects to him. That great monarch, inſtead of being offended or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the boldneſs of their petition, received it in a moſt gracious manner, and ſignified his willingneſs to comply with it. But ſenſible that he himſelf did not poſſeſs legiſlative authority, he promiſes to lay the matter before the next general aſſembly, that ſuch things as were of common concern to all might be there conſidered and eſtabliſhed by common conſent. Capitul. tom. i. p. 405—409. As the people by their petitions brought matters to be propoſed in the general aſſembly, we learn from another capitulare the form in which they were approved there, and enacted as laws. The propoſitions were read aloud, and then the people were required to declare whether they aſſented to them or not. They ſignified their aſſent by crying three times, "We are ſatisfied," and then the capitulare was confirmed by the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the monarch, the clergy and the chief men of the laity. Capitul. tom. i. p. 627. A. D. 822. It ſeems probable from a capitulare of Carolus Calvus, A. D. 851, that the ſovereign could not refuſe his aſſent to what was propoſed and eſtabliſhed by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the general aſſembly. Tit. ix. § 6. Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. vol. ii. p. 47. It is unneceſſary to multiply quotations concerning the legiſlative power of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal aſſembly of France under the ſecond race, or concerning its rights to determine with regard to peace and war. The uniform ſtyle of the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria is an abundant confirmation of the former.

What has been ſaid with reſpect to the admiſſion of the people or their repreſentatives in the ſupreme aſſembly merits attention not only in tracing the progreſs of the French government, but on account of the light which it throws upon a ſimilar queſtion agitated in England, concerning the time when the commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came part of the legiſlative body in that kingdom.</p>

                     <p>THAT important change which the conſtitution of France underwent, when the legiſlative power was transferred from the great council of the nation to the King, has been explained by the French antiquarians with leſs care, than they beſtow in illuſtrating other events in their hiſtory. For that reaſon I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the greater attention to trace the ſteps which led to this memorable revolution. I ſhall here add ſome particulars which tend farther to illuſtrate it. The Leges Salicae, the Leges Burgundionum, and other codes publiſhed by the ſeveral tribes which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Gaul, were general laws extending to every perſon, to every province and diſtrict where their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was acknowledged. But they ſeem to have become obſolete; and the reaſon of their falling into diſuſe is very obvious. Almoſt the whole property of the nation was allodial when theſe laws were fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when the feudal inſtitutions became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and gave riſe to an infinite variety of queſtions peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to that ſpecies of tenure, the ancient codes were of no uſe in deciding with regard to theſe, becauſe they could not contain regulations applicable to caſes which did not exiſt at the time when they were compiled. This conſiderable change in the nature of property made it neceſſary to publiſh the new regulations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Capitularia.</hi> Many of theſe as is evident from the peruſal of them, were general laws extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the whole French nation, in the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in which they were enacted. The weakneſs of the greater part of the monarchs of the ſecond race, and the diſorder into which the nation was thrown by the depredations of the Normans, encouraged the
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:011837_0328_0F9D86BAF00F6BC8"/>
barons to uſurp an independent power formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in France. The nature and extent of that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction which they aſſumed, I have formerly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The political union of the kingdom was at an end, its ancient conſtitution was diſſolved, and only a feudal relation ſubſiſted between the King and his vaſſals. The regal juriſdiction extended no further than the domains of the crown. Under the laſt Kings of the ſecond race, theſe were reduced almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Under the firſt Kings of the third race, they comprehended little more than the patrimonial eſtate of Hugh Capet, which he annexed to the crown. Even with this acceſſion, they continued to be very narrow. Velly. Hiſt. de France, tom. iii. p. 32. Many of the moſt conſiderable provinces of France did not at firſt acknowledge Hugh Capet as a lawful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. There are ſtill extant ſeveral charters, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the firſt years of his reign, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable clauſe in the form of dating the charter; "Deo regnante, rege expectante," regnante domino noſtro Jeſu Chriſto, Francis autem contra jus regnum uſurpante Ugone rege. Bouquet Recueil. tom. x. p. 544. A Monarch whoſe title was thus openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, was not in a condition to aſſert the royal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or to limit that of the barons.</p>
                     <p>ALL theſe circumſtances rendered it eaſy for the barons to uſurp the rights of royalty within their own territories. The capitularia became no leſs obſolete than the ancient laws; local cuſtoms were every where introduced, and became the ſole rule by which all civil tranſactions were conducted, and all cauſes were tried. The wonderful ignorance, which became ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in France, during the ninth and tenth centuries, contributed to the introduction of cuſtomary law. Few perſons, except eccleſiaſtics, could read; and as it was not poſſible for them to have recourſe to written laws, either as their guide in buſineſs, or their rule in adminiſtring juſtice, the cuſtomary law uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevailed.</p>
                     <p>DURING this period, the general aſſembly of the nation ſeems not to have been called, nor to have once exerted its legiſlative authority. Local cuſtoms regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:011837_0329_0F9D86BBAFA386B0"/>
and decided every thing. A ſtriking proof of this occurs in tracing the progreſs of the French juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. The laſt of the Capitularia collected by M. Baluze, was iſſued in the year 921, by Charles the Simple. An hundred and thirty years elapſed from that period to the publication of the firſt ordonance of the Kings of the third race, contained in the great collection of M. Lauriere, and the firſt ordonance which appears to be an act of legiſlation extending to the whole kingdom is that of Philip Auguſtus, A. D. 1190. Ordon. tom. i. p. 1, 18. During that long period of one hundred and ſixty-nine years, all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions were directed by local cuſtoms, and no addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to the ſtatutory law of France. The ordonances, previous to the reign of Philip Auguſtus, contain regulations, the authority of which did not extend beyond the King's domains.</p>
                     <p>VARIOUS inſtances occur of the caution with which the King's of France ventured at firſt to exerciſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority. M. l'Ab. de Mably produces an ordonance of Philip Auguſtus, A. D. 1206, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Jews, who, in that age, were in ſome meaſure the property of the lord in whoſe territories they reſided. But it is not ſo much an act of royal power, as a treaty of the King with the counteſs of Champagne, and the comte de Dampierre; and the regulations in it ſeem to be eſtabliſhed not by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but by their conſent. Obſervat. ſur l'hiſt. de France, ii. p. 355. In the ſame manner an ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Louis VIII. concerning the jews, A. D 1223, is a contract between the King and his nobles, with reſpect to their manner of treating that unhappy race of men. Ordon. tom. i. p. 47. The Eſtabliſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of St. Louis, though well adapted to ſerve as general laws to the whole kingdom, were not publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch, but only as a complete code of cuſtomary law, to be of authority within the King's domains The wiſdom, the equity and the order conſpicuous in that code of St. Louis, procured it a favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception throughout the kingdom. The veneration due to the virtues and good intentions of its author, contributed not a little to reconcile the nation to that
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:011837_0330_0F9D86BC71A9F958"/>
legiſlative authority, which the King began to aſſume. Soon after his time, the idea of the King's poſſeſſing ſupreme legiſlative power became common. If, ſays Beaumanoir, the King makes any eſtabliſhment ſpecially for his own domain, the barons may nevertheleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to their ancient cuſtoms; but if the eſtabliſhment be general, it ſhall be current throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and we ought to believe that ſuch eſtabliſhments are made with mature deliberation, and for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good. Count de Beauvoiſis, c. 48. p. 265. Though the Kings of the third race did not call the general aſſembly of the nation, during the long period from Hugh Capet to Philip the fair, yet they ſeem to have conſulted the biſhops and barons who happened to be preſent in their court, with reſpect to any new law which they publiſhed. Examples of this occur Ordon. tom. i. p. 3 &amp; 5. The practice ſeems to have continued as late as the reign of St. Louis, when the legiſlative authority of the crown was well eſtabliſhed. Ordon. tom. 1. p. 58. A. D. 1246. This attention paid to the barons facilitated the King's acquiring ſuch full poſſeſſion of the legiſlative power, as enabled them afterwards to exerciſe it without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that formality.</p>
                     <p>THE aſſemblies, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the States General, were firſt called, A. D. 1302, and were held occaſionally from that period to the year 1614, ſince which time they have not been ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe were very different from the ancient aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the French nation under the Kings of the firſt and ſecond race. There is no point with reſpect to which the French antiquarians are more generally agreed, than in maintaining that the States General had no ſuffrage in the paſſing of laws, and poſſeſſed no proper juriſdiction. The whole tenor of the French hiſtory confirms this opinion. The form of proceeding in the States General was this. The King addreſſed himſelf to the whole body aſſembled in one place, and laid before them the affairs on account of which he had ſummoned them. The deputies of each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe anſwers and repreſentations were conſidered by the King in his council, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally gave riſe to an ordonance. Theſe ordonances were not addreſſed to the three eſtates in common. Sometimes the King addreſſed an ordonance to each of the eſtates in particular. Sometimes he mentioned the aſſembly of the three eſtates. Sometimes mention is made only of the aſſembly of that eſtate to which the ordonance is addreſſed. Sometimes no mention at all is made of the aſſembly of eſtates, which ſuggeſted the propriety of enacting the law. Preface au tom. iii. des Ordon. p. xx.

                     <p>IF the parliament of Paris be conſidered only as the ſupreme court of juſtice, every thing relative to its origin and juriſdiction is clear and obvious. It is the ancient court of the King's palace, new-modelled, rendered ſedentary, and inveſted with an extenſive and aſcertained juriſdiction. The power of this court, while employed in this part of its functions, is not the object of preſent conſideration. The pretenſions of the parliament to controul the exerciſe of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative authority, and its claim of a right to interpoſe with reſpect to publick affairs and the political admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the kingdom, lead to enquiries attended with greater difficulty. As the officers and members of the parliament of Paris were antiently nominated by the King, were paid by him, and on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were removed by him at pleaſure (Chroniq. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deleuſe de Louis XI. chez les Mem. de Comines, tom. ii. p. 51. Edit. de M. Lenglet de Freſnoy), they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as repreſentatives of the people, nor could they claim any ſhare in the legiſlative power as acting in their name. We muſt ſearch for ſome other ſource of this high privilege. The parliament was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

compoſed of the moſt eminent perſons in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The peers of France, eccleſiaſticks of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt order, and noblemen of illuſtrious birth were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, to whom were added ſome clerks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors learned in the laws.

A court thus conſtituted, was properly a committee of the States General of the Kingdom, and was compoſed of theſe barons and <hi>fideles,</hi> whom the Kings of France were accuſtomed to conſult with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to every act of juriſdiction or legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It was natural, therefore, during the intervals between the meetings of the States General, or during thoſe periods when that aſſembly was not called, to conſult the parliament, to lay matters of publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern before it, and to obtain its approbation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, before any ordonance was publiſhed, to which the people were required to conform. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſecond race of Kings, every new law was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into proper form by the Chancellor of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was propoſed by him to the people, and when enacted, was committed to him to be kept among the publick records, that he might give authentick copies of it to all who ſhould demand them.

It was therefore natural for the King to continue to employ him in his ancient functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of framing, taking into his cuſtody, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordonances which were iſſued. To an ancient copy of the Capitularia of Charlemagne, the following words are ſubjoined.

Bouquet Recueil. tom. v. p. 663. <hi>Mallus</hi> ſignifies not only the publick aſſembly of the nation, but the court of juſtice

held by the comes, or miſſus dominicus. Scabini were the judges, or the aſſeſſors of the judges in that court. Here then ſeems to be a very early inſtance, not only of laws being publiſhed in a court of juſtice, but of their being verified or confirmed by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the judges. If this was the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it naturally introduced the verifying of edicts in the parliament of Paris. But this conjecture I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with that diffidence, which I felt in all my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings concerning the laws and inſtitutions of foreign nations. 3. This ſupreme court of juſtice in France was dignified with the appellation of parliament, the name by which the general aſſembly of the nation was diſtinguiſhed towards the cloſe of the ſecond race of Kings; and men, both in reaſoning and in conduct, are wonderfully influenced by the ſimilarity of names. The preſerving the ancient names of the magiſtrates, eſtabliſhed while republican government ſubſiſted in Rome, enabled Auguſtus and his ſucceſſors to aſſume new powers, with leſs obſervation, and greater eaſe. The beſtowing the ſame name in France upon two courts, which were extremely different, contributed not a little to confound their juriſdiction and functions.</p>
                     <p>ALL theſe circumſtances concurred in leading the Kings of France to avail themſelves of the parliament of Paris, as the inſtrument of reconciling the people to their exerciſe of legiſlative authority. The French, accuſtomed to ſee all new laws examined and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized before they were publiſhed, did not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh between the effect of performing this in the national aſſembly, or in a court appointed by the King. But as that court was compoſed of reſpectable members, and well ſkilled in the laws of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when any new edict received its ſanction, that was ſufficient to diſpoſe the people to implicit ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the practice of <hi>verifying</hi> and <hi>regiſtering</hi> the royal edicts in the parliament of Paris became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the parliament contended, that this was neceſſary in order to give them legal authority. It was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as a fundamental maxim in French juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that no law could be publiſhed in any other
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:011837_0334_0F9D86C0306E0A70"/>
manner; that without this formality, no edict or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance could have any effect; that the people were not bound to obey it, and ought not to conſider it as an edict or ordonance until it was verified in the ſupreme court, after free deliberation. Roche-flavin des Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemens de France, 4to. Gen. 1621. p. 921. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at different times, hath with great fortitude and integrity, oppoſed the will of their ſovereigns, and notwithſtanding their repeated and peremptory requiſitions and commands, hath refuſed to verify and publiſh ſuch edicts, as it conceived to be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the people, or ſubverſive of the conſtitution of the kingdom. Roche-flavin reckons that between the year 1562, and the year 1589, the parliament refuſed to verify more than a hundred edicts of the Kings. Ibid. 924. Many inſtances of the ſpirit and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with which the parliaments of France oppoſed pernicious laws, and aſſerted their own privileges, are enumerated by Limnaeus Notitiae Regni Franciae, lib. i. c. 9. p. 224.</p>
                     <p>BUT the power of the parliament to maintain and defend this privilege, bore no proportion to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or to the courage with which its members aſſerted it. When any monarch was determined that an edict ſhould be carried into execution, and found the parliament inflexibly reſolved not to verify or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, he could eaſily ſupply this defect by the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his regal power. He repaired to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in perſon, he took poſſeſſion of his ſeat of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and commanded the edict to be read, verified, regiſtered, and publiſhed in his preſence. Then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to another maxim of French law, the King himſelf being preſent, neither the parliament, nor any magiſtrate whatever, can exerciſe any authority, or perform any function.

                     <p>AS I have endeavoured in the hiſtory to trace the various ſteps in the progreſs of the conſtitution of the Empire, and to explain the peculiarities in its policy

very fully, it is not neceſſary to add much by way of illuſtration. What appears to be of any importance I ſhall range under diſtinct heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. WITH reſpect to the power, juriſdiction and revenue of the Emperors. A very juſt idea of theſe may be formed by attending to the view which Pfeffel gives of the rights of the Emperors at two different periods. The firſt at the cloſe of the Saxon race, A. D. 1024. Theſe, according to his enumeration were the right of conferring all the great eccleſiaſtical beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in Germany; of receiving the revenues of them during a vacancy; of Mort-main, or of ſucceeding to the effects of eccleſiaſticks who died inteſtate. The right of confirming or of annulling the elections of the Popes. The right of aſſembling councils, and of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them to decide concerning the affairs of the church. The right of conferring the title of King upon their vaſſals. The right of granting vacant fiefs. The right of receiving the revenues of the Empire, whether ariſing from the Imperial domains, from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts and tolls, from gold or ſilver mines, from the taxes paid by the Jews, or from forfeitures. The right of governing Italy as its proper ſovereigns. The right of erecting free cities, and of eſtabliſhing fairs in them. The right of aſſembling the diets of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and of fixing the time of their duration. The right of coining money, and of conferring that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege on the ſtates of the Empire. The right of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring both high and low juſtice within the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the different ſtates. Abregé p. 160. The other period is at the extinction of the Emperors of the families of Luxemburg, and Bavaria, A. D. 1437. According to the ſame author the Imperial preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives at that time were the right of conferring all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and titles, except the privilege of being a ſtate of the Empire. The right of <hi>Precis primariae</hi> or of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing once during their reign a dignitary in each chapter or religious houſe. The right of granting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations with reſpect to the age of majority. The right of erecting cities, and of conferring the privilege of coining money. The right of calling the meetings of the diet, and of preſiding in them. Abregé, &amp;c.
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:011837_0337_0F9D86C27007FD70"/>
p. 507. It were eaſy to ſhow that M. Pfeffel is well founded in all theſe aſſertions, and to confirm them by the teſtimony of the moſt reſpectable authors. In the one period the Emperors appear as mighty ſovereigns with extenſive prerogatives; in the other as the heads of a confederacy with very limited powers.</p>
                     <p>THE revenues of the Emperors decreaſed ſtill more than their authority. The early Emperors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe of the Saxon line, beſides their vaſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial or hereditary territories, poſſeſſed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive domain both in Italy and Germany which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them as Emperors. Italy belonged to the Emperors as their proper kingdom, and the revenues which they drew from it were very conſiderable. The firſt alienations of the Imperial revenue were made in this country. The Italian cities having acquired wealth, and aſpiring at independance, purchaſed their liberty from different Emperors, as I have obſerved Note XV. The ſums which they paid, and the Emperors with whom they concluded theſe bargains, are mentioned by Caſp. Klockius de Aerario Norimb. 1671. p. 85, &amp;c. Charles IV. and his ſon Wenceſlaus diſſipated all that remained of the Italian branch of the domain. The German domain lay chiefly upon the banks of the Rhine, and was under the government of the Counts Palatine. It is not eaſy to mark out the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, or to eſtimate the value of this ancient domain, which has been ſo long incorporated with the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of different Princes. Some hints with reſpect to it may be found in the gloſſary of Speidelius which he has intitled Speculum Juridico-Philologico-politico-Hiſtoricum Obſervationum, &amp;c. Norimb. 1673. vol. i. 679. 1045. a more full account of it is given by Klockius de Aerario, p. 84. Beſides this, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors poſſeſſed conſiderable diſtricts of land lying inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with the eſtates of the Dukes and barons. They were accuſtomed to viſit theſe frequently, and drew from them what was ſufficient to ſupport their court during the time of their reſidence. Annaliſtae, ap. Struv. tom. i. 611. A great part of theſe were ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the nobles during the long interregnum, or during the wars occaſioned by the conteſts between
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:011837_0338_0F9D86C33A37A408"/>
the Emperors and the court of Rome. At the ſame time that ſuch encroachments were made on the fixed or territorial property of the Emperors, they were robbed almoſt entirely of their caſual revenues. The Princes and barons appropriating to themſelves taxes and duties of every kind, which had uſually been paid to them, Pfeffel Abregè, p. 374. The profuſe and inconfiderate ambition of Charles IV. ſquandered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remained of the Imperial revenues after ſo many defalcations. He, in the year 1376, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the electors to chuſe his ſon Wenceſlaus King of the Romans, promiſed each of them a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand crowns. But being unable to pay ſo large a ſum, and eager to ſecure the election to his ſon, he alienated to the three eccleſiaſtical Electors, and to the Count Palatine, ſuch countries as ſtill belonged to the Imperial domain on the banks of the Rhine, and likewiſe made over to them all the taxes and tolls then levied by the Emperors in that diſtrict. Trithemius, and the author of the Chronicle of Magdeburgh enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the territories and taxes which were thus alienated, and repreſent this as the laſt and fatal blow to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial authority. Struv. Corp. vol. i. p. 437. From that period, the ſhreds of the ancient revenues poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperors have been ſo inconſiderable, that in the opinion of Speidelius, all that they yield would be ſo far from defraying the expence of ſupporting their houſhold, that they would not pay the charge of maintaining the poſts eſtabliſhed in the Empire. Spei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delii Speculum, &amp;c. vol. i. p. 680. Theſe funds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as they were, continued to decreaſe.

From the reign of Charles IV, whom Maximilian called the peſt of the Empire, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have depended entirely on their hereditary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as the only ſource of their power and even of their ſubſiſtence.</p>

The Imperial crown, as well as thoſe of moſt monarchies in Europe, were originally attained by election. An opinion long prevailed among the antiquaries and publick lawyers of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that the right of chuſing the Emperors was veſted in the archbiſhops of Mentz, Cologne and Treves, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburgh, and the Count Palatine of the Rhine, by an edict of Otho III, confirmed by Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the V, about the year 996. But the whole tenor of hiſtory contradicts this opinion. It appears that from the earlieſt period in the hiſtory of Germany, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was to reign over all, was elected by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of all. Thus Conrad I. was elected by all the people of the Franks, ſays ſome annaliſts; by all the princes and chief men, ſays others; by all the nation, ſays others. See their words, Struv. Corp. 211. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringius de German. Imper. Repub. Acroamata Sex. Ebroduni 1654. p. 103. In the year 1024, poſterior to the ſuppoſed regulations of Otho III, Conrad II, was elected by all the chief men, and his election was approved and confirmed by the people, Struv. Corp. 284. At the election of Lotharius II, A. D. 1125, ſixty thouſand perſons of all ranks were preſent. He was named by the chief men, and their nomination was approved by the people. Struv. ibid. p. 357. The firſt author who mentions the ſeven Electors is Martinus Polonus, who flouriſhed in the reign of Frederick II, which ended A. D. 1250. We find that in all the ancient elections to which I have refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Princes of greateſt power and authority were allowed by their countrymen to name the perſon whom they wiſhed to appoint Emperor, and the people approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſapproved of their nomination. This privilege of voting firſt is called by the German lawyers the right of <hi>Praetaxation.</hi> Pfeffel Abregé, p. 316. This was the firſt origin of the excluſive right which the Electors acquired. The Electors poſſeſſed the moſt extenſive territories of any Princes in the Empire; all the great offices of the ſtate were in their hands by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:011837_0340_0F9D86C4AF8D1498"/>
right; as ſoon as they obtained or engroſſed ſo much influence in the election, as to be allowed the right of praetaxation, it became unneceſſary for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior eccleſiaſticks and barons to attend, when they had no other function but that of confirming the deed of theſe more powerful Princes, by their aſſent. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times of turbulence, they could not reſort to the place of election, without a numerous retinue of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vaſſals, the expence of which they were obliged to defray out of their own revenues. The rights of the ſeven Electors were ſupported by all the deſcendants and allies of their powerful families, who ſhared in the ſplendor and influence, which they enjoyed by this diſtinguiſhing privilege. Pfeffel. Abregé, p. 376. The ſeven Electors were conſidered as the repreſentatives of all the orders, which compoſed the higheſt claſs of German nobility. There were three archbiſhops, chancellors of the three great diſtricts into which the Empire was anciently divided; one King; one Duke; one Marquis; and one Count. All theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contributed to render the introduction of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable innovation into the conſtitution of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manick body, extremely eaſy. Every thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, relating to this branch of the political ſtate of the Empire, is well illuſtrated by Onuphrius Panvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius an Auguſtinian Monk of Verona, who lived in the reign of Charles V. His treatiſe, if we make ſome allowance for that partiality which he expreſſes in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the powers which the Popes claimed in the Empire has the merit of being one of the firſt works in which a controverted point in hiſtory is examined with critical preciſion, and with a proper attention to that evidence which is derived from records, or the teſtimony of contemporary hiſtorians. It is inſerted by Goldaſtus in his Politica Imperialia, p. 2.</p>
                     <p>AS the Electors have engroſſed the ſole right of chuſing the Emperors, they have aſſumed likewiſe that of depoſing them. This high power the Electors have not only preſumed to claim, but have ventured, in more than one inſtance, to exerciſe. In the year 1298, a part of the Electors deſpoſed Adolphus of Naſſau and ſubſtituted Albert of Auſtria in his place.

The reaſons on which they found their ſentence, ſhow that this deed flowed from factious, not from public-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited motives. Struv. Corp. vol. i. 540. In the firſt year of the fifteenth century, the Electors depoſed Wenceſlaus, and placed the Imperial crown on the head of Rupert Elector Palatine. The act of depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtill extant. Goldaſti Conſtit. vol. i. 379. It is pronounced in the name and by the authority of the Electors, and confirmed by ſeveral prelates and barons of the Empire, who were preſent. Theſe exertions of the electoral power demonſtrate that the Imperial authority was ſunk very low.</p>
                     <p>THE other privileges of the electors, and the rights of the electoral college are explained by the writers on the publick law in Germany.</p>

WITH reſpect to the diets or general aſſemblies of the Empire, it would be neceſſary, if my object were to write a particular hiſtory of Germany, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a minute detail, concerning the forms of aſſembling it, the perſons who have a right to be preſent, their diviſion into ſeveral Colleges or Benches, the objects of their deliberations, the mode in which they carry on their debates or give their ſuffrages, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their decrees or receſſes. But in a general hiſtory it is ſufficient to obſerve, that, originally, the diets of the Empire were perfectly the ſame with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of March and of May, held by the Kings of France. They met, at leaſt, once a year. Every freeman had a right to be preſent. They were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in which a monarch deliberated with his ſubjects, concerning their common intereſt. Arumaeus de comitiis Rom. German Imperii, 4to. Jenae. 1660, cap. 7. No. 20, &amp;c. But when the Princes, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified eccleſiaſticks, and barons, acquired territorial and independant juriſdiction, the diet became an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the ſeparate ſtates, which formed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of which the Emperor was head. While the conſtitution of the Empire remained in its primitive form, attendance on the diets was a duty, like the other ſervices due from feudal ſubjects to their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, which the members were bound to perform in perſon; and if any member who had a right to be
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:011837_0342_0F9D86C630DE8F20"/>
preſent in the diet neglected to attend in perſon, he not only loſt his vote, but was liable to an heavy pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. Arumaeus de Comit. c. 5. No. 40. Whereas, from the time that the members of the diet became independant ſtates, the right of ſuffrage was annexed to the territory or dignity, not to the perſon. The members, if they could not, or would not attend in perſon, might ſend their deputies, as Princes ſend ambaſſadors, and they were entitled to exerciſe all the rights belonging to their conſtitutients. Ibid. No. 42, 46, 49. By degrees, and upon the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conſidering the diet as an aſſembly of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſtates, in which each confederate had the right of ſuffrage, if any member poſſeſſed more than one of thoſe ſtates or characters which entitle to a ſeat in the diet, he was allowed a proportional number of ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Pfeffel, Abregé 622. From the ſame cauſe the Imperial cities, as ſoon as they became free, and acquired ſupreme and independant juriſdiction within their own territories, were received as members of the diet. The powers of the diet extend to every thing relative to the common concern of the Germanick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or that can intereſt or affect it as a confederacy. The diet takes no cognizance of the interior admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the different States, unleſs that happens to diſturb or threaten the general ſafety.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. WITH reſpect to the Imperial chamber, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of which has been the great ſource of order and tranquillity in Germany, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that this court was inſtituted in order to put an end to the calamities occaſioned by private wars in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I have already traced the riſe and progreſs of this practice, and pointed out its pernicious effects as fully as their extenſive influence during the middle ages merited. In Germany, private wars ſeem to have been more frequent and productive of worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences than in the other countries of Europe. There are obvious reaſons for this. The nobility of Germany were extremely numerous, and the cauſes of their diſſention multiplied in proportion. The territorial juriſdiction which the German nobles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was more compleat than that poſſeſſed by
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:011837_0343_0F9D86C7C47966A8"/>
their order in other nations. They became, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, independent powers, and they claimed all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of that character. The long interregnum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed them to an uncontrouled licence, and led them to forget that ſubordination which is neceſſary in order to maintain public tranquillity. At the time when the other monarchs of Europe began to acquire ſuch an increaſe of power and revenues, as added new force to their government, the authority and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Emperors continued gradually to decline. The diets of the Empire, which alone had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to judge between ſuch mighty barons, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enforce its deciſions, met very ſeldom. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Acroamata, p. 234. The diets when they did aſſemble were often compoſed of ſeveral thouſand members, Chronic, Conſtant. ap. Struv. Corp. i. p. 546, and were mere tumultuary aſſemblies, ill-quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to decide concerning any queſtion of right. The ſeſſion of the diets continued only two or three days; Pfeffel Abregè, p. 244, ſo that they had no time to hear or diſcuſs any cauſe that was in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree intricate. Thus Germany was left, in ſome meaſure, without any court of judicature, capable of repreſſing the evils of private war.</p>
                     <p>ALL the expedients which were employed in other countries of Europe in order to reſtrain this practice, and which I have deſcribed Note XXI. were tried in Germany with little effect. The confederacies of the nobles and of the cities, and the diviſion of Germany in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to various circles, which I mentioned in that Note, were found likewiſe inſufficient. As a laſt remedy, the Germans had recourſe to arbiters whom they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Auſtregae.</hi> The barons and ſtates in different parts of Germany joined in conventions, by which they bound themſelves to refer all controverſies, that might ariſe between them, to the determination of <hi>Auſtregae,</hi> and to ſubmit to their ſentences as final. Theſe arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are named ſometimes in the treaty of convention, an inſtance of which occurs in Ludewig Reliquae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcr. omnis aevi, vol. 2. 212. ſometimes they were choſen by mutual conſent; ſometimes they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by neutral perſons; and ſometimes the choice
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:011837_0344_0F9D86C7DB3CABE8"/>
was left to be decided by lot. Datt. de Pace publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Imperii, lib. i. cap. 27. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 60, &amp;c. Speidelius Speculum, &amp;c. voc. <hi>Auſtreg.</hi> p. 95. Upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of this practice, the public tribunals of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice became, in a great meaſure, uſeleſs, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely deſerted.</p>
                     <p>IN order to re-eſtabliſh the authority of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Maximilian inſtituted the Imperial chamber, at the period which I have mentioned. This tribunal conſiſted originally of a preſident, who was always a nobleman of the firſt order, and of ſixteen judges. The preſident was appointed by the Emperor, and the judges, partly by him, and partly by the States, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to forms which it is unneceſſary to deſcribe. A ſum was impoſed with their own conſent, on the States of the Empire, for paying the ſalaries of the judges, and officers in this court. The Imperial chamber was eſtabliſhed firſt at Francfort on the Maine. During the reign of Charles V. it was removed to Spires, and continued in that city above a century and a half. It is now fixed at Wetzlar. This court takes cognizance of all queſtions concerning civil right between the States of the Empire, and paſſes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the laſt reſort, and without appeal. To it belongs, likewiſe, the privilege of judging in criminal cauſes, which may be conſidered as connected with the preſervation of the publick peace. Pfeffel Abregé, 560.</p>
                     <p>ALL cauſes relating to points of feudal right or juriſdiction, together with ſuch as reſpect the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which hold of the Empire in Italy, belong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the juriſdiction of the Aulick council. This tribunal was formed upon tihe model of the ancient court of the palace inſtituted by the Emperors of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. It depended not upon the States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but upon the Emperor; he having the right of appointing at pleaſure all the judges of whom it is compoſed. Maximilian, in order to procure ſome compenſation for the diminution of his authority, by the powers veſted in the Imperial chamber, prevailed on the diet A. D. 1512. to give its conſent to the eſtabliſhment of the Aulick council. Since that time,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:011837_0345_0F9D86C883584320"/>
it has been a great object of policy in the court of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna to extend the juriſdiction, and ſupport the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Aulick council, and to circumſcribe and weaken thoſe of the Imperial chamber. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious forms and dilatory proceeding of the Imperial chamber have furniſhed the Emperors with pretexts for doing ſo. Lites Spirae, according to the witticiſm of a German lawyer, ſpirant, ſed nunquam exſpirant. Such delays are unavoidable in a court compoſed of members named by States, jealous of each other. Whereas the judges of the Aulick council, depending on one maſter, and being reſponſible to him alone, are more vigorous and deciſive. Puffendorf. de Statu Imper. German. cap. v. § 20. Pfeffel Abrege, p. 581.</p>

                     <p>THE deſcription which I have given of the Turkiſh government is conformable to the accounts of the moſt intelligent travellers who have viſited that Empire. The count de Marſigli, in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe concerning the military ſtate of the Turkiſh Empire, ch. vi. and the Author of obſervations on the religion, laws, government and manners of the Turks, publiſhed at London 1768, vol i. p. 81. differ from other writers who have deſcribed the political conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that powerful monarchy. As they had opportunity, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their long reſidence in Turky, to obſerve the order and juſtice conſpicuous in ſeveral departments of adminiſtration, they ſeem unwilling to admit that it ſhould be denominated a deſpotiſm. But when the form of government in any country is repreſented to be deſpotick, this does not ſuppoſe that the power of the monarch is continually exerted in acts of violence, injuſtice and cruelty. Under government of every ſpecies, unleſs when ſome frantick tyrant hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to hold the ſcepter, the ordinary adminiſtration muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the principles of juſtice, and if not active in promoting the welfare of the people, cannot certainly have their deſtruction for its object. A ſtate, in which the ſovereign poſſeſſes the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command of a vaſt military force, together with the diſpoſal of an extenſive revenue; in which the people have no privileges, and no part eitheir immediate or remote in legiſlation; in which there is no body of hereditary nobility, jealous of their own rights and diſtinctions, to ſtand as an intermediate order between the Prince and People, cannot be diſtinguiſhed by any name but that of a deſpotiſm. The reſtraints, however, which I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ariſing from the <hi>Capiculy,</hi> and from religion, are powerful. But they are not ſuch as change the nature or denomination of the government. When a deſpotick Prince employs an armed force to ſupport his authority, he commits the ſupreme power to their
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:011837_0346_0F9D86C931A63868"/>
hands. The Praetorian bands in Rome, dethroned, murdered, and exalted Princes, in the ſame wanton manner with the ſoldiery of the Porte at Conſtantinople. But notwithſtanding this, the Roman Emperors have been conſidered by all political writers as poſſeſſing deſpotick power.</p>

                        </gap>aries are deſcribed by all the authors who give any account of the Turkiſh government. The manner in which enthuſiaſm was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in order to inſpire them with courage is thus related by Prince Cantemir, "When Amurath I. had formed them into a body, he ſent them to Haji Bektaſh a Turkiſh Saint, famous for his miracles and prophecies, deſiring him to give them a banner to pray to God for their ſucceſs, and to give them a name. The ſaint, when they appeared in his preſence, put the ſleeve of his gown upon one of their heads, and ſays, Let them be called <hi>Yeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicheri.</hi> Let their countenance be ever bright, their hands victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their ſword keen, let their ſpear always hang over the heads of their enemies, and wherever they go, may they return with a ſhining face. Hiſtory of the Ottoman Empire, p. 38. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Janizaries, at the firſt inſtitution of the body, was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Under Solyman, in the year 1521, they amounted to twelve thouſand, Since that time their number has greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, Marſigli, Etat. &amp;c. ch. 16. p. 68. Though Solyman poſſeſſed ſuch abilities and authority as to reſtrain this formidable body within the bounds of obedience, yet its tendency to limit the power of the Sultans was, even in that age, foreſeen by ſagacious obſervers. Nicolas Daulphinois, who accompined M. d'Aramon ambaſſador from Henry II. of France to Solyman, publiſhed an account of his travels, in which he deſcribes and celebrates the diſcipline of the Janizaries, but at the ſame time predicts that they would, one day, become formidable to their maſters, and act the ſame part at Conſtantinople<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Praetorian bands had done at Rome.

He divided the military force into the <hi>Capiculy</hi> or ſoldiery of the Porte. which was properly the ſtanding army, and <hi>Serrataculy</hi> or ſoldiers appointed to guard the frontiers. The chief ſtrength of the latter conſiſted of thoſe who held Timariots and Ziams.

with great accuracy the extent of theſe lands in each province of his Empire, appointed the preciſe number of ſoldiers each perſon who held a Timariot or a Ziam ſhould bring into the field, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the pay which they ſhould receive while engaged in ſervice. Count Marſigli and Sir Paul Rycaut have been extracts from this book of regulations, and it appears that the ordinary eſtabliſhment of the Turkiſh army exceeded an hundred and fifty thouſand men. When theſe are added to the ſoldiery of the Porte, they formed a military power which vaſtly exceeded what any Chriſtian State could command. Marſigli Etat Militaire, &amp;c. p. 136. Rycaut's ſtate of the Ottoman Empire, book iii. ch. 2. As Solyman, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his active reign, was engaged ſo conſtantly in war, that his troops were always in the field, the <hi>Serrataculy</hi> became almoſt equal to the Janizaries themſelves in diſcipline and valour.</p>
                     <p>IT is not ſurprizing, then, that the authors of the ſixteenth century ſhould repreſent the Turks as far ſuperior to the Chriſtians, both in the knowledge and in the practice of the art of war.

Buſbequius, who was ambaſſador from Ferdinand to Solyman, and who had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to obſerve the ſtate both of the Chriſtian and Turkiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, publiſhed a diſcourſe concerning the beſt manner of carrying on war againſt the Turks, in which he points out at great length the immenſe advantages which the infidels poſſeſſed with reſpect to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and military improvements of every kind.

                     <p>BEFORE I conclude theſe Proofs and Illuſtrations, I ought to explain the reaſon of two omiſſions in them; one of which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to mention on my own account, the other to obviate an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this part of the work.</p>
                     <p>IN all my inquiries and diſquiſitions concerning the progreſs of government, manners, literature, and commerce during the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ages, as well as in my delineations of the political conſtitution of the different States of Europe at the opening of the ſixteenth century, I have not once mentioned M. de Voltaire, who, in his <hi>Eſſay ſur l'hiſtoire generale,</hi> has reveiwed the ſame period, and has treated of all theſe ſubjects. This does not proceed from inattenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the works of that extraordinary man, whoſe genius, no leſs enterprizing than univerſal, has attempted almoſt every different ſpecies of literary compoſition. In many of theſe he excels, In all if he had left religion untouched, he is inſtructive and agreeable. But as he ſeldom imitates the example of modern hiſtorians in cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authors from whom they derived their information. I could not, with propriety, appeal to his authority in confirmation of any doubtful or unknown fact. I have often, however, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as my guide in theſe reſearches; and he has not only point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the facts with reſpect to which it was of importance to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but the concluſions which it was proper to draw from them. If he had, at the ſame time, mentioned the books which relate theſe particulars, a great part of my labour would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary,
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:011837_0348_0F9D86CAB0168818"/>
and many of his readers who now conſider him only as an entertaining and lively writer, would find that he is a learned and well-informed hiſtorian.</p>
                     <p>AS to the other omiſſion; every intelligent reader muſt have obſerved, that I have not entered, either in the hiſtorical part of this volume, or in the Proofs and Illuſtrations, into the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail with reſpect to the ancient laws and cuſtoms of the Britiſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as concerning thoſe of the other European nations. As the capital facts with regard to the progreſs of government and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their own country are known to moſt of my readers, ſuch a detail appeared to me to be leſs eſſential. Such facts and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, however, as were neceſſary towards compleating my deſign in this part of the work, I have mentioned under the different arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which are the ſubjects of my diſquiſitions. The ſtate of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in all the nations of Europe, having been nearly the ſame during ſeveral ages, nothing can tend more to illuſtrate the progreſs of the Engliſh conſtitution, than a careful inquiry into the laws and cuſtoms of the kingdoms on the continent. This ſource of information has been too much neglected by the Engliſh antiquarians and lawyers. Filled with admiration of that happy conſtitution now eſtabliſhed in Great Britain, they have been more attentive to its forms and principles, than to the condition and ideas of remote times, which, in almoſt every particular, differ from the preſent. While engaged in peruſing the laws, charters, and early hiſtorians of the continental kingdoms, I have often been led to think that an attempt to illuſtrate the progreſs of the Engliſh juriſprudence and policy, by a compariſon with thoſe of other kingdoms in a ſimilar ſituation, would be of great utility, and might throw much light on ſome points which are now obſcure, and decide others, which have been long controverted.</p>

Iſabella, the daughter of John II. of Caſtile, far from having any proſpect of that noble inheritance, which ſhe tranſmitted to her grandſon, paſſed the early part of her life in obſcurity and indigence; but the Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, exaſperated againſt her brother Henry IV. an ill-adviſed and vicious prince, publicly charged him with impotence, and his queen with adultery; and, upon his demiſe, rejecting Joanna, whom the king had uniformly, and even on his death-bed, owned to be his lawful daughter, and whom an aſſembly of the ſtates had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the heir of his kingdom, they obliged her to retire into Portugal, and placed Iſabella on the throne of Caſtile. Ferdinand owed the crown of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to the unexpected death of his elder brother, and acquired the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily by violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith of treaties, and diſregarding the ties of blood. To all theſe kingdoms, Chriſtopher Columbus, by an effort of genius and of intrepidity, the boldeſt and moſt ſucceſsful that is recorded in the annals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, added a new world, the wealth of which was one conſiderable ſource of the power and grandeur of the Spaniſh monarchs.</p>

But as her huſband, the Archduke, was a ſtranger to the Spaniards, it was thought expedient to invite him into Spain, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding among them, he might accuſtom himſelf to their laws and manners; and it was expected that the Cortes, or aſſembly of ſtates, whoſe authority was then ſo great in Spain, that no title to the crown was reckoned valid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it received their ſanction, would acknowledge his right of ſucceſſion, together with that of the Infanta, his wife.<note place="margin">1502.</note> Philip and Joanna, paſſing through France, in their way to Spain, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in that kingdom with the utmoſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.

The archduke did homage to Lewis XII. for the earldom of Flanders, and took his ſeat as a peer of the realm in the parliament of Paris. They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Spain with every mark of honour that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental affection of Ferdinand and Iſabella, or the reſpect of their ſubjects could deviſe; and their title to the crown was ſoon after acknowledged by the Cortes of both kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>BUT amidſt theſe outward appearances of ſatisfaction and joy,<note place="margin">Ferdinand jealous of Philip's power.</note> ſome ſecret uneaſineſs preyed upon the mind of each of theſe princes. The ſtately and reſerved ceremonial of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh court was ſo burdenſome to Philip, a prince young, gay, affable, fond of ſociety and of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he ſoon began to expreſs a deſire of returning to his native country, the manners of which were more ſuited to his temper. Ferdinand, obſerving the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health of his queen, with whoſe life his right to the government of Caſtile muſt ceaſe, eaſily foreſaw, that a prince of Philip's diſpoſition, and who already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an extreme impatience to reign, would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his retaining any degree of authority in that kingdom; and the proſpect of this diminution of his power, awakened the jealouſy of that ambitious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
                  <p>ISABELLA beheld, with the ſentiments natural to a mother,<note place="margin">Iſabella's ſolicitude, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the indifference and neglect with which the Archduke treated her daughter, who was deſtitute of all thoſe beauties of perſon, and all thoſe accompliſhments of mind, which fix the affections of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Her underſtanding, always weak, was often diſordered. She doated on Philip with ſuch an exceſs of childiſh and impertinent fondneſs, as excited diſguſt rather than affection. Her jealouſy, for which her huſband's behaviour gave her too much cauſe, was proportioned to her love, and often broke out in the moſt extravagant actions. Iſabella, though ſenſible of her defects, could not help pitying her condition, which was ſoon rendered altogether deplorable, by the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke's abrupt reſolution of ſetting out in the middle of winter for Flanders, and of leaving her in Spain.

                  <p>PHILIP, in paſſing through France, had an interview with Lewis the XII. and ſigned a treaty with him, by which he hoped that all the differences between France and Spain would be finally terminated. But Ferdinand, whoſe affairs, at that time, were extremely proſperous in Italy, where the ſuperior genius of Gonſalvo de Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dova, the great captain, triumphed, on every occaſion, over the arms of France, did not pay the leaſt regard to what his ſon-in-law had concluded, and carried on hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities with greater ardour than ever.</p>

The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe events was not far diſtant. The untimely death of her children had made a deep impreſſion on the mind of Iſabella, and as ſhe could derive but little conſolation for the loſſes ſhe had ſuſtained either from her daughter Joanna, whoſe infirmities daily increaſed, or from her ſon-in-law, who no longer preſerved even the appearance of a decent reſpect towards that unhappy princeſs, her ſpirits and health began gradually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and, after languiſhing ſome months, ſhe died at Medina del Campo, on the twenty-ſixth of November, one thouſand five hundred and four.

The union of Caſtile and Aragon,<note place="margin">The Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> for almoſt thirty years, had not ſo entirely extirpated the ancient and hereditary enmity which ſubſiſted between the natives of theſe kingdoms, that the Caſtilian pride could ſubmit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring, to the government of a king of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Ferdinand's own character, with which the Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians were well acquainted, was far from rendering his authority deſirable. Suſpicious, diſcerning, ſevere and parſimonious, he was accuſtomed to obſerve the moſt minute actions of his ſubjects with a jealous attention, and to reward their higheſt ſervices with little liberality; and they were now deprived of Iſabella, whoſe gentle qualities, and partiality to her Caſtilian ſubjects, often tempered his auſterity, or rendered it tolerable. The maxims of his government were eſpecially odious to the Grandees; for that artful prince, ſenſible of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous privileges conferred upon them by the feudal inſtitutions, had endeavoured, by extending the royal juriſdiction, by protecting their injured vaſſals, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the immunities of cities, and by other meaſures equally prudent, to curb their exorbitant power<note n="g" place="bottom">Marian. lib. 28. c. 12.</note>.

If Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna's infirmities, and the nonage of Charles rendered them incapable of government, he, as a huſband, was the proper guardian of his wife, and, as a father, the natural tutor of his ſon.

deſired it, was refuſed acceſs to her; and Philip's chief object was to prevail on the Cortes to declare her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of government, that an undivided power might be lodged in his hands, till his ſon ſhould attain to full age. But ſuch was the partial attachment of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilians to their native princeſs, that though Manuel had the addreſs to gain ſome members of the Cortes aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Valladolid, and others were willing to gratify their new ſovereign in his firſt requeſt, the great body of the repreſentatives refuſed their conſent to a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they thought ſo injurious to the blood of their monarchs<note n="r" place="bottom">Zurita Anales de Arag. vi. p. 75.</note>. They were unanimous, however, in acknowledging Joanna and Philip, queen and king of Caſtile, and their ſon Charles, prince of Aſturias.</p>
                  <p>THIS was almoſt the only memorable event during Philip's adminiſtration.<note place="margin">Death of Philip.</note> A fever, occaſioned by a debauch, put an end to his life in the twenty-eighth year of his age,<note place="margin">Sept. 25.</note> not having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the regal dignity, which he had been ſo eager to obtain, full three months <note n="s" place="bottom">Marian. lib. 28. c. 23.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE whole royal authority in Caſtile ought, of courſe, to have devolved upon Joanna.<note place="margin">The diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's mind increaſes.</note> But the ſhock, occaſioned by a diſaſter ſo unexpected as the death of her huſband, compleated the diſorder of her underſtanding, and her incapacity for government. During all the time of Philip's ſickneſs, no intreaty could prevail on her, though in the ſixth month of her pregnancy, to leave him for a moment. When he expired, however, ſhe did not ſhed one tear, or utter a ſingle groan. Her grief was ſilent and ſettled. She continued to watch the dead body with the ſame tenderneſs and attention as if it had been alive <note n="t" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 316.</note>, and though at laſt ſhe allowed it to be buried, ſhe ſoon removed it from the tomb to her own apartment. There it was laid upon a bed of ſtate, in a ſplendid dreſs; and having heard from ſome monk a legendary tale of a king who revived after he had been dead fourteen years, ſhe kept her eyes almoſt conſtantly fixed on the body, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the happy moment of its return to life.

was this capricious affection for her dead huſband leſs tinctured with jealouſy, than that which ſhe had borne to him while alive. She did not permit any of her female attendants to approach the bed on which his corpſe was laid; ſhe would not ſuffer any woman, who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to her family, to enter the apartment, and rather than grant that privilege to a midwife, tho' a very aged one had been choſen of purpoſe, ſhe bore the princeſs Catharine without any other aſſiſtance than that of her own domeſtics <note n="u" place="bottom">Mar.

                  <p>A WOMAN, in ſuch a ſtate of mind, was little capable of governing a great kingdom; and Joanna,<note place="margin">She is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> who made it her ſole employment to bewail the loſs, and to pray for the ſoul of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, would have thought her attention to public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs an impious neglect of thoſe duties which ſhe owed to him. But though ſhe declined aſſuming the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration herſelf, yet, by a ſtrange caprice of jealouſy, ſhe refuſed to commit it to any other perſon; and no intreaty of her ſubjects could perſuade her to name a regent, or even to ſign ſuch papers as were neceſſary for the execution of juſtice and the ſecurity of the kingdom.</p>
                  <p>THE death of Philip threw the Caſtilians into the greateſt perplexity. It was neceſſary to appoint a regent, both on account of Joanna's frenzy, and the infancy of her ſon; and as there was not among the nobles, any perſon ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed as to be called by the public voice to that high office, all naturally turned their eyes either to Ferdinand, or to the Emperor Maximilian. The former claimed that dignity as adminiſtrator for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Ferdinand competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors for the regency.</note> and by virtue of the teſtament of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella; the latter thought himſelf the legal guardian of his grandſon, whom, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his mother's infirmity, he already conſidered as king of Caſtile. Thoſe who had lately compelled Ferdinand to reſign the government of the kingdom, trembled at the thoughts of his being reſtored ſo ſoon to his former dignity. They dreaded the return of a monarch not apt to forgive, and who, to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:011837_0363_0F9D86D6B02466E0"/>
with which they were already acquainted, added that reſentment which the remembrance of their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and reflexion upon his own diſgrace, muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have excited. Though none or theſe objections held againſt Maximilian, he was a ſtranger to the laws and manners of Caſtile, and deſtitute of troops and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſupport his pretenſions, nor co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>DON John Manuel, however, and a few of the nobles, who conſidered themſelves as moſt obnoxious to Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand's diſpleaſure, declared for Maximilian, and offered to ſupport his claim with all their intereſt. Maximilian, always enterprizing, and deciſive in council, though feeble and dilatory in execution, eagerly embraced the offer. But a ſeries of ineffectual negotiations was the only conſequence of this tranſaction. The Emperor, as uſual, aſſerted his rights in a high ſtrain, promiſed a great deal, and performed nothing <note n="x" place="bottom">Mariana, lib. 29, c. 7. Zurita Anales de Arag. vi. 93.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A FEW days before the death of Philip, Ferdinand had ſet out for Naples, that, by his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,<note place="margin">Ferdinand abſent, on a viſit to his kingdom of Naples.</note> he might put an end, with the greater decency, to the vice-royalty of the great cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whoſe important ſervices, and cautious conduct, did not ſcreen him from the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of his jealous maſter. Though an account of his ſon-in-law's death reached him at Porto-fino, in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of Genoa, he was ſo ſolicitous to diſcover the ſecret intrigues which he ſuppoſed the great captain to have been carrying on, and to eſtabliſh his own authority on a firm foundation in the Neapolitan dominions, by removing him from the ſupreme command there, that, rather than diſcontinue his voyage, he choſe to leave Caſtile in a ſtate of anarchy, and even to riſque, by this delay, his obtaining poſſeſſion of the government of that kingdom <note n="y" place="bottom">Zurita Anales de Arag. vi. p. 85.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTHING but the great abilities, and prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his adherents, could have prevented the bad

effects of this abſence. At the head of theſe was Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes, archbiſhop of Toledo, who,<note place="margin">Acquires the regency of Caſtile, chiefly through the influence of cardinal Ximenes. 1507.</note> though he had been raiſed to that dignity by Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, contrary to the inclination of Ferdinand, and though he could have no expectation of enjoying much power under his jealous admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, was nevertheleſs ſo diſintereſted, as to prefer the welfare of his country before his own grandeur, and to declare that Caſtile could never be ſo happily governed as by a prince, whom long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience rendered thoroughly acquainted with its true intereſt. His zeal to bring over his countrymen to this opinion, induced him to lay aſide ſomewhat of his uſual auſterity and haughtineſs. He condeſcended, on this occaſion, to court the diſaffected nobles, and employed addreſs, as well as arguments, to perſuade them. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand ſeconded his endeavours with great art; and, by conceſſions to ſome of the grandees, by promiſes to others, and by letters full of complaiſance to all, he gained many of his moſt violent opponents <note n="z" place="bottom">Zurita Anales de Arag. vi. 87. 94 109.</note>. And though many cabals were formed, and ſome commotions excited, yet when Ferdinand,<note place="margin">1507. Aug. 21. Ferdinand returns to Spain.</note> after having ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the affairs of Naples, arrived in Caſtile, he entered upon the adminiſtration, without oppoſition.

                  <p>NOR was the preſervation of tranquillity in his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary kingdoms, the only obligation which the archduke Charles owed to the wiſe regency of his grandfather; he had the ſatisfaction, during that period, of ſeeing very important acquiſitions added to the dominions

over which he was to reign.<note place="margin">Conqueſt of Oran.</note> On the coaſt of Barbary, Oran, and other conqueſts of no ſmall value, were annexed to the crown of Caſtile, by cardinal Ximenes, who, with a ſpirit very uncommon in a monk,<note place="margin">1509.</note> led in perſon a numerous army againſt the Moors of that country; and, with a generoſity and magnificence ſtill more ſingular, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed the whole expence of the expedition out of his own revenues <note n="b" place="bottom">Mariana, lib. 29, c. 18.</note>.

                  <p>IT was not, however, the deſire of aggrandizing the archduke, which influenced Ferdinand in this or in any other of his actions. He was more apt to conſider that young prince as a rival, who might, one day, wreſt out of his hands the government of Caſtile, than as a grandſon, for whoſe behoof he was entruſted with the adminiſtration. This jealouſy ſoon begot averſion,<note place="margin">Ferdinand jealous of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Charles.</note> and even hatred, the ſymptoms of which he was at no pains to conceal. Hence proceeded his immoderate joy when his young queen was delivered of a ſon, whoſe life would have deprived Charles of the crowns of Aragon, Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia; and upon the untimely death of that prince, he diſcovered, for the ſame reaſon, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſolicitude to have other children. This impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of his haſtened, in all probability, the acceſſion of Charles to the crown of Spain. Ferdinand, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to procure a bleſſing, of which, from his advanced age, and the intemperance of his youth, he could have little proſpect, had recourſe to his phyſicians, and, by their preſcription, took one of thoſe potions which are ſuppoſed to add vigour to the conſtitution,<note place="margin">1513.</note> though they more frequently prove fatal to it. This was its effect on a frame ſo feeble and exhauſted as that of Ferdinand, and though he ſurvived a violent
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:011837_0366_0F9D86D8F03C7320"/>
diſorder, which it at firſt occaſioned, it brought on ſuch an habitual languor and dejection of mind, as rendered him averſe from any ſerious attention to public affairs, and fond of frivolous amuſements, on which he had not hitherto beſtowed much time <note n="d" place="bottom">Zurita Anales de Arag. vi. 347. P. Mart. Ep. 531. Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſola Anales de Aragon, lib. i. p. 4.</note>. Though he now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of having any ſon of his own, his jealouſy of the archduke did not abate, nor could he help viewing him with that averſion which princes often bear their ſucceſſors. In order to gratify this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paſſion, he made a will,<note place="margin">1515. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from the Spaniſh kingdoms, by a will in favour of Ferdinand.</note> appointing prince Ferdinand, who having been born and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in Spain, was much beloved by the Spaniards, to be regent of all his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, till the arrival of the archduke his brother; and by the ſame deed he ſettled upon him the grand-maſterſhip of the three military orders. The former of theſe grants might have put it in his power to have diſputed the throne with his brother; the latter would, in any event, have rendered him almoſt independent.</p>
                  <p>FERDINAND retained to the laſt that jealous love of power, which was ſo remarkable through his whole life. Unwilling to reſign it, even at the approach of death, he removed continually from place to place, in order to fly from his diſtemper, or to forget it; and though his ſtrength declined every day, none of his attendants durſt mention his condition; nor would he admit his father confeſſor, who thought ſuch ſilence criminal and unchriſtian, into his preſence. At laſt the danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo imminent, that it could be no longer concealed. Ferdinand received the intimation with a decent forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and touched, perhaps, with compunction at the injuſtice he had done his grandſon, or influenced by the honeſt remonſtrances of Carvajal, Zapata and Vargas, his moſt ancient and faithful counſellors, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that by inveſting prince Ferdinand with the regency, he would infallibly entail a civil war on the two brothers, and by beſtowing on him the grand maſterſhip of the military orders would ſtrip the crown

By a new deed he left Charles the ſole heir of all his dominions, and allotted to prince Ferdinand, inſtead of that throne of which he thought himſelf almoſt ſecure, an inconſiderable eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of fifty thouſand ducats a year <note n="e" place="bottom">Mar.

                  <p>CHARLES, to whom ſuch a noble inheritance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by his death, was near the full age of ſixteen. He had hitherto reſided in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,<note place="margin">Education of Charles V.</note> his paternal dominions. Margaret of Auſtria, his aunt, and Margaret of York, the ſiſter of Edward IV. of England, and widow of Charles the Bold, two princeſſes of great virtue and abilities, had the care of forming his early youth. Upon the death of his father, Philip, the Flemings committed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Low Countries to his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian, with the name rather than the authority of regent <note n="f" place="bottom">Pontius Heuterus Rerum Auſtriacarum, lib. xv.

Maximilian made choice of William de Croy, lord of Chievres, to ſuperintend the education of the young prince his grandſon <note n="g" place="bottom">The French hiſtorians, upon the authority of M. de Bellay, Mem. p. 11. have unanimouſly aſſerted that Philip, by his laſt will, having appointed the king of France to have the direction of his ſon's education, Louis XII. with a diſintereſtedneſs, ſuitable to the confidence repoſed in him, named Chievres for that office. Even the preſident Henault has adopted this opinion. Abregè Chron A. D. 1507. Varillas, in his uſual-manner, pretends to have ſeen Philip's teſtament. Pract de l'education des Princes, p. 16. But the Spaniſh, German and Flemiſh hiſtorians concur in contradicting this aſſertion of the French authors. It appears from Heuterus a contemporary Flemiſh hiſtorian of great authority, that Louis XII. by conſenting to the marriage of Germaine de Foix with Ferdinand, had loſt much of that confidence which Philip once placed in him; that this diſguſt was increaſed by the French King's giving in marriage, to the count of Angoulême, his eldeſt daughter, whom he had formerly betrothed to Charles.

All theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances render it improbable that Philip, who made his will a few days before he died, Heuter. p 152, ſhould commit the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſon to Louis XII. In confirmation of theſe plauſible conjectures, poſitive teſtimony can be adduced. It appears from Heuterus, that Philip, when he ſet out for Spain, had entruſted Chievres both with the care of his ſon's education, and with the government of his dominions in the Low Countries. Heuter. lib. vii, p. 153. That an attempt was made, ſoon after Philip's death, to have the Emperor Maximilian appointed regent, during the minority of his grandſon, but that being oppoſed, Chievres ſeems to have continued to diſcharge both the offices, which Philip had committed to him, Heut. ibid. 153, 155. That in the beginning of the year 1508, the Flemings invited Maximilian to accept of the regency, to which he conſented, and appointed his daughter Margaret, together with a council of Flemings, to exerciſe the ſupreme authority, when he himſelf ſhould, at any time, be abſent.

Under Chievres, Adrian of Utrecht acted as preceptor. This preferment, which opened his way to the higheſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities an eccleſiaſtic can attain, he owed not to his birth, for that was extremely mean; nor to his intereſt, for he was a ſtranger to the arts of a court; but to the opinion which his countrymen entertained of his learning. He was indeed no inconſiderable proficient in thoſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſciences which, during ſeveral centuries, aſſumed the name of Philoſophy, and publiſhed a commentary, which was highly eſteemed, upon The Book of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, a famous treatiſe of Petrus Lombardus, and conſidered, at that time, as the ſtandard ſyſtem of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical theology.

The perſonal rights, and political influence, which the inhabitants of theſe cities had acquired, were extenſive. The royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative circumſcribed by the privileges of the nobility, and by the pretenſions of the people, was confined within very narrow limits. Under ſuch a form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the principles of diſcord were many; the bond of union was extremely feeble; and Spain felt not only all the inconveniencies occaſioned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the feudal ſyſtem, but was expoſed to diſorders ariſing from the peculiarities in its own conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>DURING the long adminiſtration of Ferdinand, no internal commotion, it is true, had ariſen in Spain. His ſuperior abilities enabled him to reſtrain the turbulence of the nobles, and to moderate the jealouſy of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and by the wiſdom of his domeſtic government, by the ſagacity with which he conducted his foreign operations, and by the high opinion that his ſubjects entertained of both, he preſerved among them a degree of tranquillity greater than was natural to a conſtitution, in which the ſeeds of diſcord and diſorder were ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly mingled. But, by the death of Ferdinand, theſe reſtraints were at once withdrawn; and faction and diſcontent, from being long repreſſed, were ready to break out with fiercer animoſity.</p>
                  <p>IN order to prevent theſe evils,<note place="margin">Ferdinand had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes regent.</note> Ferdinand had in his laſt will taken a moſt prudent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, by appointing cardinal Ximenes, archbiſhop of Toledo, to be ſole regent of Caſtile, till the arrival of his grandſon in Spain. The ſingular character of this man, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary qualities which marked him out for that office at ſuch a juncture, merit a particular deſcription. He was deſcended of an honourable,<note place="margin">His riſe and character.</note> not of a wealthy family; and the circumſtances of his parents, as well as his own inclinations,
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:011837_0371_0F9D86DD74BD2CC8"/>
having determined him to enter into the church, he early obtained benefices of great value, and which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in the way of the higheſt preferment. All theſe however he renounced at once, and after undergoing a very ſevere noviciate, aſſumed the habit of St. Francis in a monaſtery of Obſervantine friars, one of the moſt rigid orders in the Romiſh church. There he ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eminent for his uncommon auſterity of manners, and for thoſe exceſſes of ſuperſtitious devotion, which are the proper characteriſtics of the monaſtic life. But notwithſtanding theſe extravagancies, to which weak and enthuſiaſtic minds alone are uſually prone, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, naturally penetrating and deciſive, retained its full vigour, and acquired him ſuch great authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his own order, as raiſed him to be their provincial. His reputation for ſanctity, ſoon procured him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of father confeſſor to the queen Iſabella, which he accepted with the utmoſt reluctance. He preſerved in a court the ſame auſterity of manners, which had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed him in the cloiſter. He continued to make all his journies on foot; he ſubſiſted only upon alms; his acts of mortification were as ſevere as ever; and his penances as rigorous. Iſabella, pleaſed with her choice, conferred on him, not long after, the Archbiſhopric of Toledo, which, next to the Papacy, is the richeſt dignity in the church of Rome. This honour he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a firmneſs, which nothing but the authoritative injunction of the Pope was able to overcome. Nor did this height of promotion change his manners. Though obliged to diſplay in public that magnificence which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his ſtation, he himſelf retained his monaſtic ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. Under his pontifical robes he conſtantly wore the coarſe frock of St. Francis, the rents of which he uſed to patch with his own hands. He at no time uſed lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; but was commonly clad in hair-cloth. He ſlept always in his habit, moſt frequently on the ground, or on boards, rarely in a bed. He did not taſte any of the delicacies which appeared at his table, but ſatisfied himſelf with that ſimple diet which the rule in his order preſcribed <note place="bottom">Hiſtoire de l'adminiſtration du Card.

oppoſite to the manners of the world, he poſſeſſed a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough knowledge of its affairs; and no ſooner was he called by his ſtation, and by the high opinion which Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand and Iſabella entertained of him, to take a principal ſhare in the adminiſtration, than he diſplayed talents for buſineſs, which rendered the fame of his wiſdom equal to that of his ſanctity. Bold and original in all his plans, his political conduct flowed from his real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and partook both of its virtues and its defects. His extenſive genius ſuggeſted to him ſchemes, vaſt and magnificent. Conſcious of the integrity of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he purſued theſe with unremitting and undaunted firmneſs. Accuſtomed from his early youth to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his own paſſions, he ſhewed little indulgence towards thoſe of other men. Taught by his ſyſtem of religion to check even his moſt innocent deſires, he was the enemy of every thing to which he could affix the name of elegance and pleaſure; and, though free from any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of cruelty, he diſcovered, in all his commerce with the world, a ſevere inflexibility of mind, and auſterity of character, peculiar to the monaſtic profeſſion, and which can ſcarce be conceived in a country where that is unknown.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the man to whom Ferdinand commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the regency of Caſtile, and though he was then near fourſcore, and perfectly acquainted with the labour and difficulty of the office, his natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity of mind, and zeal for the public good, prompted him to accept of it without heſitation: And though Adrian of Utrecht,<note place="margin">Cardinal Adrian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent by Charles.</note> who had been ſent into Spain a few months before the death of Ferdinand, produced full powers from the archduke to aſſume the name and authority of regent, upon the demiſe of his grandfather, ſuch was the averſion of the Spaniards to the government of a ſtranger, and ſo unequal the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the two competitors, that Adrian's claim would at once have been rejected, if Ximenes himſelf, from complaiſance to his new maſter, had not conſented to acknowledge him as regent, and to carry on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in conjunction with him. By this, however,
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:011837_0373_0F9D86DF08F486B8"/>
Adrian acquired a dignity merely nominal;<note place="margin">Ximenes obtains the ſole directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> and Ximenes, though he treated him with great decency, and even reſpect, retained the whole power in his own hands <note n="l" place="bottom">Gometius de reb. geſt.

                  <p>THE Cardinal's firſt care was to obſerve the motions of the Infant Don Ferdinand,<note place="margin">His precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the infant Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> who, having been flattered with ſo near a proſpect of the ſupreme power, bore the diſappointment of his hopes with greater impatience than could have been expected of a prince ſo young. Ximenes, under pretence of providing more effectually for his ſafety, removed him from Guadalupe, the place in which he had been educated, to Madrid, where he fixed the reſidence of the court. There he was under the cardinal's own eye, and his conduct, with that of his domeſtics, were watched with the utmoſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="m" place="bottom">Miniana Contin. Marianae, lib. 1, c. 2. Baudier, Hiſt. de Ximenes, p. 118.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt intelligence he received from the Low Countries, gave greater diſquiet to the Cardinal, and convinced him how difficult a taſk it would be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the affairs of a young prince, under the influence of counſellors unacquainted with the laws and manners of Spain. No ſooner did the account of Ferdinand's death reach Bruſſels,<note place="margin">Charles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the title of king.</note> than Charles, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Flemiſh miniſters, reſolved to aſſume the title of king. By the laws of Spain, the ſole right to the crowns both of Caſtile and of Aragon, belonged to Joanna; and though her infirmities diſqualified her from governing, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity had not been declared by any public act of the Cortes of either kingdom; ſo that the Spaniards conſidered this reſolution, not only as a direct violation of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, but as an unnatural uſurpation in a ſon on the prerogatives of a mother, towards whom, in her preſent unhappy ſituation, he manifeſted a leſs delicate regard than her ſubjects had always expreſſed <note n="n" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 568.</note>. The Flemiſh court, however, prevailed both on the Pope and on the Emperor, to addreſs letters to Charles, as king of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:011837_0374_0F9D86DFB9DC9F40"/>
the former of whom, it was pretended, had a right, as head of the church, and the latter, as head of the empire, to confer this title; and inſtructions were ſent to Ximenes, to prevail on the Spaniards to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. Ximenes, though he had earneſtly remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt the meaſure, as equally unpopular and unneceſſary, reſolved to exert all his authority and credit in carrying it into execution, and immediately aſſembled ſuch of the nobles as were then at court. What Charles required was laid before them; and when, inſtead of complying with his demands, they began to murmur againſt ſuch an unprecedented encroachment on their privileges, and to talk high of the rights of Joanna, and their oath of allegiance to her,<note place="margin">Recognized through the influence of Ximenes. April 13.</note> Ximenes haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily interpoſed, and, with that firm and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tone which was natural to him, told them, that they were not now called to deliberate, but to obey, that their ſovereign did not apply to them for advice, but expected ſubmiſſion; and "This day, added he, Charles ſhall be proclaimed King of Caſtile in Madrid, and the reſt of the cities will follow its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample." On the ſpot he gave orders for that purpoſe <note n="o" place="bottom">Gometius, p. 152, &amp;c. Baudier Hiſt. de Ximen. p. 121.</note>; and, notwithſtanding the novelty of the practice, and the ſecret diſcontents of many perſons of diſtinction, Charles's title was univerſally recognized. In Aragon, where the privileges of the ſubject were more extenſive, and the abilities and authority of the archbiſhop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragoſſa, whom Ferdinand had appointed regent, were far ſuperior to thoſe of Ximenes, the ſame obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the will of Charles did not appear, nor was he acknowledged there under any other character but that of Prince, till his arrival in Spain <note n="p" place="bottom">P. Mart Ep. 572.</note>.</p>
                  <p>XIMENES, though poſſeſſed only of delegated power, which, from his advanced age,<note place="margin">His ſchemes for extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</note> he could not expect long to enjoy, aſſumed, together with the character of regent, all the ideas natural to a monarch, and adopted ſchemes for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the regal authority, which he purſued with as much intrepidity and ardour, as if he himſelf had been
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:011837_0375_0F9D86E0A67F4150"/>
to reap the advantages reſulting from their ſucceſs. The exorbitant privileges of the Caſtilian nobles circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the prerogative of the prince within very narrow limits. Theſe the cardinal conſidered as ſo many unjuſt extortions from the crown, and determined to reduce them. Dangerous as the attempt was, there were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in his ſituation which promiſed him greater ſucceſs than any king of Caſtile could have expected. His ſtrict and prudent oeconomy of his archiepiſcopal revenues, furniſhed him with more ready money, than the crown could at any time command; the ſanctity of his manners, his charity and munificence, rendered him the idol of the people; and the nobles themſelves, not ſuſpecting any danger from him, did not obſerve his motions, with the ſame jealous attention, as they would have watched thoſe of one of their monarchs.</p>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY upon his acceſſion to the regency, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the nobles, fancying the reins of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would,<note place="margin">By depreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> of conſequence, be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what relaxed, began to aſſemble their vaſſals, and to proſecute, by force of arms, animoſities and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, which the authority of Ferdinand had obliged them to diſſemble, or to relinquiſh. But Ximenes, who had taken into pay a good body of troops, oppoſed and defeated all their deſigns with unexpected vigour and facility; and though he did not treat the authors of theſe diſorders with any cruelty, he forced them to acts of ſubmiſſion, extremely mortifying to the haughty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Caſtilian grandees.</p>
                  <p>BUT while the Cardinals attacks were confined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,<note place="margin">By forming a body of troops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the crown.</note> and every act of rigour was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the appearance of neceſſity, founded on the forms of juſtice, and tempered with a mixture of lenity, there was ſcarce room for jealouſy or complaint. It was not ſo with his next meaſure, which, by ſtriking at a privilege eſſential to the nobles, gave a general alarm to the whole order. By the feudal conſtitution, the military power was lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hands of the nobles, and men of an inferior condition were called into the field only as their vaſſals, and to follow their banners. A king, with ſcanty reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and a limited prerogative, depended on theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:011837_0376_0F9D86E1305663C0"/>
barons in all his operations. It was with their forces he attacked his enemies, and with them he defended his own kingdom; and while at the head of troops at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached only to their own lords, and accuſtomed to obey no other commands, his authority was precarious, and his efforts feeble. From this ſtate Ximenes reſolved to deliver the crown; and as mercenary ſtanding armies were unknown, under the feudal government, and would have been odious to a martial and generous people, he iſſued a proclamation, commanding every city in Caſtile, to enrol a certain number of its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, in order that they might be trained to the uſe of arms, on Sundays and holidays; he engaged to provide officers to command them at the public expence; and, as an encouragement to the private men, promiſed them an exemption from all taxes and impoſitions. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent incurſions of the Moors from Africa, and the neceſſity of having ſome force ready to oppoſe them, furniſhed a plauſible pretence for this innovation. The object really in view was to ſecure the king a body of troops independent of his barons, and which might ſerve to counterbalance their power <note n="q" place="bottom">Minianae Continuatio Marianae fol. Hag. 1733, p. 3.</note>. The nobles were not ignorant of his intention, and ſaw how effectually the ſcheme he had adopted would accompliſh his end; but as a meaſure which had the pious appearance of reſiſting the progreſs of the Infidels was extremely popular, and as any oppoſition to it, ariſing from their order alone, would have been imputed wholly to intereſted motives, they endeavoured to excite the cities themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe obedience, and to remonſtrate againſt the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as inconſiſtent with their charters and privileges. In conſequence of their inſtigations, Burgos, Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and ſeveral other cities, roſe in open mutiny. Some of the grandees declared themſelves their protectors. Violent remonſtrances were preſented to the king. His Flemiſh counſellors were alarmed. Ximenes alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued firm and undaunted; and partly by terror, partly by intreaty; by force in ſome inſtances, and by forbearance in others, he prevailed on all the refractory cities to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <note n="r" place="bottom">P.

his plan with vigour, but ſoon after his death it was intirely dropt.</p>
                  <p>HIS ſucceſs in this ſcheme for reducing the exorbitant power of the nobility, encouraged him to attempt a diminution of their poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">By recall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grants of former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs to the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> which were no leſs exorbitant. During the conteſts and diſorders inſeparable from the feudal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the nobles, ever attentive to their own intereſt, and taking advantage of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſs of their monarchs, had ſeized ſome parts of the royal demeſnes, obtained grants of others, and gradually wreſted almoſt the whole out of the hands of the prince, and annexed them to their own eſtates. The rights, by which moſt of the grandees held theſe lands, were extremely defective; it was from ſome ſucceſsful uſurpation, which the crown had been too feeble to diſpute, that many derived their only title to poſſeſſion. An enquiry carried back to the origin of theſe encroachments, which were almoſt coeval with the feudal ſyſtem, was impracticable; and as it would have ſtripped every nobleman in Spain of great part of his lands, it muſt have excited a general revolt. Such a ſtep was too bold, even for the enterprizing genius of Ximenes. He confined himſelf to the reign of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand; and beginning with the penſions granted during that time, refuſed to make any farther payment, becauſe all right to them expired with his life. He then called to account thoſe who had acquired crown lands under the adminiſtration of that monarch, and at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed whatever he had alienated. The effects of theſe revocations extended to many perſons of great rank; for though Ferdinand was a prince of little generoſity, yet he and Iſabella, having been raiſed to the throne of Caſtile by a powerful faction of the nobles, they were obliged to reward the zeal of their adherents with great liberality, and the royal demeſnes were their only fund for that purpoſe. The addition made to the revenue of the crown by theſe revocations, together with his own frugal oeconomy, enabled Ximenes not only to diſcharge all the debts which Ferdinand had left, and to remit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſums to Flanders, but to pay the officers of his new militia, and to eſtabliſh magazines more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:011837_0378_0F9D86E2BA422F40"/>
and better furniſhed with artillery, arms, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtores, than Spain had ever poſſeſſed in any former age <note n="r" place="bottom">Flechier Vie de Ximen. ii. 600.</note>. The prudent and diſintereſted application of theſe ſums was a full apology to the people for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour with which they were exacted.</p>
                  <p>THE nobles, alarmed at theſe repeated attacks, thought it neceſſary to take precautions for the ſafety of their order. Many cabals were formed,<note place="margin">The nobles oppoſe his meaſures.</note> loud complaints were uttered, and deſperate reſolutions taken; but before they proceeded to extremities, they appointed ſome of their number to examine the powers in conſequence of which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal exerciſed acts of ſuch high authority. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Caſtile, the duke de Infantado, and the Condé de Benevento, grandees of the firſt rank, were entruſted with this commiſſion. Ximenes received them with cold civility, and in anſwer to their demand produced the teſtament of Ferdinand, by which he was appointed regent, together with the ratification of that deed by Charles. To both theſe they objected; and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to eſtabliſh their validity. As the converſation grew warm,<note place="margin">But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs.</note> he led them inſenſibly towards a balcony, from which they had a view of a large body of troops, under arms, and of a formidable train of artillery. "Behold," ſays he, pointing to theſe, and raiſing his voice, "the powers which I have received from his catholic majeſty. With theſe I govern Caſtile; and with theſe I will govern it, till the king, your maſter and mine, takes poſſeſſion of his kingdom <note n="s" place="bottom">Flech. ii. 551. Ferreras, Hiſt. viii. 433.</note>." A declaration ſo bold and haughty ſilenced them, and aſtoniſhed their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates. To take arms againſt a man aware of his danger, and prepared for his defence, was what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair alone would dictate. All thoughts of a general confederacy againſt the Cardinal's adminiſtration were laid aſide; and, except from ſome ſlight commotions excited by the private reſentment of particular noblemen, the tranquillity of Caſtile ſuffered no interruption.</p>

Jealous of his great abilities, and independent ſpirit, they conſidered him rather as a rival, who might circumſcribe their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than as a miniſter, who, by his prudence and vigour was adding to the grandeur and authority of their maſter. Every complaint againſt his adminiſtration was liſtened to with pleaſure by the courtiers in the Low Countries. Unneceſſary obſtructions were thrown by their means in the way of all his meaſures, and though they could not, either with decency or ſafety, deprive him of the office of regent, they endeavoured to leſſen his authority by dividing it. They ſoon diſcovered that Adrian of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht, already joined with him in office, had neither genius or ſpirit ſufficient to give the leaſt check to his proceedings; and therefore Charles by their advice added to the commiſſion of regency La Chau,<note place="margin">An additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> a Flemiſh gentleman, and afterwards Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorf, a nobleman of Holland; the former diſtinguiſhed for his addreſs; the latter for his firmneſs.

                  </head>
                  <p>XIMENES, though engaged in ſuch great ſchemes of domeſtic policy, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by the artifices and intrigues of the Flemiſh miniſters, had the burden of two foreign wars to ſupport. The one was in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, invaded by its unfortunate monarch, John d'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret. The death of Ferdinand, the abſence of Charles, and the diſcord and diſaffection which reigned among the Spaniſh nobles, ſeemed to preſent him with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity of recovering his dominions. The Cardinal's vigilance, however, defeated a meaſure ſo well concerted. Foreſeeing the danger to which that kingdom might be expoſed, one of his firſt acts of adminiſtration was to order thither a conſiderable body of troops. While the king was employed with one part of his army in the ſiege of St. Jean Pied en Port, Villalva, an officer of great experience and courage, attacked the other by ſurprize, and cut it to pieces. The king inſtantly retreated with precipitation, and an end was put to the war <note n="t" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep 570.</note>. But as Navarre was filled
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011837_0410_0F9D879792673A38"/>
at that time with towns and caſtles, ſlightly fortified, and weakly garriſoned, which being unable to reſiſt an enemy, ſerved only to furniſh him with places of retreat; Ximenes, always bold and deciſive in his meaſures, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every one of theſe to be diſmantled, except Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peluna, the fortifications of which he propoſed to render very ſtrong. To this uncommon precaution Spain owes the poſſeſſion of Navarre. The French, ſince that period, have often entered, and have as often over-run the open country; but while they were expoſed to all the inconveniencies attending an invading army, the Spaniards have eaſily drawn troops from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provinces to oppoſe them; and the French, being deſtitute of ſtrong towns to which they could retire, have been obliged to abandon their conqueſt with as much rapidity as they gained it.</p>
                  <p>THE war which he carried on in Africa, againſt the famous adventurer Horuc Barbaroſſa, who, from a private corſair, raiſed himſelf by his ſingular valour and addreſs, to be king of Algiers and Tunis, was far from being equally ſucceſsful. The ill conduct of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh general, and the raſh valour of his troops, preſented Barbaroſſa with an eaſy victory. Many periſhed in the battle, more in the retreat, and the remainder returned into Spain covered with infamy. The magnanimity, however, with which the Cardinal bore this diſgrace, the only one he experienced during his adminiſtration, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded new luſtre to his character <note n="*" place="bottom">Gometius, lib. vi. p. 179.</note>. Great compoſure of temper under a diſapointment, was not expected from a man ſo remarkable for the eagerneſs and impatience with which he urged on the execution of all his ſchemes.</p>
                  <p>THIS diſaſter was ſoon forgotten; while the conduct of the Flemiſh court proved the cauſe of conſtant uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not only to the Cardinal, but to the whole Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh nation. All the great qualities of Chievres, the prime miniſter and favourite of the young king, were ſullied with an ignoble and ſordid avarice. The acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his maſter to the crown of Spain, opened a new and copious ſource for the gratification of this paſſion. During the time of Charles's reſidence in Flanders, the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011837_0411_0F9D879932646FB8"/>
whole tribe of pretenders to offices or to favour reſorted thither. They ſoon diſcovered that, without the patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Chievres, it was vain to hope for preferment; nor did they want ſagacity to find out the proper method of ſecuring him. Vaſt ſums of money were drawn out of Spain. Every thing was venal, and diſpoſed of to the higheſt bidder. After the example Chievres, the inferior Flemiſh miniſters engaged in this traffick, which became as general and avowed, as it was infamous <note n="w" place="bottom">Miniana. Contin. l. i. c. 2.</note>. The Spaniards were filled with rage when they beheld offices of great importance to the welfare of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſet to ſale by ſtrangers, unconcerned for its honour or its happineſs. Ximenes; diſintereſted in his whole adminiſtration, and a ſtranger, from his native grandeur of mind, to the paſſion of avarice, inveighed with the utmoſt boldneſs againſt the venality of the Flemings. He repreſented to the King in ſtrong terms, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs and indignation which their behaviour excited among a free and high-ſpirited people, and beſought him to ſet out without loſs of time for Spain, that, by his preſence, he might diſſipate the clouds which were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering all over the kingdom <note n="x" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 576.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES was fully ſenſible that he had delayed too long to take poſſeſſion of his dominions in Spain. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful obſtacles, however, ſtood in his way, and detained him in the Low Countries. The war which the league of Cambray, had kindled in Italy, ſtill ſubſiſted; though during its courſe, the armies of all the parties engaged in it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> taken different directions. France was now in alliance with Venice, which it had at firſt combined to deſtroy. Maximilian and Ferdinand had for ſome years carried on hoſtilities againſt France, their original ally, to the valour of whoſe troops the confederacy ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all its ſucceſs. Together with his kingdoms, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand tranſmitted this war to his grandſon; and there was reaſon to expect that Maximilian, always fond of new enterprizes, would perſuade the young monarch to enter into with ardour. But the Flemings, who had long poſſeſſed an extenſive commerce, which during the league of Cambray, had grown to a great height upon
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011837_0412_0F9D8799CC53D688"/>
the ruins of the Venetian trade, dreaded a rupture with France; and Chievres, ſagacious to diſcern the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his country, and not warped on this occaſion by his love of wealth, warmly declared for maintaining peace with the French nation. Francis I. deſtitute of allies, and ſolicitous to ſecure his late conqueſts in Italy by a treaty, liſtened with joy to the firſt overtures of accommodation. Chievres himſelf conducted the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation in name of Charles. Gouffier appeared as plenipotentiary for Francis. Each of them had preſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the education of the prince whom he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They had both adapted the ſame pacific ſyſtem; and were equally perſuaded that the union of the two monarchs was the happieſt event for themſelves, as well as for their kingdoms. In ſuch hands the negociation did not languiſh. A few days after opening their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences at Noyon, they concluded a treaty of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy and mutual defence between the two monarchs; Aug. 13, 1516. the chief articles in which were, that Francis ſhould give in marriage to Charles his eldeſt daughter, the princeſs Louiſa, an infant of a year old, and as her dowry, ſhould make over to him all his claims and pretenſions upon the kingdom of Naples; that in conſideration of Charles's being already in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Naples, he ſhould till the accompliſhment of the marriage pay an hundred thouſand crowns a year to the French king; and the half of that ſum annually, as long as the princeſs had no children; that when Charles ſhall arrive in Spain, the heirs of the King of Navarre may repreſent to him their right to that kingdom: and if he do not give them ſatisfaction, Francis ſhall be at liberty to aſſiſt them with all his forces <note n="x" place="bottom">Leonard Recueil des Traitez, tom. ii. 69.</note>. This alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance not only united Charles and Francis, but obliged Maximilian, who was unable alone to cope with the French and Venetians, to enter into a treaty with thoſe powers, which put a final period to that bloody and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious war which the league of Cambray had occaſioned. Europe enjoyed a few years of univerſal tranquillity, and was indebted for that bleſſing to two princes, whoſe rivalſhip and ambition kept it in perpetual diſcord and agitation during the remainder of their reigns.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011837_0413_0F9D879A70CA0168"/>BY the treaty of Noyon, Charles ſecured a ſafe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into Spain. It was not, however, the intereſt of his Flemiſh miniſters, that he ſhould viſit that kingdom ſoon. While he reſided in Flanders, the revenues of the Spaniſh crown were ſpent there, and they engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, without any competitors, all the effects of their monarch's generoſity; their country became the ſeat of government, and all favours were diſpenſed by them. Of all theſe advantages, they ran the riſque of ſeeing themſelves deprived, from the moment that their ſovereign entered Spain. The Spaniards would naturally aſſume the direction of their own affairs; the Low Countries would be conſidered only as a province of that mighty monarchy; and they who now diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the favours of the prince to others, muſt then be content to receive them from the hands of ſtrangers. But what Chievres chiefly wiſhed to avoid was, an interview between the King and Ximenes. On the other hand, the wiſdom, the integrity, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of that prelate, gave him a wonderful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over the minds of men; and it was extremely probable, theſe great qualities, added to the reverence due to his age and office, would command the reſpect of a young prince, who, capable of noble and generous ſentiments himſelf, would, in proportion to his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Cardinal's virtues, leſſen his deference towards perſons of another character. Or, on the other hand, if Charles ſhould allow his Flemiſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites to retain all the influence over his councils which they at preſent poſſeſſed, it was eaſy to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that the Cardinal would remonſtrate loudly againſt ſuch an indignity to the Spaniſh nation, and vindicate the rights of his country with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity and ſucceſs, that he had aſſerted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of the crown. For theſe reaſons, all his Flemiſh counſellors combined to retard his departure; and Charles, unſuſpicious, from want of experience, and fond of his native country, ſuffered himſelf to be unneceſſarily detained in the Netherlands a whole year after ſigning the treaty of Noyon.</p>
                  <p>THE repeated intreaties of Ximenes, the advice of his grandfather Maximilian, and the impatient mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs

of his Spaniſh ſubjects in 1517. prevailed on him at laſt to embark, Sept. 13. He was attended not only by Chievres, his prime-miniſter, but by a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſplendid train of the Flemiſh nobles, fond of beholding the grandeur, or of ſharing in the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their prince. After a dangerous voyage, he landed at Villa Vicioſa, in the province of Aſturias, and was received with ſuch loud acclamations of joy, as a new monarch, whoſe arrival was ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, had reaſon to expect. The Spaniſh nobility reſorted to their ſovereign from all parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and diſplayed a magnificence which the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were unable to emulate<note n="y" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 599. 601.</note>.</p>
                  <p>XIMENES, who conſidered the preſence of the king as the greateſt bleſſing to his dominions, was advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the coaſt, as faſt as the infirm ſtate of his health would permit, in order to receive him. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his regency, and notwithſtanding his extreme old age, he abated, in no degree, the rigour or frequency of his mortifications; and to theſe he added ſuch labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſiduity in buſineſs, as would have worn out the moſt youthful and vigorous conſtitution. Every day he employed ſeveral hours in devotion; he celebrated maſs in perſon; he even allotted ſome ſpace for ſtudy. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe occupations he regularly attended the council; he received and read all papers preſented to him; he dictated letters and inſtructions; and took un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his inſpection all buſineſs, civil, eccleſiaſtical, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary. Every moment of his time was filled up with ſome ſerious employment. The only amuſement in which he indulged himſelf by way of relaxation after buſineſs, was to canvaſs, with a few friars and divines, ſome intricate article in ſcholaſtic theology. Waſted by ſuch a courſe of life, the infirmities of age daily grew upon him. On his journey, a violent diſorder ſeized him at Bos Equillos, attended with uncommon ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; which his followers conſidered as the effects of poiſon <note n="z" place="bottom">Miniana, Contin. lib. i. c. 3</note>, but could not agree whether the crime ought to be imputed to the hatred of the Spaniſh noble, or to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011837_0415_0F9D879BF6090DB8"/>
the malice of the Flemiſh courtiers. This accident obliging him to ſtop ſhort, he wrote to Charles, and with his uſual boldneſs adviſed him to diſmiſs all the ſtrangers in his train, whoſe numbers and credit gave offence already to the Spaniards, and would ere long alienate the affections of the whole people. At the ſame time he earneſtly deſired to have an interview with the king, that he might inform him of the ſtate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the temper of his ſubjects. To prevent this, not only the Flemings, but the Spaniſh Grandees em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their addreſs, and induſtriouſly kept Charles at a diſtance from Aranda, the place to which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had removed. Through their ſuggeſtions, every meaſure that he recommended was rejected; the utmoſt care was taken to make him feel, and to point out to the whole nation, that his power was on the decline; even in things purely trivial, ſuch a choice was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made, as was deemed moſt diſagreeable to him. Ximenes did not bear this treatment with his uſual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſpirit. Conſcious of his own integrity and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he expected a more grateful return from a prince, to whom he delivered a kingdom more flouriſhing than it had been in any former age, and authority more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and better eſtabliſhed, than the moſt illuſtrious of his anceſtors had ever poſſeſſed. He could not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on many occaſions, refrain from giving vent to his indignation and complaints. He lamented the fate of his country, and foretold the calamities it would ſuffer from the inſolence, the rapaciouſneſs, and ignorance of ſtrangers. While his mind was agitated by theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he received a letter from the king, in which, after a few cold and formal expreſſions of regard, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to retire to his dioceſe; that after a life of ſuch continued labour, he might end his days in tranquillity. This meſſage proved fatal to Ximenes. His haughty mind, it is probable, would not ſurvive diſgrace; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his generous heart could not bear the proſpect of the misfortunes ready to fall on his country. Which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of theſe opinions we embrace, certain it is that he expired Nov. 8, a few hours after reading the letter <note n="z" place="bottom">Marſallier Vie de Ximenes, p. 447.

The variety, the grandeur, and the ſucceſs of his ſchemes, during a regency of only twenty months, leave it doubtful whether his ſagacity in council, his prudence in conduct, or his boldneſs in execution deſerve the greateſt praiſe. His reputation is ſtill high in Spain, not only for wiſdom, but for ſanctity; and he is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prime miniſter mentioned in hiſtory, whom his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries reverenced as a ſaint <note n="a" place="bottom">Flechier, Vie de Ximen. ii. 746.</note>, and to whom the people under his government aſcribed the power of working miracles.</p>
                  <p>SOON after the death of Ximenes, Charles made his public entry, with great pomp, into Valladolid in 1518, whither he had ſummoned the Cortes of Caſtile, though he aſſumed on all occaſions the name of king, that title had never been acknowledged in the Cortes. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards conſidering Joanna as poſſeſſed of the ſole right to the crown, and no example of a ſon's having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the title of king during the life of his parents oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in their hiſtory, the Cortes diſcovered all that ſcrupulous reſpect for ancient forms, and that averſion to innovation, which are conſpicuous in popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. The preſence, however, of their prince, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, the artifices, and the threats of his miniſters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on them at laſt to declare him king, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his mother, whoſe name they appointed to be placed before that of her ſon in all publick acts; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that, if at any future period ſhe ſhould recover the exerciſe of reaſon, the whole royal authority ſhould return into her hands. At the ſame time, they voted a free gift of ſix hundred thouſand ducats to be paid in three years, a ſum more conſiderable than had ever been granted to any former monarch <note n="b" place="bottom">Miniana, Contin. lib. i. c. 3. P. Mart. Ep. 608. Sandov. p. 12.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this obſequiouſneſs of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to the will of the king, the moſt violent ſymptoms of diſſatisfaction with his government began to break out in the kingdom. Chievres had acquired over the mind of the young monarch the aſcendant not only of a tutor, but of a parent. Charles ſeemed to have no ſentiments but thoſe which his miniſter inſpired, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011837_0417_0F9D879D71E894B0"/>
ſcarce uttered a word but what he put into his mouth. He was conſtantly ſurrounded by Flemings; no perſon got acceſs to him without their permiſſion; nor was any admitted to audience but in their preſence. As he ſpoke the Spaniſh language very imperfectly, his anſwers were always extremely ſhort, and often delivered with heſitation. From all theſe circumſtances, many of the Spaniards were led to believe that he was a prince of a ſlow and narrow genius; ſome pretended to diſcover a ſtrong reſemblance between him and his mother, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to whiſper that his capacity for government would never be far ſuperior to hers; and though they who had the beſt opportunity of judging concerning his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, maintained, that notwithſtanding ſuch unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing appearances, he poſſeſſed a large fund of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſagacity <note n="c" place="bottom">Sandoval, p. 31. P. Mart. Ep. 655.</note>; yet all agreed in condemning his partiality towards his countrymen, and his attachment to his favourites as unreaſonable and immoderate. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for Charles, theſe favourites were unworthy of his confidence. To amaſs wealth ſeems to have been their only aim; and as they had reaſon to fear, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their maſter's good ſenſe, or the indignation of the Spaniards, might ſoon abridge their power, they haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to improve the preſent opportunity, and their avarice was the more rapacious, becauſe they expected their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be of no long duration. All honours, offices and benefices, were either engroſſed by the Flemings, or publickly ſold by them. Chievres, his wife, and Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, whom Charles, on the death of Ximenes, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently raiſed to be chancellor of Caſtile, vied with each other in all the refinements of extortion and venali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Not only the Spaniſh hiſtorians, who, from reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſuſpected of exaggeration, but Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Angleria, an Italian, who reſided at that time in the court of Spain, and who was under no temptation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the perſons to whom his letters are addreſſed, give a deſcription which is almoſt incredible, of the inſatiable and ſhameleſs covetouſneſs of the Flemings. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Angleria's calculation, which he aſſerts to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely moderate, they remitted into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011837_0418_0F9D879E3175F4F0"/>
in the ſpace of ten months, no leſs a ſum than a million and one hundred thouſand ducats. The nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of William de Croy, Chievres's nephew, a young man not of canonical age, to the Archbiſhoprick of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, exaſperated the Spaniards more than all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. They conſidered the elevation of a ſtranger to the head of their church, and to the richeſt benefice in the kingdom, not only as an injury, but as an inſult to the whole nation; and both clergy and laity, the former from intereſt, the latter from indignation, joined in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt it <note n="d" place="bottom">Sandoval, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>CHARLES leaving Caſtile thus diſguſted with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, ſet out for Saragoſſa, the capital of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, that he might be preſent in the Cortes of that kingdom. On his way thither, he took leave of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ferdinand, whom he ſent into Germany on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of viſiting their grandfather, Maximilian, in his old age. To this prudent precaution, Charles owed the preſervation of his Spaniſh dominions. During the violent commotions which aroſe there ſoon after this period, the Spaniards would infallibly have offered the crown to a prince, who was the darling of the whole nation; nor did Ferdinand want ambition, or couſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, that would have prompted him to accept of the offer <note n="e" place="bottom">P. Martyr, Ep. 619. Ferreras, viii. 460.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Aragoneſe had not hitherto acknowledged Charles as King, nor would they allow the Cortes to be aſſembled in his name, but in that of the Juſtiza, to whom, during an interregnum, this privilege belonged <note n="f" place="bottom">P. Martyr, Ep. 605.</note>. The oppoſition Charles had to ſtruggle with in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Aragon, was more violent and obſtinate than that which he had overcome in Caſtile; after long delays, however, and with much difficulty, he perſuaded the members to confer on him the title of king, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with his mother. At the ſame time he bound himſelf by that ſolemn oath, which the Aragoneſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of their king, never to violate any of their rights or liberties. When a donative was demanded, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011837_0419_0F9D879EF2378F70"/>
were ſtill more intractable; many months elapſed before they would agree to grant Charles two hundred thouſand ducats, and that ſum they appropriated ſo ſtrictly for paying debts of the crown, which had long been forgotten, that a very ſmall part of it came into the King's hands. What had happened in Caſtile taught them caution, and determined them rather to ſatisfy the claims of their fellow citizens, how obſolete ſoever, than to furniſh ſtrangers the means of enriching themſelves with the ſpoils of their country <note n="g" place="bottom">P. Martyr, Ep. 615—634.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe proceedings of the Cortes, ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors arrived at Saragoſſa from Francis I. and the young king of Navarre, demanding the reſtitution of that kingdom in terms of the treaty of Noyon. But neither Charles, nor the Caſtilian nobles whom he conſulted on this occaſion, diſcovered any inclination to part with this acquiſition. A conference held ſoon after at Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier, in order to bring this matter to an amicable iſſue, was altogether fruitleſs; and while the French urged the injuſtice of the uſurpation, the Spaniards were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive only to its importance <note n="h" place="bottom">P. Martyr. Ep. 605, 633. 640.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FROM Aragon, Charles proceeded to Catalonia in 1519, where he waſted as much time, encountered more difficulties, and gained leſs money. The Flemings were now become ſo odious in every province of Spain by their exactions, that the deſire of mortifying them, and of diſappointing their avarice, augmented the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy with which a free people uſually conduct their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>THE Caſtilians, who had felt moſt ſenſibly the weight and rigour of the oppreſſive ſchemes, carried on by the Flemings, reſolved no longer to ſubmit with a tameneſs fatal to themſelves, and which rendered them the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſcorn among the reſt of the Spaniards. Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, Toledo, Seville, and ſeveral other cities of the firſt rank, entered into a confederacy for the defence of their rights and privileges; and notwithſtanding the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the nobility, who, on this occaſion, diſcovered neither the publick ſpirit, nor the reſolution which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their order, they laid before the king a full view
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011837_0420_0F9D879FB09BEC88"/>
of the ſtate of the kingdom, and of the mal-adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of his favourites. The preferment of ſtrangers; the exportation of the current coin; the increaſe of taxes, were the grievances of which they chiefly complained; and of theſe they demanded redreſs with that boldneſs, which is natural to a free people. Theſe remonſtrances, preſented at firſt at Saragoſſa, and renewed afterwards at Barcelona, Charles treated with great neglect. The confederacy, however, of theſe cities at this juncture, was the beginning of that famous union among the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Caſtile, which not long after threw the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into ſuch violent convulſions, ſhook the throne, and almoſt overturned the conſtitution <note n="i" place="bottom">P. Martyr, Ep. 630. Ferreras, viii. 464.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SOON after Charles's arrival at Barcelona, he received the account of an event which intereſted him much more than the murmurs of the Caſtilians, or the ſcrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the Cortes of Catalonia. This was the death of the Emperor Maximilian, January 12, an occurrence of ſmall importance in itſelf, for he was a prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous neither for his virtues, his power, nor his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but rendered by its conſequences more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than any that had happened during ſeveral ages. It broke that profound and univerſal peace which then reigned in the Chriſtian world; it excited a rivalſhip between two princes, which threw all Europe into agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and kindled wars more general, and of longer duration, than had hitherto been known in modern times.</p>
                  <p>THE revolutions occaſioned by the expedition of the French king, Charles VIII. into Italy, had inſpired the European Princes with new ideas concerning the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Imperial dignity. The claims of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire upon ſome of the Italian ſtates were numerous; its juriſdiction over others was extenſive; and though the former had been almoſt abandoned, and the latter ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exerciſed, under princes of no abilities, and of little influence, it was obvious, that in the hands of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror poſſeſſed of power and genius, they would be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as engines for ſtretching his dominion over the greater part of that country. Even Maximilian, feeble
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011837_0421_0F9D87A085CF4E00"/>
and unſteady as his conduct always was, had availed himſelf of the infinite pretenſions of the Empire, and had reaped advantage from every war and every nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation in Italy during his reign. Theſe conſiderations, added to the dignity of the ſtation, confeſſedly the firſt among Chriſtian princes, and to the rights inherent in the office, which, if exerted with vigour, were far from being inconſiderable, rendered the imperial crown more than ever an object of ambition.</p>
                  <p>NOT long before his death, Maximilian had diſcovered great ſolicitude to preſerve this dignity in the Auſtrian family, and to procure the king of Spain to be choſen his ſucceſſor. But he himſelf having never been crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope, a ceremony deemed eſſential in that age, was conſidered only as Emperor <hi>elect;</hi> and though hiſtorians did not attend to that diſtinction, neither the Italian nor German chancery beſtowed any other title upon him than that of King of the Romans; and no example occurring in hiſtory of any perſon's being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a ſucceſſor to a king of the Romans, the Germans, always tenacious of their forms, and unwilling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon Charles an office for which their conſtitution knew no name, obſtinately refuſed to gratify Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian in that point <note n="k" place="bottom">Guicciardini, lib. 13. p. 15.

                  <p>BY his death, this difficulty was at once removed, and Charles openly aſpired to that dignity which his grandfather had attempted, without ſucceſs to ſecure for him. At the ſame time Francis I. a powerful rival, entered the liſts againſt him; and the attention of all Europe was fixed upon this competition, no leſs illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious from the high rank of the candidates, than from the importance of the prize for which they contended. Each of them urged his pretenſions with ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and with no unpromiſing proſpect of ſucceſs. Charles conſidered the Imperial crown as belonging to him of right, from its long continuance in the Auſtrian line; he knew that none of the German princes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed power or influence enough to appear as his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt; he flattered himſelf, that no conſideration would
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011837_0422_0F9D87A1F8299FE0"/>
induce the natives of Germany to exalt any foreign prince to a dignity, which during ſo many ages had been deemed peculiar to their own nation; and leaſt of all, that they would confer this honour upon Francis I. the ſovereign of a people whoſe genius, and laws, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners differed ſo widely from thoſe of the Germans, that it was ſcarcely poſſible to eſtabliſh any cordial union between them: he truſted not a little to the effect of Maximilian's negociations, which though they did not attain their end, had prepared the minds of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans for his elevation to the imperial throne; but what he relied on as his chief recommendation, was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſituation of his hereditary dominions in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which ſerved as a natural barrier to the Empire againſt the encroachments of the Turkiſh power. The conqueſts, the abilities, and the ambition of Sultan Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim II. had ſpread over Europe, at that time, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and well founded alarm. By his victories over the Marmalukes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the extirpation of that gallant body of men, he had not only added Egypt and Syria to his empire, but had ſecured to it ſuch a degree of internal tranquillity, that he was ready to turn againſt Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the whole force of his arms, which nothing had hitherto been able to reſiſt: The moſt effectual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for ſtopping the progreſs of this torrent, ſeemed to be the election of an Emperor, poſſeſſed of extenſive territories in that country, where its firſt impreſſion would be felt, and who, beſides, could combat this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemy with all the forces of a powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and with all the wealth furniſhed by the mines of the new world, or the commerce of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Theſe were the arguments by which Charles publickly ſupported his claim; and to men of integrity and reflection, they appeared to be not only plauſible, but convincing. He did not, however, truſt the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his cauſe to theſe alone. Great ſums of money were remitted from Spain; all the refinements and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of negociation were employed; and a conſiderable body of troops kept on foot by the ſtates of the Circle of Suabia, was ſecretly taken into his pay. The venal were gained by preſents; the objections of the more

ſcrupulous were anſwered or eluded; and ſome feeble princes were threatened and over-awed <note n="l" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 13. 159 Sleidan, Hiſt. of the Reformat. 14. Stru. vii Corp. Hiſt. German. ii. 971. Not. 20.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ON the other hand, Francis ſupported his claim with equal eagerneſs, and no leſs confidence of its being well founded. His emiſſaries contended that it was now high time to convince the Princes of the houſe of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria that the Imperial crown was elective, and not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary; and that other perſons might aſpire to an honour which their arrogance had come to regard as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their family; that it required a ſovereign of mature judgment, and of approved abilities, to hold the reins of government in a country where ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known opinions concerning religion had been publiſhed, as had thrown the minds of men into an uncommon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, which threatened the moſt violent effects; that a young prince, without experience, who had hitherto given no ſpecimens of his genius for command, was no equal match for Selim, a monarch, grown old in the art of war, and in the courſe of victory; whereas a king, who, in his early youth had triumphed over the valour and diſcipline of the Swiſs, till then reckoned invincible, would be an antagoniſt not unworthy of the conqueror of the Eaſt; that the fire and impetuoſity of the French cavalry, added to the diſcipline and ſtability of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man infantry, would form an army ſo irreſiſtible, that inſtead of waiting the approach of the Ottoman forces, it might carry hoſtilities into the heart of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; that the election of Charles would be inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a fundamental conſtitution, by which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who holds the crown of Naples, is excluded from aſpiring to the Imperial dignity; that his elevation to that honour would ſoon kindle a war in Italy, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his pretenſions to the dutchy of Milan, the effects of which could not fail of reaching the Empire, and might prove fatal to it <note n="m" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 13. 160.

But while his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors enlarged upon theſe and other topicks of the ſame kind, in all the courts of Germany, Francis, ſenſible of the prejudices entertained againſt him as a foreigner,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011837_0424_0F9D87A2B39304A8"/>
unacquainted with the German language or manners, endeavoured to overcome theſe, and to gain the favour of the princes by immenſe gifts, and by infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. As the expeditious method of tranſmitting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the decent mode of conveying a bribe by bills of exchange was then little known, the French ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors travelled with a train of horſes loaded with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, an equipage not very honourable for that prince by whom they were employed, and infamous for thoſe to whom they were ſent <note n="n" place="bottom">Memoires de Marech. de Fleuranges, p. 296.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE other European princes could not remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſpectators of a conteſt, the deciſion of which ſo nearly affected them. Their common intereſt ought naturally to have formed a general combination, in order to diſappoint both competitors, and to prevent either of them from obtaining ſuch pre-eminence in power and dignity, as might prove dangerous to the liberties of Europe. But the ideas with reſpect to a proper diſtribution and balance of power were ſo lately introduced into the ſyſtem of European policy, that they were not hitherto objects of ſufficient attention. The paſſions of ſome princes, the want of foreſight in others, and the fear of giving offence to the candidates, hindred ſuch a ſalutary union of the powers of Europe, and rendered them either totally negligent of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety, or kept them from exerting themſelves with vigour in its behalf.</p>
                  <p>THE Swiſs Cantons, though they dreaded the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either of the contending monarchs, and though they wiſhed to have ſeen ſome prince whoſe dominions were leſs extenſive, and whoſe power was more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſeated on the Imperial throne, were prompted, however, by their hatred of the French nation, to give an open preference to the pretenſions of Charles, while they uſed their utmoſt influence to fruſtrate thoſe of Francis <note n="o" place="bottom">Sabinus, p. 6</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Venetians eaſily diſcerned, that it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their republick to have both the rivals ſet aſide; but their jealouſy of the houſe of Auſtria, whoſe ambition and neighbourhood had been fatal to

their grandeur, would not permit them to act up to their own ideas, and led them haſtily to give the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their approbation to the claim of the French king.</p>
                  <p>IT was equally the intereſt, and more in the power of Henry VIII. of England, to prevent either Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis or Charles from acquiring a dignity which would raiſe them ſo far above other monarchs. But though Henry often boaſted, that he held the balance of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope in his hand, he had neither the ſteady attention, the accurate diſcernment, nor the diſpaſſionate temper which that delicate function required. On this occaſion it mortified his vanity ſo much, to ſee himſelf excluded from that noble competition which reflected ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the two antagoniſts, that he took the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſending an ambaſſador into Germany, and of declaring himſelf a candidate for the imperial throne. The ambaſſador, though loaded with careſſes by the German princes and the Pope's nuncio, informed his maſter, that he could hope for no ſucceſs in a claim which he had been ſo late in preferring; and Henry, imputing his diſappointment to that circumſtance alone, and ſoothed with this oſtentatious diſplay of his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſeems to have taken no farther part in the matter, either by contributing to thwart both his rivals, or to promote one of them <note n="p" place="bottom">Memoires de Fleuranges, 314. Herbert, Hiſt. of Henry VIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>LEO X, a pontiff no leſs renowned for his political abilities, than for his love of the arts, was the only prince of the age who obſerved the motions of the two contending monarchs with a prudent attention, or who diſcovered a proper ſolicitude for the public ſafety. The imperial and papal juriſdiction interfered in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, the complaints of uſurpation were ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous on both ſides, and the territories of the church owed their ſafety ſo entirely to the weakneſs of their neighbours, and ſo little to their, own force, that nothing was ſo formidable to the court of Rome as an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of extenſive power, or of enterprizing genius. Leo trembled at the proſpect of beholding the Imperial crown placed on the head of the king of Spain and of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011837_0426_0F9D87A432150F68"/>
Naples, and the maſter of the new world; nor was he leſs afraid of ſeeing a king of France, who was duke of Milan, and lord of Genoa, exalted to that dignity. He foretold that the election of either of them would be fatal to the independence of the holy ſee, to the peace of Italy, and perhaps to the liberties of Europe. To oppoſe them, however, required addreſs and caution in proportion to the greatneſs of their power, and their opportunities of taking revenge. Leo was defective in neither. He ſecretly exhorted the German Princes to place one of their own number on the Imperial throne, which many of them were capable of filling with honour; he put them in mind of the conſtitution by which the kings of Naples were for ever excluded from that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note n="q" place="bottom">Goldaſti Conſtitutiones Imperiales. Francof. 1673. vol. 1. 439.</note>; he warmly exhorted the French king to perſiſt in his claim, not from any deſire that he ſhould gain his end, but as he foreſaw that the Germans would be more diſpoſed to favour the king of Spain, he hoped that Francis himſelf, when he diſcovered his own chance of ſucceſs to be deſperate, would be ſtimulated by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and the ſpirit of rivalſhip, to concur with all his intereſt in raiſing ſome third perſon to the head of the Empire; or on the other hand, if Francis ſhould make unexpected progreſs, he did not doubt but that Charles would be induced by ſimilar motives to act the ſame part; and thus by prudence and attention, the mutual jealouſy of the two rivals might be ſo dextrouſly managed, as to diſappoint both. But this ſcheme, the only one which a prince in Leo's ſituation could adopt, though concerted with great wiſdom, was executed with little diſcretion. The French ambaſſadors in Germany fed their maſter with vain hopes; the pope's nuncio be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gained by them, altogether forgot the inſtructions he had received; and Francis perſevered ſo long and ſo obſtinately in urging his own pretenſions, as rendered all Leo's meaſures abortive <note n="r" place="bottom">Guicciar. lib 13. 161.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH were the hopes of the candidates, and the views of the different princes, when the diet was opened according to form at Frankfort, June 17th. The
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011837_0427_0F9D87A5C44809F0"/>
right of chuſing an Emperor had long been veſted in ſeven great princes, diſtinguiſhed by the name of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the origin of whoſe office, and the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their powers, have already been explained. Theſe were, at that time Albert of Brandenburgh, archbiſhop of Mentz; Herman count de Wied, archbiſhop of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne; Richard de Greiffenklau, archbiſhop of Treves; Lewis, king of Bohemia; Lewis, count Palatin of the Rhine; Frederick, duke of Saxony; and Joachim I. marquis of Brandenburgh. Notwithſtanding the artful arguments produced by the ambaſſadors of the two kings, in favour of their reſpective maſters, and in ſpite of all their ſolicitations, intrigues, and preſents, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors did not forget that maxim on which the liberty of the German conſtitution was thought to be founded. Among the members of the Germanick body, which is a great republick compoſed of ſtates almoſt independent, the firſt principle of patriotiſm is to depreſs and limit the power of the Emperor; and of this idea, ſo natural under ſuch a form of government, a German politician ſeldom loſes ſight. No prince of conſiderable power, or extenſive dominions, had for ſome ages been raiſed to the Imperial throne; and to this prudent precaution many of the great families in Germany owed the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and independence which they had acquired during that period. To elect either of the contending mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, would have been a groſs violation of that ſalutary maxim; would have given to the empire a maſter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an head; and would have reduced themſelves from the rank of equals, to the condition of ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>FULL of theſe ideas, they all turned their eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Frederick, duke of Saxony, a prince of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent virtue, and abilities, as to be diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi>Sage,</hi> and with one voice offered him the Imperial crown. He was not dazzled with that object, which monarchs ſo far ſuperior to him in power courted with ſuch eagerneſs; and after deliberating upon the matter a ſhort time, he rejected it with a magnanimity and diſintereſtedneſs, no leſs ſingular than admirable. Nothing, he obſerved, could be more impolitic, than an obſtinate adherence to a maxim which, though ſound and juſt in many caſes, was not applicable to all. In
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011837_0428_0F9D87A67248D550"/>
times of tranquillity, ſaid he, we wiſh for an Emperor who has not power to invade our liberties; times of danger demand one who is able to ſecure our ſafety. The Turkiſh armies, led by a gallant and victorious monarch are now aſſembling. They are ready to pour in upon Germany with a violence unknown in former ages. New conjunctures call for new expedients. The imperial ſceptre muſt be committed to ſome hand more powerful than mine, or that of any other German prince. We poſſeſs neither dominions, nor revenues, nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which enable us to encounter ſuch a formidable enemy. Recourſe muſt be had in this exigency to one of the rival monarchs. Each of them can bring into the field forces ſufficient for our defence. But as the King of Spain is of German extraction, as he is a member and prince of the empire by the territories which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to him from his grandfather; as his dominions ſtretch along that frontier which lies moſt expoſed to the enemy; his claim is preferable, in my opinion, to that of a ſtranger to our language, to our blood, and to our country; and therefore I give my vote to confer on him the Imperial crown.</p>
                  <p>THIS opinion, dictated by ſuch uncommon genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and ſupported by arguments ſo plauſible, made a deep impreſſion on the Electors. The king of Spain's ambaſſadors, ſenſible of the important ſervice which Frederic had done their maſter, ſent him a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum of money, as the firſt token of that prince's gratitude. But he who had greatneſs of mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a crown, diſdained to receive a bribe; and upon their intreating that, at leaſt, he would permit them to diſtribute part of that ſum among his courtiers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he could not prevent them from accepting what ſhould be offered, but whoever took a ſingle flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin ſhould be diſmiſſed next morning from his ſervice <note n="r" place="bottom">P.

It remained to make a choice between the two great competitors. But beſides the prejudice in Charles's favour ariſing from his birth, and the ſituation of his German dominions, he owed not a little to the abilities of the cardinal de Gurk, and the zeal of Erard de la Mark, biſhop of Liege, two of his ambaſſadors who had conducted their negociations with more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and addreſs, than thoſe entruſted by the French king. The former, who had long been the miniſter and favourite of Maximilian, was well acquainted with the art of managing the Germans; and the latter having been diſappointed of a cardinal's hat by Francis, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all the malicious ingenuity with which the deſire of revenge inſpires an ambitious mind, in thwarting the meaſures of that monarch. The Spaniſh party among the Electors daily gained ground; and the Pope's nuncio, being convinced that it was vain to make any farther oppoſition, endeavoured to acquire ſome merit with the future Emperor, by offering voluntarily, in the name of his maſter, a diſpenſation to hold the Imperial crown in conjunction with that of Naples <note n="s" place="bottom">Freheri.

                  <p>ON the twenty-eighth of June, five months and ten days after the death of Maximilian, this important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, which had held all Europe in ſuſpenſe, was decided. Six of the Electors had already declared for the king of Spain, and the archbiſhop of Treves, the only firm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to the French intereſt, having at laſt joined his brethren, Charles was by the unanimous voice of the Electoral college raiſed to the Imperial throne <note n="t" place="bottom">Jac Aug.

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011837_0430_0F9D87A7F2F81C68"/>BUT though the Electors conſented, from various motives, to promote Charles to that high ſtation, they diſcovered at the ſame time great jealouſy of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power, and endeavoured, with the utmoſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, to provide againſt his encroaching on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Germanick body. It had long been the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to demand of every new Emperor a confirmation of theſe privileges, and to require a promiſe that he would never violate them in any inſtance. While princes who were formidable neither from extent of territory, nor of genius, poſſeſſed the imperial throne, a general and verbal engagement to this purpoſe was deemed ſufficient ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But under an Emperor ſo powerful as Charles, other precautions ſeemed neceſſary. A <hi>Capitulation,</hi> or claim of rights was formed, in which the privileges and immunities of the electors, of the princes of the empire, of the cities, and of every other member of the Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick body are enumerated. This capitulation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſigned by Charles's ambaſſadors in the name of their maſter, and he himſelf at his coronation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it in the moſt ſolemn manner. Since that period, the Electors have continued to preſcribe the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to all his ſucceſſors; and in Germany the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation or mutual contract between the emperor and his ſubjects, is conſidered as a ſtrong barrier againſt the progreſs of the imperial power, and as the great charter of their liberties to which they often appeal <note n="u" place="bottom">Pfeffel Abregè de l'Hiſt. de Droit Publique d'Allemagne 590. Limnei Capitulat. Imper. Epiſtres des Princes par Ruſcelli, p. 60.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE important intelligence of his election was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in nine days from Frankfort to Barcelona, where Charles was ſtill detained by the obſtinacy of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian Cortes, which had not hitherto brought to an iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue any of the affairs that came before it. He received the account with the joy natural to a young aſpiring mind, on an acceſſion of power and dignity which raiſed him ſo far above the other princes of Europe. Then it was that thoſe vaſt proſpects which allured him during his whole adminiſtration began to open, and from this aera we may date the formation, and are able to trace the gradual progreſs of a grand ſyſtem of enterprizing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011837_0431_0F9D87A8B594E370"/>
ambition which renders the hiſtory of his reign ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of attention.</p>
                  <p>A TRIVIAL circumſtance firſt diſcovered the effects of this great elevation upon the mind of Charles. In all the publick writs which he iſſued as king of Spain, he aſſumed the title of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and required it from his ſubjects as a mark of their reſpect. Before that time, all the monarchs of Europe were ſatisfied with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>Highneſs,</hi> or <hi>Grace;</hi> but the vanity of other courts ſoon led them to imitate the example of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. The epithet of Majeſty is no longer a mark of pre-eminence. The moſt inconſiderable monarchs in Europe enjoy it, and the arrogance of the greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates has invented no higher denomination<note n="u" place="bottom">Minianae Contin. Mar. p. 13. Ferreras viii. 475. Memoires Hiſt. de la Houſſaie, tom. i. p. 53, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Spaniards were far from viewing the promotion of their King to the Imperial throne with the ſame ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which he himſelf felt. To be deprived of the preſence of their ſovereign, and to be ſubjected to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a vice-roy and his council, a ſpecies of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration often oppreſſive, and always diſagreeable, were the immediate and neceſſary conſequences of this new dignity. To ſee the blood of their countrymen ſhed in quarrels wherein the nation had no concern, to behold its treaſures waſted in ſupporting the ſplendour of a foreign title, and to be plunged in the chaos of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and German politics, were effects of this event al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as unavoidable. From all theſe conſiderations, they concluded, that nothing could have happened more pernicious to the Spaniſh nation; and the fortitude and publick ſpirit of their anceſtors, who, in the Cortes of Caſtile, prohibited Alfonzo the Wiſe from leaving the kingdom, in order to receive the Imperial crown, were often mentioned with the higheſt praiſe, and pronounced to be extremely worthy of imitation at this juncture <note n="w" place="bottom">Sandoval, i p. 32. Miniana, Contin. p. 14.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT Charles, without regarding the ſentiments or murmurs of his Spaniſh ſubjects, accepted of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial dignity which the count Palatine, at the head of a ſolemn embaſſy, offered him in the name of the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011837_0432_0F9D87A9703650D0"/>
and declared his intention of ſetting out ſoon for Germany, in order to take poſſeſſion of it. This was the more neceſſary, becauſe, according to the forms of the German conſtitution, he could not, before the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a publick coronation, exerciſe any act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or authority <note n="x" place="bottom">Sabinus. P. Barre, viii. 1085.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THEIR certain knowledge of this reſolution aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the diſguſt of the Spaniards; and a ſullen and refractory ſpirit prevailed among perſons of all ranks. The Pope having granted the king the tenths of all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical benefices in Caſtile to aſſiſt him in carrying on war with greater vigour againſt the Turks, a convocation of the clergy unanimouſly refuſed to levy that ſum, upon pretence that it ought never to be exacted but at thoſe times when Chriſtendom was actually invaded by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; and though Leo, in order to ſupport his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, laid the kingdom under an interdict, ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was paid to a cenſure which was univerſally deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unjuſt, that Charles himſelf applied to have it taken off; and thus the Spaniſh clergy, beſides their merit in oppoſing the uſurpations of the pope, and diſregarding the influence of the crown, gained the exemption which they had claimed <note n="y" place="bottom">P. Martyr, Ep. 462. Ferreras viii. 473.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE commotions which aroſe in the kingdom of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia, annexed to the crown of Arragon, were more formidable, and produced more dangerous and laſting effects. A ſeditious monk having by his ſermons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the citizens of Valencia, the capital city, to take arms, and to puniſh certain criminals in a tumultuary manner, the people, pleaſed with this excerciſe of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and with ſuch a diſcovery of their own importance, not only refuſed to lay down their arms, but formed themſelves into troops and companies that they might be regularly trained to martial exerciſes. To obtain ſome ſecurity againſt the oppreſſion of the Grandees was the motive of this aſſociation, and proved a powerful bond of union; for as the ariſtocratical privileges and independence were more complete in Valencia than in any other of the Spaniſh kingdoms, the nobles, being

fearce accountable for their conduct to any ſuperior, treated the people not only as vaſſals but as ſlaves. They were alarmed, however, at the ſucceſs of this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſurrection, as it might encourage the people to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhaking off the yoke; but as they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them without taking arms, it became neceſſary to have recourſe to the Emperor, and to deſire his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to attack them, 1526. At the ſame time the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made choice of deputies to repreſent their griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and to implore the protection of their ſovereign. Happily for the latter, they arrived at court when Charles was exaſperated to an high degree againſt the nobles. As he was eager to viſit Germany, where his preſence became every day more neceſſary, and as his Flemiſh courtiers were ſtill more impatient to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their native country, and to carry thither the ſpoils they had amaſſed in Caſtile, it was impoſſible for him to hold the Cortes of Valencia in perſon. He had for that reaſon empowered the cardinal Adrian to repreſent him in that aſſembly, and in his name to receive their oath of allegiance, to confirm their privileges with the uſual ſolemnities, and to demand of them a free gift. But the Valencian nobles, who conſidered this meaſure as an indignity to their country, which was no leſs entitled, than his other kingdoms, to the honour of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's preſence, declared that by the fundamental laws of the conſtitution they could neither acknowledge a perſon who was abſent as king, nor grant him any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy, and to this declaration they adhered with an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inflexible obſtinacy. Charles piqued by their behaviour, decided in favour of the people, and raſhly authorized them to continue in arms. Their deputies returned in triumph, and were received by their fellow-citizens as the deliverers of their country; and the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the multitude increaſing with their ſucceſs, they expelled all the nobles out of the city, committed the government to magiſtrates of their own election, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into an aſſociation diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Germanada</hi> or <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> which proved the ſource not only of the wildeſt diſorders, but of the moſt fatal cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in that kingdom <note n="z" place="bottom">P.

                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011837_0434_0F9D87AAF3E09420"/>MEANWHILE, the kingdom of Caſtile was agitated with no leſs violence. No ſooner was the Emperor's intention to leave Spain made known, than ſeveral cities of the firſt rank reſolved to remonſtrate againſt it, and to crave redreſs once more of thoſe grievances which they had formerly laid before him. Charles artfully avoided admitting their deputies to audience; and as he ſaw from this circumſtance how difficult it would be at this juncture to reſtrain the mutinous ſpirit of greater ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he ſummoned the Cortes of Caſtile to meet at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella in Galicia. His only reaſon for calling that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, was the hope of obtaining another donative; for as his treaſury had been exhauſted in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that the riches of his miniſters increaſed, he could not, without ſome additional aid, appear in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many with ſplendour ſuited to the Imperial dignity. To appoint a meeting of the Cortes in ſo remote a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and to demand a new ſubſidy before the time for paying the former was expired, were innovations of a moſt dangerous tendency; and among people jealous of their liberties, and accuſtomed to ſupply the wants of their ſovereigns with a very frugal hand excited an univerſal alarm. The magiſtrates of Toledo remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt both theſe meaſures in a very high tone; the inhabitants of Valladolid, who expected that the Cortes ſhould have been held in that city, were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged that they took arms in a tumultuary manner; and if Charles with his foreign counſellors had not fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made their eſcape during a violent tempeſt, they would have maſſacred all the Flemings, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from continuing his journey towards Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella.</p>
                  <p>EVERY city through which they paſſed, petitioned againſt holding a Cortes in Galicia, a point with regard to which Charles was inflexible. But though the utmoſt influence had been exerted by the minſters, in order to procure a choice of repreſentatives favourable to their deſigns, ſuch was the temper of the nation, that at the opening of the aſſembly, April 1, there appeared among many of the members unuſual ſymptoms of ill humour, which threatened a fierce oppoſition to all the meaſures of the court. No repreſentatives were ſent by Toledo,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011837_0435_0F9D87ABB1EC55A0"/>
for the lot, according to which, by ancient cuſtom, the election was determined in that city, having fallen upon two perſons, devoted to the Flemiſh miniſters, their fellow-citizens refuſed to grant them a commiſſion in the uſual form, and in their ſtead made choice of two deputies, whom they empowered to repair to Compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella, and to proteſt againſt the lawfulneſs of the Cortes aſſembled there The repreſentatives of Salamanca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the uſual oath of fidelity, unleſs Charles conſented to change the place of meeting. Thoſe of Toro, Madrid, Cordova, and ſeveral other places, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the demand of another donative to be unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented, unconſtitutional, and unneceſſary. All the arts, however, which influence popular aſſemblies, bribes, promiſes, threats, and even force, were employed in order to gain the members. The nobles, ſoothed by the reſpectful aſſiduity with which Chievres and the other Flemings paid court to them, or inſtigated by a mean jealouſy of that ſpirit of independence which they ſaw riſing among the commons, openly favoured the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the court, or at the utmoſt did not oppoſe them; and at laſt, in contempt both of the ſentiments of the nation, and of the ancient forms of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a majority voted to grant the donative for which the Emperor had applied <note n="a" place="bottom">P. Martyr. Ep. 663. Sandoval, p. 32, &amp;c.</note>. Together with this grant, the Cortes laid before Charles a repreſentation of thoſe grievances whereof his people craved redreſs; but he, having obtained from them all he could expect, paid no attention to this ill-timed petition, which it was no longer dangerous to diſregard <note n="b" place="bottom">Sandoval, 84.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AS nothing now retarded his embarkation, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed his intention with regard to the regency of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile during his abſence, which he had hitherto kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and nominated Cardinal Adrian to that office, The vice-royalty of Aragon he conferred on Don John de Lanuza; that of Valencia on Don Diego de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza Con de Melito. The choice of the two latter was univerſally acceptable; but the advancement of Adrian, though the only Fleming who had preſerved any repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the Spaniards, animated the Caſtilians with

But Charles's deſire of viſiting Germany, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of his miniſters to leave Spain, were now ſo much increaſed, that without regarding the murmurs of the Caſtilians, or even taking time to provide any remedy againſt an inſurrection in Toledo, which at that time threatened, and afterwards produced moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable effects, he ſailed from Corogna on the twenty-ſecond of May; and by ſetting out ſo abruptly in queſt of a new crown, he endangered a more important one of which he was already in poſſeſſion <note n="*" place="bottom">P.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK II.</head>
                  <p>MANY concurring circumſtances, not only called Charles's thoughts towards the affairs of Germany, but rendered his preſence in that country ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Electors grew impatient of ſo long an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum; his hereditary dominions were diſturbed by inteſtine commotions; and the new opinions concerning religion, made ſuch rapid progreſs as required the moſt ſerious conſideration. But above all, the motions of the French king drew his attention, and convinced him that it was neceſſary to take meaſures for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, both with ſpeed and with vigour.</p>
                  <p>WHEN Charles and Francis entered the liſts as candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for the Imperial dignity, they conducted their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip with many profeſſions of regard for each other, and with repeated declarations that they would not ſuffer any tincture of enmity to mingle itſelf with this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able emulation. "We both court the ſame miſtreſs," ſaid Francis, with his uſual vivacity, "each ought to urge his ſuit with all the addreſs of which he is maſter, the moſt fortunate will prevail, and the other muſt reſt contented <note n="d" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 13 p. 159.</note>." But though two young and high-ſpirited
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011837_0438_0F9D87ADF1071A08"/>
Princes, and each of them animated with the hope of ſucceſs, might be capable of forming ſuch a generous reſolution, it was ſoon found that they promiſed upon a moderation too refined and diſintereſted for human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The preference given to Charles in the ſight of all Europe, mortified Francis to the higheſt degree, and inſpired him with all the paſſions natural to diſappointed ambition. To this was owing the perſonal jealouſy and rivalſhip which ſubſiſted between the two monarchs during their whole reign; and the rancour of theſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a real oppoſition of intereſt, and to many una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable cauſes of diſcord, involved them in almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hoſtilities. Charles had paid no regard to the principal article in the treaty of Noyon, by refuſing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than once to do juſtice to John d'Albret, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded monarch of Navarre, whom Francis was bound in honour, and prompted by intereſt, to reſtore to his throne. The French king had pretenſions to the crown of Naples, of which Ferdinand had deprived his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor by a moſt unjuſtifiable breach of faith. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror might reclaim the dutchy of Milan as a fief of the empire, which Francis had ſeized, and ſtill kept in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, without having received inveſtiture. Charles conſidered the dutchy of Burgundy as the patrimonial domain of his anceſtors wreſted from them by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt policy of Lewis XI, and obſerved with the greateſt jealouſy the ſtrict connections which Francis had formed with the duke of Gueldres, the hereditary enemy of his family.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the ſources of diſcord were ſo many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, peace could be of no long continuance even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Princes the moſt exempt from ambition or emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. But as the ſhock between two ſuch mighty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts could not fail of being both deſperate and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, they both diſcovered no ſmall ſolicitude about its conſequences, and took time not only to collect, and to weigh their own ſtrength, and to compare it with that of their adverſary, but to ſecure the friendſhip or aſſiſtance of the other European powers.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope had equal reaſon to dread the two rivals, and ſaw that he who prevailed, would become abſolute maſter in Italy. If it had been in his power to engage
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011837_0439_0F9D87AEB493CB08"/>
them in hoſtilities, without rendering Lombardy the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of war, nothing would have been more agreeable to him than to ſee them waſte each other's ſtrength in endleſs quarrels; but this was impoſſible. Leo foreſaw that on the firſt rupture between the two monarchs, the armies of France and Spain would take the field in the Milaneſe, and while the ſcene of their operations was ſo near, and the ſubject for which they contended ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting to him, he could not long remain neuter. He was obliged therefore to adapt his plan of conduct to his political ſituation. He courted and ſoothed both the Emperor and King of France with equal induſtry and addreſs; and tho' warmly ſolicited by each of them, he aſſumed all the appearances of entire impartiality, and attempted to conceal his real ſentiments under that profound diſſimulation which ſeems to have been affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt of the Italian politicians in that age.</p>
                  <p>THE views and intereſt of the Venetians were not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of the Pope; nor were they leſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to prevent Italy from becoming the ſeat of war, and their own republick from being involved in the quarrel. But thro' all Leo's artifices, and notwithſtanding his high pretenſions to a perfect neutrality, it was viſible that he leaned towards the Emperor, from whom he had both more to fear and more to hope than from Francis; and it was equally manifeſt, that if it became neceſſary to take a ſide, the Venetians would, from motives of the ſame nature, declare for the King of France. No conſiderable aſſiſtance, however, was to be expected from the Italian ſtates, who were jealous to an extreme degree of the Tranſalpine powers, and careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the balance between them, unleſs when they were ſeduced to violate this favourite maxim of their policy, by the certain proſpect of great advantage to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>BUT the chief attention both of Charles and of Francis was employed in order to gain the king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, from whom each of them expected aſſiſtance more effectual, and afforded with leſs political caution. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VIII. had aſcended the throne of that kingdom in one thouſand five hundred and nine, with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of advantage, as promiſed a reign of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed felicity and ſplendour. The union in his perſon of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011837_0440_0F9D87AF9BA04BD0"/>
the two contending titles of York and Lancaſter, and the alacrity and emulation with which both factions obeyed him, not only enabled him to exert in his domeſtic government a degree of vigour and authority which none of his predeceſſors could have ſafely aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but permited him to take a ſhare in the affairs of the continent, from which the attention of the Engliſh had long been diverted by their unhappy diviſions. The immenſe treaſures which his father had amaſſed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him the moſt wealthy prince in Europe. The peace which had ſubſiſted under the cautious adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of that monarch, was of ſufficient length to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the nation after the deſolation of the civil wars, but had not enervated its ſpirit; and the Engliſh, aſhamed of having ſo long rendered their own country a ſcene of diſcord and bloodſhed, were eager to diſplay their valour in ſome foreign war, and to revive the memory of the victories gained by their anceſtors. Henry's own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perfectly ſuited the ſtate of his kingdom, and the diſpoſition of his ſubjects. Ambitious, active, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing and accompliſhed in all the martial exerciſes which in that age formed a chief part in the education of perſons of noble birth, and inſpired them with an early love of war, he longed to engage in real action, and to ſignalize the beginning of his reign by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable exploit. An opportunity of this kind ſoon preſented itſelf; and the victory at Guinegate, and the ſucceſsful ſieges of Teroüenne and Tournay, though of little utility to England, reflected great luſtre on its monarch, and confirmed the idea which foreign princes entertained of his power and importance. So many concurring cauſes, added to the happy ſituation of his own dominions, which ſecured them from foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; and to the fortunate circumſtance of his being in poſſeſſion of Calais, which ſerved not only as a key to France, but opened an eaſy paſſage into the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, rendered the king of England the natural guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the liberties of Europe, and the arbiter between the Emperor and French monarch. Henry himſelf was ſenſible of this ſingular advantage, and convinced, that in order to preſerve the balance even, it was his office to prevent either of the rivals from acquiring ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011837_0441_0F9D87B034AA50A8"/>
ſuperiority of power as might be fatal to the other, and formidable to the reſt of Chriſtendom. But he was deſtitute of the penetration, and ſtill more of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which ſuch a function required. Influenced by caprice, by vanity, by reſentment, by affection, he was incapable of forming any regular and extenſive ſyſtem of policy, or of adhering to it with ſteadineſs. His meaſures ſeldom reſulted from attention to the general welfare, or from a deliberate regard to his own intereſt, but were dictated by paſſions which rendered him blind to both, and prevented his gaining that aſcendant in the affairs of Europe, or from reaping ſuch advantages to himſelf, as a prince of greater art, though with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior talents, might have eaſily ſecured.</p>
                  <p>ALL the impolitic ſteps in Henry's adminiſtration muſt not, however, be imputed to defects in his own character; many of them were owing to the violent paſſions and inſatiable ambition of his prime miniſter and favourite cardinal Wolſey. This man, from one of the loweſt ranks in life, had riſen to an height of power and dignity, to which no Engliſh ſubject ever arrived; and governed the haughty, preſumptuous and untractable ſpirit of Henry with abſolute authority. Great talents, and of very different kinds, fitted him for the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſtations of miniſter, and of favourite. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found judgment, his unwearied induſtry, his thorough acquaintance with the ſtate of the kingdom, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive knowledge of the views and intereſts of foreign courts, qualified him for that uncontrouled direction of affairs with which he was intruſted. The elegance of his manners, the gaiety of his converſation, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating addreſs, his love of magnificence, and his proficiency in thoſe parts or literature of which Henry was fond, gained him the affection and confidence of the young monarch. Wolſey was far from employing this vaſt and almoſt royal power, to promote either the true intereſt of the nation, or the real grandeur of his maſter. Rapacious at the ſame time, and profuſe, he was inſatiable in deſiring wealth. Of boundleſs ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he aſpired after new honours with an eagerneſs unabated by his former ſucceſs; and being rendered preſumptuous by his uncommon elevation, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011837_0442_0F9D87B0F0501A60"/>
he had gained over a prince, who ſcarce brooked advice from any other perſon, he diſcovered in his whole demeanour the moſt overbearing haughtineſs and pride. To theſe paſſions he himſelf ſacrificed every conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whoever endeavoured to obtain his favour, or that of his maſter, found it neceſſary to ſooth and to gratify them.</p>
                  <p>AS all the ſtates of Europe ſought Henry's friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at that time; all courted his miniſter with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attention and obſequiouſneſs, and ſtrove by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, by promiſes, or by flattery to work upon his avarice, his ambition, or his pride <note n="e" place="bottom">Fiddes's Life of Wolſey, 166. Rymer's Foedera, xiii, 718.</note>. Francis had in the year one thouſand five hundred and eighteen em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Bonivet, admiral of France, one of his moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and artful courtiers, to gain the haughty prelate. He himſelf beſtowed on him every mark of reſpect and confidence. He conſulted him with regard to his moſt important affairs, and received his reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with implicit deference. By theſe arts, together with the grant of a large penſion, Francis ſecured the Cardinal, who perſuaded his maſter to ſurrender Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay to France, to conclude a treaty of marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his daughter the princeſs Mary, and to conſent to a perſonal interview with the French king <note n="f" place="bottom">Herbert's Hiſt. of Henry VIII. 30. Rymer, xiii. 624.</note>. From that time, the moſt familiar intercourſe ſubſiſted between the two courts; Francis, ſenſible of the great value of Wolſey's friendſhip, laboured to ſecure the continuance of it by every poſſible expreſſion of regard, beſtowing on him in all his letters the honourable appellation of Father Tutor, and Governor.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES obſerved the progreſs of this union with the utmoſt jealouſy and concern. His near relation to the king of England gave him ſome title to his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſoon after his acceſſion to the throne of Caſtile, he attempted to ingratiate himſelf with Wolſey, by ſettling on him a penſion of three thouſand livres. His chief ſolicitude at preſent was to prevent the intended interview, the effects of which upon two young princes, whoſe hearts were no leſs ſuſceptible of friendſhip than
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011837_0443_0F9D87B276D27450"/>
their manners were of inſpiring it, he exremely dreaded. But after many delays occaſioned by difficulties about the ceremonial, and by the anxious precautions of both courts for the ſafety of their reſpective ſovereigns, the time and place of meeting were at laſt fixed. Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers had been ſent to different courts inviting all comers, who were gentlemen, to enter the liſts at tilt and tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, againſt the two monarchs and their knights; and both Francis and Henry loved the ſplendour of theſe ſpectacles too well, and were too much delighted with the graceful figure they made on ſuch occaſions, to forego the pleaſure or glory which they expected from ſuch a ſingular and brilliant aſſembly. Nor was the Cardinal leſs fond of diſplaying his magnificence in the preſence of two courts, and of diſcovering to the two nations the extent of his influence over both their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs. Charles finding it impoſſible to prevent the interview, endeavoured to diſappoint its effects, and to pre-occupy the favour of the Engliſh monarch and his miniſter by an act of complaiſance ſtill more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and more uncommon, having failed from Corun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as has already been related, he ſteered his courſe directly towards England, and relying wholly on Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's generoſity for his own ſafety, landed at Dover (May 26th.) This unexpected viſit ſurprized the nation. Wolſey, however, was well acquainted with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors intention. A negociation, unknown to the hiſtorians of that age, had been carried on between him and the court of Spain, this viſit had been concerted, and Charles granted the Cardinal, whom he calls his <hi>moſt ſincere friend,</hi> an additional penſion of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ducats <note n="g" place="bottom">Rymer, xiii. 714.</note>. Henry, who was then at Canterbury, in his way to France, immediately diſpatched Wolſey to Dover, and being highly pleaſed with an event ſo ſoothing to his vanity, haſtened to receive, with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reſpect, a gueſt who had placed in him ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence. Charles, to whom time was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſtaid only four days in England: But during that ſhort ſpace, he had the addreſs not only to give Henry favourable impreſſions of his character and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011837_0444_0F9D87B539DA93D0"/>
but to detach Wolſey entirely from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the French king. All the grandeur, wealth and power, which the Cardinal poſſeſſed, did not ſatisfy his ambitious mind while there was ſtill one ſtep high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to which an eccleſiaſtic could aſcend. The papal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had for ſome time been the object of his wiſhes, and Francis as the moſt effectual method of ſecuring his friendſhip, had promiſed to favour his pretenſions, on the firſt vacancy, with all his intereſt. But as the Emperor's influence in the college of cardinals was greatly ſuperior to the French king's, Wolſey graſped eagerly at an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer which that artful prince had made him of exerting it vigorouſly in his behalf; and allured by this proſpect, which under the pontificate of Leo, ſtill in the prime of his Life, was a very diſtant one, he entered with warmth into all the Emperor's ſchemes. No treaty however, was concluded at that time, between the two monarchs; but Henry, in return for the honour which Charles had done him, promiſed to viſit him in ſome place of the Low Countries, immediately after taking leave of the French king.</p>
                  <p>HIS interview with that prince was in an open plain between Guiſnes and Ardres June 7th, where the two kings and their attendants diſplayed their magnificence with ſuch emulation and profuſe expence, as procured it the name of the <hi>Field of the Cloth of Gold.</hi> Feats of chival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, parties of gallantry, and ſuch excerciſes and paſtimes as were in that age reckoned manly or elegant, rather than ſerious buſineſs, occupied both courts during eighteen days that they continued together <note n="h" place="bottom">The French and Engliſh hiſtorians deſcribe the pomp of this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and the various ſpectacles with great minuteneſs. One circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance mentioned by the marechal de Fleuranges who was preſent, and which appears ſingular in the preſent age, is commonly omitted. "After the tournaments" ſays he, "the French and Engliſh wreſtlers made their appearance, and wreſtled in the preſence of the Kings, and the ladies; and as there were many ſtout wreſtlers there, it afforded excellent paſtime; but as the King of France had neglected to bring any wreſtlers out of Bretagne, the Engliſh gained the prize.—After this, the Kings of France and England retired to a tent, where they drank together, and the King of England ſeizing the King of France by the collar, ſaid, <hi>"My brother, I muſt wreſtle with you,"</hi> and endeavoured once or twice to trip up his heels; but the King of France, who is a dextrous wreſtler, twiſted him round, and threw him on the ground with prodigious violence. The King of England wanted to renew the combat, but was prevented." Memoires de Fleuranges, 12. Paris, 1753. p. 329.</note>.

the liberal and unſuſpicious confidence with which he treated Henry, made on the mind of that monarch, was ſoon effaced by Wolſey's artifices, or by the interview which he had with the Emperor at Gravelines, (July 10) which was conducted by Charles with leſs pomp than that near Guiſneſs, but with greater attention to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical intereſt.</p>
                  <p>THIS aſſiduity with which the two greateſt monarchs in Europe paid court to Henry, appeared to him a plain acknowledgement that he held the balance in his hands, and convinced him of the juſtneſs of the motto he had choſen, "That whoever he favoured would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prevail." In this opinion he was confirmed by an offer which Charles made of ſubmitting any difference that might ariſe between him and Francis to his ſole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration. Nothing could have the appearance of greater candour and moderation, than the choice of a judge who was reckoned the common friend of both. But as the Emperor had now attached Wolſey entirely to his intereſt, no propoſal could be more inſidious, nor, as appeared by the ſequel, more fatal to the French king <note n="i" place="bottom">Herbert, 37.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES, notwithſtanding his partial fondneſs for the Netherlands, the place of his nativity, made no long ſtay there; and after receiving the homage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations of his countrymen, haſtened to Aix-la-Chapelle, the place appointed by the golden bull for the coronation of the Emperor, (October 23.) There, in preſence of an aſſembly more numerous and ſplendid than had appeared on any former occaſions, the crown of Charlemagne was placed upon his head, with all the pompous ſolemnity which the Germans affect in their publick ceremonies, and wich they deem eſſential to the dignity of their empire <note n="k" place="bottom">Hartman.

But ſuch a conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great princes ſhed uncommon luſtre on the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century. In every conteſt, great power and great abilities were ſet in oppoſition; and the efforts of valour and conduct on one ſide, counterbalanced by an equal exertion of the ſame qualities on the other, not only occaſioned ſuch a variety of events as renders the hiſtory of that period intereſting, but ſerved to check the exorbitant progreſs of any of thoſe princes, and to prevent their attaining ſuch pre-eminence in power as would have been fatal to the liberty and happineſs of mankind.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt act of the Emperor's adminiſtration was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Diet of the empire to be held at Worms on the ſixth of January, one thouſand five hundred and twenty-one; and in his circular letters to the different princes, he informed them that he had called this aſſembly in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to concert with them the moſt proper meaſures for checking the progreſs of thoſe new and dangerous opinions, which threatened to diſturb the peace of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, and to overturn the religion of their anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES had in view the opinions propagated by Luther and his diſciples ſince the year one thouſand five hundred and ſeventeen; and as theſe led to that happy reformation in religion which reſcued one part of Europe from the papal yoke, mitigated its rigour in the other, and produced a revolution in the ſentiments of mankind, the greateſt as well as the moſt beneficial that has happened ſince the publication of Chriſtianity, the events which at firſt gave birth to theſe opinions, and the cauſes which rendered their progreſs ſo rapid and ſucceſsful, deſerve to be conſidered with minute atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

power, and defended with art and induſtry; to eſtabliſh in its room doctrines of the moſt contrary genius and tendency; and to accompliſh all this, not by external violence or the force of arms, are operations which hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians the leaſt prone to credulity and ſuperſtition, muſt aſcribe to that Divine Providence which can, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite eaſe, bring about events that to human ſagacity appear impoſſible. The interpoſition of Heaven in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Chriſtian religion at its firſt publication, was manifeſted by miracles and prophecies wrought and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in confirmation of it: And though none of the reformers poſſeſſed, or pretended to poſſeſs, theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural gifts, yet that wonderful preparation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which diſpoſed the minds of men for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their doctrines, that ſingular combination of cauſes which ſecured their ſucceſs, and enabled men deſtitute of power and of policy to triumph over thoſe who employed both againſt them, may be conſidered as no ſlight proof that the ſame hand which planted the Chriſtian religion, protected the reformed faith, and reared it, from beginnings extremely feeble, to an amazing degree of ſtrength and maturity.</p>
                  <p>IT was from cauſes, ſeemingly fortuitous, and from a ſource very inconſiderable, that all the mighty effects of the reformation flowed. Leo X. when raiſed to the papal throne, found the revenues of the church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the vaſt projects of his two ambitious prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, Alexander VI. and Julius II; and his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, naturally liberal and enterprizing, rendered him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of that ſevere and patient oeconomy which the ſituation of his finances required. On the contrary, his ſchemes for aggrandizing the family of Medici, his love of ſplendour, his taſte for pleaſure, and his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in rewarding men of genius, involved him daily in new expences, in order to provide a fund for which, every device, that the fertile invention of prieſts had fallen upon to drain the credulous multitude, was tried. Among others, he had recourſe to a ſale of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> According to the doctrine of the Romiſh church; all the good works of the Saints, over and above thoſe which were neceſſary towards their own juſtification, together with the infinite merits of Jeſus Chriſt, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011837_0448_0F9D87B6F2CC6118"/>
in one inexhauſtible treaſury. The keys of this were committed to St. Peter and to his ſucceſſors the Popes, who may open it at pleaſure, and by transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a portion of this ſuper abundant merit to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, for a ſum of money, may convey to him either the pardon of his own ſins, or a releaſe for any one in whom he is intereſted, from the pains of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Such indulgences were firſt invented in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth century by Urban II. as a recompence for thoſe who went in perſon upon the wild enterprize of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Holy Land. They were afterwards granted to thoſe who hired a ſoldier for that purpoſe; and in proceſs of time were beſtowed on ſuch as gave money for accompliſhing any pious work enjoyned by the Pope <note n="l" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the Council of Trent, by F.

                  <p>THE promulgating of theſe Indulgences in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, together with a ſhare of the profits ariſing from the ſale of them, was aſſigned to Albert elector of Mentz and archbiſhop of Magdeburg, who, as his chief agent for retailing them in Saxony, employed Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zel, a Dominican friar, of licentious morals, but of an active ſpirit, and remarkable for his noiſy and popular eloquence.

                        <p>The terms in which Tetzel and his aſſociates deſcribed the benefits of Indulgences, and the neceſſity of purchaſing them are ſo extravagant, that they appear to be almoſt incredible.

That the efficacy of indulgences was ſo great, that the moſt heinous ſins, even if one ſhould violate (which was impoſſible) the Mother of God, would be remitted and expiated by them, and the perſon be freed both from puniſhment and guilt. That this was the unſpeakable gift of God, in order to reconcile men to himſelf. That the croſs erected by the preachers of indulgences, was as efficacious as the croſs of Chriſt itſelf. Lo! the heavens are open; if you enter not now, when will you enter? For twelve-pence you may redeem the ſoul of your Father out of purgatory; and are you ſo ungrateful, that you will not reſcue your parent from torment? If you had but one coat, you ought to ſtrip yourſelf inſtantly, and ſell it, in order to purchaſe ſuch benefits, &amp;c.

Even the moſt unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſhocked at the ſcandalous behaviour of Tetzel and his aſſociates, who often ſquandered in drunkenneſs, gaming, and low debauchery, thoſe ſums which were piouſly beſtowed in hopes of obtaining eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and all began to wiſh that ſome check were given to this commerce, no leſs detrimental to ſociety than deſtructive to religion.</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:011837_0450_0F9D87B871C5CA70"/>SUCH was the favourable juncture, and ſo diſpoſed were the minds of his countrymen to liſten to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, when Martin Luther firſt began to call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the efficacy of Indulgences, and to declaim againſt the vicious lives and falſe doctrines of thoſe who promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated them. He was a native of Eiſleben in Saxony, and though born of poor parents, had received a learned education, during the progreſs of which he gave many indications of uncommon vigour and acuteneſs of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. As his mind was naturally ſuſceptible of ſerious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and tinctured with ſomewhat of that religious melancholy which delights in the ſolitude and devotion of a monaſtic life, he retired into a convent of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian friars, and without ſuffering the intreaties of his parents to divert him from what he thought his duty to God, he aſſumed the habit of that order. There he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great reputation, not only for piety, but for his love of knowledge, and unwearied application to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He had been taught the ſcholaſtic philoſophy and theology which were then in vogue by very able maſters, and wanted not penetration to comprehend all the niceties and diſtinctions with which they abound; but his underſtanding, naturally ſound, and ſuperior to every thing frivolous, ſoon became diſguſted with theſe ſubtile and uninſtructive ſciences, and ſought for ſome more ſolid foundation of knowledge and of piety in the holy ſcriptures. Having found a copy of the Bible, which lay neglected in the library of his monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, he abandoned all other purſuits, and devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſtudy of it, with ſuch eagerneſs and aſſiduity, as aſtoniſhed the monks, who were little accuſtomed to derive their theological notions from that ſource. The great progreſs which he made in this uncommon courſe of ſtudy, augmented ſo much the ſame both of his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and of his learning, that Frederick, Elector of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony, having founded an univerſity at Wittemberg on the Elbe, the place of his reſidence, Luther was choſen firſt to teach philoſophy, and afterwards theology there, and diſcharged both offices in ſuch a manner, that he was deemed the chief ornament of that ſociety.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Luther was at the height of his reputation and authority, Tetzel began to publiſh Indulgences in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011837_0451_0F9D87B9322FCB28"/>
the neighbourhood of Wittemberg, and to aſcribe to them the ſame imaginary virtues, which had, in other places, impoſed on the credulity of the people. As Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony was not more enlightened than the other provinces of Germany, Tetzel met with prodigious ſucceſs there. It was with the utmoſt concern, that Luther beheld the artifices of thoſe who ſold, and the ſimplicity of thoſe who bought, Indulgences. The opinions of Thomas Aquinas and the other ſchoolmen, on which the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Indulgences was founded, had already loſt much of their authority with him; and the ſcriptures, which he began to conſider as the great ſtandard of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological truth, afforded no countenance to a practice, equally ſubverſive of faith and of morals. His warm and impetuous temper did not ſuffer him long to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal ſuch important diſcoveries, or to continue a ſilent ſpectator of the deluſion of his countrymen. From the pulpit in the great church of Wittemberg he inveighed bitterly againſt the irregularities and vices of thoſe who publiſhed Indulgences; he ventured to examine the doctrines which they taught, and pointed out to the people the danger of relying for ſalvation upon any other means than thoſe appointed by God in his word. The boldneſs and novelty of theſe opinions drew great attention, and being recommended by the authority of Luther's perſonal character, and delivered with a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and perſuaſive eloquence, they made a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on his hearers. Encouraged by the favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of his doctrines among the people, he wrote to Albert, elector of Mentz, and archbiſhop of Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, to whoſe juriſdiction that part of Saxony was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and remonſtrated warmly againſt the falſe opinions and wicked lives of the preachers of Indulgences; but he found that prelate too deeply intereſted in their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to correct their abuſes. His next attempt was to gain the ſuffrage of men of learning. For this purpoſe he publiſhed ninety-five theſes, containing his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with regard to indulgences. Theſe he propoſed, not as points fully eſtabliſhed, or of undoubted certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but as ſubjects of inquiry and diſputation; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, on which the learned were invited to impugn them either in perſon, or by writing; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011837_0452_0F9D87B9F163F390"/>
to the whole, ſolemn proteſtations of his high reſpect for the apoſtolic ſee, and of his implicit ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to its authority. No opponent appeared at the time prefixed; the theſes ſpread over Germany with aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing rapidity; they were read with the greateſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and all admired the boldneſs of the man who had ventured to call in queſtion the plenitude of papal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to attack the Dominicans, armed with all the terrors of inquiſitorial authority <note n="a" place="bottom">Lutheri Opera Jenae, 1612. vol. i. praeſat. 3. p. 2. 66.

                  <p>THE Friars of St. Auguſtine, Luther's own order, though addicted with no leſs obſeqiouſneſs than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monaſtic fraternities to the papal ſee, gave no check to the publication of theſe uncommon opinions. Luther had by his piety and learning acquired extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary authority among his brethren; he profeſſed the higheſt regard for the authority of the Pope; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions were at that time ſincere; and as a ſecret enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty excited by intereſt and emulation, ſubſiſts among all the monaſtic orders in the Romiſh church, the Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians were highly pleaſed with his invectives againſt the Dominicans, and hoped to ſee them expoſed to the hatred and ſcorn of the people. Nor was his ſovereign the Elector of Saxony, the wiſeſt prince at that time in Germany, diſſatisfied with this obſtruction which Luther threw in the way of the publication of indulgences. He ſecretly encouraged the attempt, and flattered himſelf that this diſpute among the Eccleſiaſticks themſelves, might give ſome check to the exactions of the court of Rome, which the ſecular princes had long though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, been endeavouring to oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>MANY zealous champions immediately aroſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend opinions on which the wealth and power of the church were founded, againſt Luther's attacks. In op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his theſes, Tetzel publiſhed counter-theſes at Francfort on the Oder; Eccius, a celebrated Divine of Augſburg, endeavoured to refute his notions; and Prierias, a Dominican friar, maſter of the ſecret palace and Inquiſitor general, wrote againſt him with all the virulence of a ſcholaſtic diſputant. But the manner in which they conducted the controverſy, did little ſervice
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011837_0453_0F9D87BAB5DBA4B8"/>
to their cauſe. Luther attempted to overturn Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences by arguments founded in reaſon, or derived from ſcripture; they produced nothing in ſupport of them but the ſentiments of ſchoolmen, the concluſions of the canon law, and the decrees of Popes<note n="b" place="bottom">F. Paul, p. 6. Seckend. p. 40. Palavic. p. 8.</note>. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of judges ſo partial and intereſted, did not ſatisfy the people, who began to call in queſtion the authority even of theſe venerable guides, when they found them ſtanding in direct oppoſition to the diſtates of reaſon, and the determinations of the divine law. <note n="c" place="bottom">Seckend. p. 30.</note> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Guicciardini has aſſerted two things with regard to the firſt promulgation of indulgences; 1.

Guic. lib. 13. 168. 2.

F.

F. Paul, p. 5. Almoſt all the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſince their time, popiſh as well as proteſtant, have, without examination, admitted theſe aſſertions to be true upon their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

That the profits ariſing from Indulgences in Saxony and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent countries, had been granted not to Magdalen, but to Albert archbiſhop of Mentz, who had the right of nominating thoſe who publiſhed them.

That Luther and his adherents never mention this grant of Leo's to his ſiſter, though a circumſtance of which they could ſcarce have been ignorant, and which they would have been careful not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs.—5. The publication of indulgences in Germany was not uſually committed to the Auguſtinians. The promalgation of them at three different periods under Julius II. was granted to the Franciſcans; the Dominicans had been employed in the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a ſhort time before the preſent period. Palav. p. 46. 6. The promulgation of thoſe Indulgences which firſt excited Luther's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation was entruſted to the archbiſhop of Mentz in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the guardian of the Franciſcans; but the latter having declined accepting of that truſt, the ſole right became veſted in the archbiſhop.

Leo, fond of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and refined pleaſures, intent upon great ſchemes of policy, a ſtranger to theological controverſies, and apt to deſpiſe them, regarded with the utmoſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the operations of an obſcure Friar, who in the heart of Germany, carried on a ſcholaſtic diſputation in a barbarous ſtile. Little did he apprehend, or Luther himſelf dream, that the effects of this quarrel would be ſo fatal to the papal ſee. Leo imputed the whole to monaſtic enmity an emulation, and ſeemed inclined not to interpoſe in the conteſt, but to allow the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinians and Dominicans to wrangle about the matter with their uſual animoſity.</p>
                  <p>THE ſolicitations, however, of Luther's adverſaries, exaſperated to an high degree by the boldneſs and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with which he animadverted on their writings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſurprizing progreſs which his opinions made in different parts of Germany, rouzed at laſt the attention of the court of Rome, and obliged Leo to take meaſures for the ſecurity of the church againſt an attack that appeared now too ſerious to be deſpiſed. For this end, he ſummoned Luther to appear at Rome, within ſixty days, before the auditor of the chamber, and the ſame Prierias who had written againſt him, whom he empowred to examine his doctrines, and to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011837_0455_0F9D87BC30391F90"/>
decide concerning them. He wrote at the ſame time, to the Elector of Saxony, beſeeching him not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect a man whoſe heretical and profane tenets were ſo ſhocking to pious ears; and enjoined the Provincial of the Auguſtinians to check by his authority the raſhneſs of an arrogant monk, which brought diſgrace upon the order of St. Auguſtine, and gave offence and diſturbance to the whole church.</p>
                  <p>FROM the ſtrain of theſe letters as well as from the nomination of a judge ſo prejudiced and partial as Prierias, Luther eaſily ſaw what ſentence he might expect at Rome. He diſcovered, for that reaſon, the utmoſt ſolicitude, to have his cauſe tried in Germany, and before a leſs ſuſpected tribunal. The univerſity of Wittemberg, anxious for the ſafety of a man who did ſo much honour to their ſociety, wrote to the Pope, and after employing ſeveral pretexts to excuſe Luther from appearing at Rome, intreated Leo to commit the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his doctrines to ſome perſons of learning and authority in Germany. The Elector requeſted the ſame thing of the Pope's legate at the diet of Augſburg; and as Luther himſelf, who, at that time, was ſo far from having any intention to diſclaim the papal authority, that he did not even entertain the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its divine original, had written to Leo a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive letter, promiſing an unreſerved compliance with his will, the Pope gratified them ſo far as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power his legate in Germany, cardinal Cajetan, a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican, eminent for ſcholaſtic learning, and paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Roman ſee, to hear and determine the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>LUTHER, though he had good reaſon to decline a judge choſen among his avowed adverſaries, did not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate about appearing before Cajetan, and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Emperor's ſafe-conduct, immediately repaired to Augſburg. The Cardinal received him with decent reſpect, and endeavoured at firſt to gain upon him by gentle treatment: But thinking it beneath the dignity of his ſtation to enter into any formal diſpute, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, by virtue of the apoſtolic powers with which he was cloathed, to retract the errors he had uttered with regard to Indulgences, and the nature of faith; and to abſtain, for the future, from the publication of new
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011837_0456_0F9D87BDD8491A20"/>
and dangerous opinions. Luther fully perſuaded of the truth of his own tenets, and confirmed in the belief of them by the approbation they had met with among perſons conſpicuous both for their learning and piety, was ſurprized at this abrupt mention of a recantation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any endeavours were uſed to convince him that he was miſtaken. He had flattered himſelf, that in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning the points in diſpute, with a prelate of ſuch diſtinguiſhed abilities, he would be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move many of thoſe imputations with which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or malice of his antagoniſts had loaded him; but the high tone of authority which the Cardinal aſſumed, extinguiſhed at once all hopes of this kind, and cut off every proſpect of advantage from the interview. His native intrepidity of mind, however, did not deſert him. He declared, with the utmoſt firmneſs, that he could not, with a ſafe conſcience, renounce opinions which he believed to be true; nor ſhould any conſideration ever induce him to do what would be ſo baſe in itſelf, and ſo offenſive to God. At the ſame time he continued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs no leſs reverence than formerly for the authority of the apoſtolic ſee <note n="d" place="bottom">Luth. Oper. vol. i. p. 164.</note>; he ſignified his willingneſs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole controverſy to certain univerſities which he named, and promiſed neither to write nor to preach for the future concerning Indulgences, provided his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries were likewiſe enjoined to be ſilent with reſpect to them <note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 169.</note>. All theſe offers Cajetan diſregarded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and ſtill inſiſted peremptorily on a ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, threatening him with eccleſiaſtical cenſures, and forbidding him to appear again in his preſence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he reſolved inſtantly to comply with what he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This haughty and violent manner of proceeding, as well as other circumſtances, gave Luther's friends ſuch ſtrong reaſons to ſuſpect, that even the Imperial ſafe-conduct would not be able to protect him from the legate's power and reſentment, that they prevailed on him to withdraw ſecretly from Augſburg, and to return to his own country. But before his departure, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a form of which there had been ſome examples, he prepared a ſolemn appeal, from the Pope ill-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011837_0457_0F9D87BE86F105F8"/>
at that time concerning his cauſe, to the Pope when he ſhould receive more full information with reſpect to it <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. of Reform. p. 7. Seckend. p. 45. Luth Oper i. 163.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CAJETAN, enraged at Luther's abrupt retreat, and the publication of his appeal, wrote to the Elector of Saxony, complaining of both; and requiring him, as he regarded the peace of the church, or the authority of its head, either to ſend that ſeditious monk a priſoner to Rome, or to baniſh him out of his territories. It was not from theological conſiderations that Frederick had hitherto countenanced Luther, he ſeems to have been much a ſtranger to controverſies of that kind, and to have been little intereſted in them. His protection flowed almoſt entirely, as hath been already obſerved, from political motives, and was afforded with great ſecrecy and caution. He had neither heard any of Luther's diſcourſes, nor read any of his books; and though all Germany reſounded with his fame, he had never once admitted him into his preſence <note n="g" place="bottom">Seckend. p. 27. Sleid. Hiſt. p. 12.</note>. But upon this demand which the Cardinal made, it became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to throw off ſomewhat of his former reſerve. He had been at great expence, and had beſtowed much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on founding a new univerſity, an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable importance to every German prince; and fore-ſeeing how fatal a blow the removal of Luther would be to its reputation <note n="h" place="bottom">Seckend. p. 59.</note>, he, under various pretexts, and with many profeſſions of eſteem for the Cardinal, and of reverence for the Pope, declined complying with either of his requeſts, and openly diſcovered great concern for Luther's ſafety <note n="i" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. p. 10. Luth. Oper. i. 172.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE inflexible rigour with which Cajetan inſiſted on a ſimple recantation, gave great offence to Luther's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in that age, and hath ſince been cenſured as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſeveral popiſh writers. But it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the legate to act another part. The judges before whom Luther had been required to appear at Rome, were ſo eager to diſplay their zeal againſt his errors, that, without waiting the expiration of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days allowed him in the citation, they had already
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011837_0458_0F9D87BF39DDB880"/>
condemned him as an heretick <note n="k" place="bottom">Luth. Oper. i. 161.</note>. Leo had in ſeveral of his brieves and letters, ſtigmatized him as a child of iniquity, and a man given up to a reprobate ſenſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, therefore than a recantation could ſave the honour of the church, whoſe maxim it is never to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the ſmalleſt point it has eſtabliſhed, and which is even precluded, by its pretenſions to infallibility, from having it in its power to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>LUTHER's ſituation, meanwhile, was ſuch as would have filled any other perſon with the moſt diſquieting apprehenſions. He could not expect that a prince ſo prudent and cautious as Frederick would, on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſet at defiance the thunders of the church, and brave the papal power which had cruſhed ſome of the moſt powerful of the German Emperors. He knew what veneration was paid, at that time, to eccleſiaſtical deciſions; what terror eccleſiaſtical cenſures carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, and how eaſily theſe might intimidate and ſhake a prince, who was rather his protector from policy, than his diſciple from conviction. If he ſhould be obliged to quit Saxony, he had no proſpect of any other aſylum, and muſt ſtand expoſed to whatever pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment the rage or bigotry of his enemies could inflict though ſenſibe of his danger, he diſcovered no ſymptoms of timidity, or remiſſneſs, but continued to vindicate his own conduct and opinions, and to inveigh againſt thoſe of his adverſaries with more vehemence than ever <note n="l" place="bottom">Seckend. p. 59.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT as every ſtep taken by the court of Rome, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the irregular ſentence by which he had been ſo precipitately declared an heretick, convinced Luther that Leo would ſoon proceed to the moſt violent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt him, he had recourſe to the only expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in his power, in order to prevent the effect of the Papal cenſures. He appealed to a general council, which he affirmed to be the repreſentative of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic church, and ſuperior in power to the Pope, who being a fallible man, might err, as St. Peter, the moſt perfect of his predeceſſors had erred <note n="m" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. 12. Luth. Oper. i. 179.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:011837_0459_0F9D87BFF25740B8"/>IT ſoon appeared, that Luther had not formed raſh conjectures concerning the intentions of the Romiſh church. A bull of a date prior to his appeal, was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the Pope, in which he magnifies the virtue and efficacy of Indulgences in terms as extravagant as any of his predeceſſors had ventured to uſe in the darkeſt ages; and without applying ſuch palliatives, or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning ſuch conceſſions as the juncture ſeemed to call for, he required all Chriſtians to aſſent to what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as the doctrine of the catholic church, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected thoſe who ſhould hold or teach any contrary opinion to the heavieſt eccleſiaſtical cenſures.</p>
                  <p>AMONG Luther's followers, this bull, which they conſidered as an unjuſtifiable effort of the Pope in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to preſerve that rich branch of his revenue which aroſe from Indulgences, produced little effect. But among the reſt of his countrymen, ſuch a clear deciſion of the ſovereign Pontiff againſt him, and inforced by ſuch dreadful penalties, muſt have been attended with conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences very fatal to his cauſe; if theſe had not been prevented in a great meaſure by the death of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Maximilian, whom both his principles and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt prompted to ſupport the authority of the holy ſee. In conſequence of this event, the vicariat of that part of Germany which is governed by the Saxon laws, was committed to the Elector of Saxony; and under the ſhelter of his friendly adminiſtration, Luther not only enjoyed tranquillity, but his opinions were ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, during the inter-regnum which preceded Charles's election, to take root in different places, and to grow up to ſome degree of ſtrength and firmneſs. Leo too, to whom the election of an Emperor was a point more intereſting than a theological controverſy, which he did not underſtand, and of which he could not foreſee the conſequences, being extremely ſolicitous not to irritate a Prince of ſuch conſiderable influence in the electoral college as Frederick, diſcovered a great unwillingneſs to pronounce the ſentence of excommunication againſt Luther, which his adverſaries continually demanded with the moſt clamorous importunity.</p>
                  <p>TO theſe political views of the Pope, as well as to his natural averſion from ſevere meaſures, was owing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011837_0460_0F9D87C22ADA17C0"/>
the ſuſpenſion of any further proceedings againſt Luther for eighteen months. Perpetual negociations, however, in order to bring the matter to ſome amicable iſſue, were carried on during that ſpace. The manner in which theſe were conducted having given Luther many opportunities of obſerving the corruption of the court of Rome; its obſtinacy in adhering to eſtabliſhed errors; and its indifference about truth, however clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or ſtrongly proved, he began to utter ſome doubts with regard to the divine original of the Papal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. A publick diſputation was held upon this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion at Leipſic, between Luther and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, one of his moſt learned and formidable antagoniſts; but it was as fruitleſs and indeciſive as ſuch ſcholaſtic combats uſually prove. Both parties boaſted of having obtained the victory; both were confirmed in their own opinions; and no progreſs was made towards deciding the point in controverſy <note n="n" place="bottom">Luth. Oper. i. 199.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOR did this ſpirit of mutiny againſt the doctrines and uſurpations of the Romiſh church, break out in Saxony alone; an attack no leſs fierce, and occaſioned by the ſame cauſes, was made upon them about this time in Switzerland. The Franciſcans being entruſted with the promulgation of Indulgences in that country, executed their commiſſion with the ſame indiſcretion and rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which had rendered the Dominicans ſo odious in Germany. They proceeded, nevertheleſs with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſs till they arrived at Zurich. There Zuinglius, a man not inferior to Luther himſelf in zeal and intrepidity, ventured to oppoſe them; and being animated with a republican boldneſs, and free from thoſe reſtraints which ſubjection to the will of a Prince impoſed on the German reformer, he advanced with more daring and rapid ſteps to overturn the whole fabric of the eſtabliſhed religion <note n="o" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. 22. Seckend. 59.</note>. The appearance of ſuch a vigorous auxiliary, and the progreſs which he made, was at firſt, matter of great joy to Luther, though on the other hand, the decrees of the univerſities of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne and Louvain, which pronounced his opinions to be erroneous, afforded great cauſe of triumph to his adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:011837_0461_0F9D87C3AEB45838"/>BUT the undaunted ſpirit of Luther acquired freſh vigour from every inſtance of oppoſition; and puſhing on his inquiries and attacks from one doctrine to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he began to ſhake the firmeſt foundations on which the wealth or power of the church were eſtabliſhed. Leo came at laſt to be convinced, that all hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him by forbearance were vain; ſeveral prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of great wiſdom exclaimed no leſs than Luther's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal adverſaries againſt the Pope's unprecedented lenity in permitting an incorrigible heretick, who during three years had been endeavouring to ſubvert every thing ſacred and venerable, ſtill to remain within the boſom of the church, the dignity of the papal ſee rendered the moſt vigorous proceedings neceſſary; the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, it was hoped, would ſupport its authority; nor did it ſeem probable that the Elector of Saxony would ſo far forget his uſual caution, as to ſet himſelf in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their united power. The college of cardinals was often aſſembled, in order to prepare the ſentence with due deliberation, and the moſt able canons were conſulted how it might be expreſſed with moſt unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable formality. At laſt, on the fifteenth of June, one thouſand five hundred and twenty, the bull ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the church of Rome, was iſſued. Forty-one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, extracted out of Luther's works, are therein condemned as heretical, ſcandalous, and offenſive to pious ears; all perſons are forbidden to read his writings, upon pain of excommunication; ſuch as had any of them in their cuſtody, are commanded to commit them to the flames; and he himſelf, if he did not, within ſixty days publickly recant his errors, and burn his books, is pronounced an obſtinate heretick; is excommunicated, and delivered unto Satan for the deſtruction of his fleſh; and all ſecular Princes are required, under pain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the ſame cenſure, to ſeize his perſon, that he might be puniſhed as his crimes deſerved <note n="p" place="bottom">Palavic. 27. Luth. Oper, i. 423.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE publication of this bull in Germany excited various paſſions in different places. Luther's adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries exulted, as if his party and opinions had been cruſhed at once by ſuch a deciſive blow. His followers, whoſe reverence for the papal authority daily diminiſhed,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011837_0462_0F9D87C3C8C98AD0"/>
read Leo's anathemas with more indignation than ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. In ſome cities, the people violently obſtructed the promulgation of the bull; in others, thoſe who attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to publiſh it were inſulted, and the bull itſelf torn in pieces, and trodden under foot <note n="q" place="bottom">Seck. p. 116.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſentence, which he had for ſome time expected, did not diſconcert or intimidate Luther. After renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his appeal to a general council, he publiſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the bull of excommunication; and being now perſuaded that Leo had been guilty both of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and injuſtice in his proceedings againſt him, he boldly declared the Pope to be that man of ſin, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, whoſe appearance is foretold in the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament; he declaimed againſt his tyranny and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with greater violence than ever; he exhorted all Chriſtian Princes to ſhake of ſuch an ignominious yoke; and boaſted of his own happineſs in being marked out as the object of eccleſiaſtical indignation, becauſe he had ventured to aſſert the liberty of mankind. Nor did he confine his expreſſions of contempt for the papal power to words alone; Leo having, in execution of the bull, appointed Luther's books to be burnt at Rome, he, by way of retaliation, aſſembled all the profeſſors and ſtudents in the univerſity of Wittemberg, and with great pomp, and before a vaſt multitude of ſpectators, caſt the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the canon law together with the bull of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication into the flames; and his example was imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in ſeveral cities of Germany. The manner in which he juſtified this action was ſtill more provoking than the action itſelf. He collected from the canon law ſome of the moſt extravagant propoſitions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the plenitude and omnipotence of the Pope's power, and ſubordination of all ſecular juriſdiction to his authority, and publiſhed theſe with a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, pointing out the impiety of ſuch tenets, and their evident tendency to ſubvert all civil government <note n="r" place="bottom">Luth Oper. ii. 316.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the progreſs which Luther had made, and ſuch the ſtate of his party, when Charles arrived in Germany. No ſecular Prince had hitherto embraced Luther's opinions, no change in the eſtabliſhed forms of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011837_0463_0F9D87C47175D998"/>
worſhip had been introduced; and no encroachments made upon the poſſeſſions or juriſdiction of the clergy; neither party had yet proceeded to action; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, though conducted with great heat and paſſion on both ſides, was ſtill carried on with its proper weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with theſes, diſputations, and replies. A deep impreſſion, however, was made upon the minds of the people; their reverence for ancient inſtitutions and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines was ſhaken; and the materials were already ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered which produced the combuſtion that ſoon ſpread all over Germany. Students crowded from every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Empire to Wittemberg; and under Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, Melancthon, Carloſtadius, and other maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then reckoned eminent, imbibed opinions, which, on their return, they propagated among their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who liſtened to them with that fond attention, which truth, when accompanied with novelty, naturally commands <note n="s" place="bottom">Seckend. 59.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING the courſe of theſe tranſactions, the court of Rome, though under the direction of one of its ableſt Pontiffs, neither formed its ſchemes with that profound ſagacity, nor executed them with that ſteady perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which had long rendered it the moſt perfect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of political wiſdom to the reſt of Europe. When Luther began to declaim againſt Indulgences, two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent methods of treating him lay before the Pope; by adopting one of which the attempt, it is probable, might have been cruſhed, and by the other it might have been rendered innocent. If Luther's firſt departure from the doctrines of the church had inſtantly drawn upon him the weight of its cenſures, the dread of theſe might have reſtrained the Elector of Saxony from protecting him, might have deterred the people from liſtening to his diſcourſes, or have over-awed Luther himſelf; and his name, like that of many good men before his time, would now have been known to the world only for his honeſt but ill-timed effort to correct the corruptions of the Romiſh church. Or on the other hand, if the Pope had early teſtified ſome diſpleaſure with the vices and exceſſes of thoſe who had been employed to publiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011837_0464_0F9D87C53253BA60"/>
if he had forbidden the mentioning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points in diſcourſes, addreſſed to the people; if he had enjoined the diſputants on both ſides to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; if he had been careful not to riſque the credit of the church by defining articles which had hitherto been left undetermined, Luther would, probably, have ſtopt ſhort at his firſt diſcoveries: He would not have been forced in ſelf-defence to venture upon new ground, and the whole controverſy might poſſibly have died away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly; or being confined entirely to the ſchools, might have been carried on with as little detriment to the peace and unity of the Romiſh church, as that which the Franciſcans maintain with the Dominicans, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immaculate conception, or that between the Janſeniſts and Jeſuits concerning the operations of grace: But Leo, by fluctuating between theſe oppoſite ſyſtems, and by embracing them alternately, defeated the effects of both. By an improper exertion of authority, Luther was exaſperated, not reſtrained. By a miſtaken exerciſe of lenity, time was given for his opinions to ſpread, but no progreſs made towards reconciling him to the church; and even the ſentence of excommunication, which at another juncture might have been deciſive, was delayed ſo long, that it became at laſt ſcarce an object of terror.</p>
                  <p>SUCH a ſeries of errors in the meaſure of a court, ſeldom chargeable with miſtaking its own true intereſt, is not more aſtoniſhing than the wiſdom which appeared in Luther's conduct. Though a perfect ſtranger to the maxims of human prudence, and incapable, from the impetuoſity of his temper, of obſerving them, he was led naturally by the method in which he made his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, to carry on his operations in a manner which contributed more to their ſucceſs, than if every ſtep he took had been preſcribed by the moſt artful policy. At the time when he ſet himſelf to oppoſe Tetzel, he was far from intending that reformation, which he afterwards effected; and would have trembled with horror at the thoughts of what at laſt he gloried in accompliſhing. The knowledge of truth was not poured into his mind, all at once, by any ſpecial revelation; he acquired it by induſtry and meditation, and his progreſs, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011837_0465_0F9D87C5F08A9708"/>
was gradual. The doctrines of Popery are ſo cloſely connected, that the expoſing of one error con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him naturally to the detection of others; and all the parts of that artificial fabrick were ſo linked together, that the pulling down of one looſened the foundation of the reſt, and rendered it more eaſy to overturn them. In confuting the extravagant tenets concerning Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, he was obliged to inquire into the true cauſe of our juſtification and acceptance with God. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that diſcovered to him by degrees the inutility of pilgrimages and penances; the vanity of relying on the interceſſion of ſaints; the impiety of worſhipping them; the abuſes of auricular confeſſion; and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary exiſtence of purgatory. The detection of ſo many errors, led him of courſe to conſider the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the clergy who taught them; and their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant wealth, the ſevere injunction of celibacy, and the intolerable rigour of monaſtic vows appeared to him the great ſources of their corruption. From thence, it was but one ſtep to call in queſtion the divine original of the papal power, which authorized and ſupported ſuch a ſyſtem of errors. As the unavoidable reſult of the whole, he diſclaimed the infallibility of the Pope, the deciſions of ſchoolmen, or any other human authority, and appealed to the word of God as the only ſtandard of theological truth. To this gradual progreſs Luther owed his ſucceſs. His hearers were not ſhocked at firſt by any propoſition too repugnant to their ancient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, or too remote from eſtabliſhed opinions. They were conducted inſenſibly from one doctrine to another. Their faith and conviction were able to keep pace with his diſcoveries. To the ſame cauſe was owing the inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and even indifference, with which Leo viewed Luther's firſt proceedings. A direct or violent attack upon the authority of the church, would have drawn upon him at once the whole weight of its vengeance; but as this was far from his thoughts, as he continued long to profeſs great reſpect for the Pope, and made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated offers of ſubmiſſion to his deciſions, there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no reaſon for apprehending that he would prove the author of any deſperate revolt; and he was ſuffered to proceed ſtep by ſtep, in undermining the conſtitution
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011837_0466_0F9D87C6B7385E28"/>
of the church, till the remedy applied at laſt came too late to produce any effect.</p>
                  <p>BUT whatever advantages Luther's cauſe derived ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the miſtakes of his adverſaries, or from his own good conduct, the ſudden progreſs and firm eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of his doctrines, muſt not be aſcribed to theſe alone. The ſame corruptions in the church of Rome which he condemned, had been attacked long before his appearance, and the ſame opinions which he now propagated, had been publiſhed in different places, and were ſupported by the ſame arguments. Waldus in the twelfth century, Wickliff in the fourteenth, and Huſs in the fifteenth, had inveighed againſt the errors of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery with great boldneſs, and confuted them with more ingenuity and learning than could have been expected in thoſe illiterate ages in which they flouriſhed. But all theſe premature attempts towards a reformation proved abortive. Such feeble lights, incapable of diſpelling the darkneſs which then covered the church, were ſoon extinguiſhed; and though the doctrines of theſe pious men produced ſome effects, and left ſome traces in the countries where they were taught, they were neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive nor conſiderable. Many powerful cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to facilitate Luther's progreſs, which either did not exiſt or did not operate with full force in their days; and at the critical and mature juncture when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, circumſtances of every kind concurred in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering each ſtep he took ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>THE long and ſcandalous ſchiſm which divided the church, during the latter part of the fourteenth, and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, had a great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in diminiſhing the veneration with which the world had been accuſtomed to view the papal dignity. Two or three contending Pontiffs roaming about Europe at a time; fawning on the Princes whom they wanted to gain; ſqueezing the countries which acknowledged their authority; excommunicating their rivals, and curſing thoſe who adhered to them, diſcredited their pretenſions to infallibility, and expoſed both their perſons and their office to contempt. The laity, to whom all parties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, came to learn that ſome right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonged to them, and acquired the exerciſe of it
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011837_0467_0F9D87C7738B8E80"/>
ſo far as to chooſe, among theſe infallible guides, whom they would pleaſe to follow. The proceedings of the councils of Conſtance and Baſil, ſpread ſtill wider this diſreſpect for the Romiſh ſee, and by their bold exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of authority in depoſing and electing Popes, taught the world that there was in the church a juriſdiction ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior even to the papal power, which they had long believed to be ſupreme.</p>
                  <p>THE wound given on that occaſion to the papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was ſcarce healed up, when the pontificates of Alexander VI. and Julius II. both able princes, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable eccleſiaſtics, raiſed new ſcandal in Chriſtendom. The profligate morals of the former in private life; the fraud, the injuſtice and cruelty of his publick adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, placed him on a level with thoſe tyrants, whoſe deeds are the greateſt reproach to human nature. The latter, though a ſtranger to theſe odious paſſions which prompted his predeceſſor to commit ſo many unnatural crimes, was under the dominion of a reſtleſs and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable ambition, which ſcorned all conſiderations of gratitude, of decency, or of juſtice, when they obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the execution of his ſchemes. It was ſcarce poſſible to be firmly perſuaded that the infallible knowledge of a religion, whoſe chief precepts are purity and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was depoſited in the breaſts of the impious Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the overbearing Julius. The opinion of thoſe who exalted the authority of a council above that of the Pope ſpread wonderfully under their pontificates: And as the Emperor and French Kings, who were alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in hoſtilities with theſe active pontiffs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and even encouraged their ſubjects to expoſe their vices with all the violence of invective, and all the petulance of ridicule, men's ears being accuſtomed to theſe, were not ſhocked with the bold or ludicrous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Luther and his followers concerning the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal dignity.</p>
                  <p>NOR were ſuch exceſſes confined to the head of the church alone. Many of the dignified clergy, both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and regular, being the younger ſons of noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who had aſſumed the eccleſiaſtical character for no other reaſon, but that they found in the church ſtations of great dignity and affluence, were accuſtomed totally to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011837_0468_0F9D87C84F14EE70"/>
neglect the duties of their office, and indulged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without reſerve in all the vices to which great wealth and idleneſs naturally give birth. Though the inferior clergy were prevented by their poverty from imitating the expenſive luxury of their ſuperiors, yet groſs ignorance and low debauchery rendered them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as the others were odious <note n="t" place="bottom">The corupt ſtate of the church prior to the Reformation, is ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by an author, who was both abundantly able to judge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, and who was not over forward to confeſs it. "For ſome years (ſays he) before the Lutheran and Calviniſtic hereſies were publiſhed, there was not (as contemporary authors teſtify) any ſeverity in eccleſiaſtical judicatories, any diſcipline with regard to morals, any knowledge of ſacred literature, any reverence for divine things, there was not almoſt any religion remaining."

The ſevere and unnatural law of celibacy, to which both were equally ſubject, occaſioned ſuch irregularities, that in ſeveral parts of Europe the concubinage of prieſts was not only permitted, but enjoined. The employing of a remedy ſo contrary to the genius of the Chriſtian religion, is the ſtrongeſt proof that the crimes it was intended to prevent were both numerous and flagrant.

                        <p>The authors I have quoted enumerate the vices of the clergy. When they ventured upon crimes, they would not be ſcrupulous with reſpect to the decorum of behaviour. Accordingly their neglect of the decent conduct ſuitable to their profeſſion, ſeems to have given great offence.

great ſcandal, not only becauſe their manners were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with their ſacred character; but the laity being accuſtomed to ſee ſeveral of them raiſed from the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtations to the greateſt affluence, did not ſhew the ſame indulgence to their exceſſes, as to thoſe of perſons poſſeſſed of hereditary wealth or grandeur; and viewing their condition with more envy, they cenſured their crimes with greater ſeverity. Nothing, therefore, could be more acceptable to Luther's hearers, than the violence with which he exclaimed againſt the immoralities of churchmen, and every perſon in his audience could, from his own own obſervation, confirm the truth of his invectives.</p>
                  <p>THE ſcandal of theſe crimes was greatly increaſed by the facility with which thoſe who committed them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon. In all the European kingdoms, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of the civil magiſtrate, under forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extremely irregular and turbulent, made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to relax the rigour of juſtice, and upon payment of a certain fine or compoſition preſcribed by law, to remit farther puniſhment, even of the moſt atrocious crimes. The court of Rome, always attentive to the means of augmenting its revenues, imitated this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and by a prepoſterous accommodation of it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious concerns, granted its pardons to ſuch tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors as gave a ſum of money in order to purchaſe them. As the idea of a compoſition for crimes was then fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, this ſtrange traffick was ſo far from ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it ſoon became general; and to prevent any impoſition in carrying it on, the officers, of the Roman chancery publiſhed a book, containing the preciſe ſum to be exacted for the pardon of every particular ſin. A deacon guilty of murder was abſolved for twenty crowns. A biſhop or abbot might aſſaſſinate for three hundred livres. Any eccleſiaſtic might commit uncleanneſs, though with the moſt aggravating circumſtances, for the third part of that ſum. Even ſuch ſhocking crimes, as occur ſeldom in human life, and perhaps exiſt only in the impure imagination of a caſuiſt, were taxed at a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate rate. When a more regular and perfect mode of diſpenſing juſtice came to be introduced into civil courts, the practice of paying a compoſition for
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011837_0470_0F9D87C9B3DBD160"/>
crimes went gradually into diſuſe; and mankind having acquired more accurate notions concerning religion and morality, the conditions on which the court of Rome beſtowed its pardons appeared impious, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one great ſource of eccleſiaſtical corruption <note n="x" place="bottom">Faſcicul.

                  <p>THIS degeneracy of manners among the clergy might, perhaps, have been tolerated with greater indulgence, if their exorbitant riches and power had not enab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them at the ſame time, to oppreſs all other orders of men. It is the genius of ſuperſtition, fond of whatever is pompous or grand, to ſet no bounds to its liberality towards perſons whom it eſteems ſacred, and to think its expreſſions of regard defective, unleſs it hath raiſed them to the height of wealth and authority. Hence flowed the extenſive revenues and juriſdiction poſſeſſed by the church in every country of Europe, and which were become intolerable to the laity from whoſe undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning bounty they were at firſt derived.</p>
                  <p>THE burden, however, of eccleſiaſtical oppreſſion had fallen with ſuch peculiar weight on the Germans, as rendered them, though naturally exempt from levity, and tenacious of their ancient cuſtoms, more inclinable than any people in Europe to liſten to thoſe who call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them to aſſert their liberty. During the long conteſt between the Popes and Emperors concerning the right of inveſtiture, and the wars which theſe occaſioned moſt of the conſiderable German eccleſiaſtics joined the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal faction; and while engaged in rebellion againſt the head of the Empire, they ſeized the Imperial revenues, and uſurped the Imperial juriſdiction within their own dioceſes. Upon the re-eſtabliſhment of tranquillity, they ſtill retained theſe uſurpations, as if by the length of an unjuſt poſſeſſion they had acquired a legal right to them. The Emperors, too feeble to wreſt them out of their hands, were obliged to grant them fiefs of theſe vaſt territories, and they enjoyed all the immunities and honours which belonged to feudal barons. By means of theſe, many biſhops and abbots in Germany were
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011837_0471_0F9D87CA7B2D5E48"/>
not only eccleſiaſtics, but princes, and their character and manners partook more of the licence, too frequent among the latter, than of the ſanctity which became the former <note n="y" place="bottom">F Paul, Hiſtory of Eccleſiaſt. Benefices, p. 107.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE unſettled ſtate of government in Germany, and the frequent wars to which that country was expoſed, contributed in another manner towards aggrandizing Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics. The only property during theſe times of anarchy which enjoyed ſecurity from the oppreſſion of the great, or the ravages of war, was that which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the church. This was owing, not only to the great reverence for the ſacred character prevalent in thoſe ages, but to a ſuperſtitious dread of the ſentence of excommunication, which the clergy were ready to denounce againſt all who invaded their poſſeſſions. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſerving this, made a ſurrender of their lands to the eccleſiaſtics, and conſenting to hold them in fee of the church, obtained as its vaſſals a degree of ſafety, which without this device they were unable to procure. By ſuch an increaſe of the number of their vaſſals, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of eccleſiaſtics received a real and permanent augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and as lands, held in fee by the limited tenures common in thoſe ages, often returned to the perſons on whom the fief depended, conſiderable additions were made in this way to the property of the clergy <note n="z" place="bottom">F. Paul, Hiſt. of Eccleſ. Benef. p. 66. Boulainvilliers, Etat de France, tom. i. 169. Lond. 1737.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE ſolicitude of the clergy in providing for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their own perſons, was ſtill greater than that which they diſplayed in ſecuring their poſſeſſions; and their efforts to attain it were ſtill more ſucceſsful. As they were conſecrated to the prieſtly office with much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſolemnity; were diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of mankind by a peculiar dreſs and manner of life; and arrogated to their order many privileges which do not belong to other Chriſtians, they naturally became the objects of exceſſive veneration. As a ſuperſtitious ſpirit ſpread, they were regarded as beings of a ſuperior ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the profane laity, whom it would be impious to try by the ſame laws, or to ſubject to the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This exemption from civil juriſdiction, granted
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011837_0472_0F9D87CD7093DA20"/>
at firſt to eccleſiaſtics, as a mark of reſpect, they ſoon claimed as a point of right. This valuable immunity of the prieſthood is aſſerted, not only in the decrees of Popes and councils, but was confirmed in the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple form by many of the greateſt Emperors <note n="a" place="bottom">Goldaſti Conſtitut. Imperial. Franc of. 1673. vol. ii. 92. 107.</note>. As long as the clerical character remained, the perſon of an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic was ſacred: and unleſs he were degraded from his office, the unhallowed hand of the civil judge durſt not touch him. But as the power of degradation was lodged in the ſpiritual courts, the difficulty and expence of obtaining ſuch a ſentence, too often ſecured offenders of abſolute impunity. Many aſſumed the clerical character for no other reaſon, than that it might ſcreen them from the puniſhment which their actions deſerved <note n="b" place="bottom">Rymer's Foedera, vol. xiii. 532.</note>. The German nobles complained loudly, that theſe anointed malefactors, as they call them <note n="c" place="bottom">Centum Gravam. § 31.</note>, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuffered capitally, even for the moſt atrocious crimes; and their independance on the civil magiſtrate is often mentioned in their remonſtrances, as a privilege equally pernicious to ſociety, and to the morals of the clergy.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the clergy aſſerted de privileges of their own order with ſuch zeal, they made continual encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon thoſe of the laity. All cauſes relative to matrimony, to teſtaments, to uſury, to legitimacy of birth, as well as thoſe which concerned eccleſiaſtical revenues, were thought to be ſo connected with religion, that they could be tried only in the ſpiritual courts. Not ſatisfied with this ample juriſdiction, which extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one half of the ſubjects which give riſe to litigation among men, the clergy, with wonderful induſtry, and by a thouſand inventions, endeavoured to draw all other cauſes into their own courts <note n="d" place="bottom">Giannonè Hiſt. of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011837_0473_0F9D87CE3372B338"/>
with ſuperior confidence. Thus the intereſt of the church, and the inclination of the people, concurring to elude the juriſdiction of the lay-magiſtrate, ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it almoſt to nothing <note n="e" place="bottom">Cetum Gravam. § 9. 56. 64.</note>. By means of this, vaſt power accrued to eccleſiaſtics, and no inconſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was made to their revenue by the ſums paid in thoſe ages to ſuch as adminiſtered juſtice.</p>
                  <p>THE penalty by which the ſpiritual courts enforced their ſentences, added to them great weight and terror. The cenſure of excommunication was inſtituted original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for preſerving the purity of the church, that obſtinate offenders, whoſe impious tenets or profane lives were a reproach to chriſtianity, might be cut off from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the faithful: This, eccleſiaſtics did not ſcruple to convert into an engine for promoting their own power, and inflicted it on the moſt frivolous occaſions. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſpiſed any of their deciſions, even concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civil matters, immediately incurred this dreadful cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which not only excluded them from all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of a Chriſtian, but deprived them of their rights as men and citizens<note n="f" place="bottom">Centum Gravam § 34.</note>; and the dread of this rendered even the moſt fierce and turbulent ſpirits obſequious to the authority of the church.</p>
                  <p>NOR did the clergy neglect the proper methods of preſerving the wealth and power which they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with ſuch induſtry and addreſs. The poſſeſſions of the church, being conſecrated to God, were declared to be unalienable; ſo that the funds of a ſociety which was daily gaining, and could never loſe, grew to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe. In Germany, it was computed that the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtics had got into their hands more than one half of the national property <note n="g" place="bottom">Centum Gravam. § 28.</note>. In other nations, the proportion varied; but the ſhare belonging to the church was every where prodigious. Theſe vaſt poſſeſſions were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the burdens impoſed on the lands of the laity. The German clergy were exempted by law from all taxes <note n="h" place="bottom">Centum Gravam. Ibid. Golda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

were pleaſed to grant any aid towards ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public exigencies, this was conſidered as a free gift flowing from their own generoſity, which the civil magiſtrate had no title to demand, far leſs to exact. In conſequence of this ſtrange ſoleciſm in government, the laity in Germany had the mortification to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loaded with exceſſive impoſitions, becauſe thoſe who poſſeſſed the greateſt property were freed from any obligation to ſupport, or to defend the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>GRIEVOUS, however, as the exorbitant wealth and numerous privileges of the clerical order were to the other members of the Germanick body, they would have reckoned it ſome mitigation of the evil, if theſe had been poſſeſſed only by eccleſiaſtics reſiding among themſelves, who would have been leſs apt to make an improper uſe of their riches, or to exerciſe their rights with unbecoming rigour. But the biſhops of Rome having early put in a claim, the boldeſt that ever human ambition ſuggeſted, of being ſupreme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible heads of the Chriſtian church; they by their profound policy and unwearied perſeverance, by their addreſs in availing themſelves of every circumſtance, which occurred, by taking advantage of the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome Princes, of the neceſſities of others, and of the credulity of the people, at length eſtabliſhed their pretenſions in oppoſition both to the intereſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of mankind. Germany was the country which theſe eccleſiaſtical ſovereigns governed with moſt abſolute authority. They excommunicated and depoſed ſome of its moſt illuſtrious Emperors, and excited their ſubjects, their miniſters, and even their children to take arms againſt them. Amidſt theſe conteſts, the Popes continually extended their own immunities, and ſpoiled the ſecular Princes of their moſt valuable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and the German church felt all the rigour of that oppreſſion which flows from ſubjection to foreign dominion, and foreign exactions.</p>
                  <p>THE right of conferring benefices, which the Popes uſurped during that period of confuſion, was an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of great importance, and exalted the eccleſiaſtical power upon the ruins of the temporal. The Emperors and other princes of Germany had long been in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011837_0475_0F9D87CFB3A7E080"/>
of this right, and it ſerved to increaſe both their authority and their revenue. But by wreſting it out of their hands, the Popes were enabled to fill the Empire with their own creatures; they accuſtomed a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of every prince's ſujects to depend not upon him but upon the Roman ſee; they beſtowed the richeſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in every country upon ſtrangers, and drained their wealth to ſupply the luxury of a foreign court.

                  </p>
                  <p>BUT the court of Rome eaſily found expedients for eluding an agreement which put ſuch reſtraints on its power. The practice of reſerving certain benefices in every country to the Pope's immediate nomination, which had been long known, and often complained of, was extended far beyond its ancient bounds. All the benefices poſſeſſed by Cardinals, or any of the numerous officers in the Roman court; thoſe held by perſons who happened to die at Rome, or within forty miles of that city, on their journey to or from it; thoſe which became vacant by tranſlation, with many others, were included in that number; and Julius II. and Leo ſtretching the matter to the utmoſt, often collated to benefices where the right of reſervation had not been declared, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of having mentally reſerved this privilege to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The right of reſervation, however, even with this extenſion, had certain limits, as it could be exerciſed only where the benefice was actually vacant; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in order to render the exertion of papal power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, <hi>expectative graces,</hi> or mandates nominating a perſon to ſucceed to a benefice upon the firſt vacancy that ſhould happen, were brought into uſe. By means of theſe, Germany was filled with perſons depending on
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011837_0476_0F9D87D076E9F008"/>
the court of Rome, from which it received theſe rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary grants; princes were defrauded, in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of their prerogatives, and the rights of lay-patrons were pre-occupied, and rendered almoſt entirely vain <note n="k" place="bottom">Centum Gravam. § 31.

                  <p>THE manner in which theſe extraordinary powers were exerciſed, rendered them ſtill more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. The avarice and extortion of the court of Rome were become exceſſive almoſt to a proverb. The ſale of benefices was ſo notorious that no pains were taken to conceal, or to diſguiſe it. Companies of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants openly purchaſed the benefices of different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts in Germany from the Pope's miniſters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed them at an advanced price <note n="l" place="bottom">Faſcic.

                  <p>THE ſums, indeed, which the court of Rome drew by its ſtated and legal impoſitions from all the countries that acknowledged its authority, were ſo conſiderable, that it is not ſtrange that they murmured at the ſmalleſt addition made to them by unneceſſary or illicit means. Every eccleſiaſtical perſon, upon his admiſſion to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, paid <hi>annats,</hi> or one year's rent of his living to the Pope, and as that tax was exacted with great rigour, its amount was prodigious. To this muſt be added the frequent demands made by the Popes of free gifts from the clergy, together with the extraordinary levies of tenths upon eccleſiaſtical benefices, on pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions againſt the Turks, ſeldom intended, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into execution; and from the whole, the vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the revenues of the church which flowed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to Rome, may be eſtimated.</p>
                  <p>SUCH were the diſſolute manners, the exorbitant wealth, and power, and privileges of the clergy before the reformation; ſuch the oppreſſive rigour of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which the Popes had eſtabliſhed over the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world; and ſuch the ſentiments concerning them that prevailed in Germany, at the beginning of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011837_0477_0F9D87D132BE9DA8"/>
century. Nor has this ſketch been copied from the controverſial writers of that age, who, in the heat of diſputation, may be ſuſpected of having exaggerated the errors, or of having miſrepreſented the conduct of that church which they laboured to overturn; it is formed upon more authentick evidence, upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and remonſtrances of the Imperial diets, cooly enumerating the grievances under which the Empire groaned, in order to obtain the redreſs of them. Diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction muſt have ariſen to a great height among the people, when theſe grave aſſemblies expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch acrimony; and if they demanded the abolition of theſe enormities with ſo much vehemence, the people, we may be aſſured, uttered their ſentiments and deſires in bolder and more virulent language.</p>
                  <p>TO men thus prepared for ſhaking off the yoke, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addreſſed himſelf with certainty of ſucceſs. As they had long felt its weight, and borne it with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, they liſtened with joy to the firſt propoſal for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing deliverance. Hence proceeded the fond and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reception that his doctrines met with, and the rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity with which they ſpread over all the provinces of Germany. Even the impetuoſity and fierceneſs of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſpirit, his confidence in aſſerting his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the arrogance and contempt wherewith he treated all who differed from him, which, in ages of greater moderation and refinement, have been reckoned defects in the character of that reformer, did not appear exceſſive to his contemporaries, whoſe minds were ſtrongly agitated by thoſe intereſting controverſies which he carried on, and who had themſelves endured the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of papal tyranny, and ſeen the curruptions in the church againſt which he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>NOR were they greatly offended at that groſs ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with which his polemical writings are filled, or at the low buffoonery he ſometimes introduces into his grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcourſes. No diſpute was managed in thoſe rude times without a large portion of the former, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was common, even on the moſt ſolemn occaſions, and in treating the moſt ſacred ſubjects. So far were either of them from doing hurt to his cauſe, that invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ridicule had ſome effect, as well as more laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

arguments, in expoſing the errors of popery, and in determining mankind to abandon them.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES all theſe cauſes of Luther's rapid progreſs, ariſing from the nature of his enterpri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, and the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at which he undertook it, he reaped advantage from ſome foreign and adventitious circumſtances, the beneficial influence of which none of his forerunners in the ſame courſe had enjoyed. Among theſe may be reckoned the invention of the art of printing, about half a century before his time. By this fortunate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the facility of acquiring and of propagating knowledge, was wonderfully increaſed, and Luther's books, which muſt otherwiſe have made their way ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with uncertainty into diſtant countries, ſpread at once all over Europe. Nor were they read only by the rich and the learned, who alone had acceſs to books before that invention; they got into the hands of the people, who, upon this appeal to them as judges, ventured to examine and to reject many doctrines, which they had formerly been required to believe, without being taught to underſtand them.</p>
                  <p>THE revival of learning at the ſame period was a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance extremely friendly to the reformation. The ſtudy of the ancient Greek and Roman authors, and the diſcovery of that liberal and found knowledge which they contain, rouzed the human mind from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found lethargy in which it had been ſunk during ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral centuries. Mankind ſeem, at that period, to have recovered the powers of inquiring and of thinking, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of which they had long loſt the uſe; and fond of the acquiſition, they exerciſed them with great boldneſs upon all ſubjects. They were not now afraid of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an uncommon path, or of embracing a new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Novelty appeals, at this time, rather to have been a recommendation to a doctrine; and inſtead of being ſtartled when the daring hand of Luther drew aſide, or tore the veil which covered eſtabliſhed errors, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the age applauded and aided the attempt. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though a ſtranger to elegance in taſte or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, zealouſly promoted the cultivation of ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature; and ſenſible or its being neceſſary in ſtudying the ſcriptures, he himſelf had acquired conſiderable
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011837_0479_0F9D87D3753A28E0"/>
knowledge both in the Hebrew and Greek tongues. Melancthon, and ſome other of his diſciples, were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proficients in the polite arts; and as the ſame bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous monks who oppoſed the introduction of learning into Germany, ſet themſelves with equal fierceneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Luther's opinions, and declared the good recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one to be the effect of the progreſs which the other had made, the cauſe of learning and of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came to be conſidered as cloſely connected, and, in every country, had the ſame friends, and the ſame enemies. This enabled the reformers to carry on the conteſt at firſt with great ſuperiority. Erudition, induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, accuracy of ſentiment, purity of compoſition, and even wit and raillery, were wholly on their ſide, and triumphed with eaſe over illiterate monks, whoſe rude arguments, expreſſed in a perplexed and barbarous ſtile, were found inſufficient for the defence of a ſyſtem, the errors of which, all the art and ingenuity of its lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more learned advocates have not been able to palliate.</p>
                  <p>THAT bold ſpirit of inquiry, which the revival of learning excited in Europe, was ſo favourable to the Reformation, that Luther was aided in his progreſs, and mankind were prepared to embrace his doctrines, by perſons who did not wiſh ſucceſs to his undertaking. The greater part of the ingenious men who applied to the ſtudy of ancient literature, towards the cloſe of the fifteenth century, and the beginning of the ſixteenth, though they had no intention, and perhaps no wiſh to overturn the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem of religion, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the abſurdity of many tenets and practices au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the church, and perceived the futility of thoſe arguments, by which illiterate monks endeavoured to defend them. Their contempt of theſe advocates for the received errors, led them frequently to expoſe the ignorance which they ſupported, and to ridicule their opinions with the utmoſt freedom and ſeverity. By this men were prepared for the more ſerious attacks made upon them by Luther, and their reverence both for the doctrines and perſons againſt whom he inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was conſiderably abated. This was particularly the caſe in Germany. When the firſt attempts were made
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011837_0480_0F9D87D435053248"/>
to revive a taſte for ancient learning in that country, the Eccleſiaſtics there, who were ſtill more ignorant than their brethren on the other ſide of the Alps, ſet themſelves to oppoſe its progreſs with more active zeal; and the patrons of the new ſtudies, in return, attacked them with great violence. In the writings of Reuchlin, Hutten, and the other revivers of learning in Germany, the corruptions of the church of Rome are cenſured with an acrimony of ſtile, litle inferior to that of Luther himſelf <note n="f" place="bottom">Gerdeſius Hiſt. Evang. renov. vol. i. p. 141, 157. Seckend. lib. i. p. 103. Vonder Hardt. Hiſt. Literar. Reform. pars ii.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FROM the ſame cauſe proceeded the frequent ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Eraſmus upon the errors of the church, as well as upon the ignorance and vices of the clergy. His reputation and authority were ſo high in Europe at the beginning of the ſixteenth century, and his works were read with ſuch univerſal admiration, that the effect of theſe deſerves to be mentioned as one of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which contributed towards Luther's ſucceſs. Eraſmus having been deſtined for the church, and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the knowledge of Eccleſiaſtical literature, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf more to theological inquiries than any of the revivers of learning in that age. His acute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vaſt erudition, enabled him to diſcover many errors, both in the doctrine and worſhip of the Romiſh church. Some of theſe he confuted with great ſolidity of reaſoning, and force of eloquence. Others he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as objects of ridicule, and turned againſt them that irreſiſtible torrent of popular and ſatirical wit, of which he had the command. There was ſcarce any opinion or practice of the Romiſh church which Luther endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reform, but what had been previouſly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted upon by Eraſmus, and had afforded him ſubject either of cenſure or of raillery. When Luther firſt began his attack upon the church, Eraſmus ſeemed to applaud his conduct; he courted the friendſhip of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his diſciples and patrons; and condemned the behaviour and ſpirit of his adverſaries <note n="g" place="bottom">Seckend. lib. i. p. 40, 96.</note>. He concurred openly with him in inveighing againſt the ſchool di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011837_0481_0F9D87D4F47D7060"/>
as the teachers of a ſyſtem equally unedifying and obſcure. He joined him in endeavouring to turn the attention of men to the ſtudy of the holy ſcriptures, as the only ſtandard of religious truth <note n="h" place="bottom">Vonder Hardt. Hiſtor. Literar. Reform. pars i. Gerdes. Hiſt. Evang. Renov. i. 147.</note>.</p>
                  <p>VARIOUS circumſtances, however, prevented Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus from holding the ſame courſe with Luther. The natural timidity of his temper; his want of that force of mind which alone can prompt a man to aſſume the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a reformer <note n="i" place="bottom">Eraſmus himſelf is candid enough to acknowledge this: "Luther, ſays he, has given us many a wholeſome doctrine, and many a good counſel. I wiſh he had not defeated the effect of them by intolerable faults. But if he had written every thing in the moſt unexceptionable manner, I had no inclination to die for the ſake of truth. Every man hath not the courage requiſite to make a martyr; and I am afraid, that if I were put to the trial, I ſhould imitate St. Peter." Epiſt. Eraſmi in Jortin's Life of Eraſm. vol i. p. 273.</note>; his exceſſive deference for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in high ſtation; his dread of looſing the penſions and other emoluments which their liberality had confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him; his extreme love of peace, and hopes of reforming abuſes gradually, and by gentle methods; all concurred in determining him to repreſs and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the zeal, with which he had once been animated againſt the errors of the church <note n="k" place="bottom">Jortin's Life of Eraſmus, vol. i. p. 2 8.</note>; and to aſſume the character of a mediator between Luther and his oppon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. But though Eraſmus ſoon began to cenſure Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as too daring and impetuous, and was at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to write againſt him, he muſt, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, be conſidered as his forerunner and auxiliary in this war upon the church. He firſt ſcattered the ſeeds, which Luther cheriſhed and brought to maturity. His raillery and oblique cenſures, prepared the way for Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's invectives and more direct attacks. In this light Eraſmus appeared to the zealous defenders of the Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church in his own times <note n="l" place="bottom">Vonder Hardt. Hiſt. Literar. Reform. pars i. p. 2.</note>. In this light he muſt be conſidered by every perſon converſant in the hiſtory of that period.</p>
                  <p>IN this long enumeration of the circumſtances which combined in favouring the progreſs of Luther's opinions,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011837_0482_0F9D87D5B10C0F90"/>
or in weakening the reſiſtance of his adverſaries, I have avoided entering into any diſcuſſion of the theological doctrines of popery, and have not attempted to ſhew how repugnant they are to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and how deſtiſtute of any foundation in reaſon, in the word of God, or in the practice of the primitive church, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe topics entirely to eccleſiaſtical hiſtorians, to whoſe province they peculiarly belong. But when we add the effect of theſe religious conſiderations to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of political cauſes, it is obvious that the united operation of both on the human mind, muſt have been ſudden and irreſiſtible. And though, to Luther's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, who were too near perhaps to the ſcene, or too deeply intereſted in it, to trace cauſes with accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, or to examine them with coolneſs, the rapidity with which his opinions ſpread appeared to be ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, that ſome of them imputed it to a certain uncommon and malignant poſition of the ſtars, which ſcattered the ſpirit of giddineſs and innovation over the world <note n="m" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſtoria, Lut. 1553. fol. p. 134.</note>, it is evident, that their ſucceſs was the natural effect of many powerful cauſes prepared by peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and happily conſpiring to that end. This at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to inveſtigate the cauſes, and to throw light on an event ſo ſingular and important, will not, perhaps, be deemed an unneceſſary digreſſion.—I return from it to the courſe of the hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>THE Diet at Worms conducted its deliberations with that ſlow formality peculiar to ſuch aſſemblies. Much time was ſpent in eſtabliſhing ſome regulations with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the internal police of the Empire. The juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Imperial chamber was confirmed, and the forms of its proceeding rendered more fixed and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. A council of regency was appointed to aſſiſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand in the government of the Empire during his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's abſence; which, from the extent of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's dominions, and the multiplicity of his affairs, was an event that might be frequently expected <note n="n" place="bottom">Pont. Heuter. Rer. Auſtr. Lib. viii. c. 11. p. 195. Pſeſſel Abregé Chronol. p. 598.</note>. The ſtate of religion was then taken into conſideration. There were not wanting ſome plauſible reaſons which might
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011837_0483_0F9D87D784CD9570"/>
have induced Charles to have declared himſelf the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of Luther's cauſe, or at leaſt to have connived at its progreſs. If he had poſſeſſed no other dominions but thoſe which belonged to him in Germany, and no other crown beſide the Imperial, he might have been diſpoſed perhaps to favour a man, who aſſerted ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the privileges and immunities for which the Empire had ſtruggled ſo long with the Popes. But the vaſt and dangerous ſchemes which Francis I. was forming againſt him, made it neceſſary for him to regulate his conduct by views more extenſive than thoſe which would have ſuited a German prince; and it being of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to ſecure the Pope's friendſhip, this determined him to treat Luther with great ſeverity, as the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method of ſoothing Leo into a concurrence with his meaſures. His eagerneſs to accompliſh this, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not unwilling to gratify the papal legates in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, who inſiſted that, without any delay or formal deliberation, the diet ought to condemn a man whom the Pope had already excommunicated as an incorrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible heretick. Such an abrupt manner of proceeding, however, being deemed unprecedented and unjuſt by by the members of the diet, they made a point of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's appearing in perſon, and declaring whether he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered or not to thoſe opinions, which had drawn upon him the cenſures of the church <note n="o" place="bottom">P. Mart. Bp. 722.</note>. Not only the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but all the Princes through whoſe territories he had to paſs, granted him a ſafe-conduct; and Charles wrote to him at the ſame time, requiring his immediate atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the diet, and renewing his promiſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from any injury or violence <note n="p" place="bottom">Luth. Oper. ii. 412.</note>. Luther did not heſitate one moment about yielding obedience, and ſet out for Worms, attended by the herald who had bro't the Emperor's letter and ſafe-conduct. While on his journey, many of his friends, whom the fate of Huſs, under ſimilar circumſtances, and notwithſtanding the ſame ſecurity of an Imperial ſafe-conduct, filled with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, adviſed and intreated him not to ruſh wantonly into the midſt of danger. But Luther, ſuperior to ſuch terrors, ſilenced them with this reply, "I am lawfully

called," ſaid he, "to appear in that city, and thither will I go in the name of the Lord, though as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils as there are tiles on the houſes, were there combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me <note n="q" place="bottom">Luth. Oper. ii. 411.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE reception he met with at Worms, was ſuch as he might have reckoned a full reward of all his labours, if vanity and the love of applauſe had been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which he was influenced. Greater crowds aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to behold him, than had appeared at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's publick entry; his apartments were daily filled with princes and perſonages of the higheſt rank <note n="r" place="bottom">Seckend. 156. Luth. Oper. ii. 414.</note>, and he was treated with all the reſpect paid to thoſe who poſſeſs the power of directing the underſtanding and ſentiments of other men; an homage, more ſincere, as well as more flattering, than any which pre-eminence in birth or condition can command. At his appearance before the diet, he behaved with great decency, and with equal firmneſs. He readily acknowledged an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of vehemence and acrimony in his controverſial writings, but refuſed to retract his opinions unleſs he were convinced of their falſhood; or to conſent to their being tried by any other rule than the word of God. When neither threats nor entreaties could prevail on him to depart from this reſolution, ſome of the eccleſiaſtics propoſed to imitate the example of the council of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and by puniſhing the author of this peſtilent he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, who was now in their power, to deliver the church at once from ſuch an evil. But the members of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et refuſing to expoſe the German integrity to freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by a ſecond violation of publick faith; and Charles being no leſs unwilling to bring a ſtain upon the beginning of his adminiſtration by ſuch an ignominious action, Luther was permitted to depart in ſafety <note n="s" place="bottom">F. Paul. Hiſt. of Counc. p. 13. Seckend. 160.</note>. A few days after he left the city, a ſevere edict was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Emperor's name, and by authority of the diet, depriving him as an obſtinate and excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed criminal of all the privileges he enjoyed as a ſubject of the Empire, forbidding any prince to harbour or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, and requiring all to concur in ſeizing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

as ſoon as the term ſpecified in his ſafe-conduct was expired <note n="t" place="bottom">Gold. Conſt. Imperial. ii. 408.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT this rigorous decree had no conſiderable effect, the execution of it being prevented partly by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of occupations which the commotions in Spain, and the wars in Italy and the Low Countries, created to the Emperor; and partly by a prudent precaution em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the elector of Saxony, Luther's faithful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. As Luther, on his return from Worms, was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing near Altenſtein in Thuringia, a number of horſemen in maſks ruſhed ſuddenly out of a wood, where the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had appointed them to lie in wait for him, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding his company, carried him, after diſmiſſing all his attendants, to Wartburg, a ſtrong caſtle not far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. There the Elector ordered him to be ſupplied with every thing neceſſary or agreeable, but the place of his retreat was carefully concealed, until upon a change in the political ſituation of Europe, the fury of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtorm againſt him began to abate. In this ſolitude, where he remained nine months, and which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called his Patmos, after the name of that iſland to which the apoſtle John was baniſhed, he exerted his uſual vigour and induſtry in defence of his doctrines, or in confutation of his adverſaries, publiſhing ſeveral trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, which revived the ſpirit of his followers, aſtoniſhed to a great degree, and diſheartened at the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance of their leader.</p>
                  <p>DURING his confinement, his opinions continued to gain ground, acquiring the aſcendant in almoſt every city of Saxony. At this time, the Auguſtinians of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg, with the approbation of the univerſity, and the connivance of the Elector, ventured upon the firſt ſtep towards an alteration in the eſtabliſhed forms of publick worſhip, by aboliſhing the celebration of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate maſſes, and by giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in adminiſtering the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER conſolation the courage and ſucceſs of his diſciples, or the progreſs of his doctrines in his own country afforded Luther in his retreat, he there received
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011837_0486_0F9D87D973800560"/>
information of two events which conſiderably damped his joy, as they ſeemed to lay inſuperable obſtacles in the way of propagating his principles in the two moſt powerful kingdoms of Europe. One was, a ſolemn decree, condemning his opinions, publiſhed by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Paris, the moſt ancient, and at that time the moſt reſpectable of the learned ſocieties in Europe. The other was, the anſwer written to his book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Babyloniſh captivity by Henry VIII. of England. That young monarch, having been educated under the eye of a ſuſpicious father, who, in order to prevent his attending to buſineſs, kept him occupied in the ſtudy of literature, ſtill retained a greater love of learning, and ſtronger habits of application to it, than are common among Princes of ſo active a diſpoſition, and ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions; and being ambitious of acquiring glory of every kind, as well as zealouſly attached to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, and highly exaſperated againſt Luther, who had treated Thomas Aquinas, his favourite author, with great contempt, he did not think it enough to exert his royal authority in oppoſing the opinions of the reformer, but reſolved likewiſe to combat them with ſcholaſtic weapons. With this view he publiſhed his treatiſe on the Seven Sacraments, which, though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at preſent, as books of controverſy always are, when the occaſion that produced them is paſt, is not deſtitute of polemical ingenuity and acuteneſs, and was repreſented by the flattery of his courtiers to be a work of ſuch wonderful ſcience and learning, as exalted him no leſs above other authors in merit, than he was diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them by his rank. The Pope, to whom it was preſented with the greateſt formality in full conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſpoke of it in ſuch terms, as if it had been dictated by immediate inſpiration; and as a teſtimony of the gratitude of the church for his extraordinary zeal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him the title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation which Henry ſoon forfeited in the opinion of thoſe from whom he derived it, and which is ſtill the title of his ſucceſſors, though the avowed enemies of thoſe opinions, by contending for which he merited that honourable diſtinction. Luther, who was not, overaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by the authority of the Univerſity, or the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011837_0487_0F9D87DA326D4958"/>
of the monarch, ſoon publiſhed his animadverſions on both, in a ſtile no leſs vehement and ſevere than he would have uſed in confuting his meaneſt antagoniſt. This indecent boldneſs, inſtead of ſhocking his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, was conſidered by them as a new proof of his undaunted ſpirit; a controverſy managed by diſputants ſo illuſtrious, drew more general attention; and ſuch was the contagion of the ſpirit of innovation diffuſed through Europe in that age, and ſo powerful the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which accompanied the doctrines of the reformers on their firſt publication, that, in ſpite both of the civil and eccleſiaſtical powers combined againſt them, they daily gained converts both in France and in England.</p>
                  <p>HOWEVER deſirous the Emperor might be to put a ſtop to Luther's progreſs, he was often obliged, during the diet at Worms, to turn his thoughts to matters ſtill more intereſting, and which demanded more immediate attention. A war was ready to break out between him and Francis in Navarre, in the Low-Countries, and in Italy; and it required either great addreſs to avert the danger or timely and wiſe precautions to reſiſt it. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance, at that juncture, inclined Charles to prefer the former meaſure. Spain was torn with inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine commotions. In Italy, he had not hitherto ſecured the aſſiſtance of any one ally. In the Low-Countries, his ſubjects trembled at the thoughts of a rupture with France, the fatal effects of which on their commerce they had often experienced. From theſe conſiderations, as well as from the ſolicitude of Chievres during his whole adminiſtration to maintain peace between the two monarchs, proceeded the Emperor's backwardneſs to commence hoſtilities. But Francis and his miniſters did not breathe the ſame pracific ſpirit. He eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that concord could not long ſubſiſt, where intereſt, emulation, and ambition conſpired to diſſolve it; and he poſſeſſed ſeveral advantages which flattered him with the hopes of ſurpriſing his rival, and of overpowering him before he could put himſelf in a poſture of defence. The French King's dominions, from their compact ſituation, from their ſubjection to the royal authority, from the genius of the people, fond of war, and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their ſovereign by every tie of duty and affection,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011837_0488_0F9D87DAF1957F28"/>
were more capable of a great or ſudden effort, than the larger but diſunited territories of the Emperor, in one part of which the people were in arms againſt his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in all his prerogative was more limited than that of his rival.</p>
                  <p>THE only princes, in whoſe power it was to have kept down, or to have extinguiſhed this flame on its firſt aapearance, either neglected to exert themſelves, or were active in kindling and ſpreading it. Henry VIII. though he affected to aſſume the name of mediator, and both parties made frequent appeals to him, had laid aſide the impartiality which ſuited that character. Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, by his artifices, had eſtranged him ſo entirely from the French King, that he ſecretly fomented the diſcord which he ought to have compoſed, and waited only for ſome decent pretext to join his arms to the Emperor's <note n="a" place="bottom">Herbert. Fiddes's Life of Wolſey, 258.</note>.</p>
                  <p>LEO'S endeavours to excite diſcord between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Francis were more avowed, and had greater influence. Not only his duty, as the common father of Chriſtendom, but his intereſt as an Italian potentate, called upon the Pope to act as the guardian of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic tranquillity, and to avoid any meaſure that might overturn the ſyſtem, which after much bloodſhed, and many negociations, was now eſtabliſhed in Italy. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Leo, who inſtantly diſcerned the propriety of this conduct, had formed a ſcheme upon Charles's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to the Imperial dignity, of rendering himſelf the umpire between the rivals, by ſoothing them alternately, while he entered into no cloſe confederacy with either; and a Pontiff leſs ambitious and enterpriſizing, might have ſaved Europe from many calamities by adhering to this plan. But this high ſpirited prelate, who was ſtill in the prime of life, longed paſſionately to diſtinguiſh his pontificate by ſome ſplendid action. He was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to waſh away the infamy of having loſt Parma and Placentia, the acquiſition of which reflected ſo much luſtre on the adminiſtration of his predeceſſor Julius. He beheld, with the indignation natural to Italians in that age, the dominion which the Tranſalpine, or as they in imitation of the Roman arrogance denominated them,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011837_0489_0F9D87DBB0647938"/>
the barbarous nations, had attained in Italy. He flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf, that after aſſiſting the one monarch to ſtrip the other of his poſſeſſions in that country, he might find means of driving out the victor in his turn, and acquire the glory of reſtoring Italy to the liberty and happineſs it enjoyed before the invaſion of Charles VIII. when every ſtate was governed by its native princes, or its own laws, and unacquainted with a foreign yoke. Extravagant and chimerical as this project may ſeem, it was the favourite object of almoſt every Italian eminent for genius or enterprize during great part of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century; they vainly hoped, that by ſuperior ſkill in the artifices and refinements of negociation, they would be able to baffle the efforts of nations, ruder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than themſelves, but much more powerful and warlike. So alluring was the proſpect of this to Leo, that notwithſtanding the gentleneſs of his diſpoſition, and his fondneſs for the pleaſures of a refined and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eaſe, he haſtened to diſturb the peace of Europe, and to plunge himſelf in a dangerous war, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity ſcarce inferior to that of the turbulent and martial Julius <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. l. 14. p. 173.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IT was in Leo's power, however, to chooſe which of the monarchs he would take for his confederate againſt the other. Both of them courted his friendſhip; he wavered for ſome time between them, and at firſt concluded an alliance with Francis. The object of this treaty was the conqueſt of Naples, which the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates agreed to divide between them. The Pope, it is probable, flattered himſelf that the briſk and active ſpirit of Francis, ſeconded by the ſame qualities in his ſubjects, would get the ſtart of the ſlow and wary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the Emperor, and that they might over-run with eaſe this detached portion of his dominions, ill provided for defence, and always the prey of every invader. But whether the French King, by diſcovering too openly his ſuſpicions of Leo's ſincerity, diſappointed theſe hopes; whether the treaty was only an artifice of the Pope's, to cover the more ſerious negociations he was carrying on with Charles; whether he was enticed by the proſpect of reaping greater advantages
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011837_0490_0F9D87DC70E3DE80"/>
from an union with that prince; or whether he was ſoothed by the zeal which Charles had manifeſted for the honour of the church in condemning Luther; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that he ſoon deſerted his new ally, and made overtures of friendſhip, though with great ſecrecy, to the Emperor <note n="c" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 14. p. 175. Mem. de Bellay, Par. 15. 3. p. 24.</note>. Don John Manuel, the ſame man who had been the favourite of Philip, and whoſe addreſs had diſconcerted all Ferdinand's ſchemes, having been delivered, upon the death of that monarch, from the priſon to which he was confined was now the Imperial ambaſſador at Rome, and fully capable of improving this favourable diſpoſition in the Pope to his maſter's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <note n="d" place="bottom">Jovii Vita Leonis, lib iv p. 89.</note>. To him the conduct of this negociation was entirely committed, and being carefully concealed from Chievres, whoſe averſion from a war with France would have prompted him to retard or defeat it, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance between the Pope and Emperor was quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <note n="e" place="bottom">Guic. l. 14. 181. Mem. de Bellay, p. 24. Du Mor Corps Diplom. tom. iv. ſuppl p. 96.</note>. The chief articles in this treaty, which proved the foundation of Charles's grandeur in Italy, were, that the Pope and Emperor ſhould join their forces to expel the French out of the Milaneſe, the poſſeſſion of which ſhould be granted to Francis Sforza, a ſon of Ludovico the Moor, and who had reſided at Trent ſince the time his brother Maximilian had been diſpoſſeſſed of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions by the French King; that Parma and Placentia ſhould be reſtored to the church; that the Emperor ſhould aſſiſt the Pope in conquering Ferrara; that the annual tribute paid by the kingdom of Naples to the Holy See ſhould be increaſed; that the Emperor ſhould take the family of Medici under his protection; that he ſhould grant to the Cardinal of that name a penſion of ten thouſand ducats upon the archbiſhoprick of Toledo; and ſettle lands in the kingdom of Naples to the ſame value upon Alexander the natural ſon of Lorenzo de Medici.</p>
                  <p>THE tranſacting an affair of ſuch moment without his participation, appeared to Chievres ſo deciſive a proof of his having loſt the aſcendant which he had hitherto
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011837_0491_0F9D87DD306BA528"/>
maintained over the mind of his pupil, that his chagrin on this account, added to the melancholy with which he was overwhelmed on taking a view of the many and unavoidable calamities attending a war againſt France, is ſaid to have ſhortened his days <note n="f" place="bottom">Belcarii Comment. de reb Gallic. 483.</note>. But though this, perhaps, may be only the conjecture of hiſtorians, fond of attributing every thing that befals illuſtrious perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to extraordinary cauſes, and of aſcribing even their diſeaſes and death to the effect of political paſſions, which oftener diſturb the enjoyment than they abridge the period of life, it is certain that his death at this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical juncture extinguiſhed all hopes of avoiding a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with France <note n="g" place="bottom">P. Heuter. Rer. Auſtriac. lib. viii. c 11. p. 197.</note>. This event, too, delivered Charles from a miniſter, to whoſe authority he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed from his infancy to ſubmit with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit deference, as checked and depreſſed his genius, and retained him in a ſtate of pupilage, unbecoming both his years and his rank; but this reſtraint being removed, the native powers of his mind were allowed to unfold themſelves, and he diſplayed ſuch great talents, both in council and in execution, as exceeded the hopes of his contemporaries <note n="h" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 735.</note>, and command the admiration of poſterity.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the Pope and Emperor were preparing, in conſequence of their ſecret alliance, to attack Milan, hoſtilities commenced in another quarter. The children of John d'Albret King of Navarre having often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the reſtitution of their hereditary dominions, in terms of the treaty of Noyon, and Charles having as often eluded their requeſt upon very frivolous pretexts, Francis thought himſelf authorized by that treaty to aſſiſt the exiled family. The juncture appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely favourable for ſuch an enterprize. Charles was at a diſtance from that part of his dominions; the troops uſually ſtationed there had been called away to quell the commotions in Spain; the Spaniſh malecontents warmly ſolicited him to invade Navarre <note n="i" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 721.</note>, in which a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able faction was ready to declare for the deſcendants of

their ancient monarchs. But in order to avoid, as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The conduct of theſe troops was committed to Andrew de Foix, de l'Eſparre, a young nobleman, whom his nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as there was no army in the field to oppoſe him, he became maſter, in a few days, of the whole kingdom of Navarre, without meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any obſtruction but from the citadel of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peluna. The additional works to this fortreſs begun by Ximenes, were ſtill unfiniſhed; nor would its ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance have deſerved notice, if Ignatio Loyola, a Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayan gentleman, had not been dangerouſly wounded in its defence. During the progreſs of a lingering cure, Loyola happened to have no other amuſement than what he found in reading the lives of the ſaints: The effect of this on his mind, naturally enthuſiaſtic, but ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and daring, was to inſpire him with ſuch a deſire of emulating the glory of theſe fabulous worthies of the Romiſh church, as led him into the wildeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant adventures; which terminated at laſt in inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the ſociety of Jeſuits, the moſt political and beſt regulated of all the monaſtic orders, and from which mankind have derived more advantages, and received greater hurt, than from any other of theſe religious fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities.</p>
                  <p>IF, upon the reduction of Pampeluna, L'Eſparre had been ſatisfied with taking proper precautions for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his conqueſt, the kingdom of Navarre might ſtill have remained annexed to the crown of France, in reality as well as in title. But, puſhed on by youthful ardour, and encouraged by Francis, who was too apt to be dazzled with ſucceſs, he ventured to paſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Navarre, and to lay ſiege to Logrogno, a ſmall city in Caſtile. This rouzed the Caſtilians, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beheld the rapid progreſs of his arms with great
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011837_0493_0F9D882A76877518"/>
unconcern; and the diſſenſions in that kingdom being almoſt compoſed, both parties exerted themſelves with emulation in defence of their country; the one that it might efface the memory of paſt miſconduct by their preſent zeal; the other that it might add to the merit of having ſubdued the Emperor's rebellious ſubjects, that of repulſing his foreign enemies. The ſudden advance of their troops, together with the gallant defence made by the inhabitants of Logrogno, obliged the French ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to abandon his raſh enterprize. The Spaniſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which increaſed every day, haraſſing him during his retreat, he, inſtead of taking ſhelter under the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Pampeluna, or waiting the arrival of ſome troops who were marching to join him, attacked the Spaniards, though far ſuperior to him in number, with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, but with ſo little conduct, that his forces were totally routed, he himſelf, together with his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers, were taken priſoners, and Spain recovered poſſeſſion of Navarre in ſtill ſhorter time than the French had ſpent in the conqueſt of it <note n="k" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 21. P. Mart. Ep. 726.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Francis endeavoured to juſtify his invaſion of Navarre, by carrying it on in the name of Henry D'Albret, he had recourſe to an artifice much of the ſame kind, in attacking another part of the Emperor's territories. Robert de la Marck, lord of the ſmall but independent territory of Bouillon, ſituated on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Luxemburg and Champagne, having abandoned Charles's ſervice on account of an encroachment which the Aulic council made on his juriſdiction, and having thrown himſelf upon France for protection, was eaſily perſuaded, in the heat of his reſentment, to ſend a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald to Worms, and to declare war in form againſt the Emperor. Such extravagant inſolence in a petty prince ſurprized Charles, and appeared to him a certain proof of his having received promiſes of powerful ſupport from the French King. The juſtneſs of this concluſion ſoon became evident. Robert with troops levied in France, by the King's connivance, though ſemingly in contradiction to his orders, entered Luxemburg, and after ravaging the open country, laid ſiege to Vireton.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011837_0494_0F9D882C55BC0E70"/>
Of this Charles complained loudly, as a direct violation of the peace ſubſiſting between the two crowns, and ſummoned Henry VIII. in terms of the treaty concluded at London in the year one thouſand five hundred and eighteen, to turn his arms againſt France as the firſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor; and though Francis pretended that he was not anſwerable for Robert's conduct, whoſe army fought under his own ſtandards, and in his own quarrel, and who, contrary to an expreſs prohibition, had ſeduced ſome ſubjects of France into his ſervice; Henry paid ſo little regard to this evaſion, that the French King, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than irritate a prince whom he ſtill hoped to gain, commanded de la Marck to diſband his troops <note n="l" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 22. &amp;c. Mem. de Fleuranges, p. 335, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, meanwhile, was aſſembling an army to chaſtiſe Robert's inſolence. Twenty thouſand men under the Count of Naſſau invaded his little territories, and in a few days became maſters of every place in them but Sedan. After making him feel ſo ſenſibly the weight of his maſter's indignation. Naſſau advanced towards the frontiers of France; and Charles know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he might preſume ſo far on Henry's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in his favour, as not to be over-awed by the ſame fears which had reſtrained Francis, ordered his general to beſiege Mouſon. The cowardice of the garriſon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged the governor to ſurrender almoſt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Naſſau inveſted Mezieres, a place at that time of no conſiderable ſtrength, but ſo advantageouſly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that by getting poſſeſſion of it, the Imperial army might have penetrated into the heart of Champagne, in which there was ſcarce any other town capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing its progreſs. Happily for France, its monarch, ſenſible of the importance of this fortreſs, and of the danger to which it was expoſed, committed the defence of it to the Chevalier Bayard, diſtinguiſhed among his contemporaries by the appellation of <hi>The Knight without fear, and without reproach</hi>

chivalry, poſſeſſed all the talents which form a great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Theſe he had many occaſions of exerting in the defence of Mezieres; partly by his valour, partly by his conduct, he protracted the ſiege to a great length, and in the end obliged the Imperialiſts to raiſe it, with infamy and loſs <note n="n" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 25, &amp;c.</note>. Francis at the head of a numerous army ſoon retook Mouſon, and entering the Low Countries, made ſeveral conqueſts of ſmall importance. In the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Valenciennes, thro' an exceſs of caution, an error with which he cannot be often charged, he loſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of cutting off the whole Imperial army <note n="o" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 747. Mem. de Bellay, 35.</note>; and what was ſtill of more conſequence, he diſguſted the conſtable Bourbon, by giving the command of the van to the duke D'Alencon, though this poſt of honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Bourbon, as a prerogative of his office.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe operations in the field, a congreſs was held at Calais under the mediation of Henry VIII. in order to bring all differences to an amicable iſſue; and if the intentions of the mediator had correſponded in any degree to his profeſſions, it could ſcarce have failed of producing ſome good effect. Henry committed the ſole management of the negociation, with unlimited powers, to Wolſey; and this choice alone was ſufficient to have rendered it abortive. That prelate, bent on at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the papal crown, the great object of his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ready to ſacrifice every thing in order to gain the Emperor's intereſt, was ſo little able to conceal his partiality, that if Francis had not been well acquainted with his haughty and vindictive temper, he would have declined his mediation. Much time was ſpent in inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who had begun hoſtilities, which Wolſey affected to repreſent as the principal point; and by throwing the blame of that on Francis, he hoped to juſtify by the treaty of London, any alliance into which his maſter ſhould enter with Charles. The conditions on which hoſtilities might be terminated, came next to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; but with regard to theſe, the Emperor's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were ſuch as diſcovered either that he was utterly averſe from peace, or that he knew Wolſey would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

Theſe terms, to which an high-ſpirited prince would ſcarce have liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, after the diſaſters of the moſt unfortunate war, Francis rejected with great diſdain; and Charles ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no inclination to comply with the more equal and moderate propoſitions of the French monarch, that he ſhould reſtore Navarre to its lawful prince, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his troops from the ſiege of Tournay, the congreſs broke up without any other effect, than that which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends unſucceſsful negociations, the exaſperating of the parties, whom it was intended to reconcile <note n="p" place="bottom">P.

                  <p>DURING the continuance of the congreſs, Wolſey, on pretence that the Emperor himſelf would be more willing to make reaſonable conceſſions than his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, made an excurſion to Bruges, to meet that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. He was received by Charles, who knew his vanity, with as much reſpect and magnificence as if he had been King of England. But inſtead of advancing the treaty of peace by this interview, Wolſey, in his maſter's name, concluded a league with the Emperor againſt Francis; in which it was ſtipulated, that Charles ſhould invade France on the ſide of Spain, and Henry in Picardy, each with an army of forty thouſand men; and that, in order to ſtrengthen their union, Charles ſhould eſpouſe the Princeſs Mary, Henry's only child, and the apparent heir of his dominions <note n="q" place="bottom">Rymer, Foeder. xiii.

Having once taken this reſolution, his inducements to prefer an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Charles were obvious. He had no claim upon any part of that Prince's dominions, moſt of which were ſo ſituated, that he could not attack them without great difficulty and diſadvantage; whereas ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral maritime provinces of France had been long in the hands of the Engliſh monarchs, whoſe pretenſions, even to the crown of that kingdom, were not altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; and the poſſeſſion of Calais not only gave him eaſy acceſs into ſome of theſe provinces, but afforded him, in caſe of any diſaſter, a ſecure retreat. While Charles attacked France upon one frontier, Henry flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf that he would find little reſiſtance on the other, and that the glory of re-annexing to the crown of England the ancient inheritance of its monarchs on the continent, was reſerved for his reign. Wolſey art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully encouraged theſe vain hopes, which led his maſter into ſuch meaſures as were moſt ſubſervient to his own ſecret ſchemes; and the Engliſh, whoſe hereditary ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt the French was apt to rekindle on every occaſion, did not diſapprove of the martial ſpirit of their ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the league between the Pope and the Emperor produced great effects in Italy, and rendered Lombardy the chief theatre of war. There was, at that time, ſuch contrariety between the character of the French and Italians, that the latter ſubmitted to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the former with greater impatience, than they expreſſed under the dominion of other foreigners. The phlegm of the Germans and gravity of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, ſuited their jealous temper and ceremonious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners better than the French gaiety, too prone to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and too little attentive to decorum.

however, by the equity and gentleneſs of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and by granting the Milaneſe more extenſive privileges than they had enjoyed under their native princes, had overcome, in a great meaſure, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and reconciled them to the French government. Francis on recovering that dutchy, did not imitate the example of his predeceſſor; and though too generous himſelf to oppreſs his people, his confidence in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and his negligence in examining into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe whom he entruſted with power, embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to venture upon many acts of oppreſſion. The government of Milan was committed by him to Odet de Foix, Marechal de Lautrec, another brother of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Chateaubriand, an officer of great experience and reputation, but haughty, imperious, rapacious and incapable either of liſtening to advice, or bearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. His inſolence and exactions totally alienated the affections of the Milaneſe from France, drove many of the conſiderable citizens into baniſhment, and forced others to retire for their own ſafety. Among the laſt was Jerome Meronè, vice-chancellor of Milan, a man whoſe genius for intrigue and enterprize diſtinguiſhed him in an age and country, where violent factions, as well as frequent revolutions, affording great ſcope for ſuch talents, produced or called them forth in great abundance. He repaired to Francis Sforza, whoſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maximilian he had betrayed; and ſuſpecting the Pope's intention of attacking the Milaneſe, although his treaty with the Emperor was not yet made publick, propoſed to him in the name of Sforza, a ſcheme for ſurprizing ſeveral places in that dutchy, by means of the exiles, who, from hatred to the French, and from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their former maſters, were ready for any deſperate attempt. Leo not only encouraged the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but advanced a conſiderable ſum towards the execution of it; and when through unforeſeen accidents it failed of ſucceſs in every part, he allowed the exiles who had aſſembled in a body, to retire to Reggio, which belonged at that time to the church. The Marechal de Foix, who commanded at Milan in abſence of his brother Lautrec, who was then in France, tempted with the hopes of catching at once as in a ſnare, all the

But the vigilance and good conduct of Guicciardini the hiſtorian, governor of that place, obliged the French general to abandon the enterprize with diſgrace <note n="a" place="bottom">Guic. lib. xiv. 183. Mem. de Bellay, p. 38, &amp;c.</note>. Leo, on receiving this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, with which he was highly pleaſed, as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him a decent pretext for a rupture with France, immediately aſſembled the conſiſtory of Cardinals, and complaining bitterly of the hoſtile intentions of the French King, and magnifying the Emperor's zeal for the church, of which he had given a recent proof by his proceedings againſt Luther, declared that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in ſelf-defence, and as the only expedient for the ſecurity of the eccleſiaſtical ſtate to join his arms to thoſe of that prince. For this purpoſe, he now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to conclude a treaty with Don John Manuel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it had been ſigned ſome months before this time; and he publickly excommunicated De Foix, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious invader of St. Peter's patrimony.</p>
                  <p>LEO had already begun preparations for war by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into pay a conſiderable body of Swiſs; but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial troops advanced ſo ſlowly from Naples and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, that it was the middle of autumn before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my took the field under the command of Proſper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna, the moſt eminent of the Italian generals, whoſe long experience and extreme caution were oppoſed with great propriety to the impetuoſity of the French. In the mean time, De Foix diſpatched courier after cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to inform the King of the danger which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. Francis, whoſe forces were either employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Low-Countries, or aſſembling on the frontiers of Spain, and who did not expect ſo ſudden an attack in that quarter, ſent ambaſſadors to his allies the Swiſs, to procure from them the immediate levy of an additional body of troops; and commanded Lautrec to repair forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to his government. That general who was well acquainted with the great neglect of oeconomy in the adminiſtration of the King's finances, and who knew how much the troops in the Milaneſe had already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

from the want of their pay, refuſed to ſet out, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſum of three hundred thouſand crowns was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put into his hands. But the King, Louiſe of Savoy, his mother, and Semblancay, the ſuperintendant of finances, having promiſed, even with an oath, that on his arrival at Milan he ſhould find remittances for the ſum which he demanded; upon the faith of this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Unhappily for France, Louiſe, a woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, vindictive, rapacious, and capable of ſacrificing any thing to the gratification of her paſſions, but who had acquired an abſolute aſcendant over her ſon by her maternal tenderneſs, her care of his education, and her great abilities, was reſolved not to perform this promiſe. Lautrec having incurred her diſpleaſure by his haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in neglecting to pay court to her, and by the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with which he talked concerning ſome of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in gallantry, ſhe, in order to deprive him of the honour which he might have gained by a ſucceſsful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Milaneſe, ſeized the three hundred thouſand crowns deſtined for that ſervice, and detained them for her own uſe.</p>
                  <p>LAUTREC, notwithſtanding this cruel diſappointment, found means to aſſemble a conſiderable army, though far inferior in number to that of the confederates. He adopted the plan of defence moſt ſuitable to his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, avoiding a pitched battle with the greateſt care, while he haraſſed the enemy continually with his light troops, beat up their quarters, intercepted their convoys, and covered or relieved every place which they attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack. By this prudent conduct, he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded their progreſs, but would have ſoon wearied out the Pope, who had hitherto defrayed almoſt the whole expence of the war, as the Emperor, whoſe revenues in Spain were diſſipated during the commotions in that country, and who was obliged to ſupport a numerous army in the Netherlands, could not make any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable remittances into Italy. But an unforeſeen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſconcerted all his meaſures, and occaſioned a fatal reverſe in the French affairs, A body of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Swiſs ſerved in their army under the banners of the republick, with which France was in alliance.

The Cardinal of Sion, who ſtill preſerved his intereſt among his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and his enmity to France, having prevailed on them to permit a levy of this kind, twelve thouſand Swiſs joined the army of the confederates. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, when they ſaw ſo many of their countrymen march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under hoſtile ſtandards, and ready to deſtroy each other, became ſenſible of the infamy to which they would be expoſed, as well as the loſs they might ſuffer, and diſpatched couriers, commanding them to leave both armies, and to return into their own country. The Cardinal of Sion, however, had the addreſs, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the meſſengers appointed to carry this order, to prevent its being delivered to the Swiſs in the ſervice of the confederates; but being intimated in due form to thoſe in the French army, they, fatigued with the length of the campaign, and murmuring for want of pay, inſtantly yielded obedience in ſpite of Lautrec's remonſtrances and intreaties.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the deſertion of a body which formed the ſtrength of his army, Lautrec durſt no longer face the confederates; and turning towards Milan, encamped on the banks of the Adda, and placed his chief hopes of ſafety in preventing the enemy from paſſing the river; an expedient for defending a country ſo precarious, that their are few examples of its being employed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt any general of experience or abilities. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Colonna, notwithſtanding Lautrec's vigilance and activity, paſſed the Adda with little loſs, and obliged him to ſhut himſelf up within the walls of Milan, which the confederates were preparing to beſiege, when an unknown perſon, who never afterwards appeared either to boaſt of this ſervice, or to claim a reward for it, came from the city and acquainted Morone, that if the army would advance that night, the Ghibelline or Imperial faction would put them in poſſeſſion of one of the gates. Colonna, though no friend to raſh enterprizes, allowed
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011837_0502_0F9D8832B568C290"/>
the Marquis de Peſcara to advance with the Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and he himſelf followed with the reſt of his troops. About the beginning of night, Peſcara arriving at the Roman gate in the ſuburbs, ſurprized the ſoldiers whom he found there; thoſe poſted in the fortifications adjoining to it, immediately fled; the Marquis, ſeizing the works which they abandoned, and puſhing forward inceſſantly, though with no leſs caution than vigour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter of the city with little bloodſhed, and almoſt without reſiſtance; the victors being as much aſtoniſhed as the vanquiſhed at the facility and ſucceſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Lautrec retired precipitately towards the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian territories with the remains of his ſhattered army the cities of the Milaneſe following the fate of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſurrendered to the confederates; Parma and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia were united to the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and of their conqueſts in Lombardy, only the town of Cremona, the caſtle of Milan, and a few inconſiderable forts remained in the hands of the French <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. l. xiv. 190, &amp;c.

                  <p>LEO received the accounts of this rapid ſucceſſion of proſperous events with ſuch tranſports of joy, as brought on (if we may believe the French hiſtorians) a ſlight fever, which being neglected, occaſioned his death on the ſecond of December, while he was ſtill of a vigorous age, and at the height of his glory. By this unexpected accident, the ſpirit of the confederacy was broken, and its operations ſuſpended. The Cardinals of Sion and Medici left the army that they might be preſent in the conclave; the Swiſs were recalled by their ſuperiors; ſome other mercenaries diſbanded for want of pay; and only the Spaniards, and a few Germans in the Emperor's ſervice, remained to defend the Milaneſe. But Lautrec, deſtitute both of men and of money, was unable to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this favourable opportunity in the manner he would have wiſhed. The vigilance of Morone, and the good conduct of Colonna, diſappointed his feeble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts on the Milaneſe; and Guicciardini, by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and valour, repulſed a bolder and more dangerous attack which he made on Parma <note n="c" place="bottom">Guic. l. xiv. 214.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="unknown:011837_0503_0F9D8833736ADB68"/>MEANWHILE great diſcord prevailed in the conclave, which followed upon Leo's death, and all the arts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to men grown old in intrigue, when contending for a prize ſo valuable, were practiſed. Wolſey's name, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Emperor's magnificent promiſes to favour his pretenſions, of which that prelate did not fail to remind him, was ſcarce mentioned in the conclave. Julio Cardinal de Medici, Leo's nephew, who was more eminent than any other member of the ſacred college for his abilities, his wealth, and his experience in tranſacting great affairs, had already ſecured fifteen voices, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſufficient, according to the forms of the conclave, to exclude any other candidate, though not to carry his own election. All the old Cardinals combined againſt him, without being united in favour of any other perſon. While theſe factions were endeavouring to gain, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or to weary out each other, Medici and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents voted one morning at the ſcrutiny, which according to form was made every day, for Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht, who at that time governed Spain in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's name. This they did merely to protract time; but the adverſe party inſtantly cloſing with them, to their own amazement and that of all Europe, a ſtranger to Italy, unknown to the perſons who gave their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages in his favour, and unacquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, or the intereſt of the ſtate, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of which they conferred upon him, was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly raiſed to the papal throne, at a juncture ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and critical, as would have demanded all the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and experience of one of the moſt able prelates in the ſacred college. The Cardinals themſelves, unable to give a reaſon for this ſtrange choice, on account of which, as they marched in proceſſion from the conclave, they were loaded with inſults and curſes by the Roman people, aſcribed it to an immediate impulſe of the Holy Ghoſt. It may be imputed with greater certainty to the influence of Don John Manuel, the Imperial ambaſſador, who by his addreſs and intrigues facilitated the election of a perſon devoted to his maſter's ſervice, from grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, from intereſt, and from inclination <note n="d" place="bottom">Ger.

                     <pb n="96" facs="unknown:011837_0504_0F9D883433F6B048"/>BESIDES the influence which Charles acquired by Adrian's promotion, it threw great luſtre on his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. To beſtow on his preceptor ſuch a noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and to place on the papal throne a creature whom he had raiſed, were acts of uncommon magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and power. Francis obſerved, with the ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a rival, the pre-eminence which he was gaining, and reſolved to exert himſelf with freſh vigour, in order to wreſt from him his late conqueſts in Italy. The Swiſs, in order to make ſome reparation to the French King, for having ſo unſeaſonably withdrawn their troops from his army, which had occaſioned the loſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe, permitted him to levy ten thouſand men in the republick. Together with this reinforcement, Lautrec received from the King a ſmall ſum in money, which enabled him once more to take the field, and after ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſurprize, or force, ſeveral places in the Milaneſe, to advance within a few miles of the capital. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate army was in no condition to obſtruct his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and though the inhabitants of Milan, inflamed by the artifices of Morone, and by the popular declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a monk whom he employed, with the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic zeal againſt the French government, conſented to raiſe extraordinary contributions, Colonna muſt ſoon have abandoned the advantageous camp he had choſen at Bicocca, and have diſmiſſed his troops for want of pay, if the Swiſs in the French ſervice had not once more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated him out of his difficulties.</p>
                  <p>THE inſolence and caprice of that people were often no leſs fatal to their friends, than their valour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline were formidable to their enemies. Having now ſerved two months without pay, of which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained loudly, a ſum deſtined for their uſe was ſent from France under a convoy of horſe; but Morone, whoſe vigilant eye nothing eſcaped, poſted a body of troops in their way, ſo that thoſe who eſcorted the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney durſt not advance. On receiving intelligence of this, the Swiſs loſt all patience, and officers as well as ſoldiers crowding around Lautrec, threatened with one voice inſtantly to retire, if he did not either advance the pay which was due, or promiſe to lead them next morning to battle. In vain did Lautrec remonſtrate
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011837_0505_0F9D8834F0EBDD60"/>
againſt theſe demands, repreſenting to them the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the former, and the raſhneſs of the latter, which muſt be attended with certain deſtruction, as the enemy occupied a camp naturally of great ſtrength, and which by art they had rendered almoſt inacceſſible. The Swiſs, deaf to reaſon, and perſuaded that their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was capable of ſurmounting every obſtactle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their demand with greater fierceneſs, offering themſelves to form the van-guard, and to begin the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. Lautrec, unable to overcome their obſtinacy, complied with their requeſt, hoping, perhaps, that ſome of thoſe unforeſeen accidents which ſo often determine the fate of battles, might crown this raſh enterprize with undeſerved ſucceſs; and convinced that the effects of a defeat could not be more fatal than thoſe which would certainly follow upon the retreat of a body which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one half of his army. Next morning the Swiſs were early in the field, and marched with the greateſt int e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity againſt an enemy deeply entrenched on every ſide, ſurrounded with artillery, and prepared to receive them. As they advanced, they ſuſtained a furious cannonade with great firmneſs, and without waiting for their own artillery, ruſhed impetuouſly upon the intrenchments. But after incredible efforts of valour, ſeconded with great ſpirit by the French, having loſt their braveſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and beſt troops, and finding that they could make no impreſſion on the enemy's works, they ſounded a retreat; leaving the field of battle, however, like men repulſed, but not vanquiſhed, in cloſe array, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any moleſtation from the enemy.</p>
                  <p>NEXT day, ſuch as ſurvived ſet out for their own country; and Lautrec, deſpairing of being able to make any farther reſiſtance, retired into France, after throwing garriſons into Cremona, and a few other places; all which, except the citadel of Cremona, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna ſoon obliged to ſurrender.</p>
                  <p>GENOA, however, and its territories, remaining ſubject to France, ſtill gave Francis conſiderable footing in Italy, and made it eaſy for him to execute any ſcheme for the recovery of the Milaneſe. But Colonna, rendered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing by continual ſucceſs, and excited by the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of the faction of the Adorni, the hereditary

enemies of the Fregoſi, who under the protection of France poſſeſſed the chief authority in Genoa, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to attempt the reduction of that ſtate; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it with amazing facility.

                  <p>SUCH a cruel ſucceſſion of misfortunes affected Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis with deep concern, which was not a little augmented by the unexpected arrival of an Engliſh herald, who, in the name of his ſovereign, declared war in form againſt France. This ſtep was taken in conſequence of the treaty Wolſey had concluded with the Emperor at Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and which had hitherto been kept ſecret. Francis, though he had reaſon to be ſurprized with this denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, after having been at ſuch pains to ſooth Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and to gain his miniſter, received the herald with great compoſure and dignity<note n="f" place="bottom">Journal de Louiſe de Savoie, p. 199.</note>; and without abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the ſchemes he was forming againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, began vigorous preparations for reſiſting this new enemy. His treaſury, however, being exhauſted by the efforts which he had already made, as well as by the ſums he expended on his pleaſures, he had recourſe to extraordinary expedients for ſupplying it. Several new offices were created, and expoſed to ſale; the royal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes were alienated; unuſual taxes were impoſed; and the tomb of St. Martin was ſtripped of a rail of maſſive ſilver, with which Lewis XI. in one of his fits of devotion, had encircled it. By means of theſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients he was enabled to levy a conſiderable army, and to put the frontier towns in a good poſture of defence.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, meanwhile, was no leſs ſolicitous to draw as much advantage as poſſible from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſuch a powerful ally; and the proſperous ſituation of his affairs, at this time, permitting him to ſet out for Spain, where his preſence was extremely neceſſary, he viſited the court of England in his way to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011837_0507_0F9D883675802EA8"/>
that country. He propoſed by this interview not only to ſtrengthen the bonds of friendſhip which united him and Henry, and to excite him to puſh the war againſt France with vigour, but hoped to remove any diſguſt or reſentment Wolſey might have conceived on account of the cruel diſappointment which he had met with in the late conclave. His ſucceſs exceeded his moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations; and by his artful addreſs, during a reſidence of ſix weeks in England, he gained not only the King and the Miniſter, but the nation itſelf. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whoſe vanity was ſenſibly flattered by ſuch a viſit, as well as by the ſtudied reſpect with which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror treated him on every occaſion, entered warmly into all his ſchemes. The Cardinal, foreſeeing from Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's age and infirmities, a ſudden vacancy in the papal ſee, diſſembled or forgot his reſentment; and as Charles augmented the penſions which he had already ſettled on him, and renewed his promiſe of favouring his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the papacy, with all his intereſt, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to merit the former, and to ſecure the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter, by freſh ſervices. The nation, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the glory of its monarch, and pleaſed with the confidence which the Emperor placed in the Engliſh by creating the Earl of Surrey, his High-Admiral, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no leſs inclination to commence hoſtilities than Henry himſelf.</p>
                  <p>IN order to give Charles, before he left England, a proof of this general ardour, Surrey ſailed with ſuch forces as were ready, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

pitched battle with the utmoſt care, and to endeavour, by throwing garriſons into every place capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, by watching all the enemy's motions, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting their convoys, attacking their advanced poſts, and haraſſing them continually with their numerous cavalry, to ruin them with the length of the war, or to beat them by piece-meal. This plan the duke of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the French general in Picardy, purſued with no leſs prudence than ſucceſs; and not only prevented Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey from taking any town of importance, but obliged him to retire with his army greatly reduced by fatigue, by want of proviſions, and by the loſs it had ſuſtained in ſeveral unſucceſsful ſkirmiſhes.</p>
                  <p>THUS ended the ſecond campaign, in a war the moſt general that hitherto had been kindled in Europe; and though Francis by his mother's ill-timed reſentment, by the diſguſting inſolence of his general, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price of the mercenary troops he employed, had loſt his conqueſts in Italy, yet all the powers combined againſt him had not been able to make any impreſſion on his hereditary dominions; and wherever they either intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or attempted an attack, he was well prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the Chriſtian Princes were thus waſting each others ſtrength, Solyman the Magnificent, entered Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary with a numerous army, and inveſting Belgrade, which was deemed the chief barrier of that kingdom againſt the Turkiſh arms, ſoon forced it to ſurrender. Encouraged by this ſucceſs, he turned his victorious arms againſt the iſland of Rhodes, the ſeat, at that time, of the Knights of St. John of Jeruſalem. This ſmall ſtate he attacked with ſuch a numerous army, as the Lords of Aſia have been accuſtomed in every age to bring into the field. Two hundred thouſand men, and a fleet of four hundred ſail appeared againſt a town de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by a garriſon conſiſting of five thouſand ſoldiers, and ſix hundred Knights, under the command of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers de L'iſle Adam, the Grand Maſter, whoſe wiſdom and valour rendered him worthy of that ſtation at ſuch a dangerous juncture. No ſooner did he begin to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the deſtination of Solyman's vaſt armaments, than he diſpatched meſſengers to all the Chriſtian courts, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring

their aid againſt the common enemy. But though every Prince in that age, acknowledged Rhodes to be the great bulwark of Chriſtendom in the eaſt, and truſted to the gallantry of its Knights as the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt the progreſs of the Ottoman arms; and though Adrian, with a zeal which became the head and father of the church, exhorted the contending powers, to forget their private quarrels, and by uniting their arms, to prevent the Infidels from deſtroying a ſociety which did honour to the Chriſtian name; yet ſo violent and implacable was the animoſity of both parties, that, regardleſs of the danger to which they expoſed all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and unmoved by the intreaties of the Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or the admonitions of the Pope, they ſuffered So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman, without diſturbance, to carry on his operations againſt Rhodes. The Grand Maſter, after incredible efforts of courage, of patience, and of military conduct during a ſiege of ſix months; after ſuſtaining many aſſaults, and diſputing every poſt with amazing obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was obliged at laſt to yield to numbers, and having obtained an honourable capitulation from the Sultan, who admired and reſpected his virtue, he ſurrendered the town, which was reduced to a heap of rubbiſh, and deſtitute of every reſource <note n="g" place="bottom">Fontanus de Bello Rhodio ap.

                  <p>CHARLES, having had the ſatiſfaction of ſeeing hoſtilities begun between France and England, took leave of Henry, and arrived in Spain on the ſeventeenth of June. He found that country juſt beginning to recover order and ſtrength after the miſeries of a civil war to which it had been expoſed during his abſence; an account of the riſe and progreſs of which, as it was but little connected with the other events that happened in Europe, hath been reſerved to this place.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner was it known that the Cortes aſſembled in Galicia had voted the Emperor a <hi>free-gift,</hi> without obtaining the redreſs of any grievance, than it excited univerſal indignation. The citizens of Toledo, who conſidered themſelves, on account of the great privileges which they enjoyed, as guardians of the liberties of the Caſtilian commons, finding that no regard was paid to the remonſtrances of their deputies againſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional grant, took arms with tumultuary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſeizing the gates of the city which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, attacked the al-cazar, or caſtle, which they ſoon obliged the governor to ſurrender. Emboldened by

this ſucceſs, they deprived of all authority every perſon whom they ſuſpected of any attachment to the court, eſtabliſhed a popular form of government, compoſed of deputies from the ſeveral pariſhes in the city, and levied troops in their own defence. The chief leader of the people in theſe inſurrections was Don John de Padilla, the eldeſt ſon of the commendador of Caſtile, a young nobleman of a generous temper, of undaunted courage, and poſſeſſed of the talents as well as of the ambition which in times of civil diſcord raiſe men to power and eminence<note n="a" place="bottom">Sandov. p. 77.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE reſentment of the citizens of Segovia produced effects ſtill more fatal. Tordeſillas, one of their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in the late Cortes, had voted for the donative; and being a bold and haughty man, ventured, upon his return, to call together his fellow citizens in the great church, that he might give them, according to cuſtom, an account of his conduct in that aſſembly. But the multitude, unable to bear his inſolence, in attempting to juſtify what they thought inexcuſable, burſt open the gates of the church with the utmoſt fury, and ſeizing the unhappy Tordeſillas, dragged him through the ſtreets, with a thouſand curſes and inſults, towards the place of publick execution. In vain did the dean and canons come forth in proceſſion with the holy ſacrame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, in order to appeaſe their rage. In vain did the monks of thoſe monaſteries by which they paſſed, conjure them on their knees to ſpare his life, or at leaſt to allow him time to confeſs, and to receive abſolution of his ſins. Without liſtening to the dictates either of humanity or of religion, they cried out, "That the hangman alone could ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſuch a traitor to his country," hurried him along with greater violence, and finding that he had expired under their hands, they hung him up with his head downward on the common gibbet <note n="b" place="bottom">P. Martyr. Ep. 671.</note>. The ſame ſpirit ſeized the inhabitants of Burgos, Zamora, and ſeveral other cities; and though their repreſentatives, taking warning from the fate of Tordeſillas, had been ſo wiſe as to ſave themſelves by a timely flight, they were burnt in effigy, their houſes razed to the ground, and their

P. Mart. Ep. 674.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ADRIAN, at that time regent of Spain, had ſcarce fixed the ſeat of his government at Valladolid, when he was alarmed with an account of theſe inſurrections. He immediately aſſembled the council to deliberate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper method of ſuppreſſing them. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors differed in opinion; ſome inſiſting it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to check this audacious ſpirit in its infancy by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere execution of juſtice; others adviſing to treat with lenity a people who had ſome reaſon to be incenſed, and not to drive them beyond all the bounds of duty by an ill-timed rigour. The ſentiments of the former being warmly ſupported by the archbiſhop of Granada, preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the council, a perſon of great authority, but cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick and impetuous, were approved of by Adrian, whoſe zeal to ſupport his maſter's authority hurried him into a meaſure, to which, from his natural caution and timidity, he would otherwiſe have been averſe. He commanded Ronquillo, one of the King's judges, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair inſtantly to Segovia, which had ſet the firſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of mutiny, and to proceed againſt the delinquents according to law; and leſt the people ſhould be ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous as to reſiſt his authority, a conſiderable body of troops was appointed to attend him. The Segovians, foreſeeing what they might expect from a judge ſo well known for his auſtere and unforgiving temper, took arms with one conſent, and having muſtered twelve thouſand men, ſhut their gates againſt him. Ronquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, enraged at this inſult, denounced them rebels and outlaws; and his troops ſeizing all the avenues to the town, hoped that it would ſoon be obliged to ſurrender for want of proviſions. The inhabitants, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves with vigour, and having received a conſiderable reinforcement from Toledo, under the command of Padilla, attacked Ronquillo, and forced him to retire, with the loſs of his baggage and military cheſt <note n="d" place="bottom">Sandov. 112. P. Mart. Ep. 679. Miniana, Contin. p. 15.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:011837_0513_0F9D883AF1020D10"/>UPON this Adrian ordered Antonio de Fonſeca, whom the Emperor had appointed commander in chief of the forces in Spain, to aſſemble an army, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege the city in form. But the inhabitants of Medina del Campo, where Cardinal Ximenes had eſtabliſhed a vaſt magazine of military ſtores, would not ſuffer him to draw from it a train of battering cannon, or to deſtroy their countrymen with thoſe arms which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared againſt the enemies of the kingdom. Fonſeca, who could not execute his orders without artillery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſeize the magazine by force, and the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſtanding on their defence, he aſſaulted the town with great briſkneſs: But his troops were ſo warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that deſpairing of carrying the place, he ſet fire to ſome of the houſes, in hopes that the citizens would abandon the walls in order to ſave their families and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Inſtead of that, the expedient to which he had recourſe ſerved only to increaſe their fury, and he was repulſed with great infamy, while the flames ſpreading from ſtreet to ſtreet, reduced to aſhes almoſt the whole town, one of the moſt conſiderable at that time in Spain, and the great mart for the manufactures of Segovia, and ſeveral other cities. As the warehouſes were then filled with goods for the approaching fair, the loſs was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and was felt univerſally; and this, added to the impreſſion which ſuch a cruel action made on people long unaccuſtomed to the horrors of civil war, enraged the Caſtilians almoſt to madneſs. Fonſeca became the object of general indignation, and was branded with the name of incendiary and enemy to his country; and even the citizens of Valladolid, whom the preſence of the Cardinal had hitherto reſtrained, declared that they could no longer remain inactive ſpectators of the ſufferings of their countrymen, and taking arms with no leſs fury than the other cities, they burnt Fonſeca's houſe to the ground, elected new magiſtrates, raiſed ſoldiers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officers to command them, and guarded their walls with as much diligence, as if an enemy had been ready to attack them.</p>
                  <p>THE Cardinal, who though virtuous and diſintereſted, and capable of governing the kingdom with honour in times of tranquillity, poſſeſſed neither the courage nor
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011837_0514_0F9D883BB5E4DC18"/>
ſagacity neceſſary at ſuch a dangerous juncture, finding himſelf unable to check theſe outrages committed under his own eye, attempted to appeaſe the people, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that Fonſeca had exceeded his orders, and had by his raſh conduct offended him, as much as he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them. This condeſcenſion, the effect of irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and timidity, rendered the malecontents bolder and more inſolent; and the Cardinal having ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called Fonſeca, and diſmiſſed his troops, which he could no longer afford to pay, as the treaſury had been drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rapaciouſneſs of the Flemiſh miniſters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no ſupply from the great cities which were all in arms, the people were left at full liberty to act without controul, and ſcarce any ſhadow of power remained in his hands.</p>
                  <p>NOR were the proceedings of the commons the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects merely of popular and tumultuary rage; they aimed at obtaining redreſs of their political grievances, and an eſtabliſhment of publick liberty on a ſecure ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, objects worthy of all the zeal they diſcovered in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for them. The feudal government in Spain, was at that time in a ſtate more favourable to liberty than in any other of the great European kingdoms. This was owing chiefly to the number of great cities in that country, a circumſtance of which I have already taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and which contributes more than any other to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the rigour of the feudal inſtitutions, and to introduce a more liberal and equal form of government. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of every city formed a great corporation with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable immunities and privileges; they were admitted to a conſiderable ſhare in the legiſlature; they acquired the arts of induſtry, without which cities cannot ſubſiſt; they accumulated wealth, by engaging in commerce; and being free and independent themſelves, were the guardians of the publick freedom and independence. The genius of the internal government eſtabliſhed in cities, which, even in countries where deſpotic power prevails moſt, is democratical and republican, rendered the idea of liberty familiar and dear to them. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives in the Cortes were accuſtomed to check with equal ſpirit the encroachments of the King, and the oppreſſion of the nobles. They endeavoured to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011837_0515_0F9D883C71265DF0"/>
extend the privileges of their own order; they laboured to ſhake off the remaining encumbrances with which the feudal tyranny had burdened them; and conſcious of being one of the moſt conſiderable orders in the ſtate, were ambitious of becoming the moſt powerful.</p>
                  <p>THE preſent juncture appeared favourable for puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any new claim. Their Sovereign was abſent from his dominions; by the ill conduct of his miniſters he had loſt the eſteem and affection of his ſubjects; the people exaſperated by many injuries, had taken up arms, though without concert, almoſt by general conſent; they were animated with fury capable of carrying them to the moſt violent extremes; the royal treaſury was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; the kingdom deſtitute of troops; and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment committed to a ſtranger, of great virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but of abilities unequal to ſuch a truſt. The firſt care of Padilla, and the other popular leaders who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and determined to improve theſe circumſtances, was to eſtabliſh ſome form of union or aſſociation among the malecontents, that they might act with greater regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and purſue one common end; and as the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cities had been prompted to take arms by the ſame motives, and were accuſtomed to conſider themſelves as a diſtinct body from the reſt of the ſubjects, they did not find this difficult. A general convention was appointed to be held at Avila. Deputies appeared there in name of almoſt all the cities intitled to have repreſentatives in the Cortes. They all bound themſelves by ſolemn oath, to live and die in the ſervice of the King, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the privileges of their order; and aſſuming the name of the holy <hi>Junta</hi> or aſſociation, proceeded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate concerning the ſtate of the nation, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per method of redreſſing its grievances. The firſt that naturally preſented itſelf, was the nomination of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner to be regent; this, they declared with one voice to be a violation of the fundamental laws of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and reſolved to ſend a deputation of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Adrian, requiring him in their name to lay aſide all the enſigns of his office, and to abſtain for the future from the exerciſe of a juriſdiction which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced illegal <note n="k" place="bottom">P.

                     <pb n="108" facs="unknown:011837_0516_0F9D883D38B73DC8"/>WHILE they were preparing to execute this bold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Padilla accompliſhed an enterprize of the greateſt advantage to the cauſe. After relieving Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, he marched ſuddenly to Tordeſillas, the place where the unhappy Queen Joanna had reſided ſince the death of her huſband, and being favoured by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, was admitted into the town, and became maſter of her perſon, for the ſecurity of which Adrian had neglected to take proper precautions <note n="l" place="bottom">Vita dell. Imper. Carl. V. dall. Alf. Ulloa Ven. 1509. p. 67. Miniana. Contin. p. 17.</note>. Padilla waited immediately upon the Queen, and accoſting her with that profound reſpect, which ſhe exacted from the few perſons whom ſhe deigned to admit into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, acquainted her at large with the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Caſtilian ſubjects under the government of her ſon, who being deſtitute of experience himſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his foreign miniſters to treat them with ſuch rigour, as had obliged them to take arms in defence of the liberties of their country. The Queen, as if ſhe had been awakened out of a lethargy, expreſſed great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at what he ſaid, and told him, that as ſhe had never heard till that moment of the death of her father, or known the ſufferings of her people, no blame could be imputed to her, but that now ſhe would take care to provide a ſufficient remedy; and in the mean time, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe, let it be your concern to do what is neceſſary for the public welfare. Padilla, too eager in forming a concluſion agreeable to his wiſhes, miſtook this lucid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of reaſon for a perfect return of that faculty; and acquainting the Junta with what had happened, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to remove to Tordeſillas, and to hold their meetings in that place. This was inſtantly done; but though Joanna received very graciouſly an addreſs of the Junta, beſeeching her to take upon her the government of the kingdom, and in token of her compliance, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all the deputies to kiſs her hand; though ſhe was preſent at a tournament held on that occaſion, and ſeemed highly ſatisfied with both theſe ceremonies, which were conducted with great magnificence in order to pleaſe her, ſhe ſoon relapſed into her former melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and fullenneſs, and could never be brought by
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:011837_0517_0F9D883DF4D23780"/>
any arguments or intreaties, to ſign any one paper ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards the diſpatch of buſineſs <note n="m" place="bottom">Sandov. 164. P. Mart. Ep. 685, 686.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Junta concealing as much as poſſible this laſt circumſtance, carried on all their deliberations in her name; and as the Caſtilians, who idolized the memory of Iſabella, retained a wonderful attachment to her daughter, no ſooner was it known that ſhe had conſented to aſſume the reigns of government, than the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the moſt univerſal and immoderate joy; and believing her recovery to be compleat, aſcribed it to a miraculous interpoſition of heaven, in order to reſcue their country from the oppreſſion of foreigners. The Junta, conſcious of the reputation and power they had acquired by ſeeming to act under the royal authority, were no longer ſatisfied with requiring Adrian to reſign the office of regent, they detached Padilla to Valado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid with a conſiderable body of troops, ordering him to ſeize ſuch members of the council as were ſtill in that city, to conduct them to Tordeſillas, and to bring away the ſeals of the kingdom, the public archieves and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury books. Padilla, who was received by the citizens, as the deliverer of his country, executed his commiſſion with great exactneſs; permitting Adrian, however, ſtill to reſide in Valadolid, though only as a private perſon, and without any ſhadow of power <note n="n" place="bottom">Sandov. 174. P. Mart. Ep. 791.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, to whom frequent accounts of theſe tranſactions were tranſmitted while he was ſtill in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was ſenſible of his own imprudence and that of his miniſters in having deſpiſed too long the murmurs and remonſtrances of the Caſtilians. He beheld, with deep concern, a kingdom the moſt valuable of any he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and in which lay the ſtrength and ſinews of his power, juſt ready to diſown his authority, and on the point of being plunged in all the miſeries of civil war. But though his preſence might have averted this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, he could not at that time, viſit Spain without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the imperial crown, and allowing the French King full leiſure to execute his ambitious ſchemes. The only points now to be deliberated upon, were, whether
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011837_0518_0F9D883EB4C771B0"/>
he ſhould attempt to gain the malecontents by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and conceſſions, or prepare directly to ſuppreſs them by force; and he reſolved to make trial of the former, while at the ſame time, if that ſhould fail of ſucceſs, he prepared for the latter. For this purpoſe, he iſſued circular letters to all the cities of Caſtile, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them in the moſt gentle terms, and with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of full pardon, to lay down their arms; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſuch cities as had continued faithful, not to exact from them the ſubſidy granted in the late Cortes, and offered the ſame favour to thoſe who returned to their duty; he engaged that no office ſhould be conferred for the future upon any but native Caſtilians. On the other hand, he wrote to the nobles exciting them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with vigour in defence of their own rights, and thoſe of the crown, againſt the exorbitant claims of the commons; he appointed the high admiral, Don Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drique Enriquez, and the high conſtable of Caſtile, Don Inigo de Velaſco, two noblemen of great abilities and influence, regents of the kingdom in conjunction with Adrian; and he gave them full power and inſtructions, if the obſtinacy of the malecontents ſhould render it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to vindicate the royal authority by force of arms <note n="o" place="bottom">P. Heuter. Rer. Auſtr. lib. viii. c. 6. p. 188.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE conceſſions he was willing to make, which, at the time of his leaving Spain, would have fully ſatisfied the people, came now too late to produce any effect. The Junta, relying on the unanimity with which the nation ſubmitted to their authority, elated with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which hitherto had accompanied all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and ſeeing no military force collected to defeat or obſtruct their deſigns, aimed at a more thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of political abuſes. They had been employed for ſome time in preparing a remonſtrance containing a large enumeration not only of the grievances, of which they craved redreſs, but of ſuch new regulations as they thought neceſſary for the ſecurity of their liberties. This remonſtrance, which is divided into many articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to all the different members of which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was compoſed, as well as to the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments

in the adminiſtration of government, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with more authentic evidence concerning the intentions of the Junta, than can be drawn from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the latter Spaniſh hiſtorians, who lived in times when it became faſhionable and even neceſſary to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the conduct of the malecontents in the worſt light, and as flowing from the worſt motives. After a long preamble concerning the various calamities under which the nation groaned, and the errors and corruption in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to which theſe were to be imputed, they take notice of the exemplary patience wherewith the people had endured them, till ſelf-preſervation, and the duty which they owed to their country, had obliged them to aſſemble in order to provide in a legal manner for their own ſafety, and that of the conſtitution: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they demanded that the King would be pleaſed to return to his Spaniſh dominions, and reſide there, as all their former monarchs had done; that he would not marry but with conſent of the Cortes; that if he ſhould be obliged at any time to leave the kingdom, it ſhall not be lawful to appoint any foreigner to be regent; that the preſent nomination of Cardinal Adrian to that office ſhall inſtantly be declared void; that he would not, at his return, bring along with him any Flemings or other ſtrangers; that no foreign troops ſhall, on any pretence whatever, be introduced into the kingdom; that none but natives ſhall be capable of holding any office or benefice either in church or ſtate; that no fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners ſhall be naturalized; that free quarters ſhall not be granted to ſoldiers, nor to thoſe of the King's houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold for any longer time than ſix days, and that only when the court is in a progreſs; that all the taxes ſhall be reduced to the ſame ſtate they were in at the death of Queen Iſabella; that all alienations of the royal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes or revenues ſince that Queen's death ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; that all new offices created ſince that period be aboliſhed; that the ſubſidy granted by the late Cortes in Galicia ſhall not be exacted; that in all future Cortes each city ſhall ſend one repreſentative of the clergy, one of the gentry, and one of the commons, each to be elected by his own order; that the crown ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or direct any city with regard to the choice of its

repreſentatives; that no member of the Cortes ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any office or penſion from the King, either for himſelf or for any of his family, under pain of death, and confiſcation of his goods; that each city or community ſhall pay a competent ſalary to its repreſentatives for his maintenance during his attendance on the Cortes; that the Cortes ſhall aſſemble once in three years at leaſt, whether ſummoned by the King or not, and ſhall then enquire into the obſervation of the articles now agreed upon, and deliberate concerning public affairs; that the rewards which have been given or promiſed to any of the members of the Cortes in Galicia, ſhall be revoked; that no gold, ſilver, or jewels, ſhall, upon pain of death, be ſent out of the kingdom; that judges ſhall have fixed ſalaries aſſigned them, and ſhall not receive any ſhare of the fines and forfeitures of perſons condemned by them; that no grant of the goods of perſons accuſed ſhall be valid, if given before ſentence was pronounced againſt them; that all privileges which the nobles have at any time obtained, to the prejudice of the commons, ſhall be revoked; that the government of cities or towns ſhall not be put into the hands of the nobles; that the lands of the nobles ſhall be ſubject to all public taxes in the ſame manner as thoſe of the commons; that an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be made into the conduct of thoſe who have been intruſted with the management of the royal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony ſince the acceſſion of Ferdinand; and if the King do not within thirty days appoint perſons properly qualified for that ſervice, it ſhall be lawful for the Cortes to nominate them; that indulgencies ſhall not be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſperſed in the kingdom until the cauſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them be examined and approved of by the Cortes; that all the money ariſing from the ſale of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, ſhall be faithfully employed in carrying on war againſt the Infidels; that ſuch prelates as do not reſide in their dioceſes ſix months in the year, ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their revenues during the time they are abſent; that the eccleſiaſtical judges and their officers ſhall not exact greater fees than thoſe which are paid in the ſecular courts; that the preſent archbiſhop of Toledo, being a foreigner, be compelled to reſign that dignity, which ſhall be conferred upon a Caſtilian; that the King ſhall

ratify and hold as good ſervice done to him and to the kingdom all the proceedings of the Junta, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don any irregularities which the cities may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from an exceſs of zeal in a good cauſe: That he ſhall promiſe and ſwear in the moſt ſolemn manner to obſerve all theſe articles, and on no occaſion attempt either to elude, or to repeal them; and that he ſhall never ſolicit the Pope or any other prelate to grant him a diſpenſation or abſolution from this oath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <note n="p" place="bottom">Sandov. 206. P. Mart. Ep. 686.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH were the chief articles preſented by the Junta to their Sovereign. As the feudal inſtitutions in the ſeveral kingdoms of Europe were originally the ſame, the genius of thoſe governments which aroſe from them bore a ſtrong reſemblance to each other, and the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which the Caſtilians attempted to eſtabliſh on this occaſion, differ little from thoſe which other nations la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to procure in their ſtruggles with their monarchs for liberty. The grievances complained of, and the remedies propoſed by the Engliſh commons in their conteſts with the princes of the houſe of Stuart, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly reſemble thoſe upon which the Junta now inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Spaniards had already acquired ideas of their own liberty and independence, had formed bold and generous ſentiments concerning government, and diſcovered an extent of political knowledge to which the Engliſh did not attain till more than a century after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>IT is not improbable, however, that the ſpirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation among the Caſtilians, hitherto unreſtrained by authority, and emboldened by ſucceſs, became too impetuous, and prompted the Junta to propoſe innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which, by alarming the other members of the conſtitution, proved fatal to their cauſe. The nobles, who, inſtead of obſtructing, had favoured or connived at their proceedings, while they confined their demands of redreſs to ſuch grievances as had been occaſioned by the King's want of experience, and by the imprudence and rapaciouſneſs of his foreign miniſters, were filled with indignation when they began to touch the privileges of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011837_0522_0F9D8842CAC1CCA8"/>
their order, and plainly ſaw that the meaſures of the commons tended no leſs to break the power of the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy, than to limit the prerogatives of the crown. The reſentment which they had conceived on account of Adrian's promotion to the regency, abated conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably upon the Emperor's raiſing the conſtable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral to a joint power with him in that office; and as their pride and dignity were leſs hurt by ſuffering the Prince to poſſeſs an extenſive prerogative, than by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the high pretenſions of the people, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to give their Sovereign the aſſiſtance which he had demanded of them, and began to aſſemble their vaſſals for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>THE Junta, meanwhile, expected with impatience the Emperor's anſwer to their remonſtrance, which they had appointed ſome of their number to preſent. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers entruſted with this commiſſion ſet out immediately for Germany, but having received at different places certain intelligence from court, that they could not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to appear there without endangering their lives, they ſtopt ſhort in their journey, and acquainted the Junta of the information which had been given them <note n="l" place="bottom">Sandov. 143.</note>. This excited ſuch violent paſſions as tranſported the whole party beyond all bounds of prudence, or of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That a Caſtilian King ſhould deny his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects acceſs into his preſence, or refuſe to liſten to their humble petitions, was repreſented as an act of tyranny ſo unprecedented and intolerable, that nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but with arms in their hands to drive away that ravenous band of foreigners which encompaſſed the throne, who, after having devoured the wealth of the kingdom, found it neceſſary to prevent the cries of an injured people from reaching the ears of their Sovereign. Many inſiſted warmly on approving a motion which had formerly been made, for depriving Charles, during the life of his mother, of the regal titles and authority which had been too raſhly conferred upon him from a falſe ſuppoſition of her total inability for government. Some propoſed to provide a proper perſon to aſſiſt her in the adminiſtration of public affairs, by marrying the Queen
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011837_0523_0F9D884345ECAD88"/>
to the Prince of Calabria, the heir of the Aragoneſe Kings of Naples, who had been detained in priſon ſince the time that Ferdinand had diſpoſſeſſed his anceſtors of their crown. All agreed, that as the hopes of obtaining redreſs and ſecurity merely by preſenting their requeſts to their Sovereign, had kept them too long in a ſtate of inaction, and prevented them from taking advantage of the unanimity with which the nation declared in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it was now neceſſary to collect their whole force, and to exert themſelves with vigour, in oppoſing this fatal combination of the King and nobles againſt their liberties <note n="m" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 688.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THEY ſoon took the field with twenty thouſand men. Violent diſputes aroſe concerning the command of this army. Padilla, the darling of the people and ſoldiers, was the only perſon whom they thought worthy of this honour. But Don Pedro de Giron, the eldeſt ſon of the Condè de Uruena, a young nobleman of the firſt order, having lately joined the commons out of private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt the Emperor, the reſpect due to his birth, together with a ſecret deſire of diſappointing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla, of whoſe popularity many of the Junta had become jealous, procured him the office of general; though he ſoon gave them a fatal proof that he poſſeſſed neither the experience, the abilities, nor the ſteadineſs which that important ſtation required.</p>
                  <p>THE regents, meanwhile, appointed Rioſeco as the place of rendezvous for their troops, which, though far inferior to thoſe of the commons in number, excelled them greatly in diſcipline and in valour. They had drawn a conſiderable body of regular and veteran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry out of Navarre. Their cavalry, which formed the chief ſtrength of their army, conſiſted moſtly of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen accuſtomed to the military life, and animated with the martial ſpirit peculiar to their order in that age. The infantry of the Junta was formed entirely of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and mechanics, little acquainted with the uſe of arms. The ſmall body of cavalry they had been able to raiſe, was compoſed of perſons of ignoble birth, and perfect ſtrangers to the ſervice into which they entered.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011837_0524_0F9D8843F2797A70"/>
The character of the generals differed no leſs than that of their troops. The royaliſts were commanded by the Condè de Haro, the conſtable's eldeſt ſon, an officer of great experience, and of diſtinguiſhed abilities.</p>
                  <p>GIRON marched with his army directly to Rioſeco and ſeizing the villages and paſſes around it, hoped that the royaliſts would be obliged either to ſurrender for want of proviſions, or to fight with diſadvantage before all their troops were aſſembled. But he had not the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor his troops the patience and diſcipline neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the execution of ſuch a ſcheme. The Condè de Haro found little difficulty in conducting a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reinforcement through all his poſts into the town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Giron deſpairing of being able to reduce it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſuddenly to Villa-panda, a place belonging to the conſtable, in which the enemy had their chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of proviſions. By this ill-judged motion, he left Tordeſillas open to the royaliſts, whom the Condè de Haro led thither in the night, with the utmoſt ſecrecy and diſpatch; and attacking the town, in which Giron had left no other garriſon than a regiment of prieſts raiſed by the biſhop of Zamora, he, by break of day forced his way into it after a deſperate reſiſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter of the Queen's perſon, took priſoners ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members of the Junta, and recovered the great ſeal, with the other enſigns of government.</p>
                  <p>BY this fatal blow, the Junta loſt all the reputation and authority which they derived from ſeeming to act by the Queen's commands; ſuch of the nobles as had hitherto been wavering or undetermined in their choice, now joined the regents with all their forces; and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſternation ſeized the partizans of the commons. This was much increaſed by the ſuſpicions they began to entertain of Giron, whom they loudly accuſed of having betrayed Tordeſillas to the enemy; and though that charge ſeems to have been deſtitute of foundation, the ſucceſs of the royaliſts being owing to Giron's ill-conduct rather than to his treachery, he ſo entirely loſt credit with his party, that he reſigned his commiſſion, and retired to one of his caſtles <note n="n" place="bottom">Miſcellaneous Tracts by Dr. Mich.

Their army, which grew ſtronger every day by the arrival of troops from different parts of the kingdom, marched likewiſe to Valladolid; and Padilla being appointed commander in chief, the ſpirits of the ſoldiery revived, and the whole party forgetting the late misfortune, continued to expreſs the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent zeal for the liberties of their country, and the ſame implacable animoſity againſt their oppreſſors.</p>
                  <p>WHAT they ſtood moſt in need of, was money to pay their troops. A great part of the current coin had been carried out of the kingdom by the Flemings; the ſtated taxes levied in times of peace were inconſiderable; commerce of every kind being interrupted by the war, the ſum which they yielded decreaſed daily; and the Junta were afraid of diſguſting the people by burdening them with new impoſitions, to which, in that age, they were little accuſtomed. But from this difficulty they were extricated by Donna Maria Pacheco, Padilla's wife, a woman of noble birth, of great abilities, of boundleſs ambition, and animated with the moſt ardent zeal in ſupport of the cauſe of the Junta. She, with a boldneſs ſuperior to thoſe ſuperſtitious fears which often influence her ſex, propoſed to ſeize all the rich and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ornaments in the cathedral of Toledo; but leſt that action, by its appearance of impiety, might offend the people, ſhe and her retinue marched to the church in ſolemn proceſſion, in mourning habits, with tears in their eyes, and beating their breaſts, and falling on their knees, implored the pardon of the ſaints whoſe ſhrines ſhe was about to violate. By this artifice, which ſcreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from the imputation of ſacrilege, and perſuaded the people that neceſſity and zeal for a good cauſe had conſtrained her, though with reluctance, to venture upon this action, ſhe procured a conſiderable ſupply of money for the Junta <note n="o" place="bottom">Sandov. 308.

how to maintain their troops, the revenues of the crown having either been diſſipated by the Flemings, or being ſeized by the commons, were obliged to take the Queen's jewels, and the plate belonging to the nobility, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to that purpoſe; and when theſe failed, they obtained a ſmall ſum by way of loan from the King of Portugal <note n="p" place="bottom">Mart. Ep 718.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE nobility diſcovered great unwillingneſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to extremities with the Junta. They were animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no leſs hatred than the commons againſt the Flemings; they approved much of ſeveral articles in the remonſtrance; they thought the juncture favourable, not only for redreſſing paſt grievances, but for render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution more perfect and ſecure by new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations; they were afraid that while the two orders of which the legiſlature was compoſed, waſted each other's ſtrength by mutual hoſtilities, the crown would riſe to power on the ruin or weakneſs of both, and encroach no leſs on the independence of the nobles, than on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the commons. To this diſpoſition were ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frequent overtures of peace which the regents made to the Junta, and the continual negociations they carried on during the progreſs of their military opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Nor were the terms which they offered unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; for, on condition that the Junta would paſs from a few articles moſt ſubverſive of the royal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or inconſiſtent with the rights of the nobility, they engaged to procure the Emperor's conſent to their other demands, which, if he, through the influence of evil counſellors, ſhould refuſe, ſeveral of the nobles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to join with them in order to extort it <note n="q" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 695, 713. Geddes's Tracts, i. 261.</note>. Such diviſions, however, prevailed among the members of the Junta, as prevented their deliberating calmly, or judging with prudence. Several of the cities which had entered into the confederacy, were filled with that mean jealouſy and diſtruſt of each other, which rivalſhip in commerce or in grandeur is apt to inſpire; the conſtable, by his influence and promiſes, had prevailed on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Burgos to abandon the Junta, and other

noblemen had ſhaken the fidelity of ſome of the leſſer cities; no perſon had ariſen among the commons of ſuch ſuperior abilities or elevation of mind, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the direction of their affairs; Padilla, their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, was a man of popular qualities, but diſtruſted for that reaſon by thoſe or higheſt rank who adhered to the Junta; the conduct of Giron led the people to view with ſuſpicion every perſon of noble birth who joined their party; ſo that the ſtrongeſt marks of irreſolution, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſtruſt, and mediocrity of genius, appeared in all their proceedings at this time. After many conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions held concerning the terms propoſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, they ſuffered themſelves to be ſo carried away by reſentment againſt the nobility, that, rejecting all thoughts of accommodation, they threatened to ſtrip them of the crown-lands, which they or their anceſtors had uſurped, and to re-annex them to the royal domain: And on this prepoſterous ſcheme, which would at once have annihilated all the liberties for which they had been ſtruggling, by rendering the Kings of Caſtile ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and independent on their people, they were ſo intent that they exclaimed with leſs vehemence againſt the exactions of the foreign miniſters, than againſt the immenſe power and wealth of the nobles, and ſeemed to hope that they might make peace with Charles, by offering to enrich him with their ſpoils.</p>
                  <p>THE ſucceſs which Padilla had met with in ſeveral ſmall encounters, and in reducing ſome inconſiderable towns, helped to precipitate them into this meaſure, filling them with ſuch confidence in the valour of their troops, that they hoped for an eaſy victory over the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts. Padilla, that his army might not remain inactive, while fluſhed with good fortune, laid ſiege to Torrelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baton, a place of greater ſtrength and importance than any he had hitherto attacked, and which was defended by a ſufficient garriſon; and though the beſieged made a deſperate reſiſtance, and the admiral attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, he took the town by ſtorm, and gave it up to be plundered by his ſoldiers. If he had marched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with his victorious army to Tordeſillas, the head quarters of the royaliſts, he could ſcarce have failed of making an effectual impreſſion on their troops, ſurprized
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:011837_0528_0F9D8846F04091D0"/>
at the briſkneſs of his operations, and far from being of ſufficient ſtrength to give him battle. But the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imprudence of the Junta prevented his taking this ſtep. Incapable alike of carrying on war, or of making peace, they liſtened again to overtures of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and even agreed to a ſhort ſuſpenſion of arms. This negociation terminated in nothing; but while it was carrying on, many of Padilla's ſoldiers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the reſtraints of diſcipline, went off with the booty they had got at Torrelobaton; and others, wearied out by the unuſual length of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, deſerted<note n="r" place="bottom">Sandov. 336.</note>. The conſtable too had leiſure to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his forces at Burgos, and to prepare every thing for marching, and as ſoon as the truce expired, he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a junction with the Condè de Haro, in ſpite of all Padilla's efforts to prevent it. They advanced imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately towards Torrelobaton, and Padilla finding the number of his troops ſo diminiſhed that he durſt not riſk a battle, attempted to retreat to Toro, which if be could have accompliſhed, the invaſion of Navarre at that juncture by the French, and the neceſſity which the regents muſt have been under of detaching men to that kingdom, might have ſaved him from danger. But Haro, ſenſible how fatal the conſequences would be of ſuffering him to eſcape, marched with ſuch rapidity at the head of his cavalry, that he came up with him near Villalar, and without waiting for his infantry, advanced to the attack. Padilla's army, fatigued and diſhearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their precipitate retreat, which they could not diſtinguiſh from a flight, happened at that time to be paſſing over a ploughed field, on which ſuch a violent rain had fallen, that the ſoldiers ſunk almoſt to the knees at every ſtep, and remained expoſed to the fire of ſome field-pieces which the rovaliſts had brought along with them. All theſe circumſtances ſo diſconcerted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated raw ſoldiers, that without facing the enemy, or making any reſiſtance, they fled in the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Padilla exerted himſelf with extraordinary cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and activity in order to rally them, though in vain; fear rendering them deaf both to his threats and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Upon which, finding matters irretrievable, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011837_0529_0F9D8847B0BBA988"/>
reſolving not to ſurvive the diſgrace of that day, and the ruin of his party, he ruſhed into the thickeſt of the enemy; but being wounded and diſmounted, he was taken priſoner. His principal officers ſhared the ſame fate; the common ſoldiers were allowed to depart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, the nobles being too generous to kill men who threw down their arms <note n="t" place="bottom">Sandov. 345, &amp;c.

                  <p>THE reſentment of his enemies did not ſuffer Padilla to linger long in expectation of what ſhould befall him.

                              <p>"To thee, the crown of Spain, and light of the whole world, free from the time of the mighty Goths; to thee, who by ſhedding the blood of ſtrangers, as well as thy own blood, haſt recovered liberty for thyſelf, and thy neighbouring cities. Thy legitimate ſon Juan de Padilla gives information, how by the blood of his body, thy ancient victories are to be refreſhed. If fate hath not permitted my actions to be placed among your ſucceſsful and celebrated exploits, the fault hath been in my ill-fortune, not in my good-will. This I requeſt of thee as of a mother, to accept, ſince God hath given me nothing more to loſe for thy ſake, than that which I am now to relinquiſh. I am more ſolicitous about thy good opinion than about my own life. The ſhiftings of fortune which never ſtand ſtill, are many. But this I ſee with infinite conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I, the leaſt of thy children, ſuffer death for thee; and that thou haſt nurſed at thy breaſts ſuch as may take vengeance for my wrongs. Many tongues will relate the manner of my death, of which I am ſtill ignorant, though I know it to be near. My end will teſtify what was my deſire. My ſoul I recommend to thee as to the patroneſs of Chriſtianity. Of my body I ſay nothing, for it is not mine. I can write nothing more, for at this very moment, I feel the knife at my throat with greater dread of thy diſpleaſure, than apprehenſion of my own pain." Sandov. Hiſt. vol. i. p. 478.</p>

After this, he ſubmitted quietly to his fate. Moſt of the Spaniſh hiſtorians, accuſtomed to ideas of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of regal power very different from thoſe upon which he acted, have been ſo eager to teſtify their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of the cauſe in which he was engaged, that they have neglected, or have been afraid to do juſtice to his virtues; and by blackening his memory, have endeavoured to deprive him of that pity, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom denied to illuſtrious ſufferers.</p>
                  <p>THE victory at Villalar proved as deciſive as it was compleat. Valladolid, the moſt zealous of all the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated cities, opened its gates immediately to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and being treated with great clemency by the regents, Medina del Campo, Segovia, and many other cities followed its example. This ſudden diſſolution of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011837_0531_0F9D8849312A9410"/>
a confederacy, formed not upon ſlight diſguſts or upon trifling motives, into which the whole body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had entered, and which had been allowed time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome degree of order and conſiſtence by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a regular plan of government, is the ſtrongeſt proof of the inability of its leaders, or of ſome ſecret diſcord reigning among the members. Though part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by which they had been ſubdued, was obliged, a few days after the battle, to march towards Navarre, in order to check the progreſs of the French in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nothing could prevail on the dejected commons of Caſtile to take arms again, and to embrace ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity of acquiring thoſe rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges for which they had appeared ſo zealous. The city of Toledo alone, animated by Donna Maria Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checo, Padilla's widow, who, inſtead of bewailing her huſband with a womaniſh ſorrow, prepared to revenge his death, and to proſecute that cauſe in defence of which he had ſuffered, muſt be excepted. Reſpect for her ſex, or admiration of her courage and abilities, as well as ſympathy with her misfortunes, and veneration for the memory of her huſband, ſecured her the ſame aſcendant over the people which he had poſſeſſed. The prudence and vigour with which ſhe acted, juſtified the confidence they placed in her. She wrote to the French general in Navarre, encouraging him to invade Caſtile by the offer of powerful aſſiſtance. She endeavoured by her letters and emiſſaries to revive the ſpirit and hopes of other cities. She raiſed ſoldiers, and exacted a great ſum from the clergy belonging to the cathedral to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expence of keeping them on foot<note n="x" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 727.</note>. She em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed every artifice that could intereſt or inflame the populace. For this purpoſe ſhe ordered crucifixes to be uſed by her troops inſtead of colours, as if they had been at war with Infidels, and enemies of religion; ſhe marched through the ſtreets of Toledo with her ſon, a young child, clad in deep mourning, ſeated on a mule, having a ſtandard carried before him repreſenting the manner of his father's execution <note n="y" place="bottom">Sandov. 375.</note>. By all theſe means ſhe kept the minds of the people in ſuch perpetual agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as prevented their paſſions from ſubſiding, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011837_0532_0F9D8849EFDD8658"/>
rendered them inſenſible of the dangers to which they were expoſed by ſtanding alone in oppoſition to the royal authority. While the army was employed in Navarre, the regents were unable to attempt the reduction of Toledo by force; and all their endeavours either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh Donna Maria's credit with the people, or to gain her by large promiſes, and the ſolicitations of her brother the Marquis de Mondeair, proved ineffectual. Upon the expulſion of the French out of Navarre, part of the army returned into Caſtile, and inveſted Toledo. Even this made no impreſſion on the intrepid and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate courage of Donna Maria. She defended the town with vigour, her troops beat the royaliſts in ſeveral ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and no progreſs was made towards reducing the place, till the clergy, whom ſhe had highly offended by invading their property, having received information of the death of William de Croy Archbiſhop of Toledo, whoſe poſſeſſion of that ſee was their chief grievance, and that the Emperor had named a Caſtilian to ſucceed him, began to turn againſt her. They perſuaded the people that ſhe had acquired ſuch influence over them by the force of enchantments, that ſhe was aſſiſted by a familiar demon which attended her in the form of a negro-maid, and that by its ſuggeſtions ſhe regulated every part of her conduct <note n="z" place="bottom">P. Mart. Ep. 727.</note>. The credulous multitude, whom their impatience of a long blockade, and deſpair of obtaining ſuccours either from the cities formerly in confederacy with them, or from the French, rendered deſirous of peace, took arms againſt her, and driving her out of the city ſurrendered it to the royaliſts. She retired to the citadel, which ſhe defended with amazing fortitude four months longer; and when reduced to the laſt extremities, ſhe made her eſcape in diſguiſe, and fled to Portugal, where ſhe had many relations <note n="a" place="bottom">Sandov. 375. P. Mart. Ep. 754. Ferrer. viii. 563.</note>.</p>
                  <p>UPON her flight, the citadel ſurrendered. Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was re-eſtabliſhed in Caſtile; and this bold attempt of the commons, like all unſucceſsful inſurrections, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to confirm and extend the power of the crown, which it was intended to moderate and abridge. The Cortes ſtill continued to make a part of the Caſtilian

conſtitution, and were ſummoned to meet when ever the King ſtood in need of money; but inſtead of adhering to their ancient and cautious form of examining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing publick grievances, before they proceeded to grant any ſupply, the more courtly cuſtom of voting a donative in the firſt place was introduced, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign having obtained all he wanted, never allowed them to enter into any ſcrutiny, or to attempt any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation injurious to his authority. The privileges which the cities had enjoyed were gradually circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or aboliſhed; their commerce began from this period to decline; and becoming leſs wealthy and leſs populous, they loſt that power and influence which they had acquired in the Cortes.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Caſtile was expoſed to the calamities of civil war, the kingdom of Valencia was torn by inteſtine commotions ſtill more violent. The aſſociation which had been formed in the city of Valencia in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty, and which was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of the Germanada, continued to ſubſiſt after the Emperor's departure from Spain; and the members of it, upon pretext of defending the coaſts againſt the deſcents of the Corſairs of Barbary, and under ſanction of that permiſſion, which Charles had raſhly granted them, refuſed to lay down their arms. But as the grievances which the Valencians aimed at redreſſing, proceeded from the arrogance and exactions of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, rather than from any unwarrantable exerciſe of the royal prerogative, their reſentment turned chiefly againſt the former. As ſoon as they were allowed the uſe of arms, and became conſcious of their own ſtrength, they grew impatient to take vengeance of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. They drove the nobles out of moſt of the cities, plundered their houſes, waſted their lands, and aſſaulted their caſtles. They then proceeded to elect thirteen perſons, one from each company of tradeſmen eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Valencia, and committed the adminiſtration of government to them, under pretext that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the laws, eſtabliſh one uniform mode of diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice without partiality, or regard to the diſtinction of ranks, and thus reſtore men to ſome degree of their original equality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="unknown:011837_0534_0F9D884B70F52848"/>THE nobles were obliged to take arms in ſelf-defence. Hoſtilities began, and were carried on with all the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, with which reſentment at oppreſſion inſpired the one party, and the idea of inſulting dignity animated the other. As no perſon of honourable birth, or of liberal education joined the Germanada, the councils as well as troops of the confederacy were conducted by low me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, who acquired the confidence of an enraged mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude chiefly by the fierceneſs of their zeal, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of their proceedings. Among ſuch men, the laws introduced in civilized nations, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain or moderate the violence of war, were unknown or deſpiſed; and they committed the wildeſt acts of cruelty and outrage.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor occupied with ſuppreſſing the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in Caſtile, which more immediately threatened the ſubverſion of his power and prerogative, was unable to give much attention to the tumults in Valencia, and left the nobility of that kingdom to fight their own battles. His viceroy, the Condè de Melito, had the ſupreme command of the forces which the nobles raiſed among their vaſſals. The Germanada carried on the war during the years 1520 and 1521, with a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering courage, than could have been expected from a body ſo tumultuary, under the conduct of ſuch leaders. They defeated the nobility in ſeveral actions, which, though not conſiderable, were extremely ſharp. They repulſed them in their attempts to reduce different towns. But the nobles, by their ſuperior ſkill in war, and at the head of troops more accuſtomed to ſervice, gained the advantage in moſt of the rencounters. At length, they were joined by a body of Caſtilian cavalry, which the regents diſpatched towards Valencia, ſoon after their victory over Padilla at Villalar, and by their aſſiſtance they acquired ſuch ſuperiority, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely broke and ruined the Germanada. The leaders of the party were put to death, almoſt without any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of legal trial, and ſuffered ſuch cruel puniſhments, as the ſenſe of recent injuries prompted the nobles to inflict. The government of Valencia was re-eſtabliſhed in its ancient form <note n="b" place="bottom">Argenſola Anales de Aragon, cap. 75. 90. 99. 118. Sayas Anales de Aragon, cap. 5. 12, &amp;c. P. Mart.

                     <pb n="127" facs="unknown:011837_0535_0F9D884CB60C3E20"/>IN Aragon, violent ſymptoms of the ſame ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection and mutiny, which reigned in the other kingdoms of Spain, began to appear; but by the prudent conduct of the viceroy, Don John de Lanuza, they were ſo far compoſed, as to prevent their breaking out into any open inſurrection. But in the iſland of Majorca, which was annexed to the crown of Aragon, the ſame cauſes that had excited the commotions in Valencia, produced effects no leſs violent. The people, impatient of the hardſhips which they endured under the rigid juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nobility, took arms in a tumultuary manner; depoſed their viceroy; drove him out of the iſland; and maſſacred every gentleman who was ſo unfortunate as to fall into their hands. The obſtinacy with which the people of Majorca perſiſted in their rebellion, was equal to the rage with which they began it. It required no inconſiderable effort to reduce them to obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tranquillity was re-eſtabliſhed in every part of Spain before they could be brought to ſubmit to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign <note n="d" place="bottom">Argenſola Anales de Aragon, c. 113.

                  <p>WHILE the ſpirit of diſaffection was ſo general among the Spaniards, and ſo many cauſes concurred in preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating them into ſuch violent meaſures, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the redreſs of their grievances, it may appear ſtrange, that the malecontents in the different kingdoms ſhould have carried on their operations without any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concert, or even any intercourſe with each other. By uniting their councils and arms, they might have acted both with greater force, and with more effect. The appearance of a national confederacy would have rendered it no leſs reſpectable among the people, than formidable to the crown; and the Emperor, unable to reſiſt ſuch a combination, muſt have complied with any terms which the members of it thought fit to preſcribe. Many things, however, prevented the Spaniards from forming themſelves into one body, and purſuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meaſures. The people of the different kingdoms in Spain, though they were become the ſubjects of the ſame Sovereign, retained, in full force, their national an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011837_0536_0F9D884CF09F9DD8"/>
to each other. The remembrance of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rivalſhip and hoſtilities was ſtill recent, and the ſenſe of reciprocal injuries ſo intire, as to be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with their acting with confidence and concert. Each nation choſe rather to depend on its own efforts, and to maintain the ſtruggle alone, than to implore the aid of neighbours, whom they diſtruſted and hated. At the ſame time, the forms of government in the ſeveral kingdoms of Spain were ſo different, and the grievances of which they complained, as well as the alterations and amendments which they attempted to introduce, ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that it was not eaſy to bring them to unite in any common plan. To this diſunion Charles was indebted for the preſervation of his Spaniſh crowns; and while each of the kingdoms followed ſeparate meaſures, all of them were obliged at laſt to conform to the will of their Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>THE arrival of the Emperor in Spain filled his ſubjects who had been in arms againſt him with deep apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; from which he ſoon delivered them by an act of clemency, no leſs prudent than generous. After a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſo general, ſcarce twenty perſons, among ſo many criminals obnoxious to the law, had been puniſhed capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally in Caſtile. Though ſtrongly ſollicited by his council, Charles refuſed to ſhed any more blood by the hands of the executioner; and publiſhed a general par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, extending to all crimes committed ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the inſurrections, from which only four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore were excepted. Even theſe he ſeems to have named, rather with an intention to intimidate others, than from any inclination to ſeize them; for when an officious courtier offered to inform him where one of the moſt conſiderable among them was concealed, he avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by a good-natured pleaſantry; "Go," ſays he, "I have now no reaſon to be afraid of that man, but he has ſome cauſe to keep at a diſtance from me, and you would be better employed in telling him that I am here, than in acquainting me with the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat <note n="e" place="bottom">Sandov. 377, &amp;c. Vida del. Emper. Carlos, per Don Juan Anton. de Vera y Zuniga, p. 30.</note>." By this appearance of magnanimity, as well as
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011837_0537_0F9D884DAFA2BF78"/>
by his care to avoid every thing which had diſguſted the Caſtilians during his former reſidence among them; by his addreſs in aſſuming their manners, in ſpeaking their language, and in complying with all their humours and cuſtoms, he acquired an aſcendant over them which ſcarce any of their native monarchs had ever attained, and brought them to ſupport him in all his enterprizes with a zeal and valour to which he owed much of his ſucceſs and grandeur <note n="f" place="bottom">Ulloa Vita de Carlos V. p. 85.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT the time that Charles landed in Spain, Adrian ſet out for Italy to take poſſeſſion of his new dignity. But though the Roman people longed extremely for his arrival, they could not, on his firſt appearance, conceal their ſurprize and diſappointment. After being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the princely magnificence of Julius, and the elegant ſplendour of Leo, they beheld with contempt an old man of an humble deportment, of auſtere manners, an enemy to pomp, deſtitute of taſte in the arts, and unadorned with any of the external accompliſhments which the vulgar expect in thoſe raiſed to eminent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note n="g" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 238. Jovii Vita Adriani, 117. Bellefor. Epitr. des Princ. 84.</note>. Nor did his political views and maxims ſeem leſs ſtrange and aſtoniſhing to the pontifical miniſters. He acknowledged and bewailed the corruptions which abounded in the church, as well as in the court of Rome, and prepared to reform both; he diſcovered no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of aggrandizing his family; he even ſcrupled at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch territories as ſome of his predeceſſors had acquired by violence and fraud, rather than by any legal title; and for that reaſon he inveſted Franceſco Maria de Roverè anew in the dutchy of Urbino, of which Leo had ſtripped him, and ſurrendered to the duke of Ferrara ſeveral places wreſted from him by the church <note n="h" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 15. 240.</note>. To men little habituated to ſee Princes regulate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by the maxims of morality and the principles of juſtice, theſe actions of the new Pope appeared incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible proofs of his weakneſs and inexperience; and Adrian, who was a perfect ſtranger to the complex and intricate ſyſtem of Italian politics, and who could place no confidence in perſons whoſe ſubtilty and refinements
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011837_0538_0F9D884E70622778"/>
in buſineſs ſuited ſo ill with his natural ſimplicity and candour, being often embaraſſed, and irreſolute in his deliberations, the opinion of his incapacity daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, until both his perſon and government became objects of ridicule among his ſubjects <note n="i" place="bottom">Jovii Vita Adr. 118. P. Mart. Ep 774. Ruſcelli Lettere de Princ. vol. i. p. 87, 96, 101.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ADRIAN, though devoted to the Emperor, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſume the impartiality which became the common father of Chriſtendom, and laboured to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the contending Princes, that they might unite in a league againſt Solyman, whoſe conqueſt of Rhodes rendered him more formidable than ever to Europe <note n="k" place="bottom">Bellefor. Epitr. p. 86.</note>. But this was an undertaking far beyond his abilities. To examine ſuch a variety of pretenſions, to adjuſt ſuch a number of interfering intereſts, to extinguiſh the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which ambition, emulation, and mutual injuries had kindled, to bring ſo many hoſtile powers to purſue the ſame ſcheme with unanimity and vigour, required not only uprightneſs of intentions, but a great ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both of underſtanding and addreſs.</p>
                  <p>THE Italian ſtates were no leſs deſirous of peace than the Pope. The Imperial army under Colonna was ſtill kept on foot, but as the Emperor's revenues in Spain, in Naples, and in the Low-Countries, were either exhauſted, or applied to ſome other purpoſe, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended entirely for pay and ſubſiſtence on the Italians. A great part of it was quartered in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and monthly contributions were levied upon the Florentines, the Milaneſe, the Genoeſe, and Luccheſe, by the viceroy of Naples; and though all exclaimed againſt ſuch oppreſſion, and were impatient to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it, the dread of worſe conſequences from the rage of the army, or the reſentment of the Emperor, obliged them to ſubmit<note n="l" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 238.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SO much regard, however, was paid to the Pope's exhortations, and to a bull which he iſſued requiring all Chriſtian Princes to conſent to a truce for three years, that the Imperial, the French, and the Engliſh Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors at Rome were impowered to treat of that matter;
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011837_0539_0F9D884F304E4D70"/>
but while they waſted their time in fruitleſs negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their maſters continued their preparations for war. The Venetians, who had hitherto adhered with great firmneſs to their alliance with Francis, being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that his affairs in Italy were in a deſperate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, entered into a league againſt him with the Emperor; to which Adrian, at the inſtigation of his countryman and friend Charles de Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, who perſuaded him that the only obſtacles to peace aroſe from the ambition of the French King, ſoon after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded. The other Italian ſtates followed their example; and Francis was left without a ſingle ally to reſiſt the efforts of ſo many enemies whoſe armies threatened, and whoſe territories encompaſſed his dominions on every ſide <note n="m" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15, 2, 1, 248.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE dread of this powerful confederacy, it was thought, would have obliged Francis to keep wholly on the defenſive, or at leaſt have prevented his entertaining any thoughts of marching into Italy. But it was the character of that Prince, too apt to become remiſs, and even negligent on ordinary occaſions, to rouze at the approach of danger, and not only to encounter it with ſpirit and intrepidity, qualities which never forſook him, but to provide againſt it with diligence and induſtry. Before his enemies were ready to execute any of their ſchemes, Francis had aſſembled a numerous army. His authority over his own ſubjects was far greater than that which Charles or Henry poſſeſſed over theirs. They depended on their parliaments for money, which was uſually granted them in ſmall ſums, very ſlowly, and with much reluctance. The taxes he could impoſe were more conſiderable, and levied with greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; ſo that on this, as well as on other occaſions, his army was in the field while they were deviſing ways and means for raiſing theirs. Senſible of this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Francis hoped to diſconcert all the Emperor's ſchemes, by marching in perſon into the Milaneſe; and this bold meaſure, the more formidable, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, could ſcarce have failed of producing that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The vanguard of his army had already reached
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011837_0540_0F9D88506D987C40"/>
Lyons, and he himſelf was haſtening after it with the ſecond diviſion of his troops, when the diſcovery of a domeſtic conſpiracy which threatened the ruin of the kingdom, obliged him to ſtop ſhort, and to alter his meaſures.</p>
                  <p>THE author of this dangerous plot was Charles duke of Bourbon, Lord High Conſtable, whoſe noble birth, vaſt fortune, and high office, raiſed him to be the moſt powerful ſubject in France, as his great talents, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuited to the field or the council, and his ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the crown rendered him the moſt illuſtrious and deſerving. The near reſemblance between the King and him in many of their qualities, both being fond of war, and ambitious to excel in active and manly exerciſes, as well as their equality in age, and their proximity of blood, ought naturally to have ſecured him a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare in that monarch's favour. But unhappily Louiſe, the King's mother, had contracted a violent averſion to the houſe of Bourbon, for no better reaſon than becauſe Anne of Bretagne, the Queen of Lewis the Twelfth, with whom ſhe lived in perpetual enmity, diſcovered a peculiar attachment to that branch of the royal family; and ſhe had taught her ſon, who was too ſuſceptible of any impreſſion ſhe gave him, to view all the conſtable's actions with a mean and unbecoming jealouſy. His diſtinguiſhed merit at the battle of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignano had not been ſufficiently rewarded; he had been recalled from the government of Milan upon very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretences, and had met with a cold reception, which his prudent conduct in that difficult ſtation did not deſerve; the payment of his penſions had been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended without any good cauſe; and during the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of one thouſand five hundred and twenty-one, the King, as has already been related, had affronted him in the preſence of the whole army, by giving the command of the van to the Duke of Alencon. The conſtable, at firſt, bore theſe indignities with greater moderation than could have been expected from an high-ſpirited Prince, conſcious of what was due to his rank, and to his ſervices. Such a multiplicity of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, however, exhauſted his patience; and inſpiring him with thoughts of revenge, he retired from court,

the intelligence which he had received. Bourbon, with great ſolemnity and the moſt impoſing affectation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and candour, aſſerted his own innocence; and as his health, he ſaid, was now more confirmed, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to join the army within a few days.

The conſtable ſet out ſoon after, ſeemingly with an intention to follow him; but turning ſuddenly to the left, he croſſed the Rhone, and after infinite fatigues and perils eſcaped all the parties which the King, ſenſible too late of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, ſent out to intercept him, and reached Italy in ſafety<note n="p" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 64, &amp;c.

                  <p>FRANCIS took every poſſible precaution to prevent the bad effects of the irreparable error he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He put garriſons in all places of ſtrength in the conſtable's territories. He ſeized all the gentlemen whom he could ſuſpect of being his aſſociates, and as he had not hitherto diſcovered the whole extent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator's ſchemes, nor knew how far the infection had ſpread among his ſubjects, he was afraid that his abſence might encourage them to make ſome deſperate attempt, and for that reaſon relinquiſhed his intention of leading his army in perſon into Italy.</p>
                  <p>HE did not, however, abandon his deſign on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe; but appointed admiral Bonnivet to take the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme command in his ſtead, and to march into that country with an army 30,000 ſtrong. Bonnivet did not owe this preferment to his abilities as a general; for of all talents requiſite to form a great commander, he poſſeſſed only perſonal courage, the loweſt and the moſt common. But he was the moſt accompliſhed gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the French court, of agreeable manners, an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating addreſs, and a ſprightly converſation; and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, who lived in great familiarity with his courtiers, was ſo charmed with theſe qualities, that he honoured him

on all occaſions, with the moſt partial and diſtinguiſhing marks of his favour. He was, beſides, the implacable enemy of Bourbon; and as the King ſcarce knew whom to truſt at that juncture, he thought the chief command could be lodged no where ſo ſafely as in his hands.</p>
                  <p>COLONNA, who was entruſted with the defence of the Milaneſe, his own conqueſt, was in no condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſuch a formidable army. He had ſcarce money ſufficient to pay his troops, reduced to a ſmall number by ſickneſs or deſertion, and had, for that reaſon, been obliged to neglect every precaution neceſſary for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the country. The only plan he formed, was to defend the paſſage of the river Teſino againſt the French; and, as if he had forgotten how eaſily he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had diſconcerted a ſimilar ſcheme formed by Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec, he promiſed with great confidence on its being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. But in ſpite of all his caution, it ſucceeded no better with him than with Lautrec. Bonnivet paſſed the river without loſs, at a ford which had been neglected, and the Imperialiſts retired to Milan, preparing to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the town as ſoon as the French ſhould appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. By an unaccountable negligence which Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardini imputes to infatuation <note n="q" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 15. 254.</note>. Bonnivet did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for three or four days, and loſt the opportunity with which his good fortune preſented him. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens recovered from their conſternation: Colonna ſtill active, at the age of fourſcore, and Moronè, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to France was indefatigable, were employed night and day in repairing the fortifications, in amaſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, in collecting troops from every quarter, and by the time the French approached, had put the city in a condition to ſtand a ſiege. Bonnivet, after ſome fruitleſs attempts on the town, which haraſſed his own troops more than the enemy, was obliged, by the inclemency of the ſeaſon to retire into winter-quarters.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, Pope Adrian died; an event ſo much to the ſatisfaction of the Roman people, whoſe hatred or contempt of him augmented every day, that the night after his deceaſe, they adorned the door of his chief phyſician's houſe with garlands, adding this

The Cardinal de Medici inſtantly renewed his pretenſions to the Papal dignity, and entered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave with high expectations on his own part, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion of the people that they would be ſucceſsful. But though ſupported by the Imperial faction, poſſeſſed of great perſonal intereſt, and capable of all the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, refinements, and corruptions, which reign in thoſe aſſemblies, the obſtinacy and intrigues of his rivals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the conclave to the unuſual length of fifty days. The addreſs and perſeverance of the Cardinal ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt every obſtacle. He was raiſed to the head of the church, and aſſumed the government of it by the name of Clement VII. The choice was univerſally approved of. High expectations were conceived of a Pope, whoſe great talents, and long experience in buſineſs, ſeemed to qualify him no leſs for defending the ſpiritual intereſts of the church, expoſed to imminent danger by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Luther's opinions, than for conducting its poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical operations with the prudence requiſite at ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult juncture; and who, beſides theſe advantages, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the eccleſiaſtical ſtate more reſpectable, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his hands the government of Florence, and the wealth of the family of Medici <note n="s" place="bottom">Guic. lib. 15. 263.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CARDINAL WOLSEY, not diſheartened by the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of his ambitious views at the former election, had entertained more ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs on this occaſion. Henry wrote to the Emperor, reminding him of his engagements to ſecond the pretenſions of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. Wolſey beſtirred himſelf with activity ſuitable to the importance of the prize for which he contended, and inſtructed his agents at Rome to ſpare neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes nor bribes in order to gain his end. But Charles had either amuſed him with vain hopes, which he never intended to gratify, or he judged it impolitic to oppoſe a candidate who had ſuch a proſpect of ſucceeding as Medici; or perhaps the cardinals durſt not venture to provoke the people of Rome, while their indignation againſt Adrian's memory was ſtill freſh, by placing another Ultramontane in the papal throne. Wolſey,

It was neceſſary, however, to conceal his intention from his maſter, and to ſuſpend the execution of it, until by a dextrous improvement of the incidents which might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, he ſhould be able gradually to alienate the King's affections from the Emperor. For this reaſon, he was ſo far from expreſſing any uneaſineſs on account of the repulſe he had met with, that he abounded on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, private as well as public, in declarations of his high ſatisfaction with Clement's promotion <note n="t" place="bottom">Fiddes's life of Wolſey, 294, &amp;c.

                  <p>HENRY had, during the campaign, fulfilled with great ſincerity whatever he was bound to perform by the league againſt France, though more ſlowly than he could have wiſhed. His thoughtleſs profuſion, and total neglect of oeconomy reduced him often to great ſtraits for money. The operations of war were now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in Europe in a manner very different from that which had long prevailed.

                     </gap>ſe to be more tedious, and leſs deciſive. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which theſe alterations in the military ſyſtem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily created, appeared intolerable to nations hitherto unaccuſtomed to the burthen of heavy taxes. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the frugal, and even parſimonious ſpirit of the Engliſh parliaments in that age, which Henry, with all his authority, was ſeldom able to overcome. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, having refuſed at this time to grant him the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies he demanded, he had recourſe to the ample and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unlimited prerogative, which the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land then poſſeſſed, and by a violent and unuſual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of it, raiſed the money he wanted. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, waſted ſo much time, that it was late in the ſeaſon before his army, under the duke of Suffolk, could take the field. Being joined by a conſiderable body of Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Suffolk marched into Picardy, and Francis from his extravagant eagerneſs to recover the Milaneſe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left that frontier almoſt unguarded, he penetrated as far as the banks of the river Oyſe, within eleven leagues of Paris, filling that capital with conſternation. But the arrival of ſome troops detached by the King, who was ſtill at Lyons; the active gallantry of the French officers, who allowed the allies no reſpite night or day; the rigour of a moſt unnatural ſeaſon, together with ſcarcity of proviſions, compelled Suffolk to retire; and La Tremoüille, who commanded in thoſe parts, had the glory of having, with an handful of men, checked the progreſs of a formidable army, and of having driven them with ignominy out of the French territories <note n="u" place="bottom">Herbert. Mem. de Bellay, 73, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor's attempts upon Burgundy and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne were not more fortunate, though in both theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces Francis was equally ill prepared to reſiſt them. The conduct and valour of his generals ſupplied his want of foreſight; the Germans who made an irruption into one of theſe provinces, and the Spaniards who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the other, were repulſed with great diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>THUS ended the year 1523, during which Francis's good fortune and ſucceſs had been ſuch as gave all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:011837_0548_0F9D8855F157A720"/>
an high idea of his power and reſources. He had diſcovered and diſconcerted a dangerous conſpiracy, the author of which he had drived into exile, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an attendant; he had rendered abortive all the ſchemes of the powerful confederacy formed againſt him; he had protected his dominions when attacked on three different ſides; and though his army in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe had not made ſuch progreſs as might have been expected from its ſuperiority to the enemy in number, he had recovered and ſtill kept poſſeſſion of one half of that dutchy.</p>
                  <p>THE enſuing year opened with events more diſaſtrous to France. Fontarabia was loſt by the cowardice or treachery of its governor. In Italy, the allies reſolved on an early and vigorous effort in order to diſpoſſeſs Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet of that part of the Milaneſe which lies beyond the Teſino; Clement, who, under the pontificates both of Leo and Adrian, had diſcovered an implacable enmity to France, began now to view the power which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was daily acquiring in Italy, with ſo much jealouſy, that he refuſed to accede, as his predeceſſors had done, to the league againſt Francis, and forgetting private paſſions and animoſities, laboured with the zeal which became his character, to bring about a reconciliation among the contending parties. But all his endeavours were ineffectual; a numerous army, to which each of the allies furniſhed their contingent of troops, was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Milan by the beginning of March. Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, took the command of it upon Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna's death, though the chief direction of military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations was committed to Bourbon, and the marquis de Peſcara; the latter, the ableſt and moſt enterprizing of the Imperial generals; the former inſpired by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment with new activity and invention, and acquainted ſo thoroughly with the characters of the French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, the genius of their troops, and the ſtrength as well as weakneſs of their armies, as to be of infinite ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the party which he joined. But all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were nearly loſt through the Emperor's inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to raiſe money ſufficient for executing the various and extenſive plans which he had formed. When his troops were commanded to march, they mutinied againſt
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011837_0549_0F9D8856B06E9EE0"/>
their leaders, demanding the pay which was due to them for ſome months; and diſregarding both the menaces and intreaties of their officers, threatened to pillage the city of Milan if they did not inſtantly receive ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Out of this difficulty the generals of the allies were extricated by Moronè, who, prevailing on his countrymen, over whom his influence was prodigious, to advance the ſum that was requiſite, the army took the field <note n="x" place="bottom">Guic. l. xv. 267.

                  <p>BONNIVET was deſtitute of troops to oppoſe this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the beginning of the charge, Bonnivet, while exerting himſelf with much valour, was wounded ſo dangerouſly as obliged him to quit the field; and the conduct of the rear was committed to the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier Bayard, who, though ſo much a ſtranger to the arts of a court, that he never roſe to the chief command, was always called, in times of real danger, to the poſts of difficulty and importance. He put himſelf at the head of the men at arms, and animating them by his preſence and example to ſuſtain the whole ſhock of the enemy's troops, he gained time for the reſt of his countrymen to make good their retreat. But in this ſervice he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wound, which he immediately perceived to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,

and being unable to continue any longer on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, he ordered one of his attendants to place him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tree, with his face towards the enemy; then fixing his eyes on the guard of his ſword, which he held up inſtead of a croſs, he addreſſed his prayers to God, and in this poſture, which became his character both as a ſoldier and as a Chriſtian, he calmly waited the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death. Bourbon, who led the foremoſt of the enemies troops, found him in this ſituation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed regret and pity at the ſight. "Pity not me," cried the high-ſpirited chevalier, "I die as a man of honour ought, in the diſcharge of my duty: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are objects of pity, who fight againſt their King, their country, and their oath." The Marquis de Peſcara, paſſing ſoon after, manifeſted his admiration of Bayard's virtues, and his ſorrow for his fall, with the generoſity of a gallant enemy; and finding that he could not be removed with ſafety from that ſpot, ordered a tent to be pitched there, and appointed proper perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. He died, notwithſtanding their care, as his anceſtors for ſeveral generations had done, in the field of battle. Peſcara ordered his body to be embalmed, and ſent to his relations; and ſuch was the reſpect paid to military merit in that age, that the Duke of Savoy commanded it to be received with royal honours in all the cities of his dominions; in Dauphinè, Bayard's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, the people of all ranks came out in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proceſſion to meet it <note n="y" place="bottom">Bellefor.

                  <p>WHILE the war kindled by the emulation of Charles and Francis ſpread over ſo many countries of Europe, Germany enjoyed a profound tranquillity, extremely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the reformation, which continued to make progreſs daily. During Luther's confinement in his retreat at Wartburg, Carloſtadius, one of his diſciples,

Theſe irregular and outrageous proceedings were ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all the Elector's cautious maxims, that if they had not received a timely check, they could ſcarce have failed of alienating from the reformers that Prince, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to a great degree of his own authority, and afraid of giving offence to the Emperor, and other patrons of the antient opinions. Luther, ſenſible of the danger, immediately quitted his retreat, without waiting for Frederick's permiſſion, and returned to Wittemberg. Happily for the reformation, the veneration for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and authority were ſtill ſo great, that his appearance alone ſuppreſſed that ſpirit of extravagance which began to ſeize his party. Carloſtadius and his fanatical fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſtruck dumb by his rebukes, declared that they heard the voice of an angel, not of a man <note n="z" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. 51.

                  <p>BEFORE Luther left his retreat, he had begun to tranſlate the Bible into the German tongue, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of no leſs difficulty than importance, of which he was extremely fond, and for which he was well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: He had a competent knowledge in the original languages; a thorough acquaintance with the ſtyle and ſentiments of the inſpired writers; and though his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in Latin were rude and barbarous, he was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned a great maſter of the purity of his mother-tongue, and could expreſs himſelf with all the elegance of which it is capable. By his own aſſiduous applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the aſſiſtance of Melancthon, and ſeveral other of his diſciples, he finiſhed part of the New Teſtament this year; and the publication of it proved more fatal to the church of Rome, than that of all his own works. It was read with wonderful avidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and attention by perſons of every rank. They were aſtoniſhed at diſcovering how contrary the precepts of

the author of our religion are, to the inventions of thoſe who pretended to be his vicegerents; and having now in their hand the rule of faith, they thought themſelves qualified by applying it to judge of the eſtabliſhed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and to pronounce when they were conformable to the ſtandard, and when they departed from it. The great advantage ariſing from Luther's tranſlation of the Bible, encouraged the advocates for reformation, in the other countries of Europe, to imitate his example, and to publiſh verſions of the Scriptures in their reſpective languages.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT this time, Nuremberg, Franckfort, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and ſeveral other cities in Germany of the firſt rank openly embraced the reformed religion, and by the authority of their magiſtrates aboliſhed the maſs, and the other ſuperſtitious rites of Popery <note n="a" place="bottom">Seckend. 241. Chytraei Contin. Krantzii, 203.</note>. The Elector of Brandenburgh, the Dukes of Brunſwick and Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and Prince of Anhalt, became avowed patrons of Luther's opinions, and countenanced the preaching of them among their ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>THE court of Rome beheld this growing defection with great concern; and Adrian's firſt care after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in Italy, had been to deliberate with the cardinals, concerning the proper means of putting a ſtop to it. This Pope was profoundly ſkilled in ſcholaſtic theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and having been early taken notice of on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he ſtill retained ſuch an exceſſive admiration of the ſcience to which he owed his reputation and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in life, that he conſidered Luther's invectives againſt the ſchoolmen, particularly Thomas Aquinas, as little leſs than blaſphemy. All the tenets of that doctor appeared to him ſo clear and irrefragable, that he ſuppoſed every perſon who called in queſtion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted them, to be either blinded by ignorance, or to be acting in oppoſition to the conviction of his own mind: Of courſe, no Pope was ever more bigotted or inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with regard to points of doctrine than Adrian; he not only maintained them as Leo had done, becauſe they were antient, or becauſe it was dangerous for the church to allow of innovations, but he adhered to them with
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011837_0553_0F9D8859AF7AC518"/>
the zeal of a theologian, and with the tenaciouſneſs of a diſputant. At the ſame time, his own manners being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſimple, and uninfected with any of the vices which reigned in the court of Rome, he was as ſenſible of its corruptions as the reformers themſelves, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with no leſs indignation. The brief he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Diet of the empire aſſembled at Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and the inſtructions he gave Cheregato the nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio whom he ſent thither, were framed agreeably to theſe views. On the one hand, he condemned Luther's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with more aſperity and rancour of expreſſion than Leo had ever uſed; he ſeverely cenſured the Princes of Germany for ſuffering him to ſpread his pernicious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, by their neglecting to execute the edict of the Diet at Worms, and required them, if Luther did not inſtantly retract his errors, to deſtroy him with fire as a gangrened and incurable member, in like manner as Dathan and Abiram had been cut of by Moſes, Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias and Sapphira by the apoſtles, and John Huſs and Jerome of Prague by their anceſtors <note n="b" place="bottom">Faſcic. Rer. Expet. &amp; Fugiend. 342.</note>. On the other hand, he, with great candour, and in the moſt expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit terms, acknowledged the corruptions of the Roman court to be the ſource from which had flowed all the evils that the church now felt or dreaded; he promiſed to exert all his authority towards reforming theſe abuſes, with as much diſpatch as the nature and inveteracy of the diſorders would admit; and he requeſted of them to give him their advice with regard to the moſt effectual means of ſuppreſſing that new hereſy which had ſprung up among them <note n="c" place="bottom">Faſcic. Rer. Expet. &amp; Fugiend. p. 345.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE members of the Diet, after praiſing the Pope's pious and laudable intentions, excuſed themſelves for not executing the edict of Worms, by alledging that the prodigious increaſe of Luther's followers, as well as the averſion to the court of Rome among their other ſubjects on account of its innumerable exactions, rendered ſuch an attempt not only dangerous, but impoſſible. They affirmed, that the grievances of Germany, which did not ariſe from imaginary injuries, but from impoſitions no

leſs real than intolerable, as his Holineſs would learn from a catalogue of them, which they intended to lay before him, called now for ſome new and efficacious remedy, and in their opinion, the only remedy ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the diſeaſe, or which afforded them any hopes of ſeeing the church reſtored to ſoundneſs and vigour, was a general council. Such a council, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they adviſed him, after obtaining the Emperor's conſent, to aſſemble without delay, in one of the great cities of Germany, that all who had a right to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent might deliberate with freedom, and propoſe their opinions with ſuch boldneſs, as the dangerous ſituation of religion at this juncture required <note n="d" place="bottom">Faſcic. Rer. Expet. &amp; Fugiend. p. 346.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE nuncio, more artful than his maſter, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the political views and intereſts of the Roman court, was ſtartled at the propoſition of a council; and eaſily foreſaw how dangerous ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly might prove at a time when many openly denied the papal authority, and the reverence and ſubmiſſion yielded to it viſibly declined among all. For that reaſon he employed his utmoſt addreſs, in order to prevail on the members of the Diet to proceed themſelves with greater ſeverity againſt the Lutheran hereſy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their propoſal concerning a general council to be held in Germany, They, perceiving the nuncio to be more ſolicitous about the intereſts of the Roman court, than the tranquillity of the empire, or purity of the church, remained inflexible, and continued to prepare the catalogue of their grievances to be preſented to the Pope <note n="e" place="bottom">Ibid. 349.</note>. The nuncio, that he might not be the bearer of a remonſtrance ſo diſagreeable to his court, left Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg abruptly, without taking leave of the Diet <note n="f" place="bottom">Ibid. 376.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE ſecular Princes accordingly, for the eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, although they gave no oppoſition, did not think it decent to join with them, drew up the liſt (ſo famous in the German annals) of an hundred grievances which the empire imputed to the iniquitous dominion of the papal ſee. This liſt contained grievances much of the ſame nature with that prepared under the reign of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian. It would be tedious to enumerate each of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011837_0555_0F9D885B2F81C610"/>
them; they complained of the ſums exacted for diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, abſolutions and indulgences; of the expence ariſing from the law-ſuits carried to Rome; of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable abuſes occaſioned by reſervations, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams, and annates; of the exemption from civil juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which the clergy had obtained; of the arts by which they brought all ſecular cauſes under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the eccleſiaſtical judges; of the indecent and profligate lives which not a few of the clergy led; and of various other particulars, many of which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been mentioned among the circumſtances which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the favourable reception, or to the quick progreſs of Luther's doctrines. In the end they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that if the holy ſee did not ſpeedily deliver them from thoſe intolerable burdens, they had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to endure them no longer, and would employ the power and authority with which God had entruſted them, in order to procure relief <note n="g" place="bottom">Faſcic. Rer. Expet. &amp; Fugiend. 354.</note>.</p>
                  <p>INSTEAD of ſuch ſeverities againſt Luther and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers as the nuncio had recommended, the <hi>receſs</hi> or edict of the Diet contained only a general injunction to all ranks of men to wait with patience for the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the council which was to be aſſembled, and in the mean time not to publiſh any new opinions, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the eſtabliſhed doctrines of the church; together with an admonition to all preachers to abſtain from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controverſy in their diſcourſes to the people, and to confine themſelves to the plain and inſtructive truths of religion <note n="h" place="bottom">Ibid. 348.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE reformers derived great advantage from the tranſactions of this Diet, as they afforded them the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt authentic evidence that groſs corruptions prevailed in the court of Rome, and that the empire was loaded by the clergy with inſupportable burthens. With regard to the former, they had now the teſtimony of the Pope himſelf, that their invectives and accuſations were not malicious or ill-founded. As to the latter, the repreſentatives of the Germanick body, in an aſſembly where the patrons of the new opinions were far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt numerous or powerful, had pointed out as
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:011837_0556_0F9D885BEFA46558"/>
the chief grievances of the empire, thoſe very practices of the Romiſh church againſt which Luther and his diſciples were accuſtomed to declaim. Accordingly, in all their controverſial writings after this period, they often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Adrian's declaration, and to the hundred griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, in confirmation of whatever they advanced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the diſſolute manners, or inſatiable ambition and rapaciouſneſs of the papal court.</p>
                  <p>AT Rome, Adrian's conduct was conſidered as a proof of the moſt childiſh ſimplicity and imprudence. Men trained up amidſt the artifices and corruptions of the papal court, and accuſtomed to judge of actions not by what was juſt, but by what was uſeful, were aſtoniſhed at a Pontiff, who, departing from the wiſe maxims of his predeceſſors, acknowledged diſorders which he ought to have concealed; and forgetting his own dignity, aſked advice of thoſe, to whom he was entitled to preſcribe. By ſuch an exceſs of impolitic ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, they were afraid, that inſtead of reclaiming, he would render the enemies of the church more preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and inſtead of extinguiſhing hereſy, would weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the foundations of the papal power, or ſtop the chief ſources from which wealth flowed into the church <note n="i" place="bottom">F. Paul. Hiſt. of Counc. p. 28. Pallavic. Hiſt. 58</note>. For this reaſon they induſtriouſly oppoſed all his ſchemes of reformation, and by throwing objections and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in his way, endeavoured to retard or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the execution of them. Adrian, amazed on the one hand, at the obſtinacy of the Lutherans, diſguſted, on the other, with the manners and maxims of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and finding himſelf unable to correct either the one or the other, often lamented his own ſituation, and often looked back with pleaſure on that period of his life when he was only dean of Louvain, a more humble but happier ſtation, in which little was expected from him, and there was nothing to fruſtrate his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions <note n="k" place="bottom">

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011837_0557_0F9D885CB0E5B340"/>
was animated not only with the averſion which all Popes naturally bear to a council, but having gained his own election by means very uncanonical, he was afraid of an aſſembly that might ſubject it to a ſcrutiny which it could not ſtand. He determined, therefore, to elude by every poſſible means the demands of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, both with reſpect to the calling of a council, and reforming abuſes in the papal court, which the raſhneſs and incapacity of his predeceſſor had brought upon him. For this purpoſe he made choice of Cardinal Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio, an artful man, often entruſted by the Popes with negociations of importance, as his nuncio to the Diet of the empire aſſembled again at Nuremberg.</p>
                  <p>CAMPEGGIO, without taking any notice of what had paſſed in the laſt meeting, exhorted the Diet in a long diſcourſe, to execute the edict of Worms with vigour, as the only effectual means of ſuppreſſing Luther's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. The Diet, in return, deſired to know the Pope's intentions concerning the council, and the redreſs of the hundred grievances. The former, the nuncio endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to elude by general and unmeaning declarations of the Pope's reſolution to purſue ſuch meaſures as would be for the greateſt good of the church. With regard to the latter, as the catalogue of grievances did not reach Rome till after Adrian's death, and of conſequence had not been regularly laid before the preſent Pope, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peggio took advantage of this circumſtance to decline making any definitive anſwer to them in Clement's name; though, at the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me, he obſerved that their catalogue of grievances contained many particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely indecent and undutiful, and that the publiſhing it by their own authority was highly diſreſpectful to the Roman ſee. In the end, he renewed his demand of their proceeding with rigour againſt Luther and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents; but though an ambaſſador from the Emperor, who was at that time very ſolicitous to gain the Pope, warmly ſeconded the nuncio, with many profeſſions of his maſter's zeal for the honour and dignity of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſee, the <hi>receſs</hi> of the Diet was conceived in terms of almoſt the ſame import with the former, without enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any additional ſeverity againſt Luther and his party <note n="l" place="bottom">Seckend. 286.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK IV.</head>
                  <p>THE expulſion of the French, both out of the Milaneſe, and the republick of Genoa, was conſidered by the Italians, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the war between Charles and Francis; and as they began immediately to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the Emperor, when they ſaw no power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Italy capable either to controul or oppoſe him, they longed ardently for the re-eſtabliſhment of peace. Having procured the reſtoration of Sforza to his paternal dominions, which had been their chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for entering into a confederacy with Charles, they plainly diſcovered their intention to contribute no longer towards increaſing the Emperor's ſuperiority over his rival, which was already the object of their jealouſy. The Pope, eſpecially, whoſe natural timidity increaſed his ſuſpicions of Charles's deſigns, endeavoured by his ambaſſadors and remonſtrances to inſpire him with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and incline him to peace.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Emperor, intoxicated with ſucceſs, and urged on by his own ambition, no leſs than by Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon's deſire of revenge, contemned Clement's admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and declared his reſolution of ordering his army to paſs the Alps, and to invade Provence, a part of his
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:011837_0560_0F9D885EEF842770"/>
rival's dominions where he leaſt dreaded an attack, and was leaſt prepared to reſiſt it. His moſt experienced miniſters diſſuaded him from undertaking ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize with a feeble army, and an exhauſted treaſury: But he relied ſo much on having obtained the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the King of England, and on the hopes which Bourbon, with the confidence and credulity natural to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles, entertained of being joined by a numerous body of his partiſans as ſoon as the Imperial troops ſhould enter France, that he perſiſted obſtinately in the meaſure. Henry undertook to furniſh an hundred thouſand ducats towards defraying the expence of the expedition during the firſt month, and had it in his choice either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the payment of that ſum monthly, or to invade Picardy before the end of July with a powerful army. The Emperor engaged to attack Guienne at the ſame time with a conſiderable body of men, and if theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes proved ſucceſsful, they agreed that Bourbon, beſides the territories he had loſt, ſhould be put in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Provence, with the title of King, and ſhould do homage to Henry as the lawful King of France, for his new dominions. Of all the parts of this extenſive but extravagant project, the invaſion of Provence was the only one which was executed. For although Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, with a ſcrupulous delicacy, altogether unexpected, after the part he had acted, poſitively refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Henry's title to the crown of France, and thereby abſolved him from any obligation to promote the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, Charles's eagerneſs to carry his own plan into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution did not in any degree abate. The army he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for that purpoſe amounted only to eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; the ſupreme command of which was given to the Marquis de Peſcara, with inſtructions to pay the greateſt deference to Bourbon's advice in all his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Peſcara paſſed the Alps without oppoſition, and entering Provence, laid ſiege to Marſeilles. Bourbon had adviſed him rather to march towards Lyons, in the neigbourhood of which city his territories were ſituated, and where of courſe his influence was moſt extenſive: But the Emperor was ſo deſirous to get poſſeſſion of a port, which would, at all times, ſecure him eaſy acceſs into France, that by his authority he over-ruled the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable's

                  <p>FRANCIS, who foreſaw, but was unable to prevent this attempt, took the moſt proper precautions to defeat it. He laid waſte the adjacent country, in order to render it more difficult for the enemy to ſubſiſt their army; he razed the ſuburbs of the city, ſtrengthened its fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and threw into it a numerous garriſon under the command of brave and experienced officers. To theſe, nine thouſand of the citizens, whom their dread of the Spaniſh yoke inſpired with contempt of danger, joined themſelves; by their united courage and induſtry, all the efforts of Peſcara's military ſkill, and of Bourbon's activity and revenge, were rendered abortive. Francis, meanwhile, had leiſure to aſſemble a powerful army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the walls of Avignon, and no ſooner began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards Marſeilles, than the Imperial troops, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the fatigues of a ſiege which had laſted forty days, weakened by diſeaſes, and almoſt deſtitute of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, retired with precipitation towards Italy <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 277.

                     <pb n="154" facs="unknown:011837_0562_0F9D88607036A2D8"/>IF the King of France had been ſatisfied with having delivered his ſubjects from this formidable invaſion, and having ſhewn all Europe the facility with which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtrength of his dominions enabled him to reſiſt the impreſſions of a foreign enemy, even when ſeconded by the abilities and powerful efforts of a rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the campaign, notwithſtanding the loſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe, would have been far from ending ingloriouſly. But Francis, animated with courage more becoming a ſoldier than a general; puſhed on by ambition, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing rather than conſiderate; and too apt to be elated with ſucceſs; was fond of every undertaking that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bold and adventurous. Such an undertaking the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of his affairs at that juncture, naturally preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his view. He had under his command one of the moſt powerful and beſt appointed armies France had ever brought into the field, which he could not think of diſbanding without having employed it in any ſervice. The Imperial troops had been obliged to retire almoſt ruined by hard duty, and diſheartened with ill ſucceſs; the Milaneſe had been left altogether without defence; it was not impoſſible to reach that country before Peſcara, with his ſhattered forces, could arrive there; or if fear ſhould add ſpeed to their retreat, they were in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make head againſt his freſh and numerous troops; and Milan would now, as in former inſtances, ſubmit without reſiſtance to a bold invader. Thoſe conſiderations, which were not deſtitute of plauſibility, appeared to his ſanguine temper to be of the utmoſt weight. In vain did his wiſeſt miniſters and generals repreſent to him the danger of taking the field at a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo far advanced, with an army compoſed chiefly of Swiſs and Germans, to whoſe caprices he would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in all his operations, and on whoſe fidelity his ſafety muſt abſolutely depend. In vain did Louiſe of Savoy advance by haſty journies towards Provence, that ſhe might exert all her authority in diſſuading her ſon from ſuch a raſh enterprize. Francis diſregarded the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances of his ſubjects; and that he might ſave himſelf the pain of an interview with his mother, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels he had determined to reject, he began his march before her arrival; appointing her, however, by way of
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011837_0563_0F9D88612F8033B8"/>
atonement for that neglect, to be regent of the kingdom during his abſence. Bonnivet, by his perſuaſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to confirm Francis in this reſolution. That favourite, who ſtrongly reſembled his maſter in all the defective parts of his character, was led by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impetuoſity, warmly to approve of ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and being prompted, beſides, by his impatience to reviſit a Milaneſe lady, of whom he had been deeply enamoured during his late expedition, he is ſaid, by his flattering deſcriptions of her beauty and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to have inſpired Francis, who was extremely ſuſceptible of ſuch paſſions, with an equal deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her <note n="d" place="bottom">

                  <p>THE French paſſed the Alps at mount Cenis; and as their ſucceſs depended on diſpatch, they advanced with the greateſt diligence. Peſcara, who had been obliged to take a longer and more difficult rout by Monaco and Final, was ſoon informed of their intention; and being ſenſible that nothing but the preſence of his troops could ſave the Milaneſe, marched with ſuch rapidity, that he reached Alva on the ſame day that the French army ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Vercelli. Francis, inſtructed by Bonnivet's er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the former campaign, advanced directly towards Milan, where the unexpected approach of an enemy ſo powerful, occaſioned ſuch conſternation and diſorder, that although Peſcara entered the city with ſome of his beſt troops, he found that the defence of it could not be undertaken with any probability of ſucceſs; and having thrown a garriſon into the citadel, retired through one gate, while the French were admitted at another <note n="e" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 81. Guic. l. 15. 278.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THESE briſk motions of the French Monarch diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed all the ſchemes of defence which the Imperialiſts had formed. Never, indeed, did generals attempt to oppoſe a formidable invaſion under ſuch circumſtances of diſadvantage. Though Charles poſſeſſed dominions more extenſive than any other Prince in Europe, and had, at this time, no other army but that which was employed in Lombardy, which did not amount to ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men, his prerogative in all his different
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011837_0564_0F9D8861F0325930"/>
ſtates was ſo limited, and his ſubjects, without whoſe conſent he could raiſe no taxes, diſcovered ſuch unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to burthen themſelves with new and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary impoſitions, that even this ſmall body of troops was in want of pay, of ammunition, of proviſions, and of cloathing. In ſuch a ſituation, it required all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Lannoy, the intrepidity of Peſcara, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable reſentment of Bourbon, to preſerve them from ſinking under deſpair, and to inſpire them with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attempt, or ſagacity to diſcover what was eſſential to their ſafety. To the efforts of their genius, and the activity of their zeal, the Emperor was more indebted for the preſervation of his Italian dominions than to his own power. Lannoy, by mortgaging the revenues of Naples, procured ſome money, which was immediately applied towards providing the army with whatever was moſt neceſſary <note n="f" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 280.</note>. Peſcara, beloved and almoſt adored by the Spaniſh troops, exhorted them to ſhew the world, by their engaging to ſerve the Emperor, in that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exigency, without making any immediate demand of pay, that they were animated with ſentiments of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour very different from thoſe of mercenary ſoldiers, to which propoſition, that gallant body of men, with an unexampled generoſity gave their conſent <note n="g" place="bottom">Jovii Vit.

                  <p>FRANCIS, by a fatal error, allowed the Emperor's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals time to derive advantage from all theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Inſtead of purſuing the enemy, who retired to Lodi on the Adda, an untenable poſt, which Peſcara had reſolved to abandon on his approach, he, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the opinion of Bonnivet, though contrary to that of his other generals, laid ſiege to Pavia on the Teſino; a town, indeed, of great importance, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of which would have opened to him all the fertile country lying on the banks of that river. But the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011837_0565_0F9D8862B16416B8"/>
of the place were ſtrong; it was dangerous to undertake a difficult ſiege at ſo late a ſeaſon; and the Imperial generals, ſenſible of its conſequence, had thrown into the town a garriſon of ſix thouſand veterans, under the command of Antonio de Leyva, an officer of high rank; of great experience; of a patient but enterprizing courage; fertile in reſources; ambitious of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf; and capable, for that reaſon, as well as from his having been long accuſtomed both to obey and to command, of ſuffering or performing any thing in order to procure ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS proſecuted the ſiege with obſtinacy equal to the raſhneſs with which he had undertaken it. During three months, every thing known to the engineers of that age, or that could be effected by the valour of his troops, was attempted in order to reduce the place; while Lannoy and Peſcara, unable to obſtruct his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, were obliged to remain in ſuch an ignominious ſtate of inaction, that a Paſquinade was publiſhed at Rome, offering a reward to any perſon who could find the Imperial army, loſt in the month of October in the mountains between France and Lombardy, and which had not been heard of ſince that time <note n="i" place="bottom">Sandov. i. 608.</note>.</p>
                  <p>LEYVA, well acquainted with the difficulties under which his countrymen laboured, and the impoſſibility of their facing, in the field, ſuch a powerful army as form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſiege of Pavia, placed his only hopes of ſafety in his own vigilance and valour. The efforts of both were extraordinary, and in proportion to the importance of the place, with the defence of which he was entruſted. He interrupted the approaches of the French by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and furious ſallies. Behind the breaches which their artillery made, he erected new works, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſcarce inferior in ſtrength to the original fortifications. He repulſed the beſiegers in all their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults; and by his own example, brought not only the garriſon, but the inhabitants to bear the moſt intolerable fatigues, and to encounter the greateſt dangers without murmuring. The rigour of the ſeaſon conſpired with his endeavours in retarding the progreſs of the French.
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:011837_0566_0F9D886371F058F8"/>
Francis attempting to become maſter of the town, by diverting the courſe of the Teſino, which is its defence on one ſide, a ſudden inundation of the river deſtroyed, in one day, the labour of many weeks, and ſwept away all the mounds which his army had raiſed with infinite toil, as well as at great expence <note n="k" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 280. Ulloa Vita di Carlo V. p. 95.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the ſlow progreſs of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers, and the glory which Leyva acquired by his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant defence, it was not doubted but that the town would at laſt be obliged to ſurrender. The Pope, who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſidered the French arms as ſuperior in Italy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came impatient to diſengage himſelf from his connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Emperor, of whoſe deſigns he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely jealous; and to enter into terms of friendſhip with Francis. As Clement's timid and cautious temper rendered him incapable of following the bold plan which Leo had formed of delivering Italy from the yoke of both the rivals, he returned to the more obvious and practicable ſcheme of employing the power of the one to balance and to reſtrain that of the other. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he did not diſſemble his ſatisfaction at ſeeing the French King recover Milan, as he hoped that the dread of ſuch a neighbour would be ſome check upon the Emperor's ambition, which no power in Italy was now able to controul. He laboured hard to bring about a peace that would ſecure Francis in poſſeſſion of his new conqueſts; and as Charles, who was always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible in the proſecution of his ſchemes, rejected the propoſition with diſdain, and with bitter exclamations againſt the Pope, by whoſe perſuaſions, while Cardinal de Medici, he had been induced to invade the Milaneſe, Clement immediately concluded a treaty of neutrality with the King of France, in which the republick of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was included <note n="l" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 282. 285.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS having by this tranſaction, deprived the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of his two moſt powerful allies, and at the ſame time having ſecured a paſſage for his own troops thro' their territories, formed a ſcheme of attacking the kingdom of Naples, hoping either to over-run that
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:011837_0567_0F9D88642F769AB0"/>
country, which was left altogether without defence, or that at leaſt ſuch an unexpected invaſion would oblige the viceroy to recal part of the Imperial army out of the Milaneſe. For this purpoſe he ordered ſix thouſand men to march under the command of John Stuart Duke of Albany. But Peſcara foreſeeing that the effect of this diverſion would depend entirely upon the operations of the armies in the Milaneſe, perſuaded Lannoy to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Albany's motions <note n="m" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 285.</note>, and to bend his whole force againſt the King himſelf; ſo that Francis not only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his army very unſeaſonably by this great detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but incurred the reproach of engaging too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in chimerical and extravagant projects.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the garriſon of Pavia was reduced to extremity; their ammunitions and proviſions began to fail; the Germans, of whom it was chiefly compoſed, having received no pay for ſeven months <note n="n" place="bottom">Gold. Polit. Imperial. 875.</note>, threatened to deliver the town into the enemies hands, and could ſcarce be retained from mutiny by all Leyva's addreſs and authority. The Imperial generals, who were no ſtrangers to his ſituation, ſaw the neceſſity of marching without loſs of time to his relief. This they had now in their power: Twelve thouſand Germans, whom the zeal and activity of Bourbon taught to move with unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual rapidity, had entered Lombardy under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and rendered the Imperial army nearly equal to that of the French, greatly diminiſhed by the abſence of the body under Albany, as well as by the fatigues of the ſiege, and the rigour of the ſeaſon. But the more their troops increaſed in number, the more ſenſibly did they feel the diſtreſs ariſing from want of money. Far from having funds for paying a powerful army, they had ſcarce what was ſufficient for defraying the charges of conducting their artillery, and of carrying their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and proviſions. The abilities of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, however, ſupplied every defect. By their own example, as well as by magnificent promiſes, in the name of the Emperor, they prevailed on the troops of all the different nations which compoſed their army, to take the field without pay; they engaged to lead them
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:011837_0568_0F9D8864EFC28830"/>
directly towards the enemy; and flattered them with the certain proſpect of victory, which would at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them with ſuch royal ſpoils as would be an ample reward for all their ſervices. The ſoldiers, ſenſible that by quitting the army, they would forfeit the vaſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears due to them, and eager to get poſſeſſion of the promiſed treaſures, demanded a battle with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of adventurers who fought only for plunder <note n="m" place="bottom">Eryci Peuteani Hiſt. Ciſalpina ap. Graevii Theſ. Antiquit. Ital. iii. p. 1170, 1179.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Imperial generals, without ſuffering the ardour of their troops to cool, advanced immediately towards the French camp. On the firſt intelligence of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Francis called a council of war, to deliberate what courſe he ought to take. All his officers of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt experience were unanimous in adviſing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and to decline a battle with an enemy who courted it from deſpair. The leaders of the Imperialiſts, they obſerved, would either be obliged in a few weeks to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band an army, which they were unable to pay, and which they kept together only by the hope of pillage, or the ſoldiers enraged at the non-performance of the promiſes to which they had truſted, would riſe in ſome furious mutiny which would allow them to think of nothing but their own ſafety: That, meanwhile, he might encamp in ſome ſtrong poſt, and waiting in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the arrival of freſh troops from France and Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, might, before the end of ſpring, take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all the Milaneſe, without danger, or bloodſhed. But in oppoſition to them, Bonnivet, whoſe deſtiny it was to give counſels fatal to France during the whole campaign, repreſented the ignominy it would reflect on their Sovereign if he ſhould abandon a ſiege which he had proſecuted ſo long, or turn his back before an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to whom he was ſtill ſuperior in number; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the neceſſity of fighting the Imperialiſts rather than relinquiſh an undertaking, on the ſucceſs of which the King's future fame depended. Unfortunately, Francis's notions of honour were delicate to an exceſs that bordered on what was romantic. Having often ſaid that he would take Pavia, or periſh in the attempt,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:011837_0569_0F9D8865AFD0B900"/>
he thought himſelf bound not to depart from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and rather than expoſe himſelf to the ſlighteſt imputation, he choſe to forego all the advantages which were the certain conſequences of a retreat, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to wait for the Imperialiſts before the walls of Pavia <note n="n" place="bottom">Guic. l. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Imperial generals found the French ſo ſtrongly entrenched, that notwithſtanding the powerful motives which urged them on, they heſitated long before they ventured to attack them; but at laſt, the neceſſities of the beſieged, and the murmurs of their own ſoldiers obliged them to put every thing to hazard. Never did armies engage with greater ardour, or with an higher opinion of the importance of the battle they were going to fight; never were troops more ſtrongly animated with emulation, national antipathy, mutual reſentment, and all the paſſions which inſpire obſtinate bravery. On the one hand, a gallant young Monarch, ſeconded by a generous nobility, and followed by ſubjects to whoſe natural impetuoſity, indignation at the oppoſition they had encountered, added new force, contended for victory and honour. On the other ſide, troops more completely diſciplined, and conducted by generals of greater abilities, fought from neceſſity, with courage heightened by deſpair. The Imperialiſts, however, were unable to reſiſt the firſt efforts of the French va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and their firmeſt battalions began to give way. But the fortune of the day was quickly changed. The Swiſs in the ſervice of France, unmindful of the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their country for fidelity and martial glory, abandoned their poſt in a cowardly manner. Levya, with his garriſon, ſallied out and attacked the rear of the French during the heat of the action with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as threw it into confuſion; and Peſcara falling on their cavalry, with the Imperial horſe, among whom he had prudently intermingled a conſiderable number of Spaniſh foot, armed with the heavy muſkets then in uſe, broke this formidable body by an unuſual method of attack againſt which they were wholly unprovided. The rout became univerſal; and reſiſtance ceaſed in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

every part, but where the King was in perſon, who fought now, not for fame or victory, but for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Though wounded in ſeveral places, and thrown from his horſe, which was killed under him, Francis defended himſelf on foot with an heroic courage. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his braveſt officers gathering round him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave his life at the expence of their own, fell at his feet. Among theſe was Bonnivet, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this great calamity, who alone died unlamented. The King, exhauſted with fatigue, and ſcarce capable of farther reſiſtance, was left almoſt alone, expoſed to the fury of ſome Spaniſh ſoldiers, ſtrangers to his rank, and enraged at his obſtinacy. At that moment came up Pomperant, a French gentleman, who had entered together with Bourbon into the Emperor's ſervice, and placing himſelf by the ſide of the Monarch againſt whom he had rebelled, aſſiſted in protecting him from the violence of the ſoldiers; at the ſame time beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſurrender to Bourbon, who was not far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Imminent as the danger was which now ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Francis, he rejected with indignation the thoughts of an action which would have afforded ſuch matter of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to his traiterous ſubject; and calling for Lannoy, who happened likewiſe to be near at hand, gave up his ſword to him; which he, kneeling to kiſs the King's hand, received with profound reſpect; and taking his own ſword from his ſide, preſented it to him, ſaying, That it did not become ſo great a Monarch to remain diſarmed in the preſence of one of the Emperor's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <note n="o" place="bottom">Guic. l. 15. 292.

                  <p>TEN thouſand men fell on this day, one of the moſt fatal France had ever ſeen. Among theſe were many noblemen of the higheſt diſtinction, who choſe rather to periſh than to turn their backs with diſhonour. Not a few were taken priſoners, of whom the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous was Henry D'Albret, the unfortunate King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre. A ſmall body of the rear-guard made its eſcape under the command of the Duke Alenſon; the feeble

garriſon of Milan on the firſt news of the defeat, retired without being purſued, by another road; and in two weeks after the battle, not a Frenchman remained in Italy.</p>
                  <p>LANNOY, though he treated Francis with all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marks of honour due to his rank and character, guarded him with the utmoſt attention. He was ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, not only to prevent any poſſibility of his eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but afraid that his own troops might ſeize his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and detain it as the beſt ſecurity for the payment of their arrears. In order to provide againſt both theſe dangers, he conducted Francis, the day after the battle, to the ſtrong caſtle of Pizzichitonè, near Cremona, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to the cuſtody of Don Ferdinand Alarcon, general of the Spaniſh infantry, an officer of great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and of ſtrict honour, but remarkable for that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and ſcrupulous vigilance which ſuch a truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Francis, who formed a judgment of the Emperor's diſpoſitions by his own, was extremely deſirous that Charles ſhould be informed of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fondly hoping, that from his generoſity or ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, he would obtain ſpeedy relief. The Imperial ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals were no leſs impatient to give their Sovereign an early account of the deciſive victory which they had gained, and to receive his inſtructions with regard to their future conduct. As the moſt certain and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious method of conveying intelligence to Spain, at that ſeaſon of the year, was by land, Francis gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendador Pennaloſa, who was charged with Lannoy's diſpatches, a paſſport to travel through France.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES received the account of this ſignal and unexpected ſucceſs that had crowned his arms, with a moderation, which, if it had been real, would have done him more honour than the greateſt victory. Without uttering one word expreſſive of exultation, or of intemperate joy, he retired immediately into his chapel, and having ſpent an hour in offering up his thankſgivings to heaven, returned to the preſence-chamber, which by that time was filled with grandees and foreign ambaſſadors, aſſembled in order to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate him: He accepted of their compliments with a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011837_0572_0F9D8867EFE903C0"/>
modeſt deportment; he lamented the misfortune of the captive King, as a ſtriking example of the ſad reverſe of fortune, to which the moſt powerful Monarchs are ſubject; he forbad any publick rejoicings, as indecent in a war carried on among Chriſtians, reſerving them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſhould obtain a victory equally illuſtrious over the Infidels; and ſeemed to take pleaſure in the advantage he had gained, only as it would prove the occaſion of reſtoring peace to Chriſtendom <note n="p" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. i. 651. Ulloa Vita dell Carlo V. p. 110.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES, however, had already begun to form ſchemes in his own mind, which little ſuited ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal appearances. Ambition, not generoſity, was the ruling paſſion in his mind; and the victory at Pavia opened ſuch new and unbounded proſpects of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as allured him with irreſiſtible force: But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no eaſy matter to execute the vaſt deſigns which he meditated, he thought it neceſſary, while proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were taking for that purpoſe, to affect the greateſt moderation, hoping under that veil to conceal his real intentions from the other Princes of Europe.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE France was filled with conſternation. The King himſelf had early tranſmitted an account of the rout at Pavia in a letter to his mother, delivered by Pennaloſa, which contained only theſe words: "Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, all is loſt except our honour." Thoſe who ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they arrived from Italy, brought ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy detail of particulars, as made all ranks of men ſenſibly feel the greatneſs and extent of the calamity. France, without its Sovereign, without money in her treaſury, without an army, without officers to command it, and encompaſſed on all ſides by a victorious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive enemy, ſeemed to be on the very brink of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But on that occaſion the great abilities of Louiſe the Regent ſaved the kingdom, which the violence of her paſſions had more than once expoſed to the greateſt danger. Inſtead of giving herſelf up to ſuch lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were natural to a woman ſo remarkable for her maternal tenderneſs, ſhe diſcovered all the foreſight, and exerted all the activity of a conſumate politician. She aſſembled the nobles at Lyons, and animated them
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011837_0573_0F9D8868B10535A8"/>
by her example no leſs than by her words, with ſuch zeal in defence of their country as its preſent ſituation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. She collected the remains of the army which had ſerved in Italy, ranſomed the priſoners, paid their arrears, and put them in a condition to take the field. She levied new troops, provided for the ſecurity of the frontiers, and raiſed ſums ſufficient for defraying theſe extraordinary expences. Her chief care, however, was to appeaſe the reſentment, or to gain the friendſhip of the King of England; and from that quarter, the firſt ray of comfort broke in upon the French affairs.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH Henry, in entering into alliances with Charles or Francis, ſeldom followed any regular or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed plan of policy, but was influenced chiefly by the caprice of temporary paſſions, ſuch occurrences often happened as recalled his attention towards that equal balance of power which it was neceſſary to keep between the two contending potentates, the preſervation of which he always boaſted to be his peculiar office. He had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that his union with the Emperor might afford him an opportunity of recovering ſome part of thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories in France which had belonged to his anceſtors, and for the ſake of ſuch an acquiſition he did not ſcruple to give his aſſiſtance towards raiſing Charles to a conſiderable pre-eminence above Francis. He had never dreamt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of any event ſo deciſive and ſo fatal as the victory at Pavia, which ſeemed not only to have broken, but to have annihilated the power of one of the rivals; ſo that the proſpect of the ſudden and entire revolution which this would occaſion in the political ſyſtem, filled him with the moſt diſquieting apprehenſions. He ſaw all Europe in danger of being over-run by an ambitious Prince, to whoſe power there now remained no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe; and though he himſelf might at firſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in quality of an ally, to ſome ſhare in the ſpoils of the captive Monarch, it was eaſy to diſcern that with regard to the manner of making the partition, as well as his ſecurity for keeping poſſeſſion of what ſhould be allotted him, he muſt abſolutely depend upon the will of a confederate, to whoſe forces his own bore no proportion. He was ſenſible that if Charles were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to add any conſiderable part of France to the vaſt
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:011837_0574_0F9D88696F5E6B48"/>
dominions of which he was already maſter, his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood would be much more formidable to England than that of the antient French Kings; while, at the ſame time, the proper balance on the continent, to which England owed both its ſafety and importance, would be entirely loſt. Concern for the ſituation of the unhappy Monarch co-operated with theſe political conſiderations; his gallant behaviour in the battle of Pavia had excited an high degree of admiration, which never fails of augmenting ſympathy; and Henry, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuſceptible of generous ſentiments, was fond of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as the deliverer of a vanquiſhed enemy from a ſtate of captivity. The paſſions of the Engliſh miniſter, ſeconded the inclinations of the Monarch. Wolſey, who had not forgot the diſappointment of his hopes in two ſucceſſive conclaves, which he imputed chiefly to the Emperor, thought this a proper opportunity of taking revenge; and Louiſe courting the friendſhip of England with ſuch flattering ſubmiſſions, as were no leſs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the King than to the Cardinal, Henry gave her ſecret aſſurances that he would not lend his aid towards oppreſſing France, in its preſent helpleſs ſtate, and obliged her to promiſe that ſhe would not conſent to diſmember the kingdom, even in order to procure her ſon's liberty <note n="q" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 94. Guic. l. 16. 318. Herbert.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT as Henry's connections with the Emperor made it neceſſary to act in ſuch a manner, as to ſave appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, he ordered public rejoicings to be made in his dominions for the ſucceſs of the Imperial arms; and as if he had been eager to ſeize the preſent opportunity of ruining the French monarchy, he ſent ambaſſadors to Madrid, to congratulate with Charles upon his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; to put him in mind, that he, as his ally, engaged in one common cauſe, was entitled to partake in the fruits of it; and to require that in compliance with the terms of their confederacy, he would invade Guienne with a powerful army, in order to give him poſſeſſion of that province. At the ſame time, he offered to ſend the Princeſs Mary into Spain or the Low-Countries, that ſhe might be educated under the Emperor's direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011837_0575_0F9D886A2FDE8440"/>
until the concluſion of the marriage agreed on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and in return for that mark of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he inſiſted that Francis ſhould be delivered to him, in conſequence of that article in the treaty of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereby each of the contracting parties was bound to ſurrender all uſurpers to him whoſe rights they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. It was impoſſible that Henry could expect that the Emperor would liſten to theſe extravagant demands, which it was neither his intereſt, nor in his power to grant. They appear evidently to have been made with no other intention than to furniſh him with a decent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for entering into ſuch engagements with France as the juncture required <note n="r" place="bottom">Herbert, p. 64.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IT was among the Italian ſtates, that the victory at Pavia occaſioned the greateſt alarm and terror. That balance of power on which they relied for their ſecurity, and which it had been the conſtant object of all their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations and refinements to maintain, was deſtroyed in a moment. They were expoſed by their ſituation to feel the firſt effects of the uncontrouled authority Charles had acquired. They obſerved many ſymptoms of a boundleſs ambition in that young Prince, and were ſenſible, that as Emperor, or King of Naples, he could either form dangerous pretenſions upon each of their territories, or invade them with great advantage. They deliberated, therefore, with much ſolicitude concerning the means of raiſing ſuch a force as might obſtruct his progreſs <note n="s" place="bottom">Guic. l. 16. 300. Ruſcelli Lettere de Princ. ii. 74, 76, &amp;c. Thuani Hiſt. lib. i. c. 11.</note>. But their conſultations, conducted with little union, and executed with leſs vigour, had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Clement, inſtead of purſuing the meaſures which he had concerted with the Venetians for ſecuring the liberty of Italy, was ſo intimidated by Lannoy's threats, or overcome by his promiſes, that he entered into a ſeparate treaty, binding himſelf to advance a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum in return for certain emoluments which he was to receive. The money was inſtantly paid; Charles afterwards refuſed to ratify the treaty; and the Pope remained expoſed at once to infamy and to ridicule; to
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011837_0576_0F9D886AF0221138"/>
the former, becauſe he had deſerted the publick cauſe for his private intereſt; to the latter, becauſe he had been a loſer by that unworthy action <note n="t" place="bottom">Guic. l. 16. 305. Mauroceni Hiſtor. Venet ap Iſtorichi delle coſe Venez. V. 131, 136.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HOW diſhonourable ſoever the artifice might be which was employed in order to defraud the Pope of this ſum, it came very ſeaſonably into the viceroy's hands, and put it in his power to extricate himſelf out of an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. Soon after the defeat of the French army, the German troops which had defended Pavia with ſuch meritorious courage and perſeverance, growing inſolent upon the fame they had acquired, and impatient of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying any longer on fruitleſs promiſes with which they had been ſo often amuſed, rendered themſelves maſters of the town, with a reſolution to keep poſſeſſion of it as a ſecurity for the payment of their arrears, and the reſt of the army diſcovered a much ſtronger inclination to aſſiſt, than to puniſh the mutineers. By dividing among them the money exacted from the Pope, Lannoy quieted the tumultuous Germans; but though this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their preſent demands, he had ſo little proſpect of being able to pay them or his other forces regularly for the future, and was under ſuch continual apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their ſeizing the perſon of the captive King, that not long after, he was obliged to diſmiſs all the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and Italians in the Imperial ſervice <note n="u" place="bottom">Guic. l. 16. p. 302.</note>. Thus, from a circumſtance that now appears very ſingular, but ariſing naturally from the conſtitution of moſt European governments in the ſixteenth century, while Charles was ſuſpected by all his neighbours of aiming at univerſal monarchy, and while he was really forming vaſt projects of this kind, his revenues were ſo limited, that he could not keep on foot his victorious army, though it did not exceed twenty-four thouſand men.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, Charles, whoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to moderation and diſintereſtedneſs were ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, deliberated with the utmoſt ſolicitude, how he might derive the greateſt advantages from the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of his adverſary. Some of his counſellors adviſed him to treat Francis with the magnanimity that became
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:011837_0577_0F9D886BAF775E00"/>
a victorious Prince, and inſtead of taking advantage of his ſituation to impoſe rigorous conditions, to diſmiſs him on ſuch equal terms, as would bind him for ever to his intereſt by the ties of gratitude and affection, more forcible, as well as more permanent, than any which could be formed by extorted oaths and involuntary ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations. Such an exertion of generoſity is not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to be expected in the conduct of political affairs, and it was far too refined for that Prince to whom it was propoſed. The more obvious, but leſs ſplendid ſcheme of endeavouring to make the utmoſt of Francis's calamity, had a greater number in the council to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, and ſuited better with the Emperor's genius. But though Charles adopted this plan, he did not execute it in a proper manner. Inſtead of making one great effort to penetrate into France with all the forces of Spain and the Low-Countries; inſtead of cruſhing the Italian ſtates before they recovered from the conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the ſucceſs of his arms had occaſioned; he had recourſe to the artifices of intrigue and negociation. This proceeded partly from neceſſity, partly from the natural diſpoſition of his mind. The ſituation of his finances at that time rendered it extremely difficult to carry on any extraordinary armament; and he himſelf having never appeared at the head of his armies, the command of which he had hitherto committed to his generals, was averſe from bold and martial counſels, and truſted more to the arts with which he was acquainted. He laid, beſides, too much ſtreſs upon the victory of Pavia, as if by that event the ſtrength of France had been annihilated, its reſources exhauſted, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom itſelf, no leſs than the perſon of its Monarch, had been ſubjected to his power.</p>
                  <p>FULL of this opinion, he determined to ſet the higheſt price upon Francis's freedom, and having appointed the Count de Roeux to viſit the captive King in his name, he inſtructed him to propoſe the following articles, as the conditions on which he would grant him his liberty; that he ſhould reſtore Burgundy to the Emperor, from whoſe anceſtors it had been unjuſtly wreſted; that he ſhould ſurrender Provence and Dauphinè, that they might be erected into an independent kingdom for the Conſtable
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:011837_0578_0F9D886C6F5687C0"/>
Bourbon; that he ſhould make full ſatisfaction to the King of England for all his claims; and finally, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the pretenſions of France to Naples, Milan, or any other territory in Italy. When Francis, who had hitherto flattered himſelf that he ſhould be treated by the Emperor with the generoſity becoming one great Prince towards another, heard theſe rigorous conditions, he was ſo tranſported with indignation, that drawing his dagger haſtily, he cried out, <q>'Twere better that a King ſhould die thus.</q> Alarcon, alarmed at his vehemence, laid hold on his hand; but though he ſoon recovered greater compoſure, he ſtill declared in the moſt ſolemn manner, that he would rather remain a priſoner during life, than purchaſe liberty by ſuch ignominious conceſſions <note n="x" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 94. Ferrera's Hiſt. ix. 43.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS mortifying diſcovery of the Emperor's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, greatly augmented Francis's chagrin and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under his confinement, and muſt have driven him to abſolute deſpair, if he had not laid hold of the only thing which ſtill could adminiſter to him any comfort. He perſuaded himſelf, that the conditions which Roeux had propoſed, did not flow originally from Charles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but were dictated by the rigorous policy of his Spaniſh council, and that therefore he might hope in one perſonal interview with him, to do more towards haſtening his own deliverance, than could be effected by long negociations paſſing through the ſubordinate hands of his miniſters. Relying on this ſuppoſition, which proceeded from too favourable an opinion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's character, he offered to viſit him in Spain, and was willing to be carried thither as a ſpectacle to that haughty nation. Lannoy employed all his addreſs to confirm him in theſe ſentiments; and concerted with him in ſecret the manner of executing this reſolution. Francis was ſo eager on a ſcheme which ſeemed to open ſome proſpect of liberty, that he furniſhed the gallies neceſſary for the voyage, Charles being at that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſet any fleet to ſea. The viceroy, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating his intentions either to Bourbon or Peſcara, conducted his priſoner toward Genoa, under pretence of tranſporting him by ſea to Naples; though ſoon after they
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:011837_0579_0F9D886D306D7DD0"/>
ſet ſail, he ordered the pilots to ſteer directly for Spain; but the wind happening to carry them near the French coaſt, the unfortunate Monarch had a full proſpect of his own dominions, towards which he caſt many a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful and deſiring look. They landed, however, in a few days at Barcelona, and ſoon after, Francis was lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the Emperor's command, in the Alcazar of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, under the care of the vigilant Alarcon, who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with as much circumſpection as ever <note n="y" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 95. P. Mart. Ep. ult. Guic. l. 16. 323.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A FEW days after Francis's arrival at Madrid, and when he began to be ſenſible of his having relied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foundation on the Emperor's generoſity, Henry VIII. concluded a treaty with the Regent of France, which afforded him ſome hope of liberty from another quarter. Henry's extravagant demands had been receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Madrid with that neglect which they deſerved, and which he probably expected. Charles, intoxicated with proſperity, no longer courted him in that reſpectful and ſubmiſſive manner which pleaſed his haughty tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Wolſey, no leſs haughty than his maſter, was highly irritated at the Emperor's diſcontinuing his wonted careſſes and profeſſions of friendſhip to him. Theſe ſlight offences, added to the weighty conſiderations formerly mentioned, induced Henry to enter into a defenſive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Louiſe, in which all the differences between him and her ſon were adjuſted; at the ſame time, he engaged that he would employ his beſt offices in order to procure the deliverance of his new ally from a ſtate of captivity <note n="z" place="bottom">Herbert. Fiddes's Life of Wolſey, 337.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the open defection of ſuch a powerful confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate affected Charles with deep concern, a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was carrying on in Italy, which threatened him with conſequences ſtill more fatal. The reſtleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing genius of Moronè, chancellor of Milan, gave riſe to this. His revenge had been amply gratified by the expulſion of the French out of Italy, and his vanity no leſs ſoothed by the re-eſtabliſhment of Sforza, to whoſe intereſt he had attached himſelf, in the dutchy of Milan. The delays, however, and evaſions of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:011837_0580_0F9D886DEFE39908"/>
court, in granting Sforza the inveſtiture of his new-acquired territories had long alarmed Moronè; theſe were repeated ſo often, and with ſuch apparent artifice, as became a full proof to his ſuſpicious mind, that the Emperor intended to ſtrip his maſter of that rich coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which he had conquered in his name. Though Charles, in order to quiet the Pope and the Venetians, no leſs jealous of his deſigns than Moronè, gave Sforza, at laſt, the inveſtiture which had been ſo long deſired; the charter was clogged with ſo many reſervations, and ſubjected him to ſuch grievous burdens, as rendered the Duke of Milan a dependant on the Emperor, rather than a vaſſal of the empire, and afforded him ſcarce any other ſecurity for his poſſeſſions, than the good pleaſure of an ambitious ſuperior. Such an acceſſion of power as would have accrued from the addition of the Milaneſe to the kingdom of Naples, was conſidered by Moronè as fatal to the liberties of Italy no leſs than to his own power and importance. Full of this idea, he began to revolve in his mind the poſſibility of reſcuing Italy from the yoke of foreigners, the darling ſcheme, as has been already obſerved, of the Italian politicians in that age, and which it was the great object of their ambition to accompliſh. If to the glory of having been the chief inſtrument of driving the French out of Milan, he could add that of delivering Naples from the dominion of the Spaniards, he thought that nothing would be wanting to compleat his fame. His fertile genius ſoon ſuggeſted to him a project for that purpoſe; a difficult indeed, and daring one, but for that very reaſon, more agreeable to his bold and enterprizing temper.</p>
                  <p>BOURBON and Peſcara were equally enraged at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy's carrying the French King into Spain without their knowledge. The former, being afraid that the two Monarchs might, in his abſence, conclude ſome treaty in which his intereſts would be entirely ſacrificed, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Madrid, in order to guard againſt that danger. The latter, on whom the command of the army now devolved, was obliged to remain in Italy; but in every company, he gave vent to his indignation againſt the viceroy in expreſſions full of rancour and contempt; he accuſed him in a letter to the Emperor of cowardice
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011837_0581_0F9D886EB03049D8"/>
in the time of danger, and of inſolence after a victory, towards the obtaining of which he had contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either by his valour or his conduct; nor did he abſtain from bitter complaints againſt the Emperor himſelf, who had not diſcovered, as he imagined, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſenſe of his merit, nor beſtowed any adequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his ſervices. It was on this diſguſt of Peſcara, that Moronè founded his whole ſyſtem. He knew the boundleſs ambition of his nature, the vaſt extent of his abilities in peace as well as war, and the intrepidity of his mind capable alike of undertaking and of executing the moſt deſperate deſigns. The cantonment of the Spaniſh troops on the frontier of the Milaneſe, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to many interviews between him and Moronè, in which the latter took care frequently to turn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to the tranſactions ſubſequent to the battle of Pavia, a ſubject upon which the Marquis entered wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and with paſſion; and Moronè obſerving his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment to be uniform and violent, artfully pointed out and aggravated every circumſtance that could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its fury. He painted in the ſtrongeſt colours the Emperor's want of diſcernment, as well as of gratitude, in preferring Lannoy to him, and in allowing that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Fleming to diſpoſe of the captive King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting the man to whoſe bravery and wiſdom Charles was indebted for the glory of having him in his power. Having warmed him by ſuch diſcourſes, he then began to inſinuate, that now was the time to be avenged for thoſe inſults, and to acquire immortal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown as the deliverer of his country from the oppreſſion of ſtrangers; that the ſtates of Italy, weary of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and intolerable dominion of Barbarians, were at laſt ready to combine in order to vindicate their own independence; that their eyes were fixed on him as the only leader whoſe genius and good fortune could enſure the happy ſucceſs of that noble enterprize; that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was no leſs practicable than glorious, it being in his power ſo to diſperſe the Spaniſh infantry, the only body of the Emperor's troops in Italy, through the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of the Milaneſe, that, in one night they might be deſtroyed by the people, who, having ſuffered much from their exactions and inſolence, would gladly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011837_0582_0F9D886F6FCCA220"/>
this ſervice; that he might then, without oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, take poſſeſſion of the throne of Naples, the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſtined for him, and a reward not unworthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of liberty to Italy; that the Pope, of whom that kingdom held, and whoſe predeceſſors had diſpoſed of it on many former occaſion, would willingly grant him the right of inveſtiture; that the Venetians, the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, the Duke of Milan, to whom he had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſcheme, together with the French, would be the guarantees of his right; that the Neapolitans would naturally prefer the government of one of their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom they loved and admired, to that odious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſtrangers, to which they had been ſo long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and that the Emperor, aſtoniſhed at a blow ſo unexpected, would find that he had neither troops nor money to reſiſt ſuch a powerful confederacy <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. xvi. l. 325.

                  <p>PESCARA, amazed at the boldneſs and extent of the ſcheme, liſtened attentively to Moronè, but with the countenance of a man loſt in profound and anxious thought. On the one hand, the infamy of betraying his Sovereign under whom he bore ſuch high command, deterred him from the attempt; on the other, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of obtaining a crown allured him to venture upon it. After continuing a ſhort ſpace in ſuſpenſe, the leaſt commendable motives, as is uſual after ſuch delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prevailed, and ambition triumphed over honour. In order, however, to through a colour of decency on his conduct, he inſiſted that ſome learned caſuiſts ſhould give their opinion, "Whether it was lawful for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to take arms againſt his immediate Sovereign, in obedience to the Lord Paramount of whom the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom itſelf was held." Such a reſolution of the caſe, as he expected, was ſoon obtained from the divines and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians both of Rome and Miland; the negociation went forward; and meaſures ſeemed to be taking with great ſpirit for the ſpeedy execution of the deſign.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE Peſcara, either ſhocked at the treachery of the action which he was going to commit, or deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011837_0583_0F9D88703058F018"/>
of its ſucceſs, began to entertain thoughts of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the engagements he had come under. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of Sforza, who happened at that time to be taken ill of a diſtemper which was thought mortal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this reſolution, and determined him to make known the whole conſpiracy to the Emperor, deeming it more prudent to expect the dutchy of Milan from him as the reward of this diſcovery, than to aim at a kingdom to be purchaſed by a ſeries of crimes. This reſolution, however, proved the ſource of actions ſcarce leſs criminal and ignominious. The Emperor, who had already received full information concerning the conſpiracy from other hands, ſeemed to be highly pleaſed with Peſcara's fidelity, and commanded him to continue his intrigues for ſome time with the Pope and Sforza, both that he might diſcover their intentions more fully, and be able to convict them of the crime with greater certainty. Peſcara, conſcious of guilt, as well as ſenſible how ſuſpicious his long ſilence muſt have appeared at Madrid, durſt not decline that diſhonourable office; and to his eternal diſgrace, was obliged to act the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all parts, that of ſeducing with a purpoſe to betray. Conſidering the abilities of the perſons with whom he had to deal, the part was ſcarce leſs difficult, than baſe; but he acted it with ſuch addreſs, as to deceive even the penetrating eye of Moronè, who relying with full confidence on his ſincerity, viſited him at Novara, in order to put the laſt hand to their machinations. Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara received him in an apartment where Antonio de Leyva was placed behind the tapeſtry, that he might overhear and bear witneſs to their converſation; as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronè was returning homewards, that officer ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and to his aſtoniſhment arreſted him priſoner in the Emperor's name. He was conducted to the caſtle of Pavia; and Peſcara, who had ſo lately been his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice, had now the aſſurance to interrogate him as his judge. At the ſame time, the Emperor declared Sforza to have forfeited all right to the dutchy of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, by his engaging in a conſpiracy againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of whom he held; Peſcara, by his command, ſeized on every place in the Milaneſe, except the caſtles of Cremona and Milan, which the unfortunate Duke
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:011837_0584_0F9D8870F0158648"/>
attempting to defend, were cloſely blockaded by the Imperial troops <note n="c" place="bottom">Guic l. 16. 329. Jovii Hiſt. 319. Capella, lib. v. p. 200.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT though this unſucceſsful conſpiracy, inſtead of ſtripping the Emperor of what he already poſſeſſed in Italy, contributed to extend his dominions in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it ſhewed him the neceſſity of coming to ſome agreement with the French King, unleſs he would draw on himſelf a confederacy of all Europe, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of his arms, and his boundleſs and undiſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition, filled with general alarm. He had not hitherto treated Francis with the generoſity which that monarch expected, and ſcarce with the decency due to his ſtation. Inſtead of diſplaying the ſentiments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a great Prince, he ſeems to have acted with the mercenary art of a Corſair, who by the rigorous uſage of his priſoners, endeavours to draw from them an high price for their ranſom. The captive King was confined in an old caſtle, under a keeper whoſe formal auſterity of manners rendered his vigilance ſtill more diſguſtful. He was allowed no exerciſe but that of riding on a mule, ſurrounded with armed guards on horſe-back. Charles, on pretence of its being neceſſary to attend the Cortes aſſembled in Toledo, had gone to reſide in that city, and ſuffered ſeveral weeks to elapſe without viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Francis, though he ſolicited an interview with the moſt preſſing and ſubmiſſive importunity. So many indignities made a deep impreſſion on an high-ſpirited Prince; he began to looſe all reliſh for his uſual amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; his natural gaiety of temper forſook him; and after languiſhing for ſome time, he was ſeized with a dangerous fever, during the violence of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained conſtantly of the unexpected and unprincely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour with which he had been treated, often exclaiming, that now the Emperor would have the ſatiſfaction of his dying in his hands, without having once deigned to ſee his face. The phyſicians, at laſt, deſpaired of his life, and informed the Emperor that they ſaw no hopes of his recovery, unleſs he were gratified with regard to that point on which he ſeemed to be ſo ſtrongly bent. Charles, ſolicitous to preſerve a life, with which all his
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011837_0585_0F9D8871AF7E8220"/>
proſpects of farther advantage from the victory at Pavia muſt have terminated, immediately conſulted his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters concerning the courſe to be taken. In vain did the chancellor Gattinara, the moſt able among them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to him the indecency of his viſiting Francis, if he did not intend to ſet him at liberty immediately upon equal terms; in vain did he point out the infamy to which he would be expoſed, if motives of avarice or ambition ſhould prevail on him to give the captive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch this mark of attention and ſympathy, for which humanity and generoſity had pleaded ſo long without effect. The Emperor, leſs delicate, or leſs ſolicitous about reputation than his miniſter, ſet out for Madrid to viſit his priſoner. The interview was ſhort; Francis being too weak to bear a long converſation. Charles accoſted him in terms full of affection and reſpect, and gave him ſuch promiſes of ſpeedy deliverance and princely treatment, as would have reflected the greateſt honour upon him, if they had flowed from another ſource. Francis graſped at them with the eagerneſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in his ſituation; and cheared with this gleam of hope began to revive from that moment, and ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his wonted health <note n="d" place="bottom">Guic. l. 16. 339. Sandov. Hiſt. i. 665.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HE had ſoon the mortification to find, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Emperor was not better founded than formerly. Charles returned inſtantly to Toledo; all negociations were carried on by his miniſters; and Francis was kept in as ſtrict cuſtody as ever. A new indignity, and that very galling, was added to all theſe he had already ſuffered. Bourbon arrived in Spain about this time, Charles, who had ſo long refuſed to viſit the King, received his rebellious ſubject with the moſt ſtudied reſpect. He met him without the gates of Toledo, embraced him with the greateſt affection, and placing him on his left hand, conducted him to his apartment. Theſe marks of honour to him, were ſo many inſults to the unfortunate Monarch; which he felt in a very ſenſible manner. It afforded him ſome conſolation, however, to obſerve that the ſentiments of the Spaniards differed widely from thoſe of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:011837_0586_0F9D88726F6DB170"/>
That generous people deteſted Bourbon's crime; and notwithſtanding his great talents and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices, they ſhunned all intercourſe with him to ſuch a degree, that Charles having deſired the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Villena to permit Bourbon to reſide in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace while the court remained in Toledo, he politely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "That he could not refuſe gratifying the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in that requeſt;" but added with a Caſtilian dignity of mind, "That he muſt not be ſurprized if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the conſtable departed, he ſhould burn to the ground a houſe, which having been polluted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a traitor, became an unfit habitation for a man of honour <note n="e" place="bottom">Guic. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Emperor himſelf, nevertheleſs, ſeemed to have it much at heart to reward Bourbon's ſervices in a ſignal manner. But as Bourbon inſiſted, in the firſt place, on the accompliſhment of his promiſe of giving him in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage his ſiſter Eleanora, Queen Dowager of Portugal, the honour of which alliance had been one of his chief inducements to rebel againſt his lawful Sovereign; as Francis, in order to prevent ſuch a dangerous union, had offered before he left Italy, to marry that Princeſs; and as Eleanora diſcovered an inclination rather to match with a powerful Monarch, than with his exiled ſubject; all theſe interfering circumſtances created great emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment to Charles, and left him ſcarce any hope of extricating himſelf with decency. But the death of Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cara, who, at the age of thirty-ſix, left behind him the reputation of being one of the greateſt generals and ableſt politicians of that century, happened opportunely at this juncture for his relief. By that event, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the army in Italy became vacant, and Charles, always fertile in his reſources, perſuaded Bourbon, who was in no condition to diſpute his will, to accept the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of general in chief there, together with a grant of the dutchy of Milan forfeited by Sforza, and in return for theſe, to relinquiſh all hopes of marrying the Queen of Portugal <note n="f" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. i. 676. Oeuv. de Brant. iv 249.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE chief obſtacle that ſtood in the way of Francis's liberty, was the Emperor's inſiſting ſo peremptorily on
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011837_0587_0F9D88732F6940B8"/>
the reſtitution of Burgundy, as a preliminary to that event. Francis declared that he would never conſent to diſmember his kingdom; and that if even he ſhould ſo far forget the duties of a Monarch, as to come to ſuch a reſolution, the fundamental laws of the kingdom would prevent its taking effect. On his part, he was willing to make an abſolute ceſſion to the Emperor of all his pretenſions in Italy and the Low-Countries; he promiſed to reſtore Bourbon all his lands which had been confiſcated; he renewed his propoſal of marrying the Emperor's ſiſter, the Queen Dowager of Portugal; and engaging to pay a great ſum by ranſom for his own perſon. But all mutual eſteem and confidence between the two Monarchs were now entirely loſt; there appeared, on the one hand, a rapacious ambition, labouring to avail itſelf of every favourable circumſtance; on the other, ſuſpicion and reſentment, ſtanding perpetually on their guard; ſo that the proſpect of bringing their negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to an iſſue, ſeemed to be far diſtant. The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of Alencon, the French King's ſiſter, whom Charles permitted to viſit her brother in his confinement, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all her addreſs, in order to procure his liberty on more reaſonable terms: Henry of England interpoſed his good offices to the ſame purpoſe; but both with ſo little ſucceſs, that Francis in deſpair, took ſuddenly the reſolution of reſigning his crown with all its rights and prerogatives to his ſon the Dauphin, determining rather to end his days in a priſon, than to purchaſe his freedom by conceſſions unworthy of a King. The deed for this purpoſe he ſigned with legal formality at Madrid, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering his ſiſter to carry it into France, that it might be regiſtered in all the parliaments of the kingdom; and at the ſame time, intimating his intention to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he deſired him to name the place of his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to aſſign him a proper number of attendants during the remainder of his days <note n="g" place="bottom">This paper is publiſhed in Memoires Hiſtoriques, &amp;c. par M. l'Abbe Raynal, tom. ii. p. 151.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS reſolution of the French King had great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; Charles began to be ſenſible, that by puſhing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to exceſs, he might defeat his own meaſures, and
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:011837_0588_0F9D8873EFFF4310"/>
inſtead of the vaſt advantages he hoped to draw from ranſoming a powerful Monarch, he might at laſt find in his hands a Prince without dominions or revenues. About the ſame time, one of the King of Navarre's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics happened by an extraordinary exertion of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, courage and addreſs, to procure his maſter an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of eſcaping from the priſon in which his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been confined ever ſince the battle of Pavia. This convinced the Emperor, that the moſt vigilant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of his officers might be eluded by the ingenuity or boldneſs of Francis, or his attendants, and one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky hour might deprive him of all the advantages which he had been ſo ſolicitous to obtain. By theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, he was induced to abate ſomewhat of his former demands. On the other hand, Francis's impatience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confinement daily increaſed; and having received certain intelligence of a powerful league forming againſt his rival in Italy, he grew more compliant with regard to conceſſions, truſting, that if he could once obtain his liberty, he would ſoon be in a condition to reſume what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had yielded.</p>
                  <p>AS theſe were the views and ſentiments of the two Monarchs, the treaty which procured Francis his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſigned at Madrid on the fourteenth of January, one thouſand five hundred and twenty-ſix. The article with regard to Burgundy, which had hitherto created the greateſt difficulty, was compromiſed, Francis en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to reſtore that dutchy with all its dependencies in full ſovereignty to the Emperor; and Charles conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this reſtitution ſhould not be made till the King was ſet at liberty; in order to ſecure the performance of this, as well as the other conditions in the treaty, Francis agreed that at the ſame inſtant he himſelf was releaſed, he would deliver as hoſtages to the Emperor, his eldeſt ſon the Dauphin, his ſecond ſon the Duke of Orleans, or in lieu of the latter, twelve of his principal nobility, to be named by Charles. The other articles ſwelled to a great number, and though not of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, were extremely rigorous. Among theſe the moſt remarkable were, that Francis ſhould renounce all his pretenſions in Italy; that he ſhould diſclaim any title which he had to the ſovereignty of Flanders and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011837_0589_0F9D8874AFC13840"/>
Artois; that within ſix weeks after his releaſe, he ſhould reſtore to Bourbon and his adherents, all their goods, moveable and immoveable, and make them full repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the damages they had ſuſtained by the confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them; that he ſhould uſe his intereſt with Henry D'Albret to relinquiſh his pretenſions to the crown of Navarre, and ſhould not for the future aſſiſt him in any attempt to recover it; that there ſhould be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed between the Emperor and Francis a league of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual friendſhip and conſederacy, with a promiſe of mutual aſſiſtance in every caſe of neceſſity. That in corroboration of this union, Francis ſhould marry the Emperor's ſiſter, the Queen Dowager of Portugal; that Francis ſhould cauſe all the articles of this treaty to be ratified by the ſtates, and regiſtered in the parliaments of his kingdom; that upon the Emperor's receiving this ratification, the hoſtages ſhould be ſet at liberty; but in their place, the Duke of Angouleme, the King's third ſon, ſhould be delivered to Charles, that in order to manifeſt, as well as to ſtrengthen the amity between the two Monarchs, he might be educated at the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial court; and that if Francis did not, within the time limited, fulfil the ſtipulations in the treaty, he ſhould promiſe, upon his honour and oath, to return into Spain, and to ſurrender himſelf again a priſoner to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <note n="h" place="bottom">Recueil des Trait. tom. ii. 112. Ulloa Vita dell Carlo V. p. 102, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BY this treaty, Charles flattered himſelf that he had not only effectually humbled his rival, but that he had taken ſuch precautions as would for ever prevent his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attaining any formidable degree of power. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which the wiſeſt politicians formed concerning it, was very different; they could not perſuade themſelves that Francis, after obtaining his liberty, would execute theſe articles againſt which he had ſtruggled ſo long, and to which even amidſt the horrors of captivity he had conſented with ſuch reluctance. Ambition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, they knew, would conſpire in prompting him to violate the hard conditions to which he had been conſtrained to ſubmit; nor would arguments and caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry be wanting to repreſent that which was ſo manifeſtly
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011837_0590_0F9D88756F3BF310"/>
advantageous, to be neceſſary and juſt. If one part of Francis's conduct had been known, at that time, this opinion might have been founded, not in conjecture, but in certainty. A few hours before he ſigned the treaty, he aſſembled ſuch of his counſellors as were then in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, and having exacted from them a ſolemn oath of ſecrecy, he made a long enumeration in their preſence of all the diſhonourable arts, as well as unprincely rigour, which the Emperor had employed in order to enſnare or intimidate him. For that reaſon, he took a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the hands of notaries, that his conſent to the treaty ſhould be conſidered as an involuntary deed, and be deemed null and void <note n="i" place="bottom">Recueil des Trait. tom. ii. p. 107.</note>. By this diſingenuous arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for which even the treatment he had received was no apology, Francis endeavoured to ſatisfy his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and conſcience in ſigning the treaty, and providing at the ſame time a pretext on which to break it.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, great were the outward demonſtrations of love and confidence between the two Monarchs; they appeared often together in publick; they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had long conferences in private; they travelled in the ſame litter, and joined in the ſame amuſements. But amidſt theſe ſigns of peace and friendſhip, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſtill harboured ſuſpicion in his mind. Though the ceremonies of the marriage between Francis and the Queen of Portugal were performed ſoon after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the treaty, Charles would not permit him to conſummate it until the return of the ratification from France. Even then Francis was not allowed to be at full liberty; his guards were ſtill continued; and while he was careſſed as a brother-in-law, he was ſtill watched like a priſoner; and it was obvious to attentive obſervers, that an union, in the very beginning of which, there might be diſcerned ſuch ſymptoms of jealouſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, could not be cordial, or of long continuance <note n="k" place="bottom">Guic. l. 16. 353.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT a month after the ſigning of the treaty, the Regent's ratification of it was brought from France; and that wiſe Princeſs, preferring, on this occaſion, the publick good to domeſtic affection, informed her ſon,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:011837_0591_0F9D8876C55D13D0"/>
that inſtead of the twelve noblemen named in the treaty, ſhe had ſent the Duke of Orleans along with his brother the Dauphin to the frontier, as the kingdom could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing by the abſence of a child, but muſt be left almoſt incapable of defence, if deprived of its ableſt ſtateſmen, and moſt experienced generals, whom Charles had artfully included in his nomination. At laſt Francis took leave of the Emperor, whoſe ſuſpicion of the King's ſincerity increaſing, as the time of putting it to the proof approached, he endeavoured to bind him ſtill faſter by exacting new promiſes, which after thoſe he had already made, the French Monarch was not ſlow to grant. He ſet out from Madrid, a place which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of many afflicting circumſtances rendered peculiarly odious to him, with the joy natural on ſuch an occaſion, and began the long-wiſhed-for journey towards his own dominions. He was eſcorted by a body of horſe under the command of Alarcon, who, as the King drew near the frontiers of France, guarded him with more ſcrupulous exactneſs than ever. When he arrived at the river Andaye, which ſeparates the two kingdoms, Lautrec appeared on the oppoſite bank with a guard of horſe equal in number to Alarcon's. An empty bark was moored in the middle of the ſtream; the attendants drew up in order on the oppoſite banks; at the ſame inſtant, Lannoy with eight gentlemen put off from the Spaniſh, and Lautrec with the ſame number from the French ſide of the river; the former had the King in his boat; the latter, the Dauphin and Duke of Orleans; they met in the empty veſſel; the exchange was made in a moment; Francis, after a ſhort embrace to his children leaped into Lautrec's boat, and reached the French ſhore. He mounted that inſtant a Turkiſh horſe, waved his hand over his head, and with a joyful voice crying aloud ſeveral times, "I am yet a King," gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped full ſpeed to St. John de Luz, and from thence to Bayonne. This event, no leſs impatiently deſired by the French nation than by their Monarch, happened on the eighteenth of March, a year and twenty-two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fatal battle of Pavia <note n="l" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. i. 735. Guic. l. 16. 355.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="unknown:011837_0592_0F9D8876F04F10C0"/>SOON after the Emperor had taken leave of Francis, and permitted him to begin his journey towards his own dominions, he ſet out for Seville, in order to ſolemnize his marriage with Iſabella, the daughter of Emanuel, the late King of Portugal, and the ſiſter of John III. who had ſucceeded him in the throne of that kingdom. Iſabella was a Princeſs of uncommon beauty and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; and as the Cortes both in Caſtile and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon had warmly ſolicited their Sovereign to marry, the choice of a wife ſo nearly allied to the royal blood of both kingdoms, was extremely acceptable to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Portugueſe, fond of this new connection with the firſt Monarch in Chriſtendom, granted him an extraordinary dowry with Iſabella, amounting to nine hundred thouſand crowns, a ſum, which, in the ſituation of his affairs at that juncture, was of no ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Emperor. The marriage was celebrated with that ſplendor and gaiety, which became a great and youthful Prince. Charles lived with Iſabella in perfect harmony, and treated her on all occaſions with much diſtinction and regard <note n="m" place="bottom">Ulloa Vita di <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, Charles could ſcarce give any attention to the affairs of Germany, though it was torn in pieces by commotions, which threatened the moſt dangerous conſequences. The feudal inſtitutions ſtill ſubſiſted almoſt unimpaired in the empire. The property of lands was veſted in the Princes, and free-barons. Their vaſſals held of them by the ſtricteſt and moſt limited tenures; while the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was kept in a ſtate but little removed from abſolute ſervitude. In ſome places of Germany, people of the loweſt claſs were ſo entirely in the power of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as to be ſubject to perſonal and domeſtic ſlavery, the moſt rigorous form of that wretched ſtate. In other provinces, particularly in Bohemia and Luſatia, the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants were bound to remain on the lands to which they belonged, and making part of the eſtate, were transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like any other property, from one hand to another. Even in Suabia, and the other countries on the banks of
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:011837_0593_0F9D8877B03F0F18"/>
the Rhine, where their condition was moſt tolerable, the peaſants not only paid the full rent of their farms to the landlord; but if they choſe either to change the place of their abode, or to follow a new profeſſion, they were obliged to purchaſe this privilege at a certain price. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, all grants of lands to peaſants expired at their death, without deſcending to their poſterity. Upon that event, the landlord had a right to the beſt of their cattle, and of their furniture; and their heirs, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a renewal of the grant, were obliged to pay large ſums by way of fine. Theſe exactions, though grievous, were borne with patience, becauſe they were cuſtomary and antient: But when the progreſs of elegance and luxury, as well as the changes introduced into the art of war came to increaſe the expence of government, and made it neceſſary for Princes to levy occaſional or ſtated taxes on their ſubjects, ſuch impoſitions being new, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared intolerable; and in Germany, theſe duties being laid chiefly upon beer, wine, and other neceſſaries of life, affected the common people in the moſt ſenſible manner. The addition of ſuch a load to their former burdens, drove them to deſpair. It was to the valour inſpired by reſentment againſt impoſitions of this kind, that the Swiſs owed the acquiſition of their liberty in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century. The ſame cauſe had excited the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants in ſeveral other provinces in Germany to rebel againſt their ſuperiors towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the ſixteenth centuries; and though theſe inſurrections were not attended with like ſucceſs, they could not however be quelled without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and bloodſhed <note n="n" place="bottom">Seckend. lib. ii. p. 2. 6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BY theſe checks, the ſpirit of the peaſants was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed rather than ſubdued; and their grievances multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying continually, they ran to arms this year, with the moſt frantic rage. Their firſt appearance was near Ulm in Suabia. The peaſants in the adjacent country flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their ſtandard with the ardour and impatience na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to men, who having groaned long under oppreſſion, beheld at laſt ſome proſpect of deliverance; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion ſpreading from province to province, reached al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:011837_0594_0F9D88787155A380"/>
every part of Germany. Wherever they came, they plundered the monaſteries; waſted the lands of their ſuperiors; razed their caſtles; and maſſacred without mercy all perſons of noble birth who were ſo unhappy as to fall into their hands <note n="n" place="bottom">Petr. Crinitus de Bello Ruſticano. ap. Freher. Script. Rer. Germ. Argent. 1717. vol. iii. p. 243.</note>. Having intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated their oppreſſors, as they imagined, by the violence of theſe proceedings, they began to conſider what would be the moſt proper and effectual method of ſecuring themſelves for the future from their tyrannical exactions. With this view, they drew up and publiſhed a memorial, containing all their demands, and declared, that while arms were in their hands, they would either perſuade or oblige the nobles to give them full ſatisfaction with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe. The chief articles were, that they might have liberty to chuſe their own paſtors; that they might be freed from the payment of all tythes but thoſe of corn; that they might no longer be conſidered as the ſlaves or bondmen of their ſuperiors; that the liberty of hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fiſhing might be common; that the great foreſts might not be regarded as private property, but be open for the uſe of all; that they might be delivered from the unuſual burden of taxes under which they laboured; that the adminiſtration of juſtice might be rendered leſs rigorous and more impartial; that the encroachments of the nobles upon meadows and commons might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <note n="o" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. p. 90.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MANY of theſe demands were extremely reaſonable; and being urged by ſuch formidable numbers, might have met with ſome redreſs. But thoſe vaſt unwieldy bodies, aſſembled in different places, had neither union, conduct, nor vigour. They were led by perſons of the loweſt rank without ſkill in war, or knowledge of what was neceſſary for accompliſhing their deſigns; and all their exploits were diſtinguiſhed by a brutal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning fury. To oppoſe this, the Princes and nobles of Suabia and the Lower Rhine raiſed their vaſſals, and attacking ſome of the mutineers with open force, and others by ſurprize, cut to pieces, or diſperſed all who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thoſe provinces; ſo that the peaſants, after ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the open country, and loſing upwards of twenty thouſand of their aſſociates in the field, were obliged to return to their habitations with leſs hope than ever of relief from their grievances <note n="p" place="bottom">Seckend. lib. ii. p. 10.

                  <p>THESE commotions happened at firſt in provinces of Germany, where Luther's opinions had made little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and being excited wholly by political cauſes, had no connection with the diſputed points in religion. But the frenzy reaching at laſt thoſe countries in which the Reformation was eſtabliſhed, derived new ſtrength from circumſtances peculiar to them, and roſe to a ſtill greater pitch of extravagance. The Reformation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was received, increaſed that bold and innovating ſpirit to which it owed its birth. Men who had the courage to overturn a ſyſtem ſupported by every thing which can command reſpect or reverence, were not to be overawed by any authority, however great or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. After having been accuſtomed to conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as judges of the moſt important doctrines in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to examine theſe freely, and to reject, without ſcruple, what appeared to them erroneous, it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for them to turn the ſame daring and inquiſitive eye towards government, and to think of rectifying whatever diſorders or imperfections were diſcovered there. And as religious abuſes had been reformed in ſeveral places without the permiſſion of the magiſtrate, it was an eaſy tranſition to attempt the redreſs of political grievances in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner, then, did the ſpirit of revolt break out in Thuringia, a province ſubject to the Elector of Saxony, the inhabitants of which were moſtly converts to Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſm, than it aſſumed a new and more dangerous form. Thomas Muncer, one of Luther's diſciples hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed himſelf in that country, had acquired a wonderful aſcendant over the minds of the people. He propagated among them the wildeſt and moſt enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic notions, but ſuch as tended manifeſtly to inſpire them with boldneſs, and lead them to ſedition. "Luther," he told them, "had done more hurt than good to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

He had, indeed, reſcued the church from the yoke of Popery, but his doctrines encouraged, and his life ſet an example of the utmoſt licentiouſneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

Let us beware, however, of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by our arrogance; but as all men are equal in his eye, let them return to that condition of equality in which he formed them, and having all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, let them live together like brethren, without any marks of ſubordination or pre-eminence <note n="q" place="bottom">Seckend. lib. ii. p. 13.

                  <p>EXTRAVAGANT as theſe tenets were, they flattered ſo many paſſions in the human heart, as to make a deep impreſſion. To aim at nothing more than abridging the power of the nobles was now conſidered as a trifling and partial reformation, not worth the contending for; it was propoſed to level every diſtinction among mankind, and by aboliſhing property, to reduce them to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate of equality, in which all ſhould receive their ſubſiſtence from one common ſtock. Muncer aſſured them, that the deſign was approved of by Heaven, and that the Almighty had in a dream aſcertained him of its ſucceſs. The peaſants ſet about the execution of it, not only with the rage which animated thoſe of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in other parts of Germany, but with the ardour that enthuſiaſm inſpires. They depoſed the magiſtrates in all the cities of which they were maſters; ſeized the lands of the nobles; and obliged ſuch of them as they got into their hands, to put on the dreſs commonly worn by peaſants, and inſtead of their former titles, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

with the appellation given to people in the loweſt claſs of life. Vaſt numbers engaged in this wild under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; but Muncer, their leader and their prophet, was deſtitute of the abilities neceſſary for conducting it. He had all the extravagance, but not the courage, which enthuſiaſts uſually poſſeſs. It was with difficulty he could be perſuaded to take the field; and though he ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Theſe Princes, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhed the blood of their deluded ſubjects, ſent a young nobleman to their camp, with the offer of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pardon, if they would immediately lay down their arms, and deliver up the authors of the ſedition. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, alarmed at this, began to harangue them with his uſual vehemence, exhorting them not to truſt theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful promiſes of their oppreſſors, nor to deſert the cauſe of God, and of Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p>BUT the ſenſe of preſent danger made a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the peaſants than his eloquence, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and terror were viſible in every face, when a rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, which was the emblem the mutineers had painted on their colours, happening to appear in the clouds, Muncer, with admirable preſence of mind, laid hold of that incident, and ſuddenly raiſed his eyes and hands towards heaven, "Behold," cries he, with an elevated voice, "the ſign which God has given. There is the pledge of your ſafety, and a token that the wicked ſhall be deſtroyed." The fanatical multitude ſet up inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great ſhout, as if victory had been certain; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in a moment from one extreme to another, murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unfortunate nobleman who had come with the offer of pardon, and demanded to be led towards the enemy. The Princes enraged at this ſhocking viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws of war, prevented them by beginning the attack; but the behaviour of the peaſants in the combat was not ſuch as might have been expected either from their ferocity or confidence of ſucceſs; an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined rabble was no equal match for well-trained troops; above five thouſand were ſlain in the field, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without making reſiſtance; the reſt fled, and

He was taken the next day, and being condemned to ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments as his crimes had deſerved, he ſuffered them with a poor and daſtardly ſpirit.

                  <p>DURING theſe commotions, Luther acted with exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary prudence and moderation; like a common parent, ſolicitous about the welfare of both parties, without ſparing the faults or errors of either. On the one hand, he addreſſed a monitory diſcourſe to the nobles, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to treat their dependants with greater humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and indulgence.

                  <p>LUTHER'S famous marriage with Catharine a Boria, a nun of a noble family, who having thrown off the veil, had fled from the cloiſter, happened this year, and was far from meeting with the ſame approbation. Even his moſt devoted followers thought this indecent at a time when his country was involved in ſo many calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; while his enemies never mentioned it with any ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appellation than that of inceſtuous or profane.

of Germany, muſt be traced back to its ſource. While the frenzy of the Cruſades poſſeſſed all Europe during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, ſeveral orders of relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> againſt Heathens and Infidels. Among theſe the Teutonic order in Germany was one of the moſt illuſtrious, the knights of which diſtinguiſhed themſelves greatly in all the wild enterprizes carried on in the Holy Land. Being driven at laſt from their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the eaſt, they were obliged to return to their native country. Their zeal and valour, were too impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to remain long inactive. They invaded, on very ſlight pretences, the province of Pruſſia, the inhabitants of which were ſtill idolaters; and having completed the conqueſt of it about the middle of the thirteenth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, held it many years as a fief depending on the crown of Poland. Fierce conteſts aroſe during this period, between the grand-maſters of the order, and the Kings of Poland; the former ſtruggling for independence, while the latter aſſerted their right of ſovereignty with great firmneſs. Albert, a Prince of the houſe or Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh, who was elected grand-maſter in the year one thouſand five hundred and eleven, engaging keenly in this quarrel, maintained a long war with Sigiſmund, King of Poland; but having become an early convert to Luther's doctrines, this gradually leſſened his zeal for the intereſts of his fraternity, ſo that he took the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the confuſions in the empire, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Emperor, to conclude a treaty with Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, greatly to his private emolument. By it, that part of Pruſſia which belonged to the Teutonic order, was erected into a ſecular and hereditary dutchy, and the inveſtiture of it granted to Albert, who, in return, bound himſelf to do homage for it to the Kings of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as their vaſſal. Immediately after this, he made publick profeſſion of the reformed religion, and married a Princeſs of Denmark. The Teutonic knights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſo loudly againſt the treachery of their grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, that he was put under the ban of the empire; but he ſtill kept poſſeſſion of the province he had uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tranſmitted it to his poſterity.

                  <p>UPON the return of the French King to his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the eyes of all the powers in Europe were fixed upon him, that by obſerving his firſt motions, they might form a judgment concerning his ſubſequent conduct. They were not held long in ſuſpence. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, as ſoon as he arrived at Bayonne, wrote to the King of England, thanking him for his zealous and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate interpoſition in his favour, to which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he owed the recovery of his liberty. Next day the Emperor's ambaſſadors demanded audience, and in their maſter's name, required him to iſſue ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as were neceſſary for carrying the treaty of Madrid into full and immediate execution; he coldly anſwered, That though for his own part he determined religiouſly to perform all he had promiſed, the treaty contained ſo many articles relative not to himſelf alone, but affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intereſts of the French monarchy, that he could not take any farther ſtep without conſulting the ſtates of his kingdom, and that ſome time would be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in order to reconcile their minds to the hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he had conſented to ratify <note n="x" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p 97.</note>. This reply was conſidered as no obſcure diſcovery of his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to elude the treaty; and the compliment paid to Henry, appeared a very proper ſtep towards ſecuring the aſſiſtance of that Monarch in the war with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, to which ſuch a reſolution would certainly give riſe. Theſe circumſtances, added to the explicit decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which Francis made in ſecret to the ambaſſadors from ſeveral of the Italian powers, fully ſatisfied them that their conjectures with regard to his conduct had been juſt, and that inſtead of intending to execute an unreaſonable treaty, he was eager to ſeize the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of revenging thoſe injuries which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

That feeble Prince, deprived now of Moronè's advice, and unprovided with every thing neceſſary for defence, found means to inform Clement and the Venetians that he muſt ſoon ſurrender, if they did not come to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The Imperial troops, as they had received no pay ſince the battle of Pavia, lived at diſcretion in the Milaneſe, levying ſuch exorbitant contributions in that dutchy, as amounted, if we may rely on Guiccardini's calculation, to no leſs a ſum than five thouſand ducats a day <note n="y" place="bottom">Guic. l. 17. 360.</note>; nor was it to be doubted, but that the ſoldiers, as ſoon as the caſtle ſhould ſubmit, would chooſe to leave a ruined country, which ſcarce afforded them ſubſiſtence, that they might take poſſeſſion of more comfortable quarters in the fertile and untouched terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Pope and Venetians. The aſſiſtance of the French King was the only thing which could either ſave Sforza, or enable them to protect their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions from the inſults of the Imperial troops.</p>
                  <p>FOR theſe reaſons, the Pope, the Venetians, and Duke of Milan were equally impatient to come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

of thirty-five thouſand men, with which, after driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spaniards out of the Milaneſe, they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the kingdom of Naples. The King of England was declared protector of this league, which they digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the name of <hi>Holy,</hi> becauſe the Pope was at the head of it; and, in order to allure Henry more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, a principality in the kingdom of Naples, of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-thouſand ducats yearly revenue, was to be ſettled on him; and lands to the value of ten thouſand ducats on Wolſey, his favourite <note n="z" place="bottom">P.

                  <p>NO ſooner was this league concluded, than Clement, by the plenitude of his papal power, abſolved Francis from the oath he had taken to obſerve the treaty of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid<note n="a" place="bottom">Goldaſt.

This right, how pernicious ſoever to morals, and deſtructive of that integrity which is the baſis of all tranſactions amongſt men, was the natural conſequence of the powers which the Popes arrogated as infallible vicegerents of Chriſt upon earth; and they having, in virtue of theſe, often diſpenſed with obligations which were held ſacred, the intereſt of ſome men, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of others, led them to imagine, that the deciſions of a ſovereign Pontiff authorized or juſtified actions which would, otherwiſe, have been criminal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the diſcovery of Francis's intention to elude the treaty of Madrid, filled the Emperor with a variety of diſquieting thoughts. He had treated an unfortunate Prince with the moſt ungenerous rigour; he had diſplayed an inſatiable ambition in all his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations with his priſoner: He knew what cenſures the former had drawn upon him, and what apprehenſions the latter had excited in every court of Europe; nor had he reaped from the meaſures he purſued, any of thoſe advantages which politicians are apt to conſider as an excuſe for the moſt criminal conduct, and a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for the ſevereſt reproaches. Francis was now out of his hands, and not one of all the mighty conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he expected from the treaty that ſet him at

liberty, was likely to take place. His raſhneſs in rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far on his own judgment as to truſt to the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the French King, in oppoſition to the ſentiments of his wiſeſt miniſters, was now apparent; and he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conjectured, that the ſame confederacy, the dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Self-condemnation and ſhame, on account of what was paſt, with anxious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions concerning what might happen, were the neceſſary reſult of theſe reflections on his own conduct and ſituation. Charles, however, was naturally firm and inflexible in all his meaſures. To have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eceded ſuddenly from any article in the treaty of Madrid, would have been a plain confeſſion of imprudence, and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſymptom of fear; he determined therefore, that it was moſt ſuitable to his dignity, to inſiſt, whatever might be the conſequences, on the ſtrict execution of the treaty, and particularly not to accept of any thing which might be offered as an equivalent for the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Burgundy <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. l xvii. 366.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN conſequence of this reſolution, he appointed Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy and Alarcon, to repair, as his ambaſſadors to the court of France, and formally to ſummon the King ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to execute the treaty with the ſincerity that became him, or to return, according to his oath, a priſoner to Madrid. Inſtead of giving them an immediate anſwer, Francis admitted the deputies of the ſtates of Burgundy to an audience in their preſence. They humbly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that he had exceeded the powers veſted in a King of France when he conſented to alienate their country from the crown, the domains of which he was bound by his coronation oath to preſerve entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired. Francis, in return, thanked them for their attachment to his crown, and intreated them, though very faintly, to remember the obligations which he lay under to fulfil his engagements with the Emperor. The deputies aſſuming an higher tone, declared they would not obey commands which they conſidered as illegal; and if he ſhould abandon them to the enemies of France,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:011837_0604_0F9D887FF1AA2068"/>
they had reſolved to defend themſelves to the beſt of their power, with a firm purpoſe rather to periſh than to ſubmit to a foreign dominion. Upon which Francis turning towards the Imperial ambaſſadors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them the impoſſibility of performing what he had undertaken, and offered in lieu of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, to pay the Emperor two millions of crowns. The viceroy and Alarcon, who eaſily perceived that the ſcene to which they had been witneſſes, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed between the King and his ſubjects in order to impoſe on them, ſignified to him their maſter's fixed reſolution not to depart in the ſmalleſt point from the terms of the treaty, and withdrew <note n="c" place="bottom">Belcar. Comment. de Reb. Gal. 573. Mem. de Bellay, 97.</note>. Before they left the kingdom, they had the mortification to hear the holy league againſt the Emperor publiſhed with great ſolemnity.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES no ſooner received an account of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy than he exclaimed in the moſt publick manner, and in the harſheſt terms, againſt Francis, as a Prince void of faith, or of honour. He complained no leſs of Clement, whom he ſolicited in vain to abandon his new allies; he accuſed him of ingratitude; he taxed him with an ambition unbecoming his character; he threatened him not only with all the vengeance which the power of an Emperor can inflict, but by appealing to a general council, called up before him all the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ariſing from the authority of thoſe aſſemblies ſo formidable to the papal ſee. It was neceſſary, however, to oppoſe ſomething elſe than reproaches and threats to the powerful combination formed againſt him; and the Emperor, prompted by ſo many paſſions, did not fail to exert himſelf with unuſual vigour, in order to ſend ſupplies not only of men, but of money, which was ſtill more needed, into Italy.</p>
                  <p>ON the other hand, the efforts of the confederates bore no proportion to that animoſity againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with which they ſeemed to enter into the holy league. Francis, it was thought, would have infuſed ſpirit and vigour into the whole body. He had his loſt honour to
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011837_0605_0F9D8880D95D83D8"/>
repair, many injuries to revenge, and the ſtation among the Princes of Europe, from which he had fallen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. From all theſe, added to the natural impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his temper, a war more fierce and bloody than any he had hitherto made upon his rival, was expected. But Francis had gone through ſuch a ſcene of diſtreſs, and the impreſſion it had made was ſtill ſo freſh in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that he was become diffident of himſelf, diſtruſtful of fortune, and deſirous of tranquillity. To procure the releaſe of his ſons, and to avoid the reſtitution of Burgundy by paying ſome reaſonable equivalent, were his chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and for the ſake of theſe, he would willingly have ſacrificed Sforza and the liberties of Italy to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. He flattered himſelf, that the dread alone of ſuch a confederacy would induce Charles to liſten to what was equitable; and was afraid of employing any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able force for the relief of the Milaneſe, left his allies, whom he had often found to be more attentive to their own intereſt, than punctual in fulfilling their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould abandon him as ſoon as the Imperialiſts were driven out of that country, and deprive his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations with the Emperor of that weight which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his being at the head of a powerful league. Meanwhile, the caſtle of Milan was preſſed more cloſely than ever, and Sforza was now reduced to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. The Pope and Venetians, truſting to Francis's concurrence, commanded their troops to take the field, in order to relieve him; and an army more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that ſervice was ſoon formed. The Milaneſe, paſſionately attached to their unfortunate Duke, and no leſs exaſperated againſt the Imperialiſts, who had oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſo cruelly, were ready to aid the confederates in all their enterprizes. But the Duke d'Urbino, their general, naturally ſlow and indeciſive, and reſtrained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by his antient enmity to the family of Medici, from taking any ſtep that might aggrandize or add re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the Pope <note n="d" place="bottom">Guic. l. 17. 382.</note>, loſt ſome opportunities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to improve others, of attacking the Imperialiſts, and raiſing the ſiege. Theſe delays gave Bourbon time
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:011837_0606_0F9D88816FD29590"/>
to bring up a reinforcement of freſh troops, and a ſupply of money. He immediately took the command of the army, and puſhed on the ſiege with ſuch vigour, as quickly obliged Sforza to ſurrender, who retiring to Lodi, which the confederates had ſurprized, left Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon in fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Italians began now to perceive the game which Francis had played, and to be ſenſible, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their addreſs, and refinements in negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they boaſted of as talents peculiarly their own, they had for once been over-reached in thoſe very arts by a <hi>tramontane</hi> Prince.

                  <p>ALL the Emperor's motions depending on himſelf alone, were more briſk and better concerted. The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of his revenues, indeed, did not allow him to make any ſudden or great effort in the field, but he abundantly ſupplied that defect by his intrigues and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations. The family of Colonna, the moſt powerful of all the Roman barons, had adhered uniformly to the Ghibeline or Imperial faction, during theſe fierce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between the Popes and Emperors, which for ſeveral ages, filled Italy and Germany with diſcord and bloodſhed. Though the cauſes which at firſt gave birth to theſe deſtructive factions exiſted no longer, and the rage with which they had been animated was in a great meaſure ſpent, the Colonnas ſtill retained their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Imperial intereſt, and by placing themſelves
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:011837_0607_0F9D88822F352CB0"/>
under the protection of the Emperors, ſecured the quiet poſſeſſion of their own territories and privileges. The Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, a man of a turbulent and ambitious temper, at that time the head of the family, had long been Clement's rival, to whoſe influence in the laſt conclave he imputed the diſappointment of all his ſchemes for attaining the papal dignity, of which, from his known connection with the Emperor, he thought himſelf ſecure. This was too great an injury to an aſpiring mind ever to be forgiven; and though he had diſſembled his reſentment ſo far as to vote for Clement at his election, and to accept of great offices in his court, he waited with the utmoſt impatience for an opportunity of being revenged. Don Hugo di Moncada, the Imperial ambaſſador at Rome, who was no ſtranger to theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, eaſily perſuaded him that now was the time, while all the papal troops were employed in Lombardy, to attempt ſomething which would, at once, avenge his own wrongs, and be of eſſential ſervice to the Emperor his patron. The Pope, however, whoſe timidity ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him quick-ſighted, was ſo attentive to their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and began to be alarmed ſo early, that he might have drawn together troops ſufficient to have diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed all Colonna's meaſures. But Moncada amuſed him ſo artfully with negociations, promiſes, and falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that he lulled aſleep all his ſuſpicions, and prevented his taking any of the precautions neceſſary for his ſafety; and, to the eternal diſgrace of a Prince poſſeſſed of great power, as well as renowned for politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom, Colonna at the head of three thouſand men, ſeized one of the gates of his capital, while he imagined himſelf to be in perfect ſecurity, and was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for reſiſting ſuch a feeble enemy. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Rome permitted Colonna's troops, from whom they apprehended no injury, to advance without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; the Pope's guards were diſperſed in a moment; and Clement himſelf terrified at the danger, aſhamed of his own credulity and deſerted by almoſt every perſon, fled with precipitation into the caſtle of St. Angelo, which was immediately inveſted. The palace of the Vatican, the church of St. Peter, and the houſes of the Pope's miniſters and ſervants, were plundered in the moſt
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:011837_0608_0F9D8882F1125CD8"/>
licentious manner; the reſt of the city was left unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted. Clement, deſtitute of every thing neceſſary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſubſiſtence or defence, was ſoon obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a capitulation: and Moncada being admitted into the caſtle, preſcribed to him with all the haughtineſs of a conqueror, conditions which it was not in his power to reject. The chief of theſe was, That Clement ſhould not only grant a full pardon to the Colonnas, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into favour, and immediately withdraw all the troops in his pay from the army of the confederates in Lombardy <note n="g" place="bottom">Jovii Vita Pomp. Colon. p. Guic. l. 17. 407. Ruſcelli Lettere de Principi i. p. 104.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Colonnas, who talked of nothing leſs than of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Clement, and of placing Pompeo, their kinſman, in the vacant chair of St. Peter, exclaimed loudly againſt a treaty which left them at the mercy of a Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff juſtly incenſed againſt them. But Moncada, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive only to his maſter's intereſt, paid little regard to their complaints, and by this fortunate meaſure, broke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the power of the confederates.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the army of the confederates ſuffered ſuch a conſiderable diminution, the Imperialiſts received two great reinforcements; one from Spain, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lannoy and Alarcon, which amounted to ſix thouſand men. The other was raiſed in the empire by George Frondſperg, a German nobleman, who having ſerved in Italy with great reputation, had acquired ſuch influence and popularity, that multitudes of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, fond on every occaſion of engaging in military en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and impatient at that juncture to eſcape from the oppreſſion of their ſuperiors both in religious and civil matters, crouded to his ſtandard; ſo that without any other gratuity than the payment of a crown to each man, fourteen thouſand enliſted in his ſervice. To theſe the Arch-duke Ferdinand added two thouſand horſe, levied in the Auſtrian dominions. But although the Emperor had raiſed troops, he could not remit the ſums neceſſary for their ſupport. His ordinary revenues were exhauſted; the credit of Princes, during the infancy of commerce, was not extenſive; and the Cortes of Caſtile,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:011837_0609_0F9D8884334AB8D8"/>
though every art had been tried to gain them, and ſome innovations had been made in the conſtitution in order to ſecure their concurrence, peremptorily refuſed to grant Charles any extraordinary ſupply <note n="h" place="bottom">Sandov. i. 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>4</note>; ſo that the more his army increaſed in number, the more were his generals embaraſſed and diſtreſſed. Bourbon, in particular, was involved in ſuch difficulties, that he ſtood in need of all his addreſs and courage in order to extricate himſelf. Vaſt ſums were due to the Spaniſh troops already in the Milaneſe, when Frondſperg arrived with ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand hungry Germans, deſtitute of every thing. Both made their demands with equal fierceneſs; the former claiming their arrears, and the latter the pay which had been promiſed them on their entering Lombardy: Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon was altogether incapable of giving ſatisfaction to either. In this ſituation, he was conſtrained to commit acts of violence extremely ſhocking to his own nature, which was gentle and humane. He ſeized the principal citizens of Milan, and by threats, and even torture, forced from them a conſiderable ſum; he rifled the churches of all their plate and ornaments; the inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ſupply which theſe afforded, he diſtributed among the ſoldiers, with ſo many ſoothing expreſſions of his ſympathy and affection, that, though it fell far ſhort of the ſums due to them, it appeaſed their preſent mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs <note n="i" place="bottom">Ripamont. Hiſt. Mediol. lib. ix. p. 717.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AMONG other expedients for raiſing money, Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon granted his life and liberty to Moronè, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been kept in priſon ſince his intrigue with Peſcara, had been condemned to die by the Spaniſh judges em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to try him. For this remiſſion he paid twenty thouſand ducats; and ſuch were his ſingular talents, and the wonderful aſcendant he acquired over the minds of thoſe to whom he had acceſs, that in a few days, from being Bourbon's priſoner, he became his prime confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, with whom he conſulted in all affairs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To his inſinuations muſt be imputed the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions which Bourbon began to entertain, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had never intended to grant him the inveſtiture of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:011837_0610_0F9D88846FFFDB68"/>
Milan, but had appointed Leyva, and the other Spaniſh generals, rather to be ſpies on his conduct, than to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate heartily towards the execution of his ſchemes. To him likewiſe, as he ſtill retained at the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore all the enterprizing ſpirit of youth, may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the bold and unexpected meaſure on which Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon ſoon after ventured <note n="*" place="bottom">Guic l. 17. 419.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH, indeed, were the exigencies of the Imperial troops in the Milaneſe, that it became indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take ſome immediate ſtep for their relief. The arrears of the ſoldiers increaſed daily; the Emperor made no remittances to his generals; and the utmoſt rigour of military extortion could draw nothing more from a country entirely drained and ruined. In this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation there was no choice left, but either to diſband the army, or to march for ſubſiſtence into the enemy's country. The territories of the Venetians lay neareſt at hand; but they, with their uſual foreſight and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, had taken ſuch precautions as ſecured them from any inſult. Nothing therefore remained, but to invade the dominions of the church, or of the Florentines; and Clement had of late acted ſuch a part, as merited the ſevereſt vengeance from the Emperor. No ſooner did the troops return to Rome after the inſurrection of the Colonnas, than, without paying any regard to the treaty with Moncada, he degraded the Cardinal Colonna, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the reſt of the family, ſeized their places of ſtrength, and waſted their lands with all the cruelty which the ſmart of a recent injury naturally excites. After this, he turned his arms againſt Naples, and as his operations were ſeconded by the French fleet, he made ſome progreſs towards the conqueſt of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the viceroy being no leſs deſtitute than the other Imperial generals, of the money requiſite for a vigorous defence <note n="k" place="bottom">Jovii Vita Pomp. Colon. Guic. l. 18. 424.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THESE proceedings of the Pope, juſtified in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the meaſures which Bourbon's ſituation rendered neceſſary; and he ſet about executing them under ſuch diſadvantages, as furniſh the ſtrongeſt proof, both of the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:011837_0611_0F9D88852FAE19B8"/>
deſpair to which he was reduced, and of the greatneſs of his abilities which were able to ſurmount ſo many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles. Having committed the government of Milan to Leyva, whom he was not unwilling to leave behind; he began his march in the depth of winter, at the head of twenty-five thouſand men, compoſed of nations dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from each other in language and manners; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, without magazines, without artillery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carriages; in ſhort, without any of thoſe things which are neceſſary to the ſmalleſt party, and which ſeem eſſential to the exiſtence and motions of a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. His rout lay through a country cut by rivers and mountains, in which the roads were almoſt impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; as an addition to his difficulties, the enemy's army, ſuperior to his own in number, was at hand to watch all his motions, and to improve every advantage. But his troops, impatient of their preſent hardſhips, and allured by the hopes of obtaining an immenſe booty, did not conſider how ill provided they were for a march, and followed him with great chearfulneſs. His firſt ſcheme was to have made himſelf maſter of Placentia, and to have gratified his ſoldiers with the plunder of that city; but the vigilance of the confederate generals ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the deſign abortive; nor had he better ſucceſs in his project for the reduction of Bologna, which was ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſupplied with as many troops as ſecured it from the inſults of an army which had neither artillery nor am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. Having failed in both theſe attempts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſter of ſome great city, he was under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of advancing. But he had now been two months in the field; his troops had ſuffered every calamity which a long march, together with the uncommon rigour of the ſeaſon could bring upon men deſtitute of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accommodations, in an enemy's country; the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent promiſes to which they truſted, had proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vain; they ſaw no proſpect of relief; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, tried to the utmoſt, failed at laſt, and they broke out into open mutiny. Some officers, who raſhly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to reſtrain them, fell victims to their fury; Bourbon himſelf, not daring to appear during the firſt tranſports of their rage, was obliged to fly ſecretly from
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011837_0612_0F9D8885F1066658"/>
his quarters <note n="l" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 434. Jovii Vit. Colon. 163.</note>. But this ſudden ebullition of wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at laſt to ſubſide; when Bourbon, who poſſeſſed in a wonderful degree, the art of governing the minds of ſoldiers, renewed his promiſes with more confidence than formerly, and aſſured them that they would be ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. He endeavoured to render their hardſhips more tolerable by partaking of them himſelf; he fared no better than the meaneſt centinel; he marched along with them on foot; he joined them in ſinging their camp-ballads, in which, with high praiſes of his valour, they mingled many ſtrokes of military raillery on his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; and wherever they came, he allowed them, as a foretaſte of what he had promiſed, to plunder the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent villages at diſcretion. Encouraged by all theſe ſoothing arts, they entirely forgot their ſufferings and complaints, and followed him with the ſame implicit confidence as formerly <note n="m" place="bottom">Oeuvres de Brant. tom iv. 246, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BOURBON, meanwhile, carefully concealed his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Rome and Florence, not knowing on which the blow would fall, were held in the moſt diſquieting ſtate of ſuſpence. Clement, equally ſolicitous for the ſafety of both, fluctuated in more than his uſual uncertainty; and while the rapid approach of danger called for prompt and deciſive meaſures, he ſpent the time in deliberations which came to no iſſue, or in taking reſolutions, which next day, his reſtleſs mind, more ſagacious in diſcerning than in obviating difficulties, overturned, without being able to fix on what ſhould be ſubſtituted in their place. At one time, he determined to unite himſelf more cloſely than ever with his allies, and to puſh the war with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; at another, he inclined to bring all differences to a final accommodation by a treaty with Lannoy, who knowing his paſſion for negociation, ſolicited him inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly with propoſals for that purpoſe. His timidity at length prevailed; and led him to conclude an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Lannoy, of which the following were the chief articles: That a ſuſpenſion of arms ſhould take place between the Pontifical and Imperial troops for eight months; That Clement ſhould advance ſixty thouſand crowns towards ſatisfying the demands of the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:011837_0613_0F9D8886AFBAB060"/>
Imperial army; That the Colonnas ſhould be abſolved from cenſure, and their former dignities and poſſeſſions be reſtored to them; That the viceroy ſhould come to Rome, and prevent Bourbon from approaching nearer to that city, or to Florence <note n="n" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 436.</note>. On this ſudden treaty, which deprived him of all hopes of aſſiſtance from his allies, without affording him any ſolid foundation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, Clement relied ſo firmly, that like a man extricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once out of all difficulties, he was at perfect eaſe, and in the fulneſs of his confidence diſbanded all his troops, except as many as were ſufficient to guard his own perſon. This amazing confidence of Clement's, who on every other occaſion was fearful and ſuſpicious to exceſs, appeared ſo unaccountable to Guicciardini, who being at that time the pontifical commiſſary-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and reſident in the confederate army, had great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity as well as great abilities for obſerving how chimerical all his hopes were, that he imputes the Pope's conduct, at this juncture, wholly to infatuation, which thoſe who are doomed to ruin cannot avoid <note n="o" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 446.</note>.</p>
                  <p>LANNOY, it would ſeem, intended to have executed the treaty with great ſincerity; and having detached Clement from the confederacy, wiſhed to turn Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon's arms againſt the Venetians, who, of all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at war with the Emperor, had exerted the greateſt vigour. With this view he diſpatched a courier to Bourbon, informing him of the ſuſpenſion of arms, which in the name of their common maſter, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Pope. Bourbon had other ſchemes; and he had proſecuted them now too far to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating. To have mentioned a retreat to his ſoldiers, would have been dangerous; his command was indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on Lannoy; he was fond of mortifying a man whom he had many reaſons to hate; for theſe reaſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying the leaſt regard to the meſſage, he continued to ravage the eccleſiaſtical territories, and to advance towards Florence. Upon this, all Clement's terror and anxiety returning with new force, he had recourſe to Lannoy, and intreated and conjured him to put a ſtop to Bourbon's progreſs. Lannoy accordingly
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:011837_0614_0F9D88876FCA3120"/>
ſet out for his camp, but durſt not approach it; Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon's ſoldiers having got notice of the truce, raged and threatened, demanding the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to which they had truſted; their general himſelf could ſcarce reſtrain them; every perſon in Rome, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that nothing remained but to prepare for reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtorm which it was now impoſſible to diſpel. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, relying on ſome ambiguous and deceitful profeſſions which Bourbon made of his inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards peace, ſunk back into his former ſecurity <note n="p" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 437, &amp;c. Mem. de Bellay, p. 100.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BOURBON, on his part, was far from being free from ſolicitude. All his attempts on any places of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had hitherto miſcarried; and Florence, towards which he had been approaching for ſome time, was, by the arrival of the Duke d'Urbino's army, put in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſet his power at defiance. As it now became neceſſary to change his rout, and to take inſtantly ſome new reſolution; he fixed without heſitation on one no leſs daring in itſelf, than it was impious according to the opinion of that age. This was to aſſault and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rome. Many reaſons, however, prompted him to it. He was fond of thwarting Lannoy, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for the ſafety of that city; he imagined that the Emperor would be highly pleaſed to ſee Clement, the chief author of the league againſt him, humbled; he flattered himſelf, that by gratifying the rapacity of his ſoldiers with ſuch immenſe booty, he would attach them for ever to his intereſt; or (which is ſtill more probable than any of theſe) he hoped that by means of the power and ſplendour he would acquire from the conqueſt of the firſt city in Chriſtendom, he might lay the foundation of an independent power; and that after ſhaking off all connection with the Emperor, he might take poſſeſſion of Naples, or of ſome of the Italian ſtates in his own name <note n="q" place="bottom">Brant. 4. 271. 6. 189. Belcarii Comment. 594.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER his motives were, he executed his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with a rapidity equal to the boldneſs with which he had formed it. His ſoldiers, now that they had their prey in full view, complained neither of fatigue,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011837_0615_0F9D88883006C4F0"/>
nor famine, nor want of pay. No ſooner did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to move from Tuſcany towards Rome, than the Pope, ſenſible at laſt how fallacious the hopes had been on which he repoſed, ſtarted from his ſecurity. But no time now remained, even for a bold and deciſive Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, to have taken proper meaſures, or to have formed any effectual plan of defence. Under Clement's feeble conduct, all was conſternation, diſorder and irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He collected, however, ſuch of his diſbanded ſoldiers as ſtill remained in the city; he armed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers of Rome, and the footmen and train-bearers of the cardinals; he repaired the breaches in the walls; he begun to erect new works; he excommunicated Bourbon and all his troops, branding the Germans with the name of Lutherans, and the Spaniards with that of Moors <note n="r" place="bottom">Seckend.

Truſting to theſe ineffectual military preparations, or to his ſpiritual arms, which were ſtill more deſpiſed by rapacious ſoldiers, he ſeems to have laid aſide his natural timidity, and contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of all his counſellors, determined to wait the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an enemy, whom, by a timely retreat, he might eaſily have avoided.</p>
                  <p>BOURBON, who ſaw the neceſſity of diſpatch, now that his intentions were known, advanced with ſuch ſpeed, that he gained ſeveral marches on the Duke d'Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino's army, and encamped in the plains of Rome on the evening of the fifth of May. From thence he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoldiers the palaces and churches of that city, into which, as the capital of the Chriſtian commonwealth, the wealth of all Europe had flowed during many cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, without having been once violated by any hoſtile hand; and commanding them to refreſh themſelves that night, as a preparation for the aſſault next day, promiſed them in reward of their toils and valour, the poſſeſſion of all the treaſures accumulated there.</p>
                  <p>EARLY in the morning, Bourbon, who had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to diſtinguiſh that day either by his death, or the ſucceſs of his enterprize, appeared at the head of his troops, clad in compleat armour, above which he wore a veſt of white tiſſue, that he might be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous

both to his friends and to his enemies; and as all depended on one bold impreſſion, he led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſcale the walls. Three diſtinct bodies, one of Germans, another of Spaniards, and the laſt of Italians, the three different nations of whom the army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were appointed to this ſervice; a ſeparate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was aſſigned to each; and the whole army advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſupport them as occaſion ſhould require. A thick miſt concealed their approach until they reached almoſt the brink of the ditch which ſurrounded the ſuburbs; having planted their ladders in a moment, each brigade ruſhed on to the aſſault, with an impetuoſity heightened by national emulation. They were received at firſt with fortitude equal to their own; the Swiſs in the Pope's guards, and the veteran ſoldiers who had been aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, fought with a courage becoming men to whom the defence of the nobleſt city in the world was entruſted. Bourbon's troops, notwithſtanding all their valour, gained no ground, and even began to give way; when their leader, perceiving that on this critical moment the fate of the day depended, threw himſelf from his horſe, preſſed to the front, ſnatched a ſcaling ladder from a ſoldier, planted it againſt the wall, and began to mount it, encouraging his men with his voice and hand, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, but at that very inſtant, a muſket bullet from the ramparts pierced his groin with a wound, which he immediately felt to be mortal; but he retained ſo much preſence of mind as to deſire thoſe who were near him to cover his body with a cloak, that his death might not diſhearten his troops; and ſoon after he expired with a courage worthy of a better cauſe, and which would have entitled him to the higheſt praiſe, if he had thus fallen in defence of his country, not at the head of its enemies <note n="s" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 101.

                  <p>IT was impoſſible, to conceal this fatal event from the army; the ſoldiers ſoon miſſed their general, whom they were accuſtomed to ſee in every time of danger; but inſtead of being diſheartened by their loſs, it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated them with new valour; the name of Bourbon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded

along the line, accompanied with the cry of <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>revenge.</hi> The veterans who defended the walls, were ſoon over-powered by numbers; the untrained body of city recruits fled at the ſight of danger, and the enemy with irreſiſtible violence ruſhed into the town.</p>
                  <p>DURING the combat, Clement was employed at the altar of St. Peter's in offering up to heaven unavailing prayers for victory. No ſooner was he informed that his troops began to give way than he fled with precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and, with an infatuation ſtill more amazing than any thing already mentioned, inſtead of making his eſcape by the oppoſite gate where there was no enemy to oppoſe it, he ſhut himſelf up, together with thirteen cardinals, the foreign ambaſſadors, and many perſons of diſtinction, in the caſtle of St. Angelo, which, from his late misfortune, he might have known to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure retreat. In his way from the Vatican to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, he ſaw his troops flying before an enemy who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued without giving quarters; he heard the cries and lamentations of the Roman citizens, and beheld the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of thoſe calamities which his own credulity and ill conduct had brought upon his ſubjects <note n="t" place="bottom">Jov.

                  <p>IT is impoſſible to deſcribe, or even to imagine the miſery and horror of that ſcene which followed. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a city taken by ſtorm can dread from military rage, unreſtrained by diſcipline; whatever exceſſes the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Germans, the avarice of the Spaniards, or the licentiouſneſs of the Italians could commit, theſe the wretched inhabitants were obliged to ſuffer. Churches, palaces, and the houſes of private perſons were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without diſtinction. No age, or character, or ſex was exempt from injury. Cardinals, nobles, prieſts, matrons, virgins, were all the prey of ſoldiers, and at the mercy of men deaf to the voice of humanity. Nor did theſe outrages ceaſe, as is uſual in towns which are carried by aſſault, when the firſt fury of the ſtorm was over; the Imperialiſts kept poſſeſſion of Rome ſeveral months; and during all that time the inſolence and brutality of the ſoldiers ſcarce abated. Their booty in ready money alone amounted to a million of ducats;

what they raiſed by ranſoms and exactions far exceeded that ſum. Rome, though taken ſeveral different times by the northern nations, who over-ran the empire in the fifth and ſixth centuries, was never treated with ſo much cruelty by the barbarous and heathen Huns, Vandals or Goths, as now by the bigotted ſubjects of a Catholic Monarch <note n="u" place="bottom">Jov.

                  <p>AFTER Bourbon's death, the command of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial army devolved on Philibert de Chalons Prince of Orange, who with difficulty prevailed on as many of his ſoldiers to deſiſt from the pillage, as were neceſſary to inveſt the caſtle of St. Angelo. Clement was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of his error in having retired into that ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and untenable fort. But as the Imperialiſts, ſcorning diſcipline, and intent only on plunder, puſhed the ſiege with little vigour, he did not deſpair of holding out until the Duke d'Urbino ſhould come to his relief. That general advanced at the head of an army compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Venetians, Florentines, and Swiſs in the pay of France, of ſufficient ſtrength to have delivered Clement from the preſent danger. But d'Urbino, perferring the indulgence of his hatred againſt the family of Medici to the glory of delivering the capital of Chriſtendom, and the head of the church, pronounced the enterprize to be too hazardous; and having from an exquiſite refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in revenge, marched forward ſo far, that his army being ſeen from the ramparts of St. Angelo, flattered the Pope with the proſpect of certain relief, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately retired <note n="x" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 450.</note>.

He agreed to pay four hundred thouſand ducats to the army; to ſurrender to the Emperor all the places of ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the church; and beſides giving hoſtages, to remain a priſoner himſelf until the chief articles were performed. He was committed to the care of Alarcon,

who, by his ſevere vigilance in guarding Francis, had given full proof of his being qualified for that office; and thus, by a ſingular accident, the ſame man had the cuſtody of the two moſt illuſtrious perſonages who had been made priſoners in Europe during ſeveral ages.</p>
                  <p>THE account of this extraordinary and unexpected event was no leſs ſurprizing than agreeable to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. But in order to conceal his joy from his ſubjects, who were filled with horror at the ſucceſs and crimes of their countrymen, and to leſſen the indignation of the reſt of Europe, he declared that Rome had been aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any order from him; he wrote to all the Princes with whom he was in alliance, diſclaiming his having had any knowledge of Bourbon's intention <note n="z" place="bottom">Ruſcelli Lettere di Principi, ii. 234.</note>; he put himſelf and court into mourning; commanded the rejoicings which had been ordered for the birth of his ſon Philip to be ſtopped; and employing an artifice no leſs hypocritical than groſs, he appointed prayers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions throughout all Spain for the recovery of the Pope's liberty, which by an order to his generals he could have immediately granted him <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 109. i. 822.

                  <p>THE good fortune of the houſe of Auſtria was no leſs conſpicuous in another part of Europe. Solyman hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded Hungary with an army three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong, Lewis II. King of that country, and of Bohemia, a weak and unexperienced Prince, advanced raſhly to meet him with a body of men which did not amount to thirty thouſand. With an imprudence ſtill more unpardonable, he gave the command of theſe troops to Paul Tomorri, a Franciſcan monk, archbiſhop of Golocza. This aukward general, in the dreſs of his order, girt with its cord, marched at the head of the troops; and hurried on by his own preſumption, as well as by the impetuoſity of nobles who deſpiſed danger, but were impatient of long ſervice, fought the fatal battle of Monacz, in which the King, the flower of the Hungarian nobility, and upwards of twenty thouſand men fell the victims of his folly and ill conduct. Solyman, after his victory, ſeized and kept poſſeſſion of ſeveral

towns of greateſt ſtrength in the ſouthern provinces of Hungary, and over-running the reſt of the country, carried near two hundred thouſand perſons into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As Lewis was the laſt male of the royal family of Jagellon, the Archduke Ferdinand claimed both his crowns. This claim was founded on a double title; the one derived from the antient pretenſions of the houſe of Auſtria to both kingdoms; the other from the right of his wife, the only ſiſter of the deceaſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, The feudal inſtitutions, however, ſubſiſted both in Hungary and Bohemia in ſuch vigour, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles poſſeſſed ſuch extenſive power, that the crowns were ſtill elective, and Ferdinand's rights, if they had not been powerfully ſupported, would have met with little regard. But his own perſonal merit; the reſpect due to the brother of the greateſt Monarch in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the neceſſity of chooſing a Prince able to afford his ſubjects ſome additional protection againſt the Turkiſh arms, which, as they had felt their weight ſo lately, they greatly dreaded; together with the intrigues of his ſiſter, who had been married to the late King, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the prejudices which the Hungarians had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt: the Archduke as a foreigner; and though a conſiderable party voted for the Waywode of Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, at length ſecured Ferdinand the throne of that kingdom. The ſtates of Bohemia imitated the example of their neighbour kingdom; but, in order to aſcertain and ſecure their own privileges, they obliged Ferdinand, before his coronation, to ſubſcribe a deed which they term a <hi>Reverſe,</hi> declaring that he held that crown not by any previous right, but by their gratuitous and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary election. By ſuch a vaſt acceſſion of territories, the hereditary poſſeſſion of which they ſecured in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time to their family, the Princes of the houſe of Auſtria attained that pre-eminence in power which hath rendered them ſo formidable to the reſt of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <note n="b" place="bottom">Steph.

Charles, exaſperated by Clement's conduct, and fully employed in oppoſing the league which he had formed againſt them, had little inclination and leſs lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to take any meaſures for ſuppreſſing the new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Germany. In a Diet of the empire held at Spires, the ſtate of religion came to be conſidered, and all that the Emperor required of the Princes was, that they would wait patiently, and without encouraging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, for the meeting of a general council, which he had demanded of the Pope. They, in return, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the convocation of a council to be the proper and regular ſtep towards reforming abuſes in the church; but contended that a national council held in Germany would be more effectual for that purpoſe than what he had propoſed. To this advice, concerning the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of innovations, they paid ſo little regard, that even during the meeting of the Diet at Spires, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines who attended the Elector of Saxony and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſe-Caſſel thither, preached publickly, and adminiſtered the ſacraments according to the rites of the reformed church <note n="c" place="bottom">Sleid. 103.</note>. The Emperor's own example em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened the Germans to treat the papal authority with little reverence. During the heat of his reſentment againſt Clement, he had publiſhed a long reply to an angry brief which the Pope had intended as an apology for his own conduct. In this manifeſto, the Emperor, after having enumerated many inſtances of that Pontiff's ingratitude, deceit and ambition, all which he painted in the ſtrongeſt and moſt aggravated colours, he appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him to a general council. At the ſame time, he wrote to the college of cardinals, complaining of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's partiality and injuſtice; and requiring them, if he refuſed or delayed to call a council, to manifeſt their concern for the peace of the Chriſtian church, ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected by its chief paſtor, by ſummoning that aſſembly in their own name <note n="d" place="bottom">Goldaſt.

                  <p>THE account of the cruel manner in which the Pope had been treated, filled all Europe with aſtoniſhment and horror. To ſee a Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who, by poſſeſſing that dignity, ought to have been the protector and advocate of the holy ſee, lay violent hands on him who repreſented Chriſt on earth, and detain his ſacred perſon in a rigorous captivity, was conſidered as an impiety that merited the ſevereſt vengeance, and which called for the immediate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of every dutiful ſon of the church. Francis and Henry, alarmed at the progreſs of the Imperial arms in Italy, had, even before the taking of Rome, entered into a cloſer alliance; and in order to give ſome check to the Emperor's ambition, had agreed to make a vigorous diverſion in the Low-Countries 1527. The force of every motive which had influenced them at that time, was now increaſed; and to theſe were added, the deſire of reſcuing the Pope out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's hands, a meaſure no leſs political, than it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be pious. This, however, rendered it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to abandon their deſigns on the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and to make Italy the ſeat of war, as it was by

Francis being now ſenſible, that in his ſyſtem with regard to the affairs of Italy, the ſpirit of refinement had carried him too far; and that, by an exceſs of remiſſneſs, he had allowed Charles to attain advantages which he might eaſily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Wolſey, whom Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis had taken care to ſecure by flattery and preſents, the certain methods of gaining his favour, neglected nothing that could incenſe his maſter againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. Beſides all theſe public conſiderations, Henry was influenced by one of a more private nature; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun about this time to form his great ſcheme of divorcing Catharine of Aragon, towards the execution of which he knew that the ſanction of Papal authority would be neceſſary, he was deſirous to acquire as much merit as poſſible with Clement, by appearing to be the chief inſtrument of his deliverance.</p>
                  <p>THE negociation, between Princes thus diſpoſed, was not tedious. Wolſey himſelf conducted it, on the part of his ſovereign, with unbounded powers. Francis treated with him in perſon at Amiens, July 11, where the Cardinal appeared, and was received with royal magnificence. A marriage between the duke of Orleans and the princeſs Mary was agreed to as the baſis of the confederacy; it was reſolved that Italy ſhould be the theatre of war; the ſtrength of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which ſhould take the field, and the contingent of troops or of money which each Prince ſhould furniſh, were ſettled; and if the Emperor did not accept of the propoſals they were jointly to make him, they bound themſelves immediately to declare war, and to begin hoſtilities, Aug. 18. Henry, who took every reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with impetuoſity, entered ſo eagerly into this
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:011837_0625_0F9D888FB0850540"/>
new alliance, that in order to give Francis the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proof of his friendſhip and reſpect, he formally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the antient claim of the Engliſh Monarchs to the crown of France, which had long been the pride and ruin of the nation; as a full compenſation for which, he accepted a penſion of fifty thouſand crowns, to be paid annually to himſelf and his ſucceſſors <note n="a" place="bottom">Herbert, 83, &amp;c. Rym. Foeder 14. 203.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the Pope, being unable to fulfil the conditions of his capitulation, remained a priſoner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſevere cuſtody of Alarcon. The Florentines no ſooner heard of what had happened at Rome, than they ran to arms in a tumultuous manner; expelled the Cardinal di Cortona, who governed their city in the Pope's name; defaced the arms of the Medici; broke in pieces the ſtatutes of Leo and Clement; and declaring themſelves a free ſtate, re-eſtabliſhed their ancient popular government. The Venetians, taking advantage of the calamity of their ally the Pope, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ravenna, and other places belonging to the church, under pretext of keeping them in depoſite. The dukes of Urbino and Ferrara, laid hold likewiſe on part of the ſpoils of the unfortunate Pontiff, whom they conſidered as irretrievably ruined <note n="b" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 453.</note>.</p>
                  <p>LANNOY, on the other hand, laboured to derive ſome ſolid benefit from that unforeſeen event, which gave ſuch ſplendour and ſuperiority to his maſter's arms. For this purpoſe he marched to Rome, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Moncada, and the marquis del Guaſto, at the head of all the troops they could aſſemble in the kingdom of Naples. The arrival of this reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought new calamities on the unhappy citizens of Rome; for the ſoldiers envying the wealth of their companions, imitated their licence, and with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rapacity gathered the gleanings, which had eſcaped the avarice of the Spaniards and Germans. There was not now any army in Italy capable of making head againſt the Imperialiſts; and nothing more was requiſite to reduce Bologna, and the other towns in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, than to have appeared before them. But the ſoldiers having been ſo long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed,

Lannoy, finding that it was no longer ſafe for him to remain among licentious troops, who deſpiſed his dignity, and hated his perſon, returned to Naples; ſoon after the marquis del Guaſto and Moncada thought it prudent to quit Rome for the ſame reaſon. The Prince of Orange, a general only in name, and by the moſt precarious of all tenures, the good will of ſoldiers whom ſucceſs and licence had rendered capricious, was obliged to pay more attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their humours, than they did to his commands. Thus the Emperor, inſtead of reaping any of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he might have expected from the reduction of Rome, had the mortification to ſee the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable body of troops he had ever brought into the field, continue in a ſtate of inactivity from which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to rouze them <note n="c" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 454.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS gave the King of France and the Venetians leiſure to form new ſchemes, and to enter into new engagements for the delivering the Pope, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the liberties of Italy. The newly reſtored re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of Florence very imprudently joined with them, and Lautrec, of whoſe abilities the Italians entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a much more favourable opinion than his own maſter, was, in order to gratify them, appointed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo of the league. It was with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance he undertook that office, being unwilling to expoſe himſelf a ſecond time to the difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces which the negligence of the King, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his favourites might bring upon him. The beſt troops in France marched under his command, and the King of England, though he had not yet declared war againſt the Emperor, advanced a conſiderable

ſum towards carrying on the expedition. Lautrec's firſt operations were prudent, vigorous, and ſucceſsful. By the aſſiſtance of Andrew Doria, the ableſt ſea offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of that age, he rendered himſelf maſter of Genoa, and re-eſtabliſhed in that republic the faction of the Fregoſi, together with the dominion of France. He obliged Alexandria to ſurrender after a ſhort ſiege, and reduced all the country on that ſide of the Teſino. He took Pavia, which had ſo long reſiſted the arms of his ſovereign, by aſſault, and plundered it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

All the Milaneſe, which Antonia de Leyva defended with a ſmall body of troops kept together and ſupported by his own addreſs and induſtry, muſt have ſoon ſubmitted to his power, if he had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bend the force of his arms againſt that country. But Lautrec durſt not compleat a conqueſt which would have been ſo honourable to himſelf, and of ſuch advantage to the league. Francis knew his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to be more deſirous of circumſcribing the Imperial power in Italy, than of acquiring new terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories for him, and was afraid that if Sforza were once re-eſtabliſhed in Milan, they would ſecond but cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the attack which he intended to make on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Naples. For this reaſon he inſtructed Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec not to puſh his operations with too much vigour in Lombardy; and happily the importunities of the Pope, and the ſollicitations of the Florentines, the one for relief, and the other for protection, were ſo urgent as afforded him a decent pretext to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward without yielding to the entreaties of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Sforza, who inſiſted on his laying ſiege to Milan <note n="d" place="bottom">Guic l. xviii. p. 461. de Bellay, 170, &amp;c.

                  <p>WHILE Lautrec advanced ſlowly towards Rome, the Emperor had time to deliberate concerning the diſpoſal of the Pope's perſon, who ſtill remained a priſoner in the caſtle of St. Angelo.

But the fear of giving new offence to all Chriſtendom, and of filling his own ſubjects with horror, obliged him to forego that ſatisfaction <note n="e" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 457.</note>. The progreſs of the confederates made it now neceſſary either to ſet the Pope at liberty, or to remove him to ſome place of confinement more ſecure than the caſtle of St. Angelo. Many conſiderations induced him to prefer the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, particularly his want of the money requiſite as well for recruiting his army, as for paying off the vaſt arrears due to it. In order to obtain this he had aſſembled the Cortes of Caſtile at Valladolid about the beginning of the year, and having laid before them the ſtate of his affairs, and repreſented the neceſſity of making great preparations to reſiſt the enemies, whom envy at the ſucceſs which had crowned his arms would unite againſt him, he demanded a large ſupply in the moſt preſſing terms.

                  <p>NOR was the Pope inactive on his part, or his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues unſucceſsful towards haſtening ſuch a treaty. By ſlattery, and the appearance of unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he diſarmed the reſentment of the cardinal Colonna, and wrought upon his vanity, which made him deſirous of ſhewing the world that as his power had at firſt depreſſed the Pope, it would now raiſe him to his former dignity. By favours and promiſes he gained Morone, who, by one of thoſe whimſical revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

which occur ſo often in his life, and which ſo ſtrongly diſplay his character, had now recovered his credit and authority with the Imperialiſts. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and influence of two ſuch men eaſily removed all the difficulties of the Emperor's ambaſſadors, and brought to a concluſion the treaty for Clement's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, upon conditions hard indeed, but not more intolerable than a Prince in his ſituation had reaſon to expect. He was obliged to advance in ready money an hundred thouſand crowns for the uſe of the army; to pay the ſame ſum at the diſtance of a fortnight; and at the end of three months, an hundred and fifty thouſand more. He engaged not to take part in the war againſt Charles, either in Lombardy or in Naples; he granted him a cruzado, and the tenth of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal revenues in Spain; and he not only gave hoſtages, but put the Emperor in poſſeſſion of ſeveral towns, as ſecurity for the performance of theſe articles <note n="g" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 467, &amp;c.</note>. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed the firſt moiety by a ſale of eccleſiaſtical dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and benefices, and other expedients equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannonical, a day was fixed for delivering him from impriſonment, Decemb. 6. But Clement, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be free, after a tedious confinement of ſix months, as well as full of the ſuſpicion and diſtruſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the unfortunate, was ſo much afraid that the Imperialiſts might ſtill throw in obſtacles to put off his deliverance, that he diſguiſed himſelf the preceding night in the habit of a merchant, and Alarcon having remitted ſomewhat of his vigilance upon the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the treaty, he made his eſcape undiſcovered.

                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, the ambaſſadors of France and England repaired to Spain, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the treaty which Wolſey had conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the French King. The Emperor, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to draw on himſelf the united forces of the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:011837_0630_0F9D88937351A648"/>
two Monarchs, diſcovered an inclination to relax ſomewhat the rigour of the treaty of Madrid, to which hitherto, he had adhered inflexibly. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to accept of the two millions of crowns which Francis had propoſed to pay as an equivalent for the dutchy of Burgundy, and to ſet his ſons at liberty on condition that he would recal his army out of Italy, and reſtore Genoa together with the other conqueſts he had made in that country. With regard to Sforza, he inſiſted that his fate ſhould be determined by the judges appointed to enquire into his crimes. Theſe propoſitions being made to Henry, he tranſmitted them to his ally the French King, whom it more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to examine, and to anſwer them; and if Francis had been ſincerely ſollicitous either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude peace, or preſerve conſiſtency in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he ought inſtantly to have cloſed with overtures which differed but little from the propoſitions he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had formerly made <note n="i" place="bottom">Recueil des Traitez, 2. 249.</note>. But his views were now much changed; his alliance with Henry; Lautrec's progreſs in Italy, and the ſuperiority of his army there above that of the Emperor, ſcarce left him room to doubt of the ſucceſs of his enterprize againſt Naples. Full of theſe ſanguine hopes, he was at no loſs to find pretexts for rejecting or evading what the Emperor had propoſed. Under the appearance of ſympathy with Sforza, for whoſe intereſts he had not hitherto diſcovered much ſolicitude, he again demanded the full and unconditional re-eſtabliſhment of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate prince in his dominions. Under colour of its being imprudent to rely on the Emperor's ſincerity, he inſiſted that his ſons ſhould be ſet at liberty before the French troops left Italy, or ſurrendered Genoa. The unreaſonableneſs of theſe demands, as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful inſinuation with which they were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, irritated Charles to ſuch a degree that he could ſcarce liſten to them with patience; and repenting of his moderation which had made ſo little impreſſion on his enemies, declared that he would not depart in the ſmalleſt article from the conditions he had now offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <p>NEXT day January 22. 1528 two heralds who had accompanied the embaſſadors on purpoſe, though they had hitherto concealed their character, having aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the enſigns of their office, appeared in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's court, and being admitted into his preſence, they in the name of their reſpective maſters, and with all the ſolemnity cuſtomary on ſuch occaſions, denounced war againſt him. Charles received both with a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuitable to his own rank, but ſpoke to each in a tone adapted to the ſentiments which he entertained of their ſovereigns. He accepted the defiance of the Engliſh Monarch with a firmneſs tempered by ſome degree of decency and reſpect. His reply to the French King abounded with that acrimony of expreſſion, which perſonal rivalſhip, exaſperated by the memory of many injuries inflicted as well as ſuffered, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſts. He deſired the French herald to acquaint his ſovereign, that he would henceforth conſider him as a baſe violator of public faith, and a ſtranger to the honour and integrity becoming a gentleman. Francis, too high ſpirited to bear ſuch an imputation, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to an uncommon expedient in order to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his character. He inſtantly ſent back the herald with a <hi>cartel</hi> of defiance, in which he gave the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror the lie in form, challenged him to ſingle combat, requiring him to name the time and place of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and the weapons with which he choſe to fight.

                  <p>THE example, of two perſonages ſo illuſtrious drew

ſuch general attention, and carried along with it ſo much authority, as gave riſe to an important change in manners all over Europe. Duels, as has already been obſerved, had long been permitted by the laws of all the European nations, and forming a part of their juriſprudence, were authorized by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on many occaſions as the moſt proper method of terminating queſtions with regard to property, or of deciding in thoſe which reſpected crimes. But ſingle combats being conſidered as ſolemn appeals to the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience and juſtice of the ſupreme Being, they were allowed only in public cauſes, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of law, and carried on in a judicial form. Men accuſtomed to this manner of deciſion in courts of juſtice, were naturally led to apply it to perſonal and private quarrels. Duels, which at firſt could be appointed by the civil judge alone, were fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interpoſition of his authority, and in caſes to which the laws did not extend. The tranſaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Charles and Francis ſtrongly countenanced this practice. Upon every affront, or injury which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to touch his honour, a gentleman thought himſelf entitled to draw his ſword, and to call on his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make reparation. Such an opinion introduced among men, of fierce courage, of high ſpirit, and of rude manners, when offence was often given, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge was always prompt, produced moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Much of the beſt blood in Chriſtendom was ſhed; many uſeful lives were ſacrificed; and at ſome periods, war itſelf hath ſcarce been more deſtructive than theſe conteſts of honour. So powerful, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is the dominion of faſhion, that neither the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of penal laws, nor reverence for religion have been able entirely to aboliſh a practice unknown among the ancients, and not juſtifiable by any principle of reaſon; though at the ſame time it muſt be admitted, that to this abſurd cuſtom, we muſt aſcribe in ſome degree the extraordinary gentleneſs and complaiſance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern manners, and that reſpectful attention of one man to another, which, at preſent, render the ſocial intercourſes of life far more agreeable and decent than among the moſt civilized nations of antiquity.</p>

                     <pb n="231" facs="unknown:011837_0633_0F9D8895B0F90490"/>WHILE the two monarchs ſeemed ſo eager to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their quarrel by a perſonal combat, Lautrec con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his operations which promiſed to be more deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. His army, which was now increaſed to thirty-five thouſand men, advanced by great marches towards Naples. The terror of their approach, as well as the remonſtrances and the entreaties of the prince of Orange, prevailed at laſt on the Imperial troops, though with difficulty to quit Rome, of which they had kept poſſeſſion during ten months. But of that flouriſhing army which had entered the city, ſcarce one half re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained; the reſt, cut off by the plague, or waſted by diſeaſes, the effects of their inactivity, intemperance, and debauchery, fell victims to their own crimes<note n="m" place="bottom">Guic. l. 18. 487.</note>. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec made the greateſt efforts to attack them in their retreat towards the Neapolitan territories, which would have finiſhed the war at one blow. But the prudence of their leaders diſappointed all his meaſures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them with little loſs to Naples. The people of that kingdom, always the prey of every invader, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely impatient to ſhake off the Spaniſh yoke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the French with open arms, wherever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to take poſſeſſion; and Gaeta and Naples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſcarce any place of importance remained in the hands of the Imperialiſts. The preſervation of the former was owing to the ſtrength of its fortifications, that of the latter to the preſence of the Imperial army. Lautrec, however ſat down before Naples, but finding it vain to think of reducing by force a city defended by ſo many troops, he was obliged to employ the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but leſs dangerous method of blockade; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken meaſures which appeared to him effectual, he confidently aſſured his maſter, that famine would ſoon compel the beſieged to capitulate. Theſe hopes were ſtrongly confirmed by the defeat of a vigorous attempt made by the enemy in order to recover the command of the ſea. The gallies of Andrew Doria, under the command of his nephew Philippino, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mouth of the harbour. Moncada, who had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Lannoy in the viceroyalty, rigged out a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of gallies ſuperior to Doria's, and going on board
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:011837_0634_0F9D8896713A62F0"/>
himſelf with the Marquis del Gauſto, and the flower of the Spaniſh officers and ſoldiers, attacked Doria be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the Venetian and French fleets. But Doria, by his ſuperior ſkill in naval operations, eaſily triumphed over the valour and number of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. The viceroy was killed, moſt of his fleet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and Gauſto, with many officers of diſtinction being taken priſoners, were put on board the captive gallies, and ſent by Philippino, as trophies of his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, to his uncle<note n="n" place="bottom">Guic. l. 19. 487.

                  <p>BUT notwithſtanding this flattering proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, many circumſtances concurred to fruſtrate Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec's expectations. Clement, tho' he always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his being indebted to Francis for the recovery of his liberty, and often complained of the cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had met with from the Emperor, was not influenced at this juncture by principles of gratitude, nor which was more extraordinary, was he ſwayed by the deſire of revenge. His paſt misfortunes render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him more cautious than ever, and his recollection of the errors which he had committed, increaſed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral irreſolution of his mind. While he amuſed Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis with promiſes, he ſecretly negociated with Charles; and being ſollicitous, above all things, to re-eſtabliſh-his family in Florence with their ancient authority which he could not expect from Francis, who had entered into ſtrict alliance with the new republick, he leaned rather towards the ſide of his enemy than that of his benefactor, and gave Lautrec no aſſiſtance towards carrying on his operations. The Venetians, viewing with jealouſy the progreſs of the French arms, were intent only on recovering ſuch maritime towns in the Neapolitan dominions as were to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by their republick, while they were altogether careleſs about the reduction of Naples, on which the ſucceſs of the common cauſe depended <note n="o" place="bottom">Guic. l. xix. 491.</note>. The King of England, inſtead of being able, as had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, to embarraſs the Emperor by attacking his territories in the Low-Countries, found his ſubjects ſo averſe to an unneceſſary war, which would have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined

                  <p>THESE unexpected events retarded the progreſs of the French, and diſcouraged both the general and his troops; but the revolt of Andrew Doria proved a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow to all their meaſures. That gallant officer, the citizen of a republick, and trained up from his infancy in the ſea-ſervice, retained the ſpirit of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance natural to the former, and the plain liberal manners peculiar to the latter. A perfect ſtranger to the arts of ſubmiſſion or flattery neceſſary in courts, and conſcious at the ſame time of his own merit and importance, he always offered his advice with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and often preferred his complaints and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances with boldneſs. The French miniſters, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch liberties, determined to ruin a man who treated them with ſo little deference; and though Francis himſelf had a juſt ſenſe of Doria's ſervices, as well as an high eſteem for his character, the courtiers, by continually repreſenting him as a man haughty, intractable, and more ſollicitous to aggrandize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than to promote the intereſt of France, gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undermined the foundations of his credit, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King's mind with ſuſpicion and diſtruſt. From thence proceeded ſeveral affronts and indignities put upon Doria. His appointments were not regularly paid; his advice, even in naval affairs, was often ſlighted; an attempt was made to ſeize the priſoners taken by his nephew in the ſea-ſight off Naples; all which he bore with abundance of ill humour. But an injury offered to his country, tranſported him beyond all bounds of patience. The French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fortify Savona, to clear its habour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving thither ſome branches of trade carried on at

Genoa, plainly ſhewed that they intended to render that town, long the object of jealouſy and hatred to the Genoeſe, their rival in wealth and commerce. Doria, animated with a patriotic zeal for the honour and intereſt of his country, remonſtrated againſt this in the higheſt tone, not without threats, if the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were not inſtantly abandoned. This bold action, aggravated by the malice of the courtiers, and placed in the moſt odious light, irritated Francis to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he commanded Barbeſieux, whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed admiral of the Levant, to ſail directly to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, with the French fleet, to arreſt Doria, and to ſeize his gallies. This raſh order, of which the moſt profound ſecrecy alone could have ſecured the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was concealed with ſo little care, that Doria got timely intelligence of it, and retired with all his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to a place of ſafety. Gauſto his priſoner, who had long obſerved and fomented his growing diſcontent, and had often allured him by magnificent promiſes to enter into the Emperor's ſervice, laid hold on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity. While his indignation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment were at their height, he prevailed on him to diſpatch one of his officers to the Imperial court with his overtures and demands. The negociation was not long; Charles fully ſenſible of the importance of ſuch an acquiſition, granted him whatever terms he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.

                  <p>HIS arrival opened the communication with the ſea, and reſtored plenty in Naples, which was now reduced to the laſt extremity; and the French, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt their ſuperiority at ſea, were ſoon reduced to great ſtraits for want of proviſions. The prince of Orange, who ſucceeded the viceroy in the command of the Imperial army, ſhewed himſelf by his prudent conduct worthy of that honour which his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the death of his generals had twice acquired him.

                  <p>THE loſs of Genoa followed immediately upon the ruin of the army in Naples. To deliver his country from the dominion of foreigners was Doria's higheſt ambition, and had been his principal inducement to
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:011837_0638_0F9D88996F2E23E8"/>
quit the ſervice of France, and enter into that of the Emperor. A moſt favourable opportunity for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this honourable enterprize now preſented itſelf. The city of Genoa, afflicted by the peſtilence, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſerted by its inhabitants: the French garriſon being neither regularly paid nor recruited, was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an inconſiderable number; Doria's emiſſaries found that ſuch of the citizens as remained, being weary alike of the French and Imperial yoke, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of which they had alternately felt, were ready to welcome him as their deliverer, and to ſecond all his meaſures. Things wearing this promiſing aſpect, he ſailed towards the coaſt of Genoa; on his approach the French gallies retired; a ſmall body of men which he landed, ſurprized one of the gates of Genoa in the night time; Trivulci, the French governor, with his feeble gariſon, Sept. 12, ſhut himſelfup in the citadel, and Doria took poſſeſſion of the town without bloodſhed or reſiſtance. Want of proviſions quickly obliged Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulci to capitulate; the people, eager to aboliſh ſuch an odious monument of their ſervitude, ran together with a tumultuous violence, and levelled the citadel with the ground.</p>
                  <p>IT was now in Doria's power to have rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſovereign of his country, which he had ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily freed from oppreſſion. The fame of his former actions, the ſucceſs of his preſent attempt, the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his friends, the gratitude of his countrymen, together with the ſupport of the Emperor, all conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to facilitate his attaining the ſupreme authority, and invited him to lay hold of it. But with a magnanimity of which there are few examples, he ſacrificed all thoughts of aggrandizing himſelf to the virtuous ſatisfaction of eſtabliſhing liberty in his country, the higheſt object at which ambition can aim. Having aſſembled the whole body of the people in the court before his palace, he aſſured them, that the happineſs of ſeeing them once more in poſſeſſion of freedom, was to him a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for all his ſervices; that more delighted with the name of citizen than of ſovereign, he claimed no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence or power above his equals; but remitted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to them the right of ſettling what form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:011837_0639_0F9D889A2FB01D58"/>
they would now chuſe to be eſtabliſhed among them. The people liſtened to him with tears of admiration, and of joy. Twelve perſons were elected to new-model the conſtitution of the republic. The influence of Doria's virtue and example, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated itſelf to his countrymen; the factions which had long torn and ruined the ſtate, ſeemed to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; prudent precautions were taken to prevent their reviving; and the ſame form of government which hath ſubſiſted with little variations ſince that time in Genoa, was eſtabliſhed with univerſal applauſe. Doria, lived to a great age, beloved, reſpected and honoured by his countrymen; and adhering uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his profeſſions of moderation, without arrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing unbecoming a private citizen, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a great aſcendant over the councils of the republic, which owed its being to his generoſity. The authority he poſſeſſed was more flattering as well as more ſatisfactory, than that derived from ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a dominion founded in love and in gratitude; and upheld by veneration for his virtues, not by the dread of his power. His memory is ſtill reverenced by the Genoeſe, and he is diſtinguiſhed in their public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, and celebrated in the works of their hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the moſt honourable of all appellations, THE FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, AND THE RESTORER OF ITS LIBERTY <note n="x" place="bottom">Guic. l. 19. p. 498.

                  <p>FRANCIS, in order to recover the reputation of his arms, diſcredited by ſo many loſſes, made new efforts in the Milaneſe, (1529.) But the Count of St. Pol, a raſh and unexperienced officer, to whom he gave the command, was no match for Antonio de Leyva, the ableſt of the Imperial generals. He, by his ſuperior ſkill in war, checked with a handful of men, the briſk, but ill-concerted motions of the French; and though ſo infirm himſelf that he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried conſtantly in a litter, he ſurpaſſed them when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required, no leſs in activity than in prudence.

                  <p>AMIDST theſe vigorous operations in the field each party diſcovered an impatient deſire of peace and continual negociations were carried on for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The French King diſcouraged, and almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by ſo many unſucceſsful enterprizes, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced now to think of obtaining the releaſe of his ſons by conceſſions, not by the terror of his arms. The Pope hoped to recover by a treaty whatever he had loſt in the war. The Emperor, notwithſtanding the advantages which he had gained, had many reaſons to make him wiſh for an accommodation; Solyman, having over-run Hungary, was ready to break in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Auſtrian territories with the whole force of the Eaſt; the Reformation gained ground daily in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, the princes who favoured it entered into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, which he thought dangerous to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Empire; the Spaniards murmured at a war the weight of which reſted chiefly on them; the variety and extent of his operations, far exceeded what his revenues could ſupport; his ſucceſs hitherto had been owing chiefly to his own good fortune, and to the abilities of his generals, nor could he flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that they with troops deſtitute of every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, would always triumph over enemies ſtill in a condition to renew their attacks. All parties, however, were at equal pains to conceal, or to diſſemble their real ſentiments. The Emperor, that his inability to carry on the war might not be ſuſpected, inſiſted on high terms in the tone of a conqueror. The Pope, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous not to loſe his preſent allies, before he came to any agreement with Charles, continued to make a thouſand proteſtations of fidelity to the former, while he privately negociated with the latter. Francis, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that his confederates might prevent him by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves with the Emperor, had recourſe to many diſhonourable artifices in order to turn their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from the meaſures which he was taking to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt all differences with his rival.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="unknown:011837_0641_0F9D889BB07B9348"/>IN this ſituation of affairs, when all the contending powers wiſhed for peace, but durſt not venture too haſtily on the ſteps neceſſary for attaining it, two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies undertook to procure this bleſſing ſo much deſired by all Europe. Theſe were Margaret of Auſtria, dowager of Savoy, the Emperor's aunt, and Louiſe Francis's mother. They agreed on an interview at Cambray, and being lodged in two adjoining houſes between which a communication was opened, met together without ceremony or obſervation, and held daily conferences to which no perſon whatever was admitted. As both were profoundly ſkilled in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thoroughly acquainted with the ſecrets of their reſpective courts, and poſſeſſed with perfect confidence in each other, they ſoon made great progreſs towards a final accommodation; and the ambaſſadors of all the confederates waited in anxious ſuſpence to know their fate, the determination of which was entirely in their hands <note n="z" place="bottom">P. Heuter. Rer. Auſtr. lib x. c. 3. p. 133. Mem. de Bellay, p. 122.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT whatever diligence they uſed to haſten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a general peace, the Pope had the addreſs and induſtry to get the ſtart of his allies, by concluding at Barcelona a particular treaty for himſelf, (June 20.) The Emperor, impatient to viſit Italy in his way to Germany; and deſirous of re-eſtabliſhing tranquillity in the one country, before he attempted to compoſe the diſorders which abounded in the other, found it neceſſary to ſecure at leaſt one alliance on which he might depend, among the Italian ſtates. That with the Pope, who courted it with unwearied importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeemed more proper than any other. Charles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extremely ſollicitous to make ſome reparation for the inſults which he had offered to his ſacred charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to redeem paſt offences by new merit, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clement, after all his misfortunes, terms more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable than he could have expected after a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeries of ſucceſs. Among other articles, he engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſtore all the territories belonging to the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical ſtate; to re-eſtabliſh the dominion of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:011837_0642_0F9D889C6F6262E8"/>
in Florence; to give his natural daughter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Alexander the head of that family; and to put it in the Pope's power to decide concerning the fate of Sforza, and the poſſeſſion of the Milaneſe. In return for theſe ample conceſſions, Clement gave the Emperor the inveſtiture of Naples without the reſerve of any tribute, but the preſent of a white ſteed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his ſovereignty; abſolved all who had been concerned in aſſaulting and plundering Rome; and permitted Charles and his brother Ferdinand to levy the fourth of the eccleſiaſtical revenues through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their dominions <note n="a" place="bottom">Guic. l. 19. 522.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE account of this tranſaction, quickened the negociations at Cambray, and brought Margaret and Louiſe to an immediate agreement, (Auguſt 5.) The treaty of Madrid ſerved as the baſis of that which they concluded; the latter being intended to mitigate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>igour of the former. The chief articles were, That the Emperor ſhould not, for the preſent, demand the reſtitution of Burgundy, reſerving however, in full force, his rights and pretenſions to that dutchy; That Francis ſhould pay two millions of crowns as the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his ſons, and, before they were ſet at liberty, ſhould reſtore ſuch towns as he ſtill held in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe; That he ſhould reſign the ſovereignty of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Artois, that he ſhould renounce all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Naples, Milan, Genoa, and every other place beyond the Alps, that he ſhould immediately conſummate the marriage concluded between him and the Emperor's ſiſter Eleanora <note n="b" place="bottom">P.

                  <p>THUS Francis, chiefly from his impatience to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure liberty to his ſons, ſacrificed every thing which had at firſt prompted him to take arms, or which had induced him, by continuing hoſtilities, during nine ſucceſſive campaigns, to protract the war at a length ſcarce known in Europe before the eſtabliſhment of ſtanding armies, and the impoſitions of exorbitant taxes became univerſal. The Emperor, by this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:011837_0643_0F9D889DB761B818"/>
was rendered ſole arbiter of the fate of Italy; he delivered his territories in the Netherlands from an ignominious badge of ſubjection; and after having baffled his rival in the field, he preſcribed to him the conditions of peace. The different conduct and ſpirit with which the two Monarchs carried on the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of war, led naturally to ſuch an iſſue of it. Charles, inclined by temper, as well as obliged by his ſituation, concerted all his ſchemes with caution, purſued them with perſeverance; and obſerving cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and events with attention, let none eſcape that could be improved to advantage. Francis, more enterpriſing than ſteady, undertook great deſigns with warmth, but executed them with remiſſneſs; and, diverted by his pleaſures, or deceived by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, he often loſt the moſt promiſing opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſucceſs. Nor had the character of the two ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals themſelves greater influence on the operations of the war, than the oppoſite qualities of the generals whom they employed. Among the Imperialiſts, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour tempered with prudence; fertility of invention aided by experience; ſagacity to penetrate the deſigns of their enemies, as well as to conduct their own, with all the talents that form great commanders and enſure victory, were conſpicuous. Among the French, theſe qualities were either wanting, or the very reverſe of them abounded; nor could they boaſt of one man (unleſs we except Lautrec, who was always unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) that equalled the merit of Peſcara, Leyva, Guaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the prince of Orange, and other leaders whom Charles had to ſet in oppoſition to them. Bourbon, Morone, and Doria, who might have been capable of balancing by their abilities and conduct the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the Imperialiſts had acquired, were loſt through the careleſſneſs of the King, and the malice or injuſtice of his counſellors; and the moſt fatal blows given to France during the progreſs of the war, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the deſpair and reſentment of theſe three perſons, who were forced to abandon her ſervice.</p>
                  <p>THE hard conditions to which Francis was obliged to ſubmit, were not the moſt afflicting circumſtance to him in the treaty of Cambray. He loſt his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:011837_0644_0F9D889DEFBC0050"/>
and the confidence of all Europe, by abandoning his allies to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> adjuſting their intereſts, or afraid that whatever he claimed for them muſt have been purchaſed by farther conceſſions on his own part, he gave them up in a body; and without the leaſt provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their behalf, left the Venetians, the Florentines, the duke of Ferrara, together with ſuch of the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan barons as had joined his army, to the mercy of the Emperor. They exclaimed loudly againſt this baſe and perfidious action, of which Francis himſelf was ſo much aſhamed, that, in order to avoid the pain of hearing from their ambaſſadors the reproaches which he juſtly merited, it was ſome time before he would conſent to allow them an audience. Charles, on the other hand, was attentive to the intereſt of every perſon who had adhered to him; the rights of ſome of his Flemiſh ſubjects, who had eſtates or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in France, were ſecured; one article was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, obliging Francis to reſtore the blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Conſtable Bourbon; and to grant his heirs the poſſeſſion of his lands which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; another, by which indemnification was ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for thoſe French gentlemen who had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Bourbon in his exile <note n="c" place="bottom">Guic. l. 19. p. 525. P. Heuter. Rer, Auſtr. lib. x. c. 4. p. 235.</note>. This conduct, laudable in itſelf, and placed in the moſt ſtriking light by a compariſon with that of Francis, gained Charles as much eſteem as the ſucceſs of his arms had acquired him glory.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS, did not treat the King of England with the ſame neglect as his other allies. He communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him all the ſteps of his negociation at Cambray, and luckily found that Monarch in a ſituation which left him no choice, but to approve implicitly of his meaſures, and to concur with them. Henry had been ſolliciting the Pope for ſome time, in order to obtain a divorce from Catharine of Aragon his Queen. Several motives combined in prompting the King to urge this ſuit; as he was powerfully influenced at ſome
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:011837_0645_0F9D889EB0CFBA40"/>
ſeaſons by religious conſiderations, he entertained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſcruples concerning the legitimacy of his marriage with his brother's widow; his affections had long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> eſtranged from the Queen, who was older than himſelf, and had loſt all the charms ſhe poſſeſſed in the earlier part of her life; he was paſſionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of having male iſſue; Wolſey artfully fortified his ſcruples, and encouraged his hopes, that he might widen the breach between him and the Emperor, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine's nephew; and, what was more forcible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in its operation than all theſe united, the King had conceived a violent love for the celebrated Anne Boleyn, a young lady of great beauty, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er accompliſhments, whom, as he found it impoſſible to gain her on other terms, he determined to raiſe to the throne. The Papal authority had often been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to grant divorces for reaſons leſs ſpecious than thoſe which Henry produced. When the matter was firſt propoſed to Clement, during his impriſonment in the caſtle of St. Angelo, as his hopes of recovering liberty depended entirely on the King of England, and his ally of France, he expreſſed the warmeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to gratify him. But no ſooner was he ſet free, than he diſcovered other ſentiments. Charles, who eſpouſed the protection of his aunt with zeal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by reſentment, alarmed the Pope on the one hand with threats which made a deep impreſſion on his timid mind; and allured him on the other with thoſe promiſes in favour of his family, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accompliſhed. Upon the proſpect of theſe Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only forgot all his obligations to Henry, but ventured to endanger the intereſt of the Romiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in England, and to run the riſk of alienating that kingdom for ever from the obedience of the Papal ſee. After amuſing Henry during two years, with all the ſubtleties and chicane which the court of Rome can ſo dextrouſly employ to protract or defeat any cauſe; after diſplaying the whole extent of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous and deceitful policy, the intricacies of which the Engliſh hiſtorians, to whom it properly belongs, have found it no eaſy matter to trace and unravel; he, at laſt, recalled the powers of the delegates whom he
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:011837_0646_0F9D889F77E4EDF0"/>
had appointed to judge in the point, avocated the cauſe to Rome, leaving the King no other hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a divorce but from the perſonal deciſion of the Pope himſelf. As Clement was now in ſtrict alliance with the Emperor, who had purchaſed his friendſhip by ſuch exorbitant conceſſions, Henry deſpaired of procuring any ſentence from the former, but what was dictated by the latter. His honour, however, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concurred in preventing him from relinquiſhing his ſcheme of a divorce, which he determined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh by other means, and at any rate; and the continuance of Francis's friendſhip being neceſſary to counterbalance the Emperor's power, he, in order to ſecure that, not only offered no remonſtrances againſt the total neglect of their allies, in the treaty of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, but made Francis the preſent of a large ſum, as a brotherly contribution towards the payment of the ranſom for his ſons <note n="d" place="bottom">Herbert.

                  <p>MEANWHILE the Emperor landed in Italy with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous train of the Spaniſh nobility, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body of troops. He left the government of Spain during his abſence to the Empreſs Iſabella. By his long reſidence in that country, he had acquired ſuch thorough knowledge of the character of the people, that he could perfectly accommodate the maxims of his government to their genius. He could even aſſume, upon ſome occaſions, ſuch popular manners, as gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wonderfully upon the Spaniards. A ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his diſpoſition to gratify them had occurred a few days before he embarked for Italy: He was to make his public entry into the city of Barcelona; and ſome doubts having ariſen among the inhabitants, whether they ſhould receive him as Emperor, or as Count of Barcelona, Charles inſtantly decided in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the latter, declaring that he was more proud of that antient title, than of his Imperial crown.

                  <p>THE Emperor appeared in Italy with the pomp and power of a conqueror; and ambaſſadors from all the princes and ſtates of that country attended his court waiting to receive his deciſion with regard to their fate. At Genoa, where he firſt landed, he was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the acclamations due to the protector of their liberties. Having honoured Doria with many marks of diſtinction, and beſtowed on the republick ſeveral new privileges, he proceeded to Bologna, the place fixed upon for his interview with the Pope. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to unite in his publick entry into that city the ſtate and majeſty that ſuited an Emperor, with the humility becoming an obedient ſon of the church; and while at the head of twenty thouſand veteran ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, able to give law to all Italy, he kneeled down to kiſs the feet of that very Pope whom he had ſo lately detained a priſoner. The Italians, after ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much from the ferocity and licentiouſneſs of his armies, and after having been long accuſtomed to form in their imagination a picture of Charles which bore ſome reſemblance to that of the barbarous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the Goths or Huns, who had formerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted their country with the like calamities, were ſurprized to ſee a prince of a graceful appearance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and courteous in his deportment, of regular manners, and of exemplary attention to all the offices of religion <note n="f" place="bottom">Sandov.

Charles, from all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, finding it neceſſary to aſſume an air of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, acted his part with a good grace. He admitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sforza into his preſence, and not only gave him a full pardon of all paſt offences, but granted him the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure of the duchy together with his neice the King of Denmark's daughter in marriage. He allowed the duke of Ferrara to keep poſſeſſion of all his dominions, adjuſting the points in diſpute between him and the Pope with an impartiality not very agreeable to the latter.

The Florentines alone did not partake of this general joy. Animated with a zeal for liberty more laudable than prudent, they determined to oppoſe the reſtoration of the Medici. The Imperial army had already entered their territories, and formed the ſiege of their capital. But though deſerted by all their allies, and left without any hope of ſuccour, they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves many months with an obſtinate valour worthy of better ſucceſs, and even when they ſurrenderd, they obtained a capitulation which gave them hopes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſome remains of their liberty. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from his deſire to gratify the Pope, fruſtrated all their expectations, and aboliſhing their ancient form of government, raiſed Alexander Medici to the ſame abſolute dominion over that ſtate which his family have retained to the preſent times. Philibert de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons prince of Orange, the Imperial general, was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during this ſiege. His eſtate and titles deſcended to his ſiſter Claude de Chalons, who was married to Renè count of Naſſau, and ſhe tranſmitted to her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of the houſe of Naſſau the title of Princes of Orange which they have rendered ſo illuſtrious<note n="i" place="bottom">Guic. l. xx. p. 541 &amp;c.

                  <p>AFTER the publication of the peace at Bologna, and the ceremony of his coronation as King of Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy and Emperor of the Romans, which the Pope performed with the accuſtomed formalities, (Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 22,) nothing detained Charles in Italy <note n="k" place="bottom">H.

His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence became every day more neceſſary in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and was ſolicited with equal importunity by the catholicks and by the favourers of the new doctrines. During that long interval of tranquillity which the abſence of the Emperor, the conteſts between him
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:011837_0650_0F9D88A26FFAA378"/>
and the Pope, and his attention to the war with France afforded them, the latter had gained much ground. Moſt of the princes who had embraced Luther's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, had not only eſtabliſhed in their territories that form of worſhip which he approved, but had entirely ſuppreſſed the rites of the Romiſh church. Many of the free cities had imitated their conduct. Almoſt one half of the Germanick body had revolted from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſee, and its dominion, even in that part which had not hitherto ſhaken off the yoke, was conſiderably weakened by the example of the neighbouring ſtates, or by the ſecret progreſs of thoſe doctrines which had undermined it among them. Whatever ſatisfaction the Emperor, while he was at open enmity with the ſee of Rome, might have felt in thoſe events that tended to mortify and embarraſs the Pope, he could not help perceiving now, that the religious diviſions in Germany would, in the end; prove extremely hurtful to the Imperial authority. The weakneſs of former Emperors had ſuffered the great vaſſals of the Empire to make ſuch ſucceſsful encroachments upon their power and prerogative, that during the whole courſe of a war, which had often required the exertion of his utmoſt ſtrength, Charles ſcarce drew any effectual aid from Germany, and found that magnificent titles or obſolete pretenſions were almoſt the only advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he had gained by ſwaying the Imperial ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. He now became fully ſenſible that if he did not recover in ſome degree the prerogatives which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had loſt, and acquire the authority, as well as poſſeſs the name of head of the Empire, his high dignity would contribute more to obſtruct than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his ambitious ſchemes. Nothing, he ſaw, was more eſſential towards attaining this than to ſuppreſs opinions which might form new bonds of confederacy among the princes of the Empire, and unite them by ties ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſacred than any political connection. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemed to lead more certainly to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deſigns, than to employ zeal for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion, of which he was the natural protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as the inſtrument of extending his civil authority.</p>

                     <pb n="249" facs="unknown:011837_0651_0F9D88A3355DB288"/>ACCORDINGLY, a proſpect no ſooner opened of coming to an accommodation with the Pope, than by the Emperor's appointment, a diet of the Empire was held at Spires, (March 15, 1529,) in order to take into conſideration the ſtate of religion. The decree of the diet aſſembled there in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty ſix, which was almoſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a toleration of Luther's opinions, had given great offence to the reſt of Chriſtendom. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delicacy of addreſs, however, was requiſite in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to any deciſion more rigorous. The minds of men kept in perpetual agitation by a controverſy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on during twelve years without intermiſſion of debate, or abatement of zeal, were now inflamed to an high degree. They were accuſtomed to innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſaw the boldeſt of them ſucceſeful. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only aboliſhed old rites, but ſubſtituted new forms in their place, they were influenced as much by attachment to the ſyſtem which he had embraced, as by averſion to that which they had abandoned. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelf, of a ſpirit not to be worn out by the length and obſtinacy of the combat, or to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs upon ſucceſs, continued the attack with as much vigour as he had begun it. His diſciples, of whom many equalled him in zeal, and ſome ſurpaſſed him in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were no leſs capable than their maſter to conduct the controverſy in the propereſt manner. Many of the laity, and even of the princes, trained up amidſt theſe inceſſant diſputations, and in the habit of liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to the arguments of the contending parties who alternately appealed to them as judges, came to be profoundly ſkilled in all the queſtions which were agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and, upon occaſion, could ſhew themſelves not in expert in any of the arts with which theſe theological encounters were managed. It was obvious from all theſe circumſtances, that any violent deciſion of the diet muſt have immediately precipitated matters into confuſion, and have kindled in Germany the flames of a religious war. All, therefore, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, and the other commiſſioners appointed by the Emperor demanded of the diet, was, to enjoin thoſe ſtates of the Empire who had hitherto obeyed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

iſſued againſt Luther at Worms in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty-four, to perſevere in the obſervation of it, and to prohibit the other ſtates from attempting any farther innovation in religion, particularly from aboliſhing the Maſs, before the meeting of a general council. After much diſpute, a decree to that effect was approved of by a majority of voices<note n="l" place="margin">Sleid. Hiſt. 117.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Elector of Saxony, the marquis of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the Landgrave of Heſſe, the dukes of Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the prince of Anhalt, together with the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fourteen Imperial or free cities<note n="m" place="margin">The fourteen cities were Straſburg, Nuremberg, Ulm, Conſtance, Reut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingen, Windſheim, Meinengen, Lindaw, Kempten, Hailbron, Iſna, Weiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Nordlingen, and St. Gal.</note>, entered a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proteſt againſt this decree, as unjuſt and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, (April 19.) On that account they were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of PROTESTANTS<note n="n" place="margin">Sleid. Hiſt. 119. F. Paul, Hiſt. p. 45.

Not ſatisfied with this declaration of their diſſent from the decree of the diet, the Proteſtants ſent ambaſſadors into Italy to lay their grievances before the Emperor, from whom they met with the moſt diſcouraging reception. Charles was at that time in cloſe union with the Pope, and ſollicitous to attach him inviolably to his intereſt. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their long reſidence at Bologna, they held many conſultations concerning the moſt effectual means of extirpating the hereſies which had ſprung up in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.

He repreſented general councils as factious, ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, preſumptuous, formidable to civil authority, and too ſlow in their operations to remedy diſorders which required an immediate cure. Experience, he ſaid, had now taught both the Emperor and himſelf,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011837_0653_0F9D88A4AFDB1558"/>
that forbearance and lenity exaſperated the ſpirit of innovation which they ought to have mollified; it was neceſſary, therefore, to have recourſe to the rigorous methods which ſuch a deſperate caſe required; Leo's ſentence of excommunication, and the decree of the diet at Worms ſhould be carried into execution, and it was incumbent on the Emperor to employ his whole power, in order to overawe thoſe on whom the reverence due either to eccleſiaſtical or civil authority had no longer any influence. Charles, whoſe views were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from the Pope's. and who became daily more ſenſible how obſtinate and deep rooted the evil was, thought of reconciling the Proteſtants by means leſs violent, and conſidered the convocation of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as no improper expedient for that purpoſe; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, if theſe gentler arts failed of ſucceſs, that then he would exert himſelf with vigour to reduce thoſe ſtubborn enemies of the Catholic faith <note n="o" place="margin">F.

                  <p>SUCH were the ſentiments with which the Emperor ſet out for Germany, having already appointed a diet of the Empire to be held at Auſburg, (March 22, 1530.) In his journey towards that city, he had many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of obſerving the diſpoſition of the Germans with regard to the points in controverſy, and found their minds every where ſo much irritated and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as convinced him that nothing tending to ſeverity or rigour ought to be attempted, till all other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proved ineffectual. He made his public entry into Augſburg with extraordinary pomp, (June 15;) and found there ſuch a full aſſembly of the members of the diet as was ſuitable both to the importance of the affairs which were to come under their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the honour of an Emperor, who, after a long abſence, returned to them crowned with repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſucceſs. His preſence ſeems to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to all parties an unuſual ſpirit of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſire of peace.

                     </gap>thor of all thoſe diſſenſions which it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo difficult to compoſe. At the Emperor's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, all the Proteſtant princes forbad the divines who accompanied them to preach in publick during their reſidence at Augſburg. For the ſame reaſon they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Melancthon, the man of the greateſt learning, as well as of the moſt pacific and gentle ſpirit among the Reformers, to draw up a confeſſion of their faith, expreſſed in terms as little offenſive to the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, as a regard for truth would permit. Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, who ſeldom ſuffered the rancour of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to envenom his ſtyle, even in writings purely pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, executed a taſk ſo agreeable to his natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with great moderation and ſucceſs. The Creed which he compoſed, known by the name of the Confeſſion of Augſburg, from the place where it was preſented, was read publickly in the diet; ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh divines were appointed to examine it; they brought in their animadverſions; a diſpute enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Melancthon, ſeconded by ſome of his brethren; but though Melancthon ſoftened ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, made conceſſions with regard to others, and put the leaſt exceptionable ſenſe upon all; though the Emperor himſelf laboured with great earneſtneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the contending parties; ſo many marks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction were now eſtabliſhed, and ſuch inſuperable barriers placed between the two churches, that all hopes of bringing about a coalition ſeemed utterly deſperate <note n="p" place="margin">Seckond. lib. il. 159, &amp;c.

                  <p>FROM the divines, among whom his endeavours had been ſo unſucceſsful, Charles turned to the princes their patrons. Nor did he find them, how deſirous ſoever of accommodation, or willing to oblige the Emperor, more diſpoſed than the former to renounce their opinions. At that time, zeal for religion took poſſeſſion of the minds of men to a degree which can ſcarce be conceived by thoſe who live in an age when the paſſions excited by the firſt manifeſtation of truth, and the firſt recovery of liberty, have in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ceaſed to operate. This zeal was then of ſuch
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:011837_0655_0F9D88A6CB948DC8"/>
ſtrength as to overcome attachment to their political intereſt, which is commonly the predominant motive among princes. The Elector of Saxony, the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſe, and other chiefs of the Proteſtants, though ſolicited ſeparately by the Emperor, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the promiſe or proſpect of thoſe advantages which it was known they were moſt ſolicitous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, refuſed, with a fortitude highly worthy of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to abandon what they deemed the cauſe of God, for the ſake of an earthly acquiſition <note n="q" place="margin">Sleid. 132. Scultet. Annal. 158.</note>.</p>
                  <p>EVERY ſcheme in order to gain or diſunite the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant party proving abortive, nothing now remained for the Emperor but to take ſome vigorous meaſures towards aſſerting the doctrines and authority of the eſtabliſhed church. Theſe, Campeggio, the Papal nuncio, had always recommended as the only proper and effectual courſe of dealing with ſuch obſtinate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics. In compliance with his opinions and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, the diet iſſued a decree (November 19,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning moſt of the peculiar tenets held by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; forbidding any perſon to protect or tolerate thoſe who taught them; enjoining a ſtrict obſervance of the eſtabliſhed rites; and prohibiting any further innovation under ſevere penalties. All orders of men were required to aſſiſt with their perſons and fortunes in carrying this decree into execution; and ſuch as refuſed to obey it were declared incapable of acting as judges, or of appearing as parties in the Imperial cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the ſupreme court of judicature in the Empire. To all which was ſubjoined a promiſe that an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made to the Pope, requiring him to call a general council within ſix months, in order to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all controverſies by its ſovereign deciſions<note n="r" place="margin">Sleid. 139.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE ſeverity of this decree, which they conſidered as a prelude to the moſt violent perſecutions, alarmed the Proteſtants, and convinced them that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was reſolved on their deſtruction. The dread of thoſe calamities which were ready to fall on the church, oppreſſed the feeble ſpirit of Melancthon; and as if the the cauſe had already been deſperate, he gave himſelf
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:011837_0656_0F9D88A6EF6E1ED0"/>
up to melancholy and lamentation. But Luther, who during the meeting of the diet endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and animate his party by ſeveral treatiſes which he addreſſed to them, was not diſconcerted or diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the proſpect of this new danger. He comforted Melancthon and his other deſponding diſciples, and exhorted the princes not to abandon thoſe truths which they had lately aſſerted with ſuch laudable bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="s" place="margin">Seck. ii. 180. Sleid. 140.</note>. His exhortations made the deeper impreſſion upon them as they were greatly alarmed at that time by the account of a combination among the Popiſh princes of the Empire for the maintenance of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed religion, to which Charles himſelf had acced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="t" place="margin">Seck. ii. 200. iii. 11.</note>. This convinced them that it was neceſſary to ſtand on their guard; and that their own ſafety as well as the ſucceſs of their cauſe depended on union. Filled with this dread of the adverſe party, and with theſe ſentiments concerning the conduct proper for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they aſſembled at Smalkalde. There, they concluded a league of mutual defence againſt all ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors<note n="u" place="margin">Sleid. Hiſt. 142.</note> (December 22,) by which they formed the Proteſtant ſtates of the Empire into one regular body, and beginning already to conſider themſelves as ſuch, they reſolved to apply to the Kings of France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and to implore them to aſſiſt and patronize their new confederacy.</p>
                  <p>AN affair not connected with religion furniſhed them with a pretence for courting the aid of foreign princes. Charles, whoſe ambitious views enlarged in proportion to the increaſe of his power and grandeur, had formed a ſcheme of continuing the Imperial crown in his family, by procuring his brother Ferdinand to be elected King of the Romans. The preſent juncture was favourable for the execution of that deſign. The Emperor's arms had been every where victorious; he had given law to all Europe at the late peace; no rival now remained in a condition to balance or to controul him; and the Electors, dazzled by the ſplendour of his ſucceſs, or over-awed by the greatneſs of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, durſt ſcarce diſpute the will of a prince whoſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:011837_0657_0F9D88A7AFF98268"/>
carried with them the authority of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Nor did he want plauſible reaſons to enforce the meaſure. The affairs of his other kingdoms, he ſaid, obliged him to be often abſent from Germany; the growing diſorders occaſioned by the controverſies about religion, as well as the formidable neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Turks, who continually threatened to break in with their deſolating armies into the heart of the Empire, required the conſtant preſence of a prince, endowed with prudence capable of compoſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and with power and valour ſufficient to repel the latter. His brother Ferdinand poſſeſſed theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in an eminent degree; by reſiding long in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, he had acquired a thorough knowledge of their conſtitution and manners; having been preſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from the firſt riſe of their religious diſſenſions, he knew what remedies were moſt proper, what they could bear, and how to apply them; as his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions lay on the Turkiſh frontier, he was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural defender of Germany againſt the invaſions of the Infidels, being prompted by intereſt no leſs than he would be bound in duty to oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>THESE arguments made little impreſſion on the Proteſtants. Experience taught them, that nothing had contributed more to the undiſturbed progreſs of their opinions, than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long abſence of Charles, and the ſlackneſs in the reins of government which theſe occaſioned; after deriving ſuch advantages from a ſtate of anarchy, they were extremely unwilling to give themſelves a new and a fixed maſter. They perceived clearly the extent of Charles's ambition, that he aimed at render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Imperial crown hereditary in his family, and would of courſe eſtabliſh in the Empire an abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, to which elective princes could not have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with equal facility. They determined therefore to oppoſe Ferdinand's election with the utmoſt vigour, and to rouſe their countrymen by their example and exhortations, to withſtand this encroachment on their liberties. The Elector of Saxony accordingly, not only refuſed to be preſent in the electoral college, which the Emperor ſummoned to meet at Cologne (January

But the other Electors, whom Charles had been at great pains to gain, without regarding either his abſence, or proteſt, choſe Ferdinand King of the Romans; who a few days after was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle <note n="x" place="margin">Sleid. 142.

                  <p>THE account of this tranſaction, as well as of the commencement of ſome proſecutions againſt them on account of their religious principles, in the Imperial chamber, being brought to the Proteſtants, who were aſſembled a ſecond time at Smalkalde, they thought it neceſſary both to renew their former confederacy, and immediately to diſpatch their ambaſſadors into France and England (Febru. 29). Francis had obſerved, with all the jealouſy of a rival, the reputation which the Emperor had acquired by his ſeeming diſintereſtedneſs and moderation in ſettling the affairs of Italy; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with great concern, the ſucceſsful ſtep which he had taken towards perpetuating and extending his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Germany by the election of a King of the Romans. Nothing however, would have been more impolitic than to precipitate into a new war his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exhauſted by extraordinary efforts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by ill ſucceſs, before it had got time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit its ſtrength, or to forget paſt misfortunes. Nor could he, when no provocation had been given, and ſcarce a pretext had been afforded him, violate a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace which he himſelf had ſo lately ſolicited, without forfeiting the eſteem of all Europe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deteſted as a prince void of probity and honour. He obſerved, with great joy, powerful factions begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to form in the Empire; he liſtened with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eagerneſs to the complaints of the Proteſtant prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and without ſeeming to countenance their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions, determined ſecretly to cheriſh thoſe ſparks of political diſcord which might be afterwards kindled into a flame. For this purpoſe, he ſent Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Bellay, one of the ableſt negociators in France, into Germany, who viſiting the courts of the male-content

Seck. iii. 14.</note>, which though concealed at that time, and productive of no immediate effects, laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an union fatal on many occaſions to Charles's ambitious projects; and ſhewed the diſcontented prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, where they might, for the future, find a protector no leſs powerful than willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their defence againſt the encroachments of the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>THE King of England, highly incenſed againſt Charles, in complaiſance to whom, the Pope had long retarded, and now openly oppoſed his divorce, was no leſs diſpoſed than Francis to ſtrengthen a league which might be rendered ſo formidable to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. But his favourite project of the divorce led him into ſuch a labyrinth of ſchemes and negociations, and he was, at the ſame time, ſo intent on aboliſhing the papal juriſdiction in England, that he had no leiſure for foreign affairs; and was obliged to ſatisfy himſelf with giving general promiſes, together with a ſmall ſupply in money to the confederates of Smalkalde <note n="z" place="margin">Herbert, 152, 154.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, many circumſtances convinced Charles that this was not a juncture when the extirpation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy was to be attempted by violence and rigour; that, in compliance with the Pope's inclinations, he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proceeded with imprudent precipitation; and that it was more his intereſt to conſolidate Germany into one united and vigorous body, than to divide and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble it by a civil war. The Proteſtants, already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable by their numbers, and their zeal, had now acquired additional weight and importance by their joining in that confederacy into which the raſh ſteps taken at Augſburg had forced them. Having now diſcovered their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>wn ſtrength, they deſpiſed the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Imperial chamber; and being ſecure of foreign protection, were ready to ſet the head of the Empire at defiance. At the ſame time his peace with France was precarious, the friendſhip of an irreſolute and intereſted pontiff was not to be relied on; and Solyman, in order to repair the infamy and loſs which
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:011837_0660_0F9D88A9F111B8C8"/>
his arms had ſuſtained in the former campaign, was preparing to enter Auſtria with more numerous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. On all theſe accounts, eſpecially the laſt, a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy accommodation with the malecontent princes, was neceſſary not only for the accompliſhment of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſchemes, but for aſcertaining his preſent ſafety. Negociations were, accordingly, carried on by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with the Elector of Saxony and his aſſociates, (1532;) after many delays occaſioned by their jealouſy of the Emperor, and of each other, after innumerable difficulties ariſing from the inflexible nature of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tenets, which cannot admit of being altered, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, or relinquiſhed in the ſame manner as points of political intereſt, terms of pacification were agreed upon at Nuremberg, (July 23) and ratified ſolemnly in the Diet at Ratiſbon (Auguſt 3). In this treaty, it was ſtipulated, That univerſal peace be eſtabliſhed in Germany, until the meeting of a general council, the convocation of which within ſix months the Emperor ſhall endeavour to procure; That no perſon be moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on account of religion; That a ſtop be put to all proceſſes begun by the Imperial chamber againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and the ſentences already paſſed to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment be declared void. On their part, the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants engaged to aſſiſt the Emperor with all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in reſiſting the invaſion of the Turks<note n="a" place="bottom">Du Mont Corps Diplomatique, tom. iv. part ii. 87, 89.</note>. Thus by their firmneſs in adhering to their principles, by the unanimity with which they urged all their claims, and by their dexterity in availing themſelves of the Emperor's ſituation, the Proteſtants obtained terms which amounted almoſt to a toleration of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all the conceſſions were made by Charles, none by them; even the favourite point of approving his brother's election was not mentioned; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Germany, who had hitherto been viewed only as a religious ſect, came henceforth to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a political body of no ſmall conſequence<note n="b" place="bottom">Sleid. 149, &amp;c.

                  <p>THE intelligence which Charles received of Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's having entered Hungary at the head of three hundred thouſand men cut ſhort the deliberations of
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:011837_0661_0F9D88AAB0287208"/>
the Diet at Ratiſbon; the contingent both of troops and money which each prince was to furniſh towards the defence of the Empire having been already ſettled. The Proteſtants as a teſtimony of their gratitude to the Emperor, exerted themſelves with extraordinary zeal, and brought into the field forces that exceeded in number the quota impoſed on them; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics imitating their example, one of the greateſt and beſt appointed armies that had ever been levied in Germany, aſſembled near Vienna. Being joined by a body of Spaniſh and Italian veterans under the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis del Guaſto; by ſome heavy armed cavalry from the Low-Countries; and by the troops which Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand had raiſed in Bohemia, Auſtria and his other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, it amounted in all to ninety thouſand diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined foot, and thirty thouſand horſe, beſides a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious ſwarm of irregulars. Of this vaſt army, worthy the firſt Prince in Chriſtendom, the Emperor took the command in perſon; and mankind waited in ſuſpence the iſſue of a deciſive battle between the two greateſt Monarchs in the world. But each of them dreading the other's power and good fortune, they both conducted their operations with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive caution, that a campaign, for which ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe preparations had been made, ended without any memorable event. Solyman finding it impoſſible to gain ground upon an enemy always attentive, and on his guard, marched back to Conſtantinople to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of autumn<note n="c" place="bottom">Jovii. Hiſt. lib. 30 p. 100, &amp;c. Barre Hiſt. de l Empire, i. 8. 347.</note>. It is remarkable that in ſuch a martial age, when every gentleman was a ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and every prince a general, this was the firſt time that Charles, who had already carried on ſuch exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wars, and gained ſo many victories, appeared at the head of his troops. In this firſt eſſay of his arms, to have oppoſed ſuch a leader as Solyman, was no ſmall honour; to have obliged him to retreat merited very conſiderable praiſe.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT the beginning of this campaign, (Auguſt 16.) the Elector of Saxony died, and was ſucceeded by his ſon John Frederick. The Reformation rather gained than loſt by that event; the new Elector, no
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:011837_0662_0F9D88AB7138A988"/>
leſs attached than his predeceſſors to the opinions of Luther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> occupied the ſtation which they held at the head of the Proteſtant party, and defended, with the boldneſs and zeal of youth, the cauſe which they had foſtered and reared with the caution of old age.</p>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY after the retreat of the Turks, Charles, impatient to reviſit Spain, ſet out, on his way thither, for Italy. As he was extremely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of an interview with the Pope, they met a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time at Bologna, with the ſame external de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of reſpect and friendſhip, but with little of that confidence which had ſubſiſted between them during their late negotiations there. Clement was much diſſatisfied with the Emperor's proceedings at Augſburg; his conceſſions with regard to the ſpeedy convocation of a council, having more than cancelled all the merit of the ſevere decree againſt the doctrines of the Reformers. The toleration granted to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants at Ratiſbon, and the more explicit promiſe concerning a council with which it was accompanied, had irritated him ſtill farther. Charles, however, partly from conviction that the meeting of a council would be attended with ſalutary effects, and partly from his deſire to pleaſe the Germans, having ſolicited him by his ambaſſadors to call that aſſembly without delay, and now urging the ſame thing in perſon, Clement was greatly embaraſſed what reply he ſhould make to a requeſt, which it was indecent to refuſe, and dangerous to grant. He endeavoured at firſt to divert Charles from the meaſure, but finding him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, he had recourſe to artifices which he knew would delay, if not entirely defeat the calling of that aſſembly. Under the plauſible pretext of its being previouſly neceſſary to ſettle, with all parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the place of the council's meeting; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its proceedings; the right of the perſons who ſhould be admitted to vote; and the authority of their deciſions; he diſpatched a nuncio, accompanied by an ambaſſador from the Emperor, to the Elector of Saxony, as the head of the Proteſtants. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to each of theſe articles, inextricable difficulties and conteſts aroſe. The proteſtants demanded a
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:011837_0663_0F9D88AC31E141B0"/>
council to be held in Germany; the Pope inſiſted that it ſhould meet in Italy; they contended that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> points in diſpute ſhould be determined by the words of the holy ſcripture alone; he conſidered the decrees of the church, and the opinions of fathers and doctors as of equal authority; they required a free council in which the divines commiſſioned by different churches ſhould be allowed a voice; he aimed at modelling the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in ſuch a manner as would render it entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on his pleaſure: Above all, the Proteſtants thought it unreaſonable that they ſhould bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſubmit to the decrees of a council, before they knew on what Principles theſe decrees were to be founded, by what perſons they were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and what forms of proceeding they would obſerve. The Pope maintained it to be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to call a council, if thoſe who demanded it did not not previouſly declare their reſolution to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in its decrees. In order to adjuſt ſuch a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of points, many expedients were propoſed, and the negociations ſpun out to ſuch a length, as effectually anſwered Clement's purpoſe of putting off the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a council, without drawing on himſelf the whole infamy of obſtructing a meaſure which all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope deemed ſo eſſential to the good of the church<note n="d" place="bottom">F. Paul. Hiſt. 61. Seckend iii. 73.</note>.</p>
                  <p>TOGETHER with this negociation about calling a council, the Emperor carried on another which he had ſtill more at heart, for ſecuring the peace eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Italy. As Francis had renounced his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in that country with great reluctance, Charles made no doubt but that he would lay hold on the firſt pretext afforded him, or embrace the firſt opportunity which preſented itſelf of recovering what he had loſt. It became neceſſary, on this account, to take meaſures for aſſembling an army able to oppoſe him. As his treaſury, drained by a long war, could not ſupply the ſums requiſite for keeping ſuch a body conſtantly on foot, he attempted to throw that burden on his allies, and to provide for the ſafety of his own dominions at their expence, by propoſing that the Italian ſtates ſhould enter into a league of defence againſt all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:011837_0664_0F9D88ACEFD8EE90"/>
that, on the firſt appearance of danger, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be raiſed and maintained at the common charge; and that Antonio de Leyva ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the generaliſſimo. Nor was the propoſal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to Clement, though for a reaſon very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which induced the Emperor to make it, (1533.) He hoped, by this expedient, to deliver Italy from the German and Spaniſh veterans which had ſo long filled all the powers in that country with terror, and ſtill kept them in ſubjection to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al yoke. A league was accordingly concluded (Feb. 24); all the Italian ſtates, the Venetians excepted, acceded to it; the ſum which each of the contracting parties ſhould furniſh towards maintaining the army was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Emperor agreed to withdraw the troops which gave ſo much umbrage to his allies, and which he was unable any longer to ſupport. Having diſbanded part of them, and removed the reſt to Sicily and Spain, he embarked on board Doria's gallies, and arrived at Barcelona, (April 22) <note n="e" place="bottom">Guic. l. xx. 551. Ferreras, ix. 149.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all his precautions for ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of Germany and maintaining that ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem which he had eſtabliſhed in Italy, the Emperor became every day more and more apprehenſive that both would be ſoon diſturbed by the intrigues or arms of the French King. His apprehenſions were well founded, as nothing but the deſperate ſituation of his affairs could have brought Francis to give his conſent to a treaty ſo diſhonourable and diſadvantageous as that of Cambray: He at the very time of ratifying it, had formed a reſolution to obſerve it no longer than neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity compelled him, and took a ſolemn proteſt, though with the moſt profound ſecrecy, againſt ſeveral arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the treaty, particularly that whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all pretenſions to the dutchy of Milan, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, injurious to his heirs, and invalid. One of the crown lawyers, by his command, entered a proteſt to the ſame purpoſe, and with the like ſecrecy, when the ratification of the treaty was regiſtered in the parliament of Paris <note n="f" place="bottom">Du Mont. Corps Diplom. tom. iv. part. 2. p. 52.</note>; and Francis ſeems to have
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:011837_0665_0F9D88AE2E6E8538"/>
thought that, by employing an artifice unworthy of a King, deſtructive of public faith, and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>tual confidence on which all tranſactions between nations are founded, he was releaſed from any obligations to perform the moſt ſolemn promiſes, or to adhere to the moſt ſacred engagements. From the moment he concluded the peace of Cambray, he wiſhed and watched for an opportunity of violating it with ſafety. He endeavoured for that reaſon to ſtrengthen his alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the King of England, whoſe friendſhip he cultivated with the greateſt aſſiduity. He put the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force of his own kingdom on a better and more reſpectable footing than ever. He artfully fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the jealouſy and diſcontent of the German princes.</p>
                  <p>BUT above all, Francis laboured to break the ſtrict confederacy which ſubſiſted between Charles and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and he had ſoon the ſatisfaction to obſerve appearances of diſguſt and alienation ariſing in the mind of that ſuſpicious and intereſted Pontiff, which gave him hopes that their union would not be laſting. As the Emperor's deciſion in favour of the Duke of Ferrara had greatly irritated the Pope, Francis aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated the injuſtice of that proceeding, and flattered him that the Papal ſee would find in him a more impartial and no leſs powerful protector. As the importunity with which Charles demanded a council was extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the Pope, Francis artfully created obſtacles to prevent it, and attempted to divert the German princes, his allies, from inſiſting ſo obſtinately on that point <note n="g" place="bottom">Bellay, 141, &amp;c.

As the Emperor had gained ſuch an aſcendant over Clement by contributing to aggrandize his family, Francis endeavoured to allure him by the ſame irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bait, propoſing a marriage between his ſecond ſon Henry duke of Orleans, and Catharine, the daughter of the Pope's couſin Laurence di Medici. On the firſt overtures of this match, the Emperor could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade himſelf that Francis really intended to debaſe the royal blood of France by an alliance with Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, whoſe anceſtors had been ſo lately private citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens

                     </gap> only to flatter or amuſe the ambitious Pontiff. He thought it neceſſary, however to eface the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſuch a dazzling offer might have made, by promiſing to break off the marriage which had been agreed to between his own niece the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark's daughter, and the Duke of Milan, and to ſubſtitute Catherine in her place. But the French ambaſſadors producing unexpectedly full powers to conclude the marriage treaty with the duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans, this expedient had no effect, Clement was ſo highly pleaſed with an honour which added ſuch luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and dignity to the houſe of Medici, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grant Catharine the inveſtiture of conſiderable territories in Italy by way of portion; he ſeemed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſupport Francis in proſecuting his ancient claims in that country, and conſented to a perſonal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with that Monarch <note n="h" place="bottom">Guic. l. xx. 551. 533. Belay, 138.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES was at the utmoſt pains to prevent a meeting, in which nothing was likely to paſs but what would be of detriment to him; nor could he bear, after he had twice condeſcended to viſit the Pope, in his own territories, that Clement ſhould beſtow ſuch a mark of diſtinction on his rival, as to venture on a voyage by ſea, at an unfavourable ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in order to pay court to Francis in the French dominions. But the Pope's eagerneſs to accompliſh the match overcame all ſcruples of pride, or fear, or jealouſy, which muſt have influenced him on any other occaſion. The interview notwithſtanding ſeveral artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Emperor to prevent it, took place at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles with extraordinary pomp, and demonſtrations of confidence on both ſides; and the marriage, which the ambition and abilities of Catharine rendered in the ſequel as fatal to France, as it was then thought diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, was conſummated, (1534). But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſchemes may have been ſecretly concerted by the Pope and Francis in favour of the duke of Orleans, to whom his father propoſed to make over all his rights in Italy, ſo careful were they to avoid giving any cauſe of offence to the Emperor, that no treaty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between them <note n="i" place="bottom">Guic. l. 20. 555.</note>; and even in the marriage ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:011837_0667_0F9D88AF2F08C968"/>

                  <p>BUT at the very time when he was carrying on theſe negociations, and forming this connection with Francis, which gave ſo great umbrage to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſuch was the artifice and duplicity of Clement's character that he ſuffered the latter to direct all his proceedings with regard to the King of England, and was no leſs attentive to gratify him in that particular, than if the moſt cordial union had ſtill ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Henry's ſuit for a divorce had now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued near ſix years; during all which period the Pope negociated, promiſed, retracted, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing. After bearing repeated delays and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, longer than could have been expected from a prince of ſuch a cholerick and impetuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his patience was at laſt ſo much exhauſted, that he applied to another tribunal for that decree which he had ſolicited in vain at Rome. Cranmer, archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Canterbury, by a ſentence founded on the authority of Univerſities, Doctors, and Rabbies, who had been conſulted with reſpect to the point, annull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King's marriage with Catharine; her daughter was declared illegitimate; and Anne Boleyn acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as Queen of England. At the ſame time Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry began to neglect and to threaten the Pope whom he had hitherto courted, and to make innovations in the church, of which he had formerly been ſuch a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defender. Clement, who had already ſeen ſo many provinces and kingdoms revolt from the Holy ſee, became apprehenſive at laſt that England would imitate their example, and partly from his ſolicitude to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that fatal blow, partly in compliance with the French King's ſolicitations, determined to give Henry ſuch ſatisfaction as might ſtill retain him within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the church.

That vaſt fabrick of eccleſiaſtical dominion which had been raiſed with ſuch art, and whoſe foundations ſeemed ſo deep, being no longer ſupported by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the people, was overturned in a moment. Henry himſelf, with the caprice peculiar to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, continued to defend the doctrines of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church as fiercely as he attacked its juriſdiction. He alternately perſecuted the Proteſtants for rejecting the former, and the Catholicks for acknowledging the latter. But his ſubjects being once permitted to enter into new paths, did not chuſe to ſtop ſhort at the preciſe point preſcribed by him. Having been encouraged by his example to break ſome of their fetters, they were ſo impatient to ſhake off all that remained <note n="k" place="bottom">Herbert. Burn.

                  <p>A SHORT delay might have ſaved the See of Rome from all the unhappy conſequences of Clement's raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Soon after his ſentence againſt Henry, he fell into a languiſhing diſtemper, which gradually waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conſtitution, put an end to his Pontificate, (September 25) the moſt unfortunate, both during its continuance, and by its effects, that the church had known for many ages. The very day (Octo. 13) on which the Cardinals entered the conclave, they raiſed to the Papal throne Alexander Farneſe, dean of the ſacred college, and the eldeſt member of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who aſſumed the name of Paul III.

Perſons more capable of judging, formed a favourable preſage of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, from the experience which he had acquired under four pontificates, as well as the character of prudence and moderation which he had uniformly maintained in a ſtation of great eminence, and during an active and difficult juncture that required both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and addreſs <note n="l" place="bottom">Guic. l. 20. 556.

                  <p>EUROPE, it is probable, owed the continuance of its peace to the death of Clement; for although no traces remain in hiſtory of any league concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Francis, it is ſcarce to be doubted but that he would have ſeconded the operations of the French arms in Italy, that he might have gratified his ambition by ſeeing one of his family poſſeſſed of the ſupreme power in Florence, and another in Milan. But upon the election of Paul III. who had hitherto adhered uniformly to the Imperial intereſt, Francis found it neceſſary to ſuſpend his operations for ſome time, and to put off the commencement of hoſtilities againſt the Emperor, on which he was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Francis waited for an opportunity to renew a war which had hitherto proved ſo fatal to himſelf and his ſubjects, a tranſaction of a very ſingular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was carried on in Germany. Among many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and ſalutary effects of which the Reformation was the immediate cauſe, it was attended, as muſt be the caſe, in all actions and events wherein men are concerned, with ſome conſequences of an oppoſite nature. When the human mind is rouzed by grand objects, and agitated by ſtrong paſſions, its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons acquire ſuch force, that they are apt to become irregular and extravagant. Upon any great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in religion, ſuch irregularities abound moſt, at that particular period, when men having thrown off the authority of their ancient principles, do not yet
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:011837_0670_0F9D88B1701A5C90"/>
fully comprehend the nature, or feel the obligation of thoſe new ones which they have embraced. The mind, in that ſituation, puſhing forward with the boldneſs which prompted it to reject eſtabliſhed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and not guided by a clear knowledge of the ſyſtem ſubſtituted in their place, diſdains all reſtraint, and runs into wild notions that often lead to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or immoral conduct. Thus, in the firſt ages of the Chriſtian church, many of the new converts, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renounced their ancient Creeds, and being but imperfectly acquainted with the doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, broached the moſt extravagant opinions equally ſubverſive of piety and virtue; all which errors diſappeared or were exploded when the knowledge of religion increaſed, and came to be more generally diſſuſed. In like manner ſoon after Luther's appearance, the raſhneſs or ignorance of ſome of his diſciples led them to publiſh abſurd and pernicious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which being propoſed to men extremely illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but fond of novelty, and at a time when their minds were turned wholly towards religious ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gained too eaſy credit and authority among them. To theſe cauſes muſt be imputed the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of Munſter, in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty-five, as well as the rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs which they made among the peaſants; but tho' the inſurrection excited by that Fanatic was ſoon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſeveral of his followers lurked in different places, and endeavoured privately to propagate his opinions.</p>
                  <p>IN thoſe provinces of Upper Germany, which had already been ſo cruelly waſted by their enthuſiaſtic rage, the magiſtrates watched their motions with ſuch ſevere attention, that many of them found it neceſſary to retire into other countries, ſome were puniſhed, others driven into exile, and their errors were entirely rooted out. But in the Netherlands and Weſtphalia, where the pernicious tendency of their opinions was more unknown, and guarded againſt with leſs care, they got admittance into ſeveral towns, and ſpread the infection of their principles. The moſt remarkable of their religious tenets related to
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:011837_0671_0F9D88B2309FF7B0"/>
the Sacrament of Baptiſm, which as they contended, ought to be adminiſtred only to perſons grown up to years of underſtanding, and ſhould be performed not by ſprinkling them with water, but by dipping them in it: For this reaſon they condemned the baptiſm of infants, and rebaptizing all whom they admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſociety, the ſect came to be diſtinguiſhed by the name of Anabaptiſts. To this peculiar notion concerning baptiſm, which has the appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded on the practice of the church in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age, and contains nothing inconſiſtent with the peace and order of human ſociety, they added other principles of a moſt enthuſiaſtic, as well as dangerous nature. They maintained that, among Chriſtians who had the precepts of the goſpel to direct, and the ſpirit of God to guide them, the office of magiſtracy was not only unneceſſary, but an unlawful encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their ſpiritual liberty; that the diſtinctions occaſioned by birth, or rank, or wealth, being contrary to the ſpirit of the goſpel, which conſiders all men as equal, ſhould be entirely aboliſhed; that all Chriſtians throwing their poſſeſſions into one common ſtock, ſhould live together in that ſtate of equality which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes members of the ſame family; that as neither the laws of nature, nor the precepts of the New-Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament had placed any reſtraints upon men with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the number of wives which they might marry they ſhould uſe that liberty which God himſelf had granted to the patriarchs.</p>
                  <p>SUCH opinions, propagated and maintained with enthuſiaſtic zeal and boldneſs, were not long of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the violent effects natural to them. Two Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt prophets, John Matthias, a baker of Haerlem, and John Boccold, or Beükels, a journeyman taylor of Leyden, poſſeſſed with the rage of making proſelytes, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their reſidence at Munſter, an Imperial city in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia, of the firſt rank, under the ſovereignty of its biſhop, but governed by its own ſenate and conſuls. As neither of theſe Fanaticks wanted the talents neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſuch an undertaking, great reſolution, the appearance of ſanctity, bold pretenſions to inſpiration, and a confident and plauſible manner of diſcourſing,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:011837_0672_0F9D88B2EF1E0300"/>
they ſoon gained many converts. Among theſe were Rothman, who had firſt preached the Proteſtant doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in Munſter, and Cnipperdoling, a citizen of good birth, and conſiderable eminence. Emboldened by the countenance of ſuch diſciples, they openly taught their opinions; and not ſatisfied with that liberty, they made ſeveral attempts, though without ſucceſs, to ſeize the town, in order to get their tenets eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by publick authority. At laſt, having ſecretly called in their aſſociates from the neighbouring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they ſuddenly took poſſeſſion of the arſenal and ſenate-houſe in the night time, and running through the ſtreets with drawn ſwords, and horrible howlings, cried out alternately, "Repent, and be baptized," and "De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye ungodly." The ſenators, the canons, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, together with the more ſober citizens, whether Papiſts or Proteſtants, terrified at their threats and outcries, fled in confuſion, and left the city under the dominion of a frantic multitude, conſiſting chiefly of ſtrangers. Nothing now remaining to overawe or controul them, they ſet about modelling the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to their own wild ideas; and though at firſt they ſhewed ſo much reverence for the ancient conſtitution, as to elect ſenators of their own ſect; and to appoint Cnipperdoling and another proſelyte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, this was nothing more than form; for all their proceedings were directed by Matthias, who in the ſtile, and with the authority of a prophet, uttered his commands, which it was inſtant death to diſobey. Having begun with encouraging the multitude to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage the churches, and deface their ornaments; he enjoined them to deſtroy all books except the Bible, as uſeleſs or impious; he appointed the eſtates of ſuch as fled to be confiſcated, and ſold to the inhabitants of the adjacent country; he ordered every man to bring forth his gold, ſilver, and precious effects, and to lay them at his feet; the wealth amaſſed by theſe means, he depoſited in a publick treaſury, and named deacons to diſpenſe it for the common uſe of all. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his common-wealth being thus brought to a perfect equality, he commanded all of them to eat at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles prepared in publick, and even preſcribed the diſhes
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:011837_0673_0F9D88B3AFE083F8"/>
which were to be ſerved up each day. Having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his plan of Reformation, his next care was to provide for the defence of the city; and he took meaſures for that purpoſe with a prudence which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured nothing of fanaticiſm. He collected vaſt maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines of every kind; he repaired and extended the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, obliging every perſon without diſtinction to work in his turn; he formed ſuch as were capable of bearing arms into regular bodies, and endeavoured to add the vigour of diſcipline to the impetuoſity of enthuſiaſm. He ſent emiſſaries to the Anabaptiſts in the Low-countries, inviting them to aſſemble at Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which he dignified with the name of Mount-Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that from thence they might ſet out to reduce all the nations of the earth under their dominion. He himſelf was unwearied in attending to every thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſecurity or increaſe of the ſect; animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſciples by his own example to refuſe no labour, as well as to repine at no hardſhip; and their enthuſiaſtic paſſions being kept from ſubſiding by a perpetual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of exhortations, revelations and prophecies, they ſeemed ready to untertake or to ſuffer any thing in maintenance of their opinions.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the biſhop of Munſter having aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a conſiderable army, advanced to beſiege the town. On his approach, Matthias ſallied out at the head of ſome choſen troops, attacked one quarter of his camp, forced it, and after great ſlaughter, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the city loaded with glory and ſpoil. Intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſucceſs, he appeared next day brandiſhing a ſpear, and declared, that in imitation of Gideon, he would go forth with a handful of men and ſmite the hoſt of the ungodly. Thirty perſons, whom he named, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him without heſitation in this wild enterprize, and ruſhing on the enemy with a frantic courage were cut off to a man. The death of their prophet occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt great conſternation among his diſciples, but Boccold, by the ſame gifts and pretenſions which had gained Matthias credit, ſoon revived their ſpirits and hopes to ſuch a degree, that he ſucceeded him in the ſame abſolute direction of all their affairs. As he did not poſſeſs that enterprizing courage which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:011837_0674_0F9D88B471F3E338"/>
his predeceſſor, he ſatisfied himſelf with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a defenſive war, and without attempting to annoy the enemy by ſallies, he waited for the ſuccours he expected from the Low-countries, the arrival of which was often foretold and promiſed by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But though leſs daring in action than Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, he was a wilder enthuſiaſt, and of more unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ambition. Soon after the death of his predeceſſor, having by obſcure viſions, and propheſies, prepared the multitude for ſome extraordinary event, he ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped himſelf naked, and marching through the ſtreets, proclaimed with a loud voice, "That the kingdom of Sion was at hand; that whatever was higheſt on earth ſhould be brought low, and whatever was loweſt ſhould be exalted." In order to fulfil this, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the churches, as the moſt lofty buildings in the city, to be levelled with the ground; he degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſenators choſen by Matthias, and depriving Cnipperdoling of the conſulſhip, the higheſt office in the commonwealth, he appointed him to execute the the loweſt and moſt infamous, that of common hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to which ſtrange tranſition the other agreed, not only without murmuring, but with the utmoſt joy; and ſuch was the deſpotiſm and rigour of Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold's adminiſtration, that he was called almoſt every day to perform ſome duty or other of his wretched function. In place of the depoſed ſenators, he named twelve judges, according to the number of tribes in Iſrael, to preſide in all affairs; retaining to himſelf the ſame authority which Moſes anciently poſſeſſed as legiſlator of that people.</p>
                  <p>NOT ſatisfied, however, with power or titles which were not ſupreme, a prophet, whom he had gained and tutored, having called the multitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, declared it to be the will of God, that John Boccold ſhould be King of Sion, and ſit on the throne of David. John kneeling down, accepted of the heavenly call, which he ſolemnly proteſted had been revealed likewiſe to himſelf, and was immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as Monarch by the deluded multitude, (June 24). From that moment he aſſumed all the ſtate and pomp of royalty. He wore a crown of gold,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:011837_0675_0F9D88B531CE1B58"/>
and the richeſt and moſt ſumptuous garments. A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was carried on his one hand, a naked ſword on the other. A great body of guards accompanied him when he appeared in publick. He coined money ſtamped with his own image, and appointed the great officers of his houſhold and kingdom, among whom Cnipperdoling was nominated governor of the city, as a reward for his former ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>HAVING now attained the heighth of power, Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold began to diſcover paſſions, which he had hitherto reſtrained or indulged only in ſecret. As the exceſſes of enthuſiaſm have been obſerved in every age to lead to ſenſual gratifications, the ſame conſtitution that is ſuſceptible of the former, being remarkably prone to the latter, he inſtructed the prophets and teachers to harrangue the people for ſeveral days concerning the lawfulneſs, and even neceſſity of taking more wives than one, which they aſſerted to be one of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges granted by God to the ſaints. When their ears were once accuſtomed to this licentious doctrine, and their paſſions inflamed with the proſpect of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded indulgence, he himſelf ſet them an example of uſing what he called their Chriſtian liberty, by marrying at once three wives, among which the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Matthias, a woman of ſingular beauty was one. As he was allured by beauty, or the love of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, he gradually added to the number of his wives until they amounted to fourteen, though the widow of Matthias was the only one dignified with the title of Queen, or who ſhared with him the ſplendour and ornaments of royalty. After the example of their prophet, the multitude gave themſelves up to the moſt licentious and uncontrouled gratification of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. No man remained ſatisfied with a ſingle wife. Not to uſe their Chriſtian liberty was deemed a crime. Perſons were appointed to ſearch the houſes for young women grown up to maturity, whom they inſtantly compelled to marry. Together with polygamy, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of divorce, its inſeparable attendant, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and became a new ſource of corruption. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exceſs was committed, of which the paſſions of men are capable, when reſtrained neither by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

                  <p>MEANWHILE, the German princes were highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the inſult offered to their dignity by Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold's preſumptuous uſurpation of royal honours; and the profligate manners of his followers, which were a reproach to the Chriſtian name, filled men of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions with horror. Luther, who had teſtified againſt this fanatical ſpirit on its firſt appearance, now deeply lamented its progreſs, and expoſing the deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with great ſtrength of argument, as well as acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſtile, called loudly on all the ſtates of Germany to put a ſtop to a phrenſy no leſs pernicious to ſociety, than fatal to religion. The Emperor, occupied with other cares and projects, had no leiſure to attend to ſuch a diſtant object. But the princes of the Empire, aſſembled by the King of the Romans, voted a ſupply of men and money to the biſhop of Munſter, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to keep a ſufficient army on foot, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the ſiege of the town into a blockade. The forces raiſed in conſequence of this reſolution, were put under the command of an officer of experience, who approaching the town towards the end of ſpring in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-five, preſſed it more cloſely than formerly, but found the fortifications ſo ſtrong, and ſo diligently guarded, that he durſt not attempt an aſſault. It was now above fifteen months ſince the Anabaptiſts had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed their dominion in Munſter; they had during that time undergone prodigious fatigue in working on the fortifications, and performing military duty. Notwithſtanding the prudent attention of their King
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:011837_0677_0F9D88B6B0D61B10"/>
to provide for their ſubſiſtence, and his frugal and regular oeconomy in their publick meals, they began to feel the approach of famine. Several ſmall bodies of their brethren, who were advancing to their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Low-Countries, had been intercepted, and cut to pieces; and while all Germany was ready to combine againſt them, they had no proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. But ſuch was the aſcendant which Boccold had acquired over the multitude, and ſo powerful the faſcination of enthuſiaſm, that their hopes were as ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine as ever, and they hearkened withimplicit credulity to the viſions and predictions of their prophets, which aſſured them, that the Almighty would ſpeedily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in order to deliver the city. The faith, however, of ſome few, ſhaken by the violence and length of their ſufferings, began to fail; but being ſuſpected of an inclination to ſurrender to the enemy, they were puniſhed with immediate death, as guilty of impiety in diſtruſting the power of God. One of the King's wives, having uttered certain words that implied ſome doubt concerning his divine miſſion, he inſtantly called the whole number together, and commanding the blaſphemer, as he called her, to kneel down, cut off her head with his own hands; and ſo far were the reſt from expreſſing any horror at this cruel deed, that they joined him in dancing with a frantick joy around the bleeding body of their companion.</p>
                  <p>BY this time, the beſieged endured the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of famine; (June 1.) but they choſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hardſhips, the recital of which is ſhocking to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, than to liſten to the terms of capitulation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them by the biſhop. At laſt, a deſerter, whom they had taken into their ſervice, being either leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with the fumes of enthuſiaſm, or unable any longer to bear ſuch diſtreſs, made his eſcape to the enemy. He informed their general of a weak part in the fortifications which he had obſerved, and aſſuring him that the beſieged, exhauſted with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fatigue, kept watch there with little care, he offered to lead a party thither in the night. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was accepted, and a choſen body of troops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſervice; who, ſcaling the walls unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,

ſeized one of the gates, and admitted the reſt of the army (June 24). The Anabaptiſts, though ſurprized, defended themſelves in the market place with valour, heightened by deſpair; but being over-powered by numbers, and ſurrounded on every hand, moſt of them were ſlain, and the remainder taken priſoners. Among the laſt were the King and Cnip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdoling. The King, loaded with chains, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from city to city as a ſpectacle to gratify the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the people, and was expoſed to all their inſults. His ſpirit, however, was not broken or humbled by this ſad reverſe of his condition; and he adhered with unſhaken firmneſs to the diſtinguiſhing tenets of his ſect. After this, he was brought back to Munſter, the ſcene of his royalty and crimes, and put to death with the moſt exquiſite and lingering tortures, all which he bore with aſtoniſhing fortitude.

                  <p>TOGETHER with its Monarch, the kingdom of the Anabaptiſts came to an end. Their principles having taken deep root in the Low-Countries, the party ſtill ſubſiſts there, under the name of Mennonites; but by a very ſingular revolution, this ſect, ſo mutinous and ſanguinary at its firſt origin, hath become altogether innocent and pacific. Holding it unlawful to wage war, or to accept of civil offices, they devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to the duties of private citizens, and by their induſtry and charity endeavour to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to human ſociety for the violence committed by their founders <note n="o" place="bottom">Bayle Diction. Art. Anabaptiſtes.</note>. A ſmall number of this ſect which is ſettled in England, retain its peculiar tenets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning baptiſm, but without any dangerous mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of enthuſiaſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:011837_0679_0F9D88B832D26BF8"/>THE mutiny of the Anabaptiſts, though it drew general attention, did not ſo entirely engroſs the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, as not to allow leiſure for other tranſactions. The alliance between the French King and the confederates at Smalkalde, began about this time to produce great effects. Ulric, Duke of Wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg, having been expelled his dominions in the year one thouſand five hundred and nineteen, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his violent and oppreſſive adminiſtration, the houſe of Auſtria had got poſſeſſion of his dutchy. That prince having now by along exile atoned for the errors in his conduct, which were the effect rather of inexperience than of a tyrannical diſpoſition, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the object of general compaſſion. The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſe, in particular, his near relation, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſpouſed his intereſt, and uſed many efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover for him his ancient inheritance. But the king of the Romans obſtinately refuſed to relinquiſh a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable acquiſition which his family had made with ſo much eaſe. The Landgrave, unable to compel him, applied to the King of France his new ally. Francis, eager to embrace any opportunity of diſtreſſing the houſe of Auſtria, and deſirous of wreſting from it a territory, which gave it footing and influence in a part of Germany at a diſtance from its other domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, encouraged the Landgrave to take arms, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſupplied him with a large ſum of money. This he employed to raiſe troops, and marching with great expedition towards Wurtemberg, attacked, defeated, and diſperſed a conſiderable body of Auſtrians, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the defence of the country. All the Duke's ſubjects haſtened, with emulation, to receive their native Prince, and re-inveſted him with that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is ſtill enjoyed by his defendants. At the ſame time the exerciſe of the Proteſtant religion was eſtabliſhed in his dominions <note n="p" place="bottom">Sleid. 172. Bellay, 159, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FERDINAND, how ſenſible ſoever of this unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blow, not daring to attack a prince whom all the Proteſtant powers in Germany were ready to ſupport,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:011837_0680_0F9D88B8EFD210C0"/>
judged it expedient to conclude a treaty with him, by which he recognized in the moſt ample form his title to the dutchy. The ſucceſs of the Landgrave's operations in behalf of the duke of Wurtemberg, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced Ferdinand that a rupture with a league ſo formidable as that of Smalkalde, was to be avoided with the utmoſt care, he entered likewiſe into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation with the Elector of Saxony, the head of that union, and by ſome conceſſions in favour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, and others of advantage to the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf, he prevailed on him, together with his confederates to acknowledge his title as King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. At the ſame time, in order to prevent any ſuch precipitate or irregular election in times to come, it was agreed that no perſons ſhould hereafter be promoted to that dignity without the unanimous conſent of the Electors; and the Emperor ſoon after confirmed this ſtipulation <note n="q" place="bottom">Sleid. 173. Corps Diplom. tom. iv. p. 2. 119.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THESE acts of indulgence towards the Proteſtants, and the cloſe union into which the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeemed to be entering with the Princes of that party, gave great offence at Rome. Paul III. though he had departed from a reſolution of his predeceſſor, never to conſent to the calling of a general council, and had promiſed in the firſt conſiſtory held after his election, that he would convoke that aſſembly ſo much deſired by all Chriſtendom, was no leſs enraged than Clement at the innovations in Germany, and no leſs averſe to any ſchemes for reforming either the doctrines of the church, or the abuſes in the court of Rome: But having been a witneſs of the univerſal cenſure which Clement had incurred by his obſtinacy with regard to theſe points, he hoped to avoid the ſame reproach by the ſeeming alacrity with which he propoſed a council; flattering himſelf, however, that ſuch difficulties would ariſe concerning the time and place of meeting, the perſons who had a right to be preſent, and the order of their proceedings, as would effectually defeat the intention of thoſe who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that aſſembly, without expoſing himſelf to any
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:011837_0681_0F9D88B9B02DEC60"/>
imputation for refuſing to call it. With this view he diſpatched nuncios to the ſeveral courts, in order to make known his intention, and that he had fixed on Mantua as a proper place in which to hold the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Such difficulties as the Pope had foreſeen, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſented themſelves in great number. The French King did not approve of the place which Paul had choſen, as the Papal and imperial influence would neceſſarily be too great in a town ſituated in that part of Italy. The King of England not only concurred with Francis in urging that objection, but refuſed, beſides, to acknowledge any council called in the name and by the authority of the Pope (Dec. 12). The German Proteſtants having met together at Smalkalde, inſiſted on their original demand of a council to be held in Germany, and pleading the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's promiſe, as well as the agreement at Ratiſbon to that effect, declared that they would not conſider an aſſembly held at Mantua as a legal or free repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the church. By this diverſity of ſentiments and views, ſuch a field for intrigue and negociation opened, as made it eaſy for the Pope to aſſume the merit of being eager to aſſemble a council, while at the ſame time he could put off its meeting at pleaſure. The Proteſtants on the other hand ſuſpecting his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and ſenſible of the importance which they deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their union, renewed for ten years the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of Smalkalde, which now became ſtronger and more formidable by the acceſſion of ſeveral new members <note n="r" place="bottom">This league was concluded December, one thouſand five hundred and thirty five, but not extended or ſigned in form till September in the following year.

                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions in Germany, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror undertook his famous enterprize againſt the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratical ſtates in Africa. That part of the African continent lying along the coaſt of the Mediterranean
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:011837_0682_0F9D88BA708BB048"/>
ſea, which anciently formed the kingdoms of Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania and Maſſylia, together with the republick of Carthage, and which is now known by the general name of Barbary, had undergone many revolutions. Subdued by the Romans, it became a province of their empire. Conquered afterwards by the Vandals, they erected a kingdom there. That being overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Beliſarius, the country continued ſubject to the Greek Emperors, until it was over-run towards the end of the ſeventh century, by the rapid and irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arms of the Arabs. It remained for ſometime a part of that vaſt empire of which the Caliphs were the head. Its immenſe diſtance, however, from the ſeat of government, encouraged the deſcendants of thoſe leaders, who had ſubdued the country, or the chiefs of the Moors, its ancient inhabitants, to throw off the yoke, and to ſet up for independance. The Caliphs, who derived their authority from a ſpirit of enthuſiaſm, more fitted for making conqueſts than for preſerving them, were obliged to connive at acts of rebellion which they could not prevent; and Barbary was divided into ſeveral kingdoms, of which Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Algiers and Tunis were the moſt conſiderable. The inhabitants of theſe kingdoms were a mixed race, Arabs, Negroes from the ſouthern provinces, and Moors, either natives of Africa, or who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of Spain; all zealous profeſſors of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan religion, and inflamed againſt Chriſtianity with a bigotted hatred proportional to their ignorance and barbarous manners.</p>
                  <p>AMONG theſe people, no leſs daring, inconſtant and treacherous, than the ancient inhabitants of the ſame country deſcribed by the Roman hiſtorians, frequent ſeditions broke out, and many changes in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took place. Theſe, as they affected only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtate of a country ſo barbarous are but little known, and deſerve to be ſo. But about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixteenth century a ſudden revolution hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, which by rendering the ſtates of Barbary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the Europeans, hath made their hiſtory worthy of more attention. This revolution was brought about by perſons born in a rank of life which
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:011837_0683_0F9D88BB3077B700"/>
entitled them to act no ſuch illuſtrious part. Horuc and Hayradin, the ſons of a potter in the iſle of Leſbos, prompted by a reſtleſs and enterprizing ſpirit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their father's trade, ran to ſea, and joined a crew of pirates. They ſoon diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their valour and activity, and becoming maſters of a ſmall brigantine, carried on their infamous trade with ſuch conduct and ſucceſs, that they aſſembled a fleet of twelve galleys, beſides many veſſels of ſmaller force. Of this fleet Horuc, the elder brother, called Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa from the red colour of his beard, was admiral, and Hayradin ſecond in command, but with almoſt equal authority. They called themſelves the friends of the ſea, and the enemies of all who ſail upon it; and their names ſoon became terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles to thoſe of Gibraltar. Together with their fame and power, their ambitious views opened and enlarged, and while acting as Corſairs they adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ideas, and acquired the talents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes which they took on the coaſts of Spain and Italy into the ports of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, and enriching the inhabitants by the ſale of their booty, and the thoughtleſs prodigality of their crews, were welcome gueſts in every place at which they touched. The convenient ſituation of theſe harbours lying ſo near the greateſt commercial ſtates at that time in Chriſtendom, made the brothers wiſh for an eſtabliſhment in that country. An opportunity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing this quickly preſented itſelf, which they did not ſuffer to paſs unimproved. Eutemi, King of Algiers, having attempted ſeveral times, without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, to take a fort which the Spaniſh governors of Oran had built not far from his capital, was ſo ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed as to apply for aid to Barbaroſſa, whoſe valour the Africans conſidered as irreſiſtible. The active Corſair gladly accepted of the invitation, and leaving his brother Hayradin with the fleet, marched at the head of five thouſand men to Algiers, where he was received as their deliverer. Such a force gave him the command of the town; and obſerving that the Moors neither ſuſpected him of any bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor were capable with their light-armed
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:011837_0684_0F9D88BBEFA92818"/>
troops of oppoſing his diſciplined veterans, he ſecretly murdered the Monarch whom he had come to aſſiſt, and cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed King of Algiers in his ſtead. The authority which he had thus boldly uſurped, he endeavoured to eſtabliſh by arts ſuited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; by liberality, without bounds to thoſe who favoured his promotion, and by cruelty no leſs unbounded towards all whom he had any reaſon to diſtruſt. Not ſatisfied with the throne which he had acquired, he attacked the neighbouring King of Tremecen, and having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed him in battle, added his dominions to thoſe of Algiers. At the ſame time, he continued to infeſt the coaſts of Spain and Italy with fleets which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the armaments of a great Monarch, rather than the light ſquadrons of a Corſair. The devaſtations which theſe committed obliged Charles about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign, to furniſh the marquis de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mares, governor of Oran, with troops ſufficient to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him. That officer, aſſiſted by the dethroned King of Tremecen, executed the commiſſion with ſuch ſpirit, that Barbaroſſa's troops being beat in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral encounters, he himſelf was ſhut up in Tremecen; after defending it to the laſt extremity, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in attempting to make his eſcape, and ſlain while he fought with an obſtinate valour, worthy of his former fame and exploits.</p>
                  <p>HIS brother Hayradin, known likewiſe by the name of Barbaroſſa, aſſumed the ſcepter of Algiers with the ſame ambition and abilities, but with better fortune. His reign being undiſturbed by the arms of the Spaniards, which had full occupation in the wars among the European powers, he regulated with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable prudence the interior police of his kingdom, carried on his naval operations with great vigour, and extended his conqueſts on the continent of Africa. But, perceiving that the Moors and Arabs ſubmitted to his government with the utmoſt impatience, and being afraid that his continual depredations would, one day, draw upon him the arms of the Chriſtians, he put his dominions under the protection of the Grand Seignior, and received from him a body of Turkiſh
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:011837_0685_0F9D88BCB6ED18A0"/>
ſoldiers ſufficient for his ſecurity againſt his domeſtic as well as his foreign enemies. At laſt, the ſame of his exploits daily increaſing, Solyman offered him the command of the Turkiſh fleet, as the only perſon whoſe valour and ſkill in naval affairs entitled him to command againſt Andrew Doria, the greateſt ſea-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of that age. Proud of this diſtinction, Barbaroſſa repaired to Conſtantinople, and with a wonderful verſatility of mind, mingling the arts of a courtier with the boldneſs of a Corſair, gained the entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence both of the Sultan and his Vizier. To them he communicated a ſcheme that he had formed of making himſelf maſter of Tunis, the moſt flouriſhing kingdom, at that time, on the coaſt of Africa; which being approved of by them, he obtained whatever he demanded for carrying it into execution.</p>
                  <p>HIS hopes of ſucceſs in this undertaking were founded on the inteſtine diviſions in the kingdom of Tunis. Mahmed, the laſt King of that country, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty-four ſons by different wives, named Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Haſcen, one of the youngeſt among them, his ſucceſſor. That weak Prince, who owed his prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence not to his own merit, but to the aſcendant which his mother had acquired over an old doating monarch, firſt poiſoned his father in order to prevent him from altering his deſtination; and then, with the babarous policy which prevails wherever polygamy is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the right of ſucceſſion is not preciſely fixed, he put to death all his brothers whom he could get into his power. Alraſchid, one of the eldeſt, was ſo fortunate as to eſcape his rage; and finding a retreat among the wandering Arabs, made ſeveral attempts, by the aſſiſtance of ſome of their chiefs, to recover the throne, which of right belonged to him. But theſe proving unſucceſsful, and the Arabs, from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural levity, being ready to deliver him up to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs brother, he fled to Algiers, the only place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge remaining, and implored the protection of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa; who, diſcerning at once all the advantages that might be gained by ſupporting his title, received him with every poſſible demonſtration of friendſhip and reſpect. Being ready, at that time, to ſet ſail for
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:011837_0686_0F9D88BD6F6C6950"/>
Conſtantinople, he eaſily perſuaded Alraſchid, whoſe eagerneſs to obtain a crown diſpoſed him to believe or undertake, any thing, to accompany him thither, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him effectual aſſiſtance from Solyman, whom he repreſented to be the moſt generous, as well as moſt powerful Monarch in the world. But no ſooner were they arrived at Conſtantinople, than the falſe Corſair, regardleſs of all his promiſes to him, opened to the Sultan a plan for conquering Tunis, and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Turkiſh empire, by making uſe of the name of this exiled Prince, and by means of the party ready to declare in his favour. Solyman approved with too much facility, of this perſidious propoſal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſuitable to the character of its author, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of a great Prince. A powerful fleet and numerous army were ſoon aſſembled; at the ſight of which the credulous Alraſchid flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he would ſoon enter his capital in triumph.</p>
                  <p>BUT juſt as this unhappy Prince was going to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark, he was arreſted by order of the Sultan, ſhut up in the ſeraglio, and was never heard of more. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa ſailed with a fleet of two hundred and fifty veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels towards Africa. After ravaging the coaſts of Italy, and ſpreading terror through every part of that country, he appeared before Tunis; and landing his men, gave out that he came to aſſert the right of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſchid, whom he pretended to have left ſick on board the Admiral galley. The ſort of Goletta which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the bay, ſoon fell into his hands, partly by his own addreſs, partly by the treachery of its command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and the inhabitants of Tunis, weary of Muley-Haſcen's government, took arms, and declared for Alraſchid with ſuch zeal and unanimity, as obliged the former to fly ſo precipitately, that he left all his treaſures behind him. The gates were immediately ſet open to Barbaroſſa, as the reſtorer of their lawful ſovereign. But when Alraſchid himſelf did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and when inſtead of his name, that of Solyman alone was heard among the acclamations of the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſoldiers marching into the town, the people of Tunis began to ſuſpect the Corſair's treachery; and their ſuſpicions being ſoon converted into certainty,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:011837_0687_0F9D88BE2F463028"/>
they ran to arms with the utmoſt fury, and ſurrounded the citadel, into which Barbaroſſa had led his troops. But having foreſeen ſuch a revolution, he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for it; he immediately turned againſt them the artillery on the ramparts, and by one briſk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it, and of his ſmall arms, he diſperſed the numerous but undirected aſſailants, and forced them to acknowledge Solyman as their ſovereign, and to ſubmit to himſelf as his viceroy.</p>
                  <p>HIS firſt care was to put the kingdom of which he had thus got poſſeſſion, in a proper poſture of defence. He ſtrengthened the citadel which commands the town; and fortifying the Goletta in a regular manner at vaſt expence, made it the principal ſtation for his fleet, and his great arſenal both for military and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtores. Being now poſſeſſed of ſuch extenſive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, he carried on his depredations againſt the Chriſtian ſtates to a greater extent, and with more deſtructive violence than ever. Daily complaints of the outrages committed by his cruizers were brought to the Emperor by his ſubjects, both in Spain and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All Chriſtendom ſeemed to expect from him, as its greateſt and moſt fortunate Prince, that he would put an end to this new and odious ſpecies of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At the ſame time Muley-Haſcen, the exiled king of Tunis, finding none of the Mahometan Princes in Africa willing or able to aſſiſt him in recovering his throne, applied to Charles as the only perſon who could aſſert his rights in oppoſition to ſuch a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſurper. The Emperor, equally deſirous of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his dominions from the dangerous neigbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Barbaroſſa; of appearing as the protector of an unfortunate Prince; and of acquiring the glory annexed in that age, to every expedition againſt the Mahometans, readily concluded a treaty with Muley-Haſcen, (April 21, 1553) and began to prepare for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading Tunis. Having made trial of his own abilities for war in the late campaign in Hungary, he was now become ſo fond of the military character, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to command on this occaſion in perſon. The united ſtrength of his dominions was called out upon an enterprize in which the Emperor was about to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:011837_0688_0F9D88BEF15107D0"/>
his glory, and which drew the attention of all Europe. A Flemiſh fleet carried from the ports of the Low-Country a body of German infantry <note n="s" place="bottom">Hardi Annales Brabant. i 599.</note>; the gallies of Naples and Sicily took on board the veteran bands of Italians and Spaniards, which had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves by ſo many victories over the French; the Emperor himſelf embarked at Barcelona with the flower of the Spaniſh nobility, and was join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a conſiderable ſquadron from Portugal, under the command of the Infant Don Lewis, the Empreſs's brother; Andrew Doria conducted his own gallies, the beſt appointed at that time in Europe, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt ſkilful officers: the Pope furniſhed all the aſſiſtance in his power towards ſuch a pious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; and the order of Malta, the perpetual enemies of the Infidels, equipped a ſmall ſquadron, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by the valour of the knights who ſerved on board it. The port of Cagliari in Sardinia was the general place of rendezvous. Doria was appointed High Admiral of the fleet; the command in chief of the land forces was given to the marquis di Guaſto.</p>
                  <p>ON the ſixteenth of July, the fleet, conſiſting of near five hundred veſſels, having on board above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand regular troops, ſet ſail from Cagliari, and after a proſperous navigation, landed within ſight of Tunis. Barbaroſſa having early intelligence of the Emperor's immenſe armament, and ſuſpecting its deſtination, prepared with equal prudence and vigour for the defence of his new conqueſt. He called in all his corſairs from their different ſtations; he drew from Algiers what forces could be ſpared; he diſpatched meſſengers to all the African Princes, Moors as well as Arabs, and by repreſenting Muley-Haſcen as an infamous apoſtate, prompted by ambition and revenge not only to become the vaſſal of a Chriſtian Prince, but to conſpire with him to extirpate the Mahomedan faith, he enflamed thoſe ignorant and bigotted chiefs to ſuch a degree, that they took arms as in a common cauſe. Twenty thouſand horſe together with a vaſt body of foot, ſoon aſſembled at Tunis; and Barbaroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, by a proper diſtribution of preſents among them from time to time, kept the ardour which had bro't
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:011837_0689_0F9D88C03B6BF5B8"/>
them together from ſubſiding. But as he was too well acquainted with the enemy whom he had to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to think that theſe light troops could reſiſt the heavy armed cavalry and veteran infantry which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Imperial army, his chief confidence was in the ſtrength of the Goletta, and in his body of Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſoldiers who were armed and diſciplined after the European faſhion. Six thouſand of theſe, under the command of Sinan, a renegado Jew, the braveſt and moſt experienced of all his corſairs, he threw into that fort, which the Emperor immediately inveſted. As Charles had the command of the ſea, his camp was ſo plentifully ſupplied not only with the neceſſaries, but with all the luxuries of life, that Muley-Haſcen, who had not been accuſtomed to ſee war carried on with ſuch order and magnificence, was filled with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Emperor's power. His troops animated by his preſence, and conſidering it as meritorious to ſhed their blood in ſuch a pious cauſe, contended with each other for the poſts of honour and danger. Three ſeparate attacks were concerted, and the Germans, Spaniards and Italians, having one of theſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each of them, puſhed them forward with the eager courage which national emulation inſpires. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan diſplayed reſolution and ſkill becoming the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which his maſter had put in him; the garriſon performed the hard ſervice on which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with great fortitude. But though he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the beſiegers by frequent ſallies; though the Moors and Arabs alarmed the camp with their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual incurſions; the breaches ſoon became ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable towards the land, while the fleet battered the fortifications which it could approach, with no leſs fury and ſucceſs, that an aſſault being given on all ſides at once, the place was taken by ſtorm (July 25).

number in that age, and a remarkable proof of the ſtrength of the fort, as well as of the greatneſs of the corſair's power, The Emperor marched into the Goletta through the breach, and turning to Muley-Haſcen who attended him, "Here," ſays he, <q>is a gate open to you, by which you ſhall return to take poſſeſſion of your dominions.</q>

                  <p>BARBAROSSA, though he felt the full weight of the blow which he had received, did not, however, loſe courage, or abandon the defence of Tunis. But as the walls were of great extent, and extremely weak; as he could not depend on the fidelity of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, nor hope that the Moors and Arabs would ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the hardſhips of a ſiege, he boldly determined to advance with his army, which amounted to fifty thouſand men <note n="t" place="bottom">Epiſtres de Princes, par Ruſcelli, p. 119, &amp;c.</note>, towards the Imperial camp, and to decide the fate of his kingdom by the iſſue of a battle. This reſolution he communicated to his principal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and repreſenting to them the fatal conſequences which might follow, if ten thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves, whom he had ſhut up in the citadel, ſhould attempt to mutiny during the abſence of the army, he propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a neceſſary precaution for the public ſecurity, to maſſacre them without mercy before he began his march. They all approved warmly of his intention to fight; but inured as they were, in their piratical depredations, to ſcenes of bloodſhed and cruelty, the barbarity of his propoſal concerning the ſlaves filled them with horror; and Barbaroſſa, rather from the dread of irritating them, than ſwayed by motives of humanity, conſented to ſpare the lives of the ſlaves.</p>
                  <p>BY this time the Emperor had begun to advance towards Tunis; and though his troops ſuffered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable hardſhips in their march over burning ſands, deſtitute of water, and expoſed to the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heat of the ſun, they ſoon came up with the enemy. The Moors and Arabs, emboldened by their vaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in number, immediately ruſhed on to the attack with loud ſhouts, but their undiſciplined cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage did not ſtand one moment the ſhock of regular
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:011837_0691_0F9D89F13537DEF0"/>
battalions; and though Barbaroſſa, with admirable preſence of mind, and by expoſing his own perſon to the greateſt dangers, endeavoured to rally them, the rout became ſo general, that he himſelf was hurried along with them in their flight back to the city. There he found every thing in the utmoſt confuſion; ſome of the inhabitants flying with their families and effects; others ready to ſet open their gates to the conqueror; the Turkiſh ſoldiers preparing to retreat; and the citadel, which in ſuch circumſtances might have afforded him ſome refuge, already in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian captives. Theſe unhappy men, rendered deſperate by their ſituation, had laid hold on the opportunity which Barbaroſſa dreaded. As ſoon as his army was at ſome diſtance from the town, they gained two of their keepers, by whoſe aſſiſtance, knocking off their fetters, and burſting open their priſons, they overpowered the Turkiſh garriſon, and turned the artillery of the fort againſt their former maſters. Barbaroſſa, diſappointed and enraged, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſometimes againſt the falſe compaſſion of his officers, and ſometimes condemning his own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent compliance with their opinion, fled precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Bona.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE Charles, ſatisfied with the eaſy and almoſt bloodleſs victory which he had gained, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ſlowly with the precaution neceſſary in an enemy's country, did not yet know the whole extent of his own good fortune. But at laſt, a meſſenger diſpatched by the ſlaves acquainted him with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their noble effort for the recovery of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and at the ſame time deputies arrived from the town, in order to preſent him the keys of their gates, and to implore his protection from military violence. While he was deliberating concerning the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for this purpoſe, the ſoldiers fearing that they would be deprived of the booty which they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, broke ſuddenly, and without orders, into the town, and began to kill and plunder without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. It was then too late to reſtrain their cruelty, their avarice, or licentiouſneſs. All the outrages of which ſoldiers are capable in the fury of a ſtorm, all

the exceſſes of which men can be guilty when their paſſions are heightened by the contempt and hatred which difference in manners and religion inſpire, were committed. Above thirty thouſand of the innocent inhabitants periſhed on that unhappy day, and ten thouſand were carried away as ſlaves. Muley-Haſcen took poſſeſſion of a throne ſurrounded with carnage, abhorred by this ſubjects on whom he had brought ſuch calamities, and pitied even by thoſe whoſe raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been the occaſion of them. The Emperor lamented the fatal accident which had ſtained the luſtre of his victory; and amidſt ſuch a ſcene of horror there was but one ſpectacle that afforded him any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Ten thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves, among whom were ſeveral perſons of diſtinction, met him as he entered the town; and falling on their knees, thanked and bleſſed him as their deliverer.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time that Charles accompliſhed his promiſe to the Mooriſh King of re-eſtabliſhing him in his dominions, he did not neglect what was neceſſary for bridling the power of the African corſairs, for the ſecurity of his own ſubjects, and for the intereſt of the Spaniſh crown: In order to gain theſe ends, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treaty with Muley-Haſcen on the following conditions; that he ſhould hold the kingdom of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in fee of the crown of Spain, and do homage to the Emperor as his liege lord; that all the Chriſtian ſlaves now within his dominions, of whatever nation, ſhould be ſet at liberty without ranſom; that no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Emperor's ſhould for the future be detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſervitude; that no Turkiſh corſair ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the ports of his dominions; that free trade, together with the publick exerciſe of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, ſhould be allowed to all the Emperor's ſubjects; that the Emperor ſhould not only retain the Goletta, but all the other ſea-ports in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which were fortified, ſhould be put into his hands; that Muley-Haſcen ſhould pay annually twelve thouſand crowns for the ſubſiſtence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh garriſon in the Goletta; that he ſhould enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no alliance with any of the Emperor's enemies, and ſhould preſent to him every year, as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VI.</head>
                  <p>UNFORTUNATELY for the reputation of Francis I. among his contemporaries, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, at this juncture, appeared a perfect contraſt to that of his rival, as he laid hold on the opportunity afforded him, by the Emperor's having turned his whole force againſt the common enemy, to revive his pretenſions in Italy, and to plunge Europe into a new war. The treaty of Cambray, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, did not remove the cauſes of enmity between the two contending Princes; it covered up, but did not extinguiſh the flames of diſcord. Francis, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, who waited with impatience for a proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of recovering the reputation as well as territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he had loſt, continued to carry on his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations in different courts againſt the Emperor, taking the utmoſt pains to heighten the jealouſy which many Princes entertained of his power or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and to inſpire the reſt with the ſame ſuſpicion and fear: Among others, he applied to Francis Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:011837_0695_0F9D89F65F3712D8"/>
who, though indebted to Charles for the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dutchy of Milan, had received it on ſuch hard conditions, as rendered him not only a vaſſal of the Empire, but a tributary dependant upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The honour of having married the Emperor's niece, did not reconcile him to this ignominious ſtate of ſubjection, which became ſo intolerable even to Sforza, a weak and poor ſpirited Prince, that he liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with eagerneſs to the firſt propoſals Francis made of reſcuing him from the yoke. Theſe propoſals were conveyed to him by Maraviglia, or Merveille, as he is called by the French hiſtorians, a Milaneſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſiding at Paris; and ſoon after, in order to carry on the negociation with greater advantage, Merveille was ſent to Milan, on pretence of viſiting his relations, but with ſecret credentials from Francis as his envoy. In this character he was received by Sforza. But notwithanding his care to keep that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance concealed, Charles ſuſpecting, or having received information of it, remonſtrated and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſuch a high tone, that the Duke and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, equally intimidated, gave the world imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a moſt infamous proof of their ſervile fear of offending the Emperor. Having decoyed Merveille, who had neither the prudence nor temper which the ſtation wherein he was placed required, into a quarrel in which he happened to kill his antagoniſt, one of the Duke's domeſtics, they inſtantly commanded him to be ſeized, to be tried for that crime, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed (Dec. 1533). Francis, aſtoniſhed at this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a character held ſacred among the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized nations, and enraged at the inſult offered to the dignity of his crown, threatned Sforza with the effects of his indignation, and complained to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, whom he conſidered as the real author of that unexampled outrage. But meeting with no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from either, he appealed to all the Princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and thought himſelf now entitled to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for an injury, which it would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and puſillanimous to let paſs with impunity.</p>
                  <p>BEING thus furniſhed with a pretext for beginning a war, on which he had already reſolved, he multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

After having ſacrificed the honour of his houſe by the marriage of his ſon with Catharine of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici, in order to gain Clement, the death of that Pontiff had deprived him of all the advantages which he expected to derive from his friendſhip. Paul, his ſucceſſor, though attached by inclination to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial intereſt, ſeemed determined to maintain the neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality ſuitable to his character as the common father of the contending Princes. The King of England, occupied with domeſtic cares and projects, declined for once, engaging in the affairs of the continent, and refuſed to aſſiſt Francis, unleſs he would imitate his example, in throwing off the Papal ſupremacy. Theſe diſappointments led him to ſolicit, with greater ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, the aid of the Proteſtant Princes aſſociated by the league of Smalkalde. That he might the more eaſily acquire their confidence, he endeavoured to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf to their predominant paſſion, zeal for their religious tenets. He affected a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful moderation with regard to the points in diſpute; he permitted Bellay, his envoy in Germany, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his ſentiments concerning ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant articles, in terms not far different from thoſe uſed by the Proteſtants <note n="a" place="bottom">Freheri Script. Rer. German. iii. 354, &amp;c. Sleid. Hiſt. 178, 183; Seckend. lib. iii. 103.</note>; he even condeſcended to invite Melancthon, whoſe gentle manners and pacific ſpirit diſtinguiſhed him among the Reformers, to viſit Paris, that by his aſſiſtance he might concert the moſt proper meaſures for reconciling the contending ſects, which ſo unhappily divided the church <note n="b" place="bottom">Camerarii Vita Ph. Melanchthonis, 12mo, Hag. 1655. p. 12.</note>. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions muſt be conſidered rather as arts of policy, than the reſult of conviction; for whatever impreſſion the new opinions in religion made on his ſiſters, the Queen of Navarre and Dutcheſs of Ferrara, the gaiety of Francis's own temper, and his love of pleaſure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him little leiſure to examine theological con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>

                     <pb n="295" facs="unknown:011837_0697_0F9D89F8908BD318"/>BUT ſoon after he loſt all the fruits of this diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous artifice, by a ſtep very inconſiſtent with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to the German Princes. This ſtep, however, the prejudice of the age, and the religious ſentiments of his own ſubjects, rendered it neceſſary for him to take. His cloſe union with the King of England an excommunicated heretick; his frequent negociations with the German Proteſtants; but above all, his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick audience to an envoy from Sultan Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, had excited violent ſuſpicions concerning the ſincerity of his attachment to religion. To have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Emperor, who, on all occaſions, made high pretenſions to zeal in defence of the Catholick faith, and at the very juncture, when he was prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his expedition againſt Barbaroſſa, which was then conſidered as a pious enterprize, could not have failed to confirm ſuch unfavourable ſentiments with regard to Francis, and called on him to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſome extraordinary demonſtration of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the eſtabliſhed doctrines of the church. The indiſcreet zeal of ſome of his ſubjects, who had imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Proteſtant opinions, furniſhed him with ſuch an occaſion as he deſired. They had affixed to the gates of the Louvre, and other public places, papers containing indecent reflexions on the doctrines and rites of the Popiſh church. Six of the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this raſh action were diſcovered and ſeized. The King, in order to avert the judgments which it was ſuppoſed their blaſphemies might draw down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nation, appointed a ſolemn proceſſion. The holy ſacrament was carried through the city in great pomp; Francis walked uncovered before it, bearing a torch in his hand; the princes of the blood ſupported the canopy over it; the nobles marched in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. In the preſence of this numerous aſſembly, the King, accuſtomed to expreſs himſelf on every ſubject in ſtrong and animating language, declared that if one of his hands were infected with hereſy, he would cut it off with the other, and would not ſpare even his own children, if found guilty of that crime. As a dreadful proof of his being in earneſt, the ſix unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py perſons were publickly burnt before the proceſſion

was finiſhed, with circuſtances of the moſt ſhocking barbarity attending their execution <note n="c" place="bottom">Belcarii Camment. Rer, Gallic. 646. Sleid. Hiſt. 175, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Princes of the league of Smalkalde, filled with reſentment and indignation at the cruelty with which their brethren were treated, could not conceive Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis to be ſincere, when he offered to protect in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many thoſe very tenets, which he perſecuted with ſuch rigour in his own dominions; ſo that all Bellay's art and eloquence in vindicating his maſter, and apologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing for his conduct, made but little impreſſion upon them. Beſides, the Emperor, who hitherto had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver employed violence againſt the doctrines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, nor even given them much moleſtation in their progreſs, was now bound by the agreement at Ratiſbon, not to diſturb thoſe who had embraced the new opinions; and the Proteſtants wiſely conſidered this as a more certain and immediate ſecurity, than the precarious and diſtant hopes with which Francis endeavoured to allure them. The manner too in which he had behaved to his allies at the peace of Cambray, was two recent to be forgotten, and did not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to rely much on his friendſhip or generoſity. Upon all theſe accounts, the Proteſtant Princes refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſiſt the French King in any hoſtile attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor. The Elector of Saxony, the moſt zealous among them, in order to avoid giving any um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage to Charles, would not permit Melancthon to viſit the court of France, although that Reformer, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered perhaps by the invitation of ſo great a Monarch, or hoping that his preſence there might be of ſignal advantage to the Proteſtant cauſe, diſcovered a ſtrong inclination to undertake the journey.<note n="d" place="bottom">Camerarii Vita Melan. 142, &amp;c. 415.

                  <p>BUT though none of the many Princes who envied or dreaded the power of Charles, would ſecond Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis's efforts in order to reduce and circumſcribe it, he, nevertheleſs, commanded his army to advance towards the frontiers of Italy. As his ſole pretext for taking arms was, that he might chaſtiſe the Duke of Milan for his inſolent and cruel breach of the law of nations, it might have been expected that the whole weight of

                     </gap> allured by the magnificent promiſes with which he flattered her ambition, ſhe formed an union between the Duke and the Imperial court, extremely inconſiſtent with that neutrality, which wiſe policy as well as the ſituation of his dominions had hitherto induced him to obſerve in all the quarrels between the contending Monarchs. Francis was abundantly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the diſtreſs to which he might be expoſed, if when he entered Italy, he ſhould leave behind him the territories of a Prince, devoted ſo obſequiouſly to the Emperor, that he had ſent his eldeſt ſon to be educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the court of Spain, as a kind of hoſtage for his fidelity. Clement the Seventh, who had repreſented this danger in a ſtrong light during his interview with Francis at Marſeilles, ſuggeſted to him, at the ſame time, the proper method of guarding againſt it, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adviſed him to begin his operations againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe, by taking poſſeſſion of Savoy and Piedmont, as the only certain way of ſecuring a communication with his own dominions. Francis, highly irritated at the Duke on many accounts, particularly for having ſupplied the Conſtable Bourbon with the money, which enabled him to levy that body of troops which ruined the French army in the fatal battle of Pavia, was not unwilling to let him now feel both how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he reſented, and how ſeverely he could puniſh theſe injuries. Nor did he want ſeveral pretexts that would give ſome colour of equity to the violence which he intended. The territories of France and Savoy lying contiguous to each other, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled in many places, various diſputes, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſuch a ſituation, ſubſiſted concerning the limits of their reſpective property; and beſides, Francis had, in right of his mother Louiſe of Savoy, large claims

upon the Duke her brother, for her ſhare in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſuccceſſion. Being unwilling, however, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin hoſtilities without ſome cauſe of quarrel more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than theſe pretenſions, many of which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete, and others dubious, he demanded permiſſion to march through Piedmont in his way to the Milaneſe, hoping that the Duke, from an exceſs of attachment to the Imperial intereſt, might refuſe this requeſt, and thus give a greater appearance of juſtice to all his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt him. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we may believe the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians of Savoy, better informed with regard to this particular than thoſe of France, the Duke readily, and with a good grace, granted what it was not in his power to deny, promiſing free paſſage to the French troops as was deſired; ſo that Francis, as the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod now left of juſtifying the meaſures which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take, was obliged to inſiſt for full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with regard to every thing that either the crown of France or his mother Louiſe could demand of the houſe of Savoy <note n="e" place="bottom">Hiſtoire Genealogique de Savoye, par.

Such an evaſive anſwer, as might have been expected, being made to this requiſition, the French army under the admiral Brion poured at once into the Duke's territories at different places. The countries of Breſſe and Bugey, united at that time to Savoy, were over-run in a moment. Moſt of the towns in the dutchy of Savoy opened their gates at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the enemy; a few which attempted to make reſiſtance were eaſily forced; and before the end of the campaign, the Duke ſaw himſelf ſtripped of all his dominions, but the province of Piedmont, in which there were not many places in a condition to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                  <p>TO compleat the Duke's misfortunes, the city of Geneva, the ſovereignty of which he claimed, and in ſome degree poſſeſſed, threw of his yoke, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt drew along with it the loſs of the adjacent terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Geneva was, at that time, an Imperial city; and though under the direct dominion of its own bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the remote ſovereignty of the Dukes of Savoy, the form of its internal conſtitution was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:011837_0701_0F9D89FD0BD1A668"/>
republican, being governed by ſyndics and a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil choſen by the citizens. From theſe diſtinct and often claſhing juriſdictions, two oppoſite parties took their riſe, and had long ſubſiſted in the ſtate; the one compoſed of the advocates for the privileges of the community, aſſumed the name of <hi>Eignotz,</hi> or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in defence of liberty; and branded the other, which ſupported the epiſcopal or ducal prerogatives, with the name of <hi>Mammelukes</hi> or ſlaves. At length, the Proteſtant opinions beginning to ſpread among the citizens, inſpired ſuch as embraced them with that bold enterprizing ſpirit which always accompanied or was naturally produced by them in their firſt operations. As both the Duke and Biſhop were from intereſt, from prejudice, and from political conſiderations, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent enemies of the Reformation, all the new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts joined with warmth the party of the Eignotz; and zeal for religion, mingling with the love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, added ſtrength to that generous paſſion. The rage and animoſity of two factions, ſhut up within the ſame walls, occaſioned frequent inſurrections, which terminating moſtly to the advantage of the friends of liberty, they daily gained ground.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke and Biſhop, forgetting their ancient conteſts about juriſdiction, had united againſt their common enemies, and each attacked them with his proper weapons. The Biſhop excommunicated the people of Geneva as guilty of a double crime; of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, in apoſtatiſing from the eſtabliſhed religion; and of ſacrilege, in invading the rights of his ſee. The Duke attacked them as rebels againſt their lawful Prince, and attempted to render himſelf maſter of the city, firſt by ſurprize, and then by open force. The citizens, deſpiſing the thunder of the Biſhop's cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, boldly aſſerted their independance againſt the Duke; and partly by their own valour, partly by the powerful aſſiſtance which they received from their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the canton of Berne, together with ſome ſmall ſupplies both of men and money, ſecretly furniſhed by the King of France, they defeated all his attempts. Not ſatisfied with having repulſed him, or with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining always upon the defenſive themſelves, they
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:011837_0702_0F9D8A0071E7DD18"/>
now took advantage of the Duke's inability to reſiſt them, while overwhelmed by the armies of France, and ſeized ſeveral caſtles and places of ſtrength which he poſſeſſed in the neighbourhood of Geneva; thus delivering the city from theſe odious monuments of its former ſubjection, and rendering the public liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more ſecure for the future. At the ſame time the canton of Berne invaded and conquered the Paijis de Vaud, to which it had ſome pretenſions. The canton of Friburgh, though zealouſly attached to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic religion, and having no ſubject of conteſt with the Duke, laid hold on part of the ſpoils of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince. A great portion of theſe conqueſts or uſurpations being ſtill retained by the two cantons, add conſiderably to their power, and have become the moſt valuable part of their territories, Geneva, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many ſchemes and enterprizes of the Dukes of Savoy to re-eſtabliſh their dominion there, ſtill keeps poſſeſſion of its independance; and in conſequence of that bleſſing, has attained a degree of conſideration, wealth and elegance, which it could not otherwiſe have reached <note n="f" place="bottom">Hiſt. de la Ville de Geneve, par Spon. 120.

                  <p>AMIDST ſuch a ſucceſſion of diſaſtrous events, the Duke of Savoy had no other reſource but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's protection, which, upon his return from Tunis, he demanded with the moſt earneſt importunity; and as his misfortunes were occaſioned chiefly by his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Imperial intereſt, he had a juſt title to immediate aſſiſtance. Charles, however, was not in a condition to ſupport him with that vigour and diſpatch which the exigency of his affairs called for. Moſt of the troops employed in the African expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having been raiſed for that ſervice alone, were diſbanded as ſoon as it was finiſhed; the veteran for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under Antonio de Leyva were ſcarce ſufficient for the defence of the Milaneſe; and the Emperor's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was entirely drained by his vaſt efforts againſt the Infidels.</p>
                  <p>BUT the death of Francis Sforza, (October 24) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:011837_0703_0F9D8A01E91960A8"/>
according to ſome hiſtorians, by the terror of a French invaſion, which had twice been fatal to his family, afforded the Emperor full leiſure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for action. By this unexpected event, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the war, and the cauſes of diſcord, were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally changed. Francis's firſt pretext for taking arms, in order to chaſtiſe Sforza for the inſult offered to the dignity of his crown, was at once cut off; but, as that Prince died without iſſue, all Francis's rights to the dutchy of Milan, which he had yielded only to Sforza and his poſterity, returned back to him in full force. As the recovery of the Milaneſe was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite object of that Monarch, he inſtantly renewed his claim to it; and if he had ſupported his pretenſions by ordering the powerful army quartered in Savoy, to advance without loſing a moment towards Milan, he could ſcarce have failed to ſecure the important point of poſſeſſion. But Francis who became daily leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing as he advanced in years, and who was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed at ſome times into an exceſs of caution by the remembrance of his paſt misfortunes, endeavoured to eſtabliſh his rights by negociation, not by arms; and from a timid moderation, fatal in all great affairs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to improve the favourable opportunity which preſented itſelf. Charles, meanwhile, in quality of ſovereign, took poſſeſſion of the dutchy, as a vacant fief of the Empire; and while Francis endeavoured to explain and aſſert his title to it, by arguments and memorials, uſing every art in order to reconcile the Italian powers to the thoughts of his regaining foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Italy, his rival was ſilently taking effectual ſteps to prevent it. The Emperor, however, was very careful not to diſcover too early any intention of this kind; but ſeeming to admit the equity of Francis's claim, he appeared ſollicitous only about giving him poſſeſſion in ſuch a manner as might not diſturb the peace of Europe, or overturn the balance of power in Italy, which the politicians of that country were ſo fond of preſerving. By this artifice he deceived Francis, and gained ſo much confidence with the reſt of Europe, that almoſt without incurring any ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he involved the affair in new difficulties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:011837_0704_0F9D8A025607E098"/>
the negociations at pleaſure. Sometimes he propoſed to grant the inveſtiture of Milan to the Duke of Orleans, Francis's ſecond ſon, ſometimes to the Duke of Angouleme, his third ſon; as the views and inclinations of the French court varied, he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his choice alternately from the one to the other, with ſuch profound and well conducted diſſimulation, that neither Francis nor his miniſters ſeem to have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated his real intention; and all military operations were entirely ſuſpended, as if nothing had remained but to enter quietly into poſſeſſion of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>DURING the interval gained in this manner, (1536) Charles prevailed on the ſtates both of Sicily and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, who thought themſelves greatly honoured by the preſence of their ſovereign on his return from Tunis, and who were no leſs pleaſed with the apparent diſintereſtedneſs of his expedition into Africa, than dazzled by the ſucceſs which had attended his arms, to vote him ſuch liberal ſubſidies as were ſeldom granted in that age. This enabled him to recruit his veteran troops, to levy a body of Germans, and to take every other proper precaution for executing or ſupporting the meaſures on which he had determined. Bellay, the French envoy in Germany, having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the intention of raiſing troops in that country, notwithſtanding all the pretexts employed in order to conceal it, firſt alarmed his maſter with this evident proof of the Emperor's inſincerity <note n="g" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 192.</note>. But Francis was ſo poſſeſſed at that time with the rage of negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all the artifices and refinements of which his rival far ſurpaſſed him, that inſtead of beginning his military operations, and puſhing them with vigour or ſeizing the Milaneſe before the Imperial army was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, he ſatisfied himſelf with making new offers to the Emperor, in order to procure the inveſtiture by his voluntary deed. His offers were, indeed, ſo liberal and advantageous, that if ever Charles had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to grant his demand, he could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them with decency. He dextrouſly eluded
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:011837_0705_0F9D8A04BAA467C8"/>
them by declaring that, until he conſulted the Pope in perſon, he could not take his final reſolution with regard to a point which ſo nearly concerned the peace of Italy. By this evaſion he gained ſome farther time for ripening the ſchemes he had in view.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor at laſt advanced towards Rome, and made his public entry into that city with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pomp; (April 6) but it being found neceſſary to remove the ruins of an ancient temple of peace in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to widen one of the ſtreets, through which the cavalcade had to paſs, all the hiſtorians take notice of this trivial circumſtance, which they are fond to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret as an omen of the bloody war that followed. Charles, it is certain, had by this time baniſhed all thoughts of peace; and at laſt threw off the maſk, with which he had ſo long covered his deſigns from the court of France, by a declaration of his ſentiments no leſs ſingular than explicit. The French ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors having in their maſter's name demanded a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive reply to his propoſitions concering the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Milan, Charles promiſed to give it next day in preſence of the Pope and Cardinals aſſembled in full conſiſtory. Theſe being accordingly met, and all the the foreign ambaſſadors invited to attend, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſtood up, and addreſſing himſelf to the Pope, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated for ſome time on the ſincerity of his own wiſhes for the peace of Chriſtendom, and his abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of war, the miſeries of which he enumerated at great length, with ſtudied and elaborate oratory; he comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ined that all his endeavours to preſerve the tranquility of Europe had hitherto been defeated by the reſtleſs and unjuſt ambition of the French King; that even during his minority he had proofs of the unfriendly and hoſtile intentions of that monarch; that afterwards, he had openly attempted to wreſt from him the Imperial crown which belonged to him by a title no leſs juſt than natural; that he had next invaded his kindom of Navarre; that not ſatisfied with this, he had attacked his territories as well as thoſe of his allies both in Italy and the Low-Countries; that when the valour of the Imperial troops, rendered ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable by the protection of the Almighty, had
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:011837_0706_0F9D8A054D74CF18"/>
checked his progreſs, ruined his armies, and ſeized his perſon, he continued to purſue by deceit what he had undertaken with injuſtice; that he had violated every article in the the treaty of Madrid to which he owed his liberty, and as ſoon as he returned to his dominions took meaſures for rekindling the war which that pacification had happily extinguiſhed; that when new misfortunes compelled him to ſue again for peace at Cambray, he concluded and obſerved it with great inſincerity; that ſoon thereafter he had formed dangerous connections with the heretical Princes in Germany, and incited them to diſturb the tranquillity of the Empire; that now he had driven the Duke of Savoy, his brother-in-law and ally, out of the greater part of his territories; that after injuries ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and amidſt ſo many ſources of diſcord, all hope of amity or concord became deſperate; and though he was ſtill willing to grant the inveſtiture of Milan to one of the Princes of France, there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle probability of that event's taking place, as Francis on the one hand, would not conſent to what he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſary for ſecuring the tranquillity of Europe, nor, on the other, could he think it reaſonable or ſafe to give him the unconditional poſſeſſion of all that he demanded. Let us not, however, added he, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue wantonly to ſhed the blood of our innocent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; let us decide the quarrel man to man, with what arms he pleaſes to chuſe, in our ſhirts, on an iſland, a bridge, or aboard a galley moored in a river; let the dutchy of Burgundy be put in depoſit on his part, and that of Milan on mine; theſe ſhall be the prize of the conqueror; and after that, let the united forces of Germany, Spain, and France, be employed to humble the power of the Turk, and to extirpate hereſy out of Chriſtendom. But if he, by declining this method of terminating our differences, renders war inevitable, nothing ſhall divert me from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting it to ſuch extremity, as ſhall reduce one of us to be the pooreſt gentleman in his own dominions. Nor do I fear that it will be on me this misfortune ſhall fall; I enter upon action with the faireſt proſpect of ſucceſs; the juſtice of my cauſe, the union of my
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:011837_0707_0F9D8A079399F5A8"/>
ſubjects, the number and valour of my troops, the experience and fidelity of my generals, all combine to enſure it. Of all theſe advantages, the King of France is deſtitute; and were my reſources no more certain, and my hopes of victory no better founded than his, I would inſtantly throw myſelf at his feet and with folded hands and a rope about my neck, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his mercy <note n="h" place="bottom">Bellay, 199.

                  <p>THIS long harangue the Emperor delivered with an elevated voice, a haughty tone, and the greateſt vehemence of expreſſion and geſture. The French ambaſſadors, who did not fully comprehend his meaning, as he ſpake in the Spaniſh tongue, were totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted, and at a loſs how they ſhould anſwer ſuch an unexpected invective; when one of them began to vindicate his maſter's conduct, Charles interpoſed abruptly, and would not permit him to proceed. The Pope, without entering into any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, ſatisfied himſelf with a ſhort but pathetic recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of peace, together with an offer of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſincere endeavours, in order to procure that bleſſing to Chriſtendom; and the aſſembly broke up in the greateſt aſtoniſhment at the extraordinary ſcene which had been exhibited. In no part of his conduct indeed, did Charles ever deviate ſo widely from his general character. Inſtead of that prudent recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that compoſed and regular deportment ſo ſtrictly attentive to decorum, and ſo admirably adapted to conceal his own paſſions, for which he was at all other times conſpicuous, he appears on this occaſion before the moſt auguſt aſſembly in Europe, boaſting of his own power and exploits with inſolence; inveighing againſt his enemy with indecency; and challenging him to combat with an oſtentatious valour, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a champion in romance, than the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in Chriſtendom. But the well known and powerful operation of continued proſperity, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated praiſe, even upon the firmeſt minds, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently account for this ſeeming inconſiſtency. After having compelled Solyman to retreat, and having
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:011837_0708_0F9D8A0A67D16BA0"/>
ſtripped Barbaroſſa of a kingdom, Charles began to conſider his arms as invincible. He had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ever ſince his return from Africa, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſcenes of triumphs and public rejoicings; the orators and poets of Italy, the moſt elegant at that time in Europe, had exhauſted their genius in pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, to which the aſtrologers added magnificent promiſes of a more ſplendid fortune ſtill in ſtore. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with all theſe, he forgot his uſual reſerve and moderation, and was unable to reſtrain this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſally of vanity, which became the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by being both ſo uncommon and ſo public.</p>
                  <p>HE himſelf ſeems to have been immediately ſenſible of the impropriety of his behaviour, and when the French ambaſſadors demanded next day a more clear explanation of what he had ſaid concerning the combat, he told them, that they were not to conſider his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal as a formal challenge to their maſter, but as an expedient for preventing bloodſhed; he endeavoured to ſoften other expreſſions in his diſcourſe; and ſpoke in terms full of reſpect towards Francis. But though this ſlight apology was far from being ſufficient to remove the offence which had been given, Francis by an unaccountable infatuation, continued, to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, as if it had ſtill been poſſible to bring their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to a period by an amicable compoſition. Charles finding him ſo eager to run into the ſnare, favoured the deception, and by ſeeming to liſten to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals gained time to prepare for the execution of his own deſigns <note n="i" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 205, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AT laſt the Imperial army aſſembled on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Milaneſe, to the amount of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, and ten thouſand horſe, while that of France encamped near Vercelli in Piedmont, being greatly inferior in number, and weakened by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of a body of Swiſs, whom Charles artfully perſuaded the Popiſh cantons to recall, that they might not ſerve againſt the Duke of Savoy, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ally. The French general, not daring to riſque a battle, retired as ſoon as the Imperialiſts advanced (May 6). The Emperor put himſelf at the head of
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:011837_0709_0F9D8A0AC52E7250"/>
his forces, which the marquis del Guaſto, the Duke of Alva, and Ferdinand de Gonzago commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, though the ſupreme direction of the whole was committed to Antonio de Leyva, whoſe abilities and experience juſtly entitled him to that diſtinction. Charles ſoon diſcovered his intention not to confine his operations to the recovery of Piedmont and Savoy, but to puſh forward and invade the ſouthern provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of France. This ſcheme he had long meditated, and had long been taking meaſures for executing it with ſuch vigour as might enſure ſucceſs. He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted large ſums to his ſiſter, the governeſs of the Low-Countries, and to his brother, the King of the Romans, inſtructing them to levy all the forces in their power, in order to form two ſeparate bodies, the one to enter France on the ſide of Picardy, the other on the ſide of Champagne; while he with the main army, fell upon the oppoſite frontier of the kingdom. Truſting to theſe vaſt preparations, he thought it impoſſible that Francis could reſiſt ſo many unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attacks, on ſuch different quarters; and begun his enterprize with ſuch confidence of its happy iſſue, that he deſired Paul Jovius the hiſtorian, to make a large proviſion of paper ſufficient to record the victories which he was going to acquire.</p>
                  <p>HIS miniſters and generals, inſtead of entertaining the ſame ſanguine hopes, repreſented to him in the ſtrongeſt terms the danger of leading his troops ſo far from his own territories, to ſuch a diſtance from his magazines, and into provinces which did not yield ſufficient ſubſiſtence for their own inhabitants. They entreated him to conſider the inexhauſtible reſources of France in maintaining a defenſive war, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive zeal with which a gallant nobility would ſerve a Prince whom they loved, in repelling the enemies of their country; they recalled to his remembrance the fatal miſcarriage of Bourbon and Peſcara, when they ventured upon the ſame enterprize under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſeemed as certainly to promiſe ſucceſs; the marquis del Guaſto in particular, fell on his knees, and conjured him to abandon the undertaking as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. But many circumſtances combined in leading
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:011837_0710_0F9D8A0C202DC718"/>
Charles to diſregard all their remonſtrances. He could ſeldom be brought, on any occaſion, to depart from a reſolution which he had once taken; he was too apt to under-rate or deſpiſe the talents of his rival the King of France, which differed ſo widely from his own; he was blinded by the preſumption which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies proſperity; and relied, perhaps, in ſome degree, on the prophecies which predicted the increaſe of his own grandeur. He not only adhered obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own plan, but determined to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards France without waiting for the reduction of any part of Piedmont, except ſuch towns as were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for preſerving his communication with the Milaneſe.</p>
                  <p>THE marquis de Saluces, to whom Francis had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the command of a ſmall body of troops left for the defence of Piedmont, rendered this more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy than he had any reaſon to expect. That nobleman, educated in the court of France, diſtinguiſhed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual marks of the king's favour, and honoured ſo lately with a charge of ſuch importance, ſuddenly, and without any provocation or pretext of diſguſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from his benefactor. His motives to this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous action, were as childiſh as the deed itſelf was baſe. Being ſtrongly poſſeſſed with a ſuperſtitious faith in divination and aſtrology, he believed with full aſſurance, that the fatal period of the French nation was at hand; that on its ruins the Emperor would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh an univerſal monarchy; that therefore he ought to follow the dictates of prudence, in attaching himſelf to his riſing fortune, and would incur no blame for deſerting a Prince whom heaven had devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtruction <note n="k" place="bottom">Bellay. 221. a. 246, b.</note>. His treaſon became ſtill more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by his employing that very authority with which Francis had inveſted him, in order to open his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his enemies. Whatever was propoſed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by the officers under his command for the defence of their conqueſts, he rejected or defeated. Whatever properly belonged to himſelf as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in chief, to provide or perform for that purpoſe, he totally neglected. In this manner, he rendered towns even of the greateſt conſequence untenable, by leaving
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:011837_0711_0F9D8A0D0BA93AC0"/>
them deſtitute either of proviſions, or ammunition or artillery, or a ſufficient garriſon; and the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts muſt have reduced Piedmont in as ſhort time as was neceſſary to march through it, if Montpezat, the governor of Foſſana, had not, by an extraordinary effort of courage and military conduct, detained them, almoſt a month, before that inconſiderable place.</p>
                  <p>BY this meritorious and ſeaſonable ſervice, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his maſter ſufficient time for aſſembling his forces, and for concerting a ſyſtem of defence againſt a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which he now ſaw to be inevitable. Francis fixed upon the only proper and effectual plan for defeating the invaſion of a powerful enemy; and his prudence in chuſing this plan, as well as his perſeverance in execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, deſerve the greater praiſe, as it was equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his natural temper, and to the genius of the French nation. He determined to remain altogether upon the defenſive; never to hazard a battle, or even a great ſkirmiſh, without certainty of ſucceſs; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his camps in a regular manner; to throw garriſons only into towns of great ſtrength; to deprive the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ſubſiſtence, by laying waſte the country before them; and to ſave the whole kingdom, by ſacrificing one of its provinces. The execution of this plan he committed entirely to the marechal Montmorency, who was the author of it; a man wonderfully fitted by nature for ſuch a truſt. Haughty, ſevere, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his own abilities, and deſpiſing thoſe of other men; incapable of being diverted from any reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by remonſtrances or intreaties; and in proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſcheme, regardleſs alike of love and of pity.</p>
                  <p>MONTMORENCY, made choice of a ſtrong camp, under the walls of Avignon, at the confluence of the Rhoſne and Durance, one of which plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his troops with all neceſſaries from the inland provinces, and the other covered his camp on that ſide, where it was moſt probable the enemy would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. He laboured with unwearied induſtry to render the fortifications of this camp impregnable, and aſſembled there a conſiderable army, though greatly inferior to that of the enemy; while the King with
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:011837_0712_0F9D8A0D89E0F610"/>
another body of troops encamped at Valence, higher up the Rhoſne. Marſeilles and Arles were the only towns he thought it neceſſary to defend; the former in order to retain the command of the ſea; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the barrier of the province of Languedoc; and each of theſe he furniſhed with numerous garriſons of his beſt troops, commanded by officers, on whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and valour he could rely. The inhabitants of the other towns as well as of the open country, were compelled to abandon their houſes, and were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the mountains, to the camp at Avignon or to the inland provinces. The fortifications of ſuch places as might have afforded ſhelter or defence to the enemy were thrown down. Corn, forage and proviſions of every kind, were carried away or deſtroyed; all the mills and ovens were ruined, and the wells filled up or rendered uſeleſs. The devaſtation extended from the Alps to Marſeilles and from the ſea to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Dauphine; nor does hiſtory afford any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance among civilized nations, in which this cruel expedient for the public ſafety was employed with the ſame rigour.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the Emperor arrived with the van of his army on the frontiers of Provence, and was ſtill ſo poſſeſſed with confidence of ſucceſs, that during a few days, when he was obliged to halt until the reſt of his troops came up, he began to divide his future conqueſts among his officers; and as a new incitement to ſerve him with zeal, gave them liberal promiſes of offices, lands and honours in France <note n="l" place="bottom">Bellay, 266, a.</note>. The face of deſolation, however, which preſented itſelf to him, when he entered the country, could ſcarce fail to damp his hopes; and to convince him that a Monarch, who, in order to diſtreſs an enemy, had voluntarily ruined one of his richeſt provinces, would defend the reſt with obſtinate deſpair. Nor was it long before he became ſenſible, that Francis's plan of defence was as prudent as it appeared extraordinary. His fleet, on which Charles chiefly depended for ſubſiſtence, was prevented for ſome time by contrary winds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidents to which naval operations are ſubject, from approaching the French coaſt; and even after
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:011837_0713_0F9D8A0E52587CC8"/>
its arrival, it afforded at beſt a precarious and ſcanty ſupply to ſuch a numerous body of troops <note n="m" place="bottom">Sandov. ii. 231.</note>; nothing was to be found in the country itſelf for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; nor could they draw conſiderable aid from the dominions of the Duke of Savoy, exhauſted already by maintaining two great armies. The Emperor was no leſs embarraſſed how to employ, than how to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his forces; for, though he was now in poſſeſſion of almoſt an entire province, he could not however be ſaid to have the command of it, while he held only defenceleſs towns; and while the French, beſides their camp at Aviguon, continued maſters of Marſeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Arles. At firſt he thought of attacking the camp, and of determinating the war by one deciſive blow; but ſkilful officers, who were appointed to view it, declared the attempt to be utterly impracticable. He then commanded Marſeilles and Arles to be inveſted, hoping that the French would quit their advantageous poſt in order to relieve them; but Montmorency ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering firmly to his plan, remained immoveable at Avignon, and the Imperialiſts met with ſuch a warm reception from the garriſons of both towns, that they relinquiſhed their enterprize with loſs and diſgrace. As a laſt effort, the Emperor advanced once more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Avignon, tho' with an army harraſſed by the perpetual incurſions of ſmall parties of the French light troops, weakened by diſeaſes, and diſpirited by diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſeemed more intolerable, becauſe they were unexpected.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe operations Montmorency found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expoſed to greater danger from his own troops than from the enemy; and their inconſiderate valour went near to have precipitated the kingdom into theſe calamities, which he with ſuch induſtry and caution had endeavoured to avoid. Unaccuſtomed to behold an enemy ravaging their country almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul; impatient of ſuch long inaction; unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſlow and remote, but certain effects of Montmorency's ſyſtem of defence; the French wiſhed for a battle with no leſs ardour than the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts. They conſidered the conduct of their general as a diſgrace to their country. His caution they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:011837_0714_0F9D8A0F122EB190"/>
to timidity; his circumſpection to want of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and the conſtancy with which he purſued his plan to obſtinacy or pride. Theſe reflections, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, at firſt, among the ſoldiers and ſubalterns, were adopted, by degrees, by officers of higher rank; and as many of theſe envied Montmorency's favour with the King, and more were diſſatisfied with his harſh diſguſting manner, the diſcontent ſoon became great in his camp, which was filled with general mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, and almoſt open complaints againſt his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Montmorency, on whom the ſentiments of his own troops made as little impreſſion as the inſults of the enemy, adhered ſteadily to his ſyſtem; though in order to reconcile the army to his maxims, no leſs contrary to the genius of the nation, than to the ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of war among undiſciplined troops, he aſſumed an unuſual affability in his deportment, and often explained with great condeſcenſion the motives of his conduct, the advantages which had already reſulted from it, and the certain ſucceſs with which it would be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At laſt Francis joined his army at Avignon, which having received ſeveral reinforcements, he now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as of ſtrength ſufficient to face the enemy. As he had put upon himſelf no ſmall conſtraint, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſented that his troops ſhould remain ſo long upon the defenſive, it can ſcarce be doubted but that his fondneſs for what was daring and ſplendid, added to the impatience both of officers and ſoldiers, would have over-ruled Montmorency's ſalutary caution <note n="n" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 269, &amp;c. 312, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAPPILY the retreat of the enemy delivered the kingdom from the danger which any raſh reſolution might have occaſioned. The Emperor, after ſpending two inglorious months in Provence, having perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing ſuitable to his vaſt preparations, or that could juſtify the confidence with which he had boaſted of his own power, found that, beſides Antonio de Leyva, and other officers of diſtincton, he had loſt one half of his troops by diſeaſes, or by famine; and that the reſt were in no condition to ſtruggle any longer with calamities, by which ſo many of their companions had periſhed. Neceſſity, therefore, extorted from him
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:011837_0715_0F9D8A0FCFD40080"/>
orders to retire; and though he was ſome time in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the French ſuſpected his intention, a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of light troops, aſſiſted by crowds of peaſants, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be revenged on thoſe who had brought ſuch deſolation on their country, hung upon the rear of the Imperialiſts, and by ſeizing every favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of attacking them, threw them often into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The road by which they fled, for they purſued their march with ſuch diſorder and precipitation, that it ſcarce deſerves the name of a retreat, was ſtrewed with arms or baggage, which in their hurry and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidation they had abandoned, and covered with the ſick, the wounded, and the dead; inſomuch, that Martin Bellay, an eye-witneſs of their calamities, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to give his readers ſome idea of it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring their miſeries to thoſe which the Jews ſuffered from the victorious and deſtructive arms of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <note n="o" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 316. Sandov. Hiſt. del Emper, ii. 232.</note>. If Montmorency at this critical moment had advanced with all his forces, nothing could have ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Imperial army from utter ruin. But that general, by ſtanding ſo long and ſo obſtinately on the defenſive, had become cautious to exceſs; his mind, tenacious of any bent it had once taken, could not aſſume a contrary one as ſuddenly as the change of circumſtances required; and he ſtill continued to repeat his favourite maxims, that it was more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to allow the lion to eſcape, than to drive him to deſpair, and that a bridge of gold ſhould be made for a retreating enemy.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor having conducted the ſhattered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his troops to the frontiers of Milan, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the marquis del Guaſto to ſucceed Leyva in the government of the dutchy, ſet out for Genoa. As he could not bear to expoſe himſelf to the ſcorn of the Italians, after ſuch a ſad reverſe of fortune; and did not chuſe, under his preſent circumſtances, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſit thoſe cities through which he had ſo lately paſſed in triumph for one conqueſt, and in certain expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another; he embarked directly for Spain <note n="p" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſtor. lib. 35. p. 174, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOR was the progreſs of his arms on the oppoſite frontier of France ſuch as to alleviate in any degree the loſſes which he had ſuſtained in Provence. Bellay
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:011837_0716_0F9D8A108F2A5AD0"/>
by his addreſs and intrigues had prevailed on ſo many of the German Princes to withdraw the contingent of troops which they furniſhed to the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that he was obliged to lay aſide all thoughts of his intended irruption into Champagne. Though a powerful army levied in the Low-Countries entered Picardy, which they found but feebly guarded, while the ſtrength of the Kingdom was drawn towards the ſouth; yet the nobility taking arms with their uſual alacrity, ſupplied by their ſpirit the defects of the King's preparations, and defended with ſuch vigour Peronne, and other towns which were attacked, as obliged the enemy to retire without making any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of importance <note n="q" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 318, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THUS Francis, by the prudence of his own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and by the union and valour of his ſubjects, rendered abortive thoſe vaſt efforts by which his rival had almoſt exhauſted his whole force. As this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Emperor's arrogance no leſs than it checked his power, he was mortified more ſenſibly on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion than on any other, during the courſe of the long conteſts between him and the French Monarch.</p>
                  <p>ONE circumſtance alone embittered the joy with which the ſucceſs of the campaign inſpired Francis. That was the death of the Dauphin, his eldeſt ſon, a Prince of great hopes, and extremely beloved by the people on account of his reſemblance to his father. This happening ſuddenly, was imputed to poiſon, not only by the vulgar, ſond of aſcribing the death of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious perſonages to extraordinary cauſes, but by the King and his miniſters. The count de Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi, an Italian nobleman, cupbearer to the Dauphin, being ſeized on ſuſpicion and put to the torture, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged the Imperial generals, Gonzaga and Leyva, with having inſtigated him to the commiſſion of that crime, and threw out ſome indirect and obſcure accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt the Emperor himſelf. At a time when all France was animated with implacable hatred againſt Charles, this was conſidered as an inconteſtible proof of guilt; while the confidence with which both he
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:011837_0717_0F9D8A11674738B8"/>
and his officers aſſerted their own innocence, together with the indignation and horror which they expreſſed on their being ſuppoſed capable of ſuch a deteſtable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were little attended to, and leſs regarded <note n="r" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, 289.</note>. It is evident however, that the Emperor could have no inducement to perpetrate ſuch a crime, as Francis was ſtill in the vigour of life himſelf, and had two ſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Dauphin, grown up to a good age. That ſingle conſideration, without mentioning the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's general character, unblemiſhed by the imputation of any deed reſembling this in atrocity, is more than ſufficient to counterbalance the weight of a dubious teſtimony uttered during the anguiſh of torture <note n="s" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. del Emper. ii. 231.</note>. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the moſt unprejudiced hiſtorians, the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin's death was occaſioned by his having drunk too freely of cold water after overheating himſelf at ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; and this account, as it is moſt ſimple, is likewiſe the moſt credible. But if his days were cut ſhort by poiſon, it is not improbable that the Emperor conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured rightly, when he affirmed that it had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the direction of Catharine of Medici, in order to ſecure the crown to the Duke of Orleans, her huſband <note n="t" place="bottom">Vera y Zuniga Vida de Carlo V. p. 75.</note>. The advantages reſulting to her by the Dauphin's death, were obvious as well as great; nor did her boundleſs and daring ambition ever ſcruple at any action neceſſary towards attaining the objects which ſhe had in view.</p>
                  <p>NEXT year (1537.) opened with a tranſaction very uncommon, but ſo incapable of producing any effect, that it would not deſerve to be mentioned, if it were not a ſtriking proof of that perſonal animoſity which mingled itſelf in all the hoſtilities between Charles and Francis, and which often betrayed them into ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies towards each other, as leſſened the dignity of both. Francis, accompanied by the peers and princes of the blood, having taken his ſeat in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Paris with the uſual ſolemnities, the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate-general appeared; and after accuſing Charles of Auſtria, (for ſo he affected to call the Emperor) of having violated the treaty of Cambray, by which he
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:011837_0718_0F9D8A140687F770"/>
was abſolved from the homage due to the crown of France for the counties of Artois and Flanders; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that this treaty being now void, he was ſtill to be conſidered as a vaſſal of the crown, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, had been guilty of rebellion in taking arms againſt his ſovereign; and therefore he demanded that Charles ſhould be ſummoned to appear in perſon, or by his counſel, before the parliament of Paris, his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal judges to anſwer for his crime. The requeſt was granted; a herald repaired to the frontiers of Picardy, and ſummoned him, with the accuſtomed formalities to appear againſt a day prefixed. The term being expired, and no perſon appearing in his name, the parliament gave judgment, "That Charles of Auſtria had forfeited by rebellion and contumacy theſe fiefs; declared Flanders and Artois to be re-united to the crown of France; and ordered their decree for this purpoſe to be publiſhed by ſound of trumpet on the frontiers of theſe provinces <note n="u" place="bottom">Lettres et Memoires d'Etat par Ribier, 2. tom. Blois. 1666, tom. i. p. 1.</note>."</p>
                  <p>SOON after this vain diſplay of his reſentment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of his power, Francis marched towards the Low-Countries, as if he intended to execute the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which his parliament had pronounced, and to ſeize thoſe territories which it had awarded to him. As the Queen of Hungary, to whom her brother the Emperor had committed the government of that part of his dominions, was not prepared for ſo early a cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, he at firſt made ſome progreſs, and took ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral towns of importance. But being obliged ſoon to leave his army, in order to ſuperintend the other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of war, the Flemings having aſſembled a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous army, not only recovered moſt of the places which they had loſt, but began to make conqueſts in their turn. At laſt they inveſted Terouenne, and the Duke of Orleans, now Dauphin, by the death of his brother, Montmorency, whom Francis honoured with the conſtable's ſword, as the reward of his great ſervice during the former campaign, determined to hazard a battle in order to relieve it. While they were advancing for this purpoſe, and within a few miles of the enemy, they were ſtopt ſhort by the arrival of an
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:011837_0719_0F9D8A15EDA4BCF8"/>
herald from the Queen of Hungary, acquainting him that a ſuſpenſion of arms was now agreed upon.</p>
                  <p>THIS unexpected event was owing to the zealous endeavours of the two ſiſters, the Queens of France and of Hungary, who had long laboured to reconcile the contending Monarchs. The war in the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands had laid waſte the frontier provinces of both countries, without any real advantage to either; the French and Flemings equally regretted the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their commerce, which was beneficial to both; and Charles and Francis, who had each ſtrained to the utmoſt, in order to ſupport the vaſt operations of the former campaign, found that they could not now keep armies on foot in this quarter, without weakening their operations in Piedmont, where both wiſhed to puſh the war with the greateſt vigour. All theſe circumſtances facilitated the negociations of the two Queens; a truce was concluded, (July 30) to continue in force for ten months, but it extended no farther than the Low-Countries <note n="x" place="bottom">Memoires de Ribier, 56.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN Piedmont the war was ſtill proſecuted with great animoſity; and though neither Charles nor Francis could make the powerful efforts to which their animoſity prompted them, they continued to exert themſelves like combatants, whoſe rancour remains after their ſtrength is exhauſted. Towns were alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loſt and retaken; ſkirmiſhes were fought every day; and much blood was ſhed, without any deciſive action, that gave the ſuperiority to either ſide. At laſt the two Queens determining not to leave unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good work which they had begun, prevailed by their importunate ſollicitations, the one on her brother, the other on her huſband, to conſent alſo to a truce in Piedmont for three months, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that each ſhould keep poſſeſſion of what was in his hands, and leaving garriſons in the towns, withdraw his army out of the province; and that plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould be appointed to adjuſt all matters in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute by a final treaty <note n="y" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier, 62.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE powerful motives which inclined both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:011837_0720_0F9D8A17E9BF3D98"/>
to this accommodation, have been often mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The expences of the war had far exceeded the ſums which their revenues were capable of ſupplying, nor durſt they venture upon any great addition to the impoſitions then eſtabliſhed, as ſubjects were not yet taught to bear with patience the immenſe burthens to which they have become accuſtomed in modern times. The Emperor, in particular, though he had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed debts which in that age appeared prodigious <note n="z" place="bottom">Ribier, i. 294.</note>, had it not in his power to pay the large arrears which had been long due to his army. At the ſame time he had no proſpect of deriving any aid in money or men either from the Pope or Venetians, though he had employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed promiſes and threats, alternately, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. But he found the former fixed in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of adhering ſteadily to the neutrality which he had always declared to be ſuitable to his character, and paſſionately deſirous of bringing about a peace. He perceived that the latter were ſtill intent on their ancient object of holding the balance even between the rivals, and ſollicitous not to throw too great a weight into either ſcale.</p>
                  <p>WHAT made a deeper impreſſion on Charles than all theſe, was the dread of the Turkiſh arms, which Francis had drawn upon him by his league with Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Though Francis, without the aſſiſtance of a ſingle ally, had a war to maintain againſt an enemy greatly ſuperior in power to himſelf, yet ſo great was the horror of Chriſtians, in that age, at any union with Infidels, which they conſidered not only as diſhonourable but profane, that it was long before he could be brought to avail himſelf of the obvious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages reſulting from ſuch a confederacy. Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at laſt ſurmounted his delicacy and ſcruples; and towards the cloſe of the preceding year, La Foreſt, a ſecret agent at the Ottoman porte, had concluded a treaty with the Sultan, whereby Solyman engaged to invade, next campaign, the kingdom of Naples, and to attack the King of the Romans in Hungary with a powerful army, while Francis undertook to enter the Milaneſe at the ſame time with a proper force. Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:011837_0721_0F9D8A1811404A50"/>
had punctually performed what was incumbent on him. Barbaroſſa with a great fleet appeared on the coaſt of Naples, filled that kingdom, from which all the troops had been drawn towards Piedmont, with conſternation, landed without reſiſtance near Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too, obliged Caſtro, a place of ſome ſtrength, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, plundered the adjacent country, and was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſures for ſecuring and extending his conqueſts, when the unexpected arrival of Doria, together with the Pope's gallies, and a ſquadron of the Venetian fleet, made it prudent for him to retire. In Hungary the progreſs of the Turks was more formidable. Mahmet, their general, after gaining ſeveral ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, defeated the Germans in a great battle at Eſſek on the Drave<note n="a" place="bottom">Iſtnanhaffi Hiſt. Hung. lib. xiii. p. 139.</note>. Happily for Chriſtendom, it was not in Francis's power to execute with equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs what he had ſtipulated; nor could he aſſemble at this juncture an army ſtrong enough to penetrate into the Milaneſe. By this he failed in recovering poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that dutchy; and Italy was not only ſaved from the calamities of a new war, but from feeling as an addition to all that it had ſuffered the deſolating rage of the Turkiſh arms <note n="b" place="bottom">Jovii. Hiſtor. lib. xxxv, p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>83.</note>. As the Emperor knew that he could not long reſiſt the efforts of two ſuch powerful confederates, nor could expect that the ſame fortunate accidents would concur a ſecond time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Naples, and to preſerve the Milaneſe: As he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the Italian ſtates would not only tax him loudly with inſatiable ambition, but might even turn their arms againſt him, if he ſhould be ſo regardleſs of their danger as obſtinately to protract the war, he thought it neceſſary, both for his ſafety and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to give his conſent to a truce. Nor was Francis willing to ſuſtain all the blame of obſtructing the re-eſtabliſhment of peace, or to expoſe himſelf on that account to the danger of being deſerted by the Swiſs and other foreigners in his ſervice. He even began to apprehend that his own ſubjects would ſerve him coldly, if by contributing to aggrandize the power of the Infidels, which it was his duty, and had been the
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:011837_0722_0F9D8A18C9EE28F8"/>
ambition of his anceſtors to depreſs, he continued to act in direct oppoſition to all the principles which ought to influence a Monarch diſtinguiſhed by the title of Moſt Chriſtian King. He choſe, for all theſe reaſons, rather to run the riſque of diſobliging his new ally the Sultan, than, by an unſeaſonable adherence to the treaty with him, to forfeit what was of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                  <p>BUT though both parties conſented to a truce, the plenipotentiaries found inſuperable difficulties in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the articles of a definitive treaty. Each of the Monarchs, with the arrogance of a conqueror, aimed at giving law to the other; and neither would ſo far acknowledge his inferiority, as to ſacrifice any point of honour, or to relinquiſh any matter of right; ſo that the plenipotentiaries ſpent the time in long and fruitleſs negociations, and ſeparated after agreeing to prolong the truce for a few months.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, however, did not deſpair of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing a point in which the plenipotentiaries had fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took upon himſelf the ſole burden of negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating a peace. To form a confederacy capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Chriſtendom from the formidable inroads of the Turkiſh arms, and to concert effectual meaſures for the extirpation of the Lutheran hereſy, were two great objects which Paul had much at heart, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the union of the Emperor with the King of France as an eſſential preliminary to both. To be the inſtrument of reconciling theſe contending Monarchs, whom his predeceſſors by their intereſted and indecent intrigues had ſo often embroiled, was a circumſtance which could not fail of throwing diſtinguiſhed luſtre on his character and adminiſtration. Nor was he without hopes that while he purſued this laudable end, he might ſecure advantages to his own family, the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing of which he did not neglect, though he aimed at it with a leſs audacious ambition than was common among the Popes of that century. Influenced by theſe conſiderations, he propoſed an interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Monarchs at Nice, and offered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither in perſon, that he might act as mediator in compoſing all their differences. When a Pontiff of a

venerable character, and of very advanced age, was willing, from his zeal for peace, to undergo the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of ſuch a diſtant journey, neither Charles nor Francis could with decency decline the interview. But though both came to the place of rendezvous, ſo great was the difficulty of adjuſting the ceremonial, or ſuch the remains of diſtruſt and rancour on each ſide, that they refuſed to ſee one another, and every thing was tranſacted by the intervention of the Pope, who viſited them alternately. Nor could he, with all his zeal and ingenuity, find out any method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the obſtcales, particularly thoſe ariſing from the poſſeſſion of the Milaneſe, which prevented a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal accommodation; nor was all the weight of his authority, ſufficient to overcome the obſtinate perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of either Monarch in aſſerting his own claims. At laſt, that he might not ſeem to have laboured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without effect, he prevailed on them to ſign a truce for ten years, (June 18) upon the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the former, that each ſhould retain what was now in his poſſeſſion, and in the mean time ſhould ſend ambaſſadors to Rome, to diſcuſs their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at leiſure <note n="c" place="bottom">Recueil des Traitez, ii. 210.

                  <p>THUS ended a war of no long continuance, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extenſive in its operations, and in which both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties exerted their utmoſt ſtrength. Tho' Francis fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the object that he had principally in view, the recovery of the Milaneſe, he acquired, nevertheleſs, great reputation by the wiſdom of his meaſures, as well as the ſucceſs of his arms in repulſing a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble invaſion; and by ſecuring poſſeſſion of one half of the Duke of Savoy's dominions, he added no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable acceſſion to his kingdom. Whereas, Charles, repulſed and baffled, after having boaſted ſo arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of victory, purchaſed an inglorious truce, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing an ally who had raſhly confided too much in his friendſhip and power.

Of all his dominions, Nice, with its dependencies, was the only corner of which he himſelf kept poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſaw the reſt divided between a powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, and the ally to whoſe protection he had truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while he remained a ſad monument of the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of weak Princes, who by taking part in the quarrel of mighty neighbours, between whom they happen to be ſituated, are cruſhed and overwhelmed in the ſhock.</p>
                  <p>A FEW days after ſigning the treaty of truce, the Emperor ſet ſail for Barcelona, but was driven by contrary winds to the iſland St. Margaret on the coaſt of Provence. When Francis, who happened to be not far diſtant, heard of this, he conſidered it as an office of civility, to invite him to take ſhelter in his dominions, and propoſed a perſonal interview with him at Aigues-mortes. The Emperor, who would not be outdone by his rival in complaiſance, inſtantly repaired thither. As ſoon as he caſt anchor in the road, Francis, without waiting to ſettle any point of ceremony, but relying implicitly on the Emperor's honour for his ſecurity, viſited him on board his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and was received and entertained with the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt demonſtrations of eſteem and affection. Next day, the Emperor repaid the confidence which the King had placed in him. He landed at Aigues-mortes with as little precaution, and met with a reception equally cordial. He remained on ſhore during the night, and in both viſits, they vied with each other in expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reſpect and friendſhip <note n="d" place="bottom">Sandov.

But the hiſtory of theſe Monarchs abounds
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:011837_0725_0F9D8A1B29BF7448"/>
with ſuch ſurprizing tranſitions. From implacable enmity, they appeared to paſt, in a moment, to the moſt cordial reconcilement; from ſuſpicion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, to perfect confidence; and from practiſing all the dark arts of a deceitful policy, they could aſſume, of a ſudden, the liberal and open manners of two gallant gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, beſides the glory of having reſtored peace to Europe, gained, according to his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a point of great conſequence to his family, by prevailing on the Emperor to betroth Margaret of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria his natural daughter, formerly the wife of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander de Medici, to his grandſon Octavio Farneſe, and in conſideration of this marriage, to beſtow ſeveral honours and territories upon his future ſon-in-law. A very tragical event, which happened about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year one thouſand five hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven, had deprived Margaret of her firſt huſband. That young prince, whom the Emperor's partiality had raiſed to the ſupreme power in Florence, upon the ruins of the publick liberty, neglected entirely the cares of government, and abandoned himſelf to the moſt diſſolute debauchery. Lorenzo de Medici his neareſt kinſman, was not only the companion but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of his pleaſures, and employing all the powers of a cultivated and inventive genius in this diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miniſtry, added ſuch elegance and variety to vice as gained him an abſolute aſcendant over the mind of Alexander. But while Lorenzo ſeemed to be ſunk in Luxury, and affected ſuch an appearance of indolence and effeminacy, that he would not wear a ſword, and trembled at the ſight of blood, he concealed under that diſguiſe, a dark, deſigning, audacious ſpirit. Prompted either by the love of liberty, or allured by the hope of attaining the ſupreme power, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to aſſaſſinate Alexander his benefactor and friend. Though he long revolved this deſign in his mind, his reſerved and ſuſpicious temper prevented him from communicating it to any perſon whatever; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to live with Alexander in their uſual familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he, one night, under pretence of having ſecured him an aſſignation with a lady of high rank, whom-
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:011837_0726_0F9D8A1BE9E92BF8"/>
he had often ſolicited, drew that unwary Prince into a ſecret apartment of his houſe, and there ſtabbed him, while he lay careleſsly on a couch, expecting the arrival of the lady whoſe company he had been promiſed. But no ſooner was the deed done, than ſtanding aſtoniſhed, and ſtruck with horror at its atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he forgot, in a moment, all the motives which had induced him to commit it, and, inſtead of rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people to recover their liberty, by publiſhing the death of the tyrant, inſtead of taking any ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards opening his own way to the dignity now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, he locked the door of the apartment, and, like a man bereaved of reaſon and preſence of mind, fled with the utmoſt precipitation out of the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine territories. It was late next morning before the fate of the unfortunate Prince was known, as his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, accuſtomed to his irregularities, never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his apartment early. Immediately the chief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſtate aſſembled. Being induced partly by the zeal of cardinal Cibo for the houſe of Medici, to which he was nearly related, partly by the authority of Francis Guicciardini, who recalled to their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and repreſented in ſtriking colours, the caprice as well as turbulence of their ancient popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they agreed to place Coſmo di Medici, a youth of eighteen, the only male heir of that illuſtrious houſe, at the head of the government; though at the ſame time ſuch was their love of liberty, that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſeveral regulations in order to circumſcribe and moderate his power.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE Lorenzo having reached a place of ſafety, made known what he had done, to Philip Strozzi and the other Florentines who had been driven into exile, or who had voluntarily retired, when the republican form of government was aboliſhed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make way for the dominion of the Medici. By them, the deed was extolled with extravagant praiſes, and the virtue of Lorenzo was compared with that of the elder Brutus, who diſregarded the ties of blood, or with that of the younger, who forgot the friendſhip and favours of the tyrant, that they might preſerve or
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:011837_0727_0F9D8A1C915DD4D0"/>
recover the liberty of their country <note n="e" place="bottom">Lettere di Principi, tom. iii. p. 52.</note>. Nor did they reſt ſatisfied with empty panegyricks; they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately quitted their different places of retreat, aſſembled forces, animated their vaſſals and partizans to take arms, and to ſeize this opportunity of re-eſtabliſhing the publick liberty on its ancient foundation. Being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly aſſiſted by the French ambaſſador at Rome, and ſecretly encouraged by the Pope, who bore no good will to the houſe of Medici, they entered the Florentine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions with a conſiderable body of men. But the perſons who had elected Coſmo poſſeſſed both the means of ſupporting his government, and abilities to employ them in the moſt proper manner. They levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the greateſt expedition, a good number of troops; they endeavoured by every art, to gain the citizens of greateſt authority, and to render the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the young prince agreeable to the people. Above all, they courted the Emperor's protection, as the only firm foundation of Coſmo's dignity and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Charles, knowing the propenſity of the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines to the friendſhip of France, and how much all the partizans of a republican government deteſted him as the oppreſſor of their liberties, ſaw it to be greatly for his intereſt to prevent the re-eſtabliſhment of the ancient conſtitution in Florence. For this reaſon, he not only acknowledged Coſmo as head of the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſtate, and conferred on him all the titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with which Alexander had been dignified, but engaged to defend him to the utmoſt; and as a pledge of this, ordered the commanders of ſuch of his troops as were ſtationed on the frontiers of Tuſcany, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him againſt all aggreſſors. By their aid, Coſmo obtained an eaſy victory over the exiles, whoſe troops he ſurprized in the night-time, and took moſt of the chiefs priſoners; an event which broke all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and fully eſtabliſhed his own authority. But though he was extremely deſirous of the additional ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of marrying the Emperor's daughter, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his predeceſſor, Charles, ſecure already of his
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:011837_0728_0F9D8A1D496DF4A8"/>
attachment, choſe rather to gratify the Pope by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing her on his nephew <note n="f" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſt. c. xcviii. p. 218, &amp;c. Belcarii Comment. l. 22. p. 696. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria de ſui tempi di Giov. Bat. Adrian. Ven. 1587. p. 10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING the war between the Emperor and Francis, an event had happened which abated in ſome degree the warmth and cordiality of friendſhip which had long ſubſiſted between the latter and the King of England. James the fifth of Scotland, an enterprizing young Prince, having heard of the Emperor's intention to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Provence, and being fond of ſhewing that he did not yield to any of his anceſtors in the ſincerity of his attachment to the French crown, as well as eager to diſtinguiſh himſelf by ſome military exploit, levied a body of troops with an intention of leading them in perſon to the aſſiſtance of the King of France. Though ſome unfortunate accident prevented his carrying any troops into France, nothing could divert him from going thither in perſon. Immediately upon his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he haſtened to Provence, but had been detained ſo long in his voyage that he could not have any ſhare in the military operations, and he met the King on his return after the retreat of the Imperialiſts, (January 1, 1537.) Francis, greatly pleaſed with his zeal, and no leſs with his manners and converſation, could not refuſe him his daughter Magdalen, whom he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in marriage. It mortified Henry extremely to ſee a Prince of whom he was lately become jealous, after having long treated him and his ſubjects with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, form an alliance, from which he derived ſuch an acceſſion both of reputation and ſecurity <note n="g" place="bottom">Hiſt. of Scotland, vol. i. p. 77.</note>. He could not, however, with decency oppoſe Francis's beſtowing his daughter upon a Monarch deſcended from a race of Princes, the moſt ancient and faithful allies of the French crown. But when James, upon the ſudden death of Magdalen, demanded as his ſecond wife Mary of Guiſe, he warmly ſolicited Francis to deny his ſuit, and in order to diſappoint him aſked that lady in Marriage for himſelf. When Francis preferred the Scottiſh King's ſincere courtſhip to his artful and malevolent propoſal, he diſcovered much
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:011837_0729_0F9D8A208661E558"/>
diſſatisfaction. The pacification agreed upon at Nice, and the familiar interview of the two rivals at Aigues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortes, filled Henry's mind with new ſuſpicions, as if Francis had altogether renounced his friendſhip for the ſake of new connections with the Emperor. Charles, thoroughly acquainted with the temper of the Engliſh King, and watchful to obſerve all the ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and caprices of his paſſions, thought this a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opportunity of renewing his negociations with him, which had long been broken off. By the death of Queen Catherine, whoſe intereſt the Emperor could not with decency have abandoned, the chief cauſe of their diſcord was removed; ſo that without touching upon the delicate queſtion of her divorce, he might now take what meaſures he thought moſt effectual for regaining Henry's good will. For this purpoſe, he began with propoſing ſeveral marriage-treaties to the King. He offered his niece, a daughter of the King of Denmark, to Henry himſelf; he demanded the Princeſs Mary for one of the Princes of Portugal, and was even willing to recieve her as the King's ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate daughter <note n="h" place="bottom">Mem, de Ribier, t. i 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>6</note>. Though none of theſe projected alliances ever took place, or perhaps were ever ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intended, they occaſioned ſuch frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the courts, and ſo many reciprocal profeſſions of civility and eſteem, as conſiderably abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the edge of Henry's rancour againſt the Emperor, and paved the way for that union between them which afterwards proved ſo diſadvantageous to the French King.</p>
                  <p>THE ambitious ſchemes in which the Emperor had been engaged, and the wars he had been carrying on for ſome years proved, as uſual, extremely favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the progreſs of the reformation in Germany. While Charles was abſent upon his African expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or intent on his vaſt projects againſt France, his chief object in Germany was to prevent the diſſenſions about religion from diſturbing the publick tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by granting ſuch indulgence to the Proteſtant Princes as might induce them to concur with his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or at leaſt hinder them from taking part with
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:011837_0730_0F9D8A2206E12778"/>
his rival. For this reaſon, he was careful to ſecure to the Proteſtants the poſſeſſion of all the advantages which they had gained by the articles of pacification at Nuremberg, in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-two <note n="i" place="bottom">Du Mont Corps Diplom. tom. iv. part 2. p. 138.</note>; and except ſome ſlight trouble from the proceedings of the Imperial chamber, they met with nothing to diſturb them in the exerciſe of their religion, or to interrupt the ſucceſsful zeal with which they propagated their opinions. Meanwhile the Pope continued his negociations for convoking a general council; and though the Proteſtants had expreſſed great diſſatisfaction with his intention to fix upon Mantua as the place of meeting, he adhered obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his choice, iſſued a bull on the ſecond of June, one thouſand five hundred and thirty-ſix, appointing it to aſſemble in that city on the twenty-third of May the year following; he nominated three cardinals to preſide in his name; enjoined all Chriſtian Princes to countenance it by their authority, and invited the prelates of every nation to attend in perſon. This ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a council, an aſſembly which from its nature and intention demanded quiet times, as well as paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic diſpoſitions, at the very juncture, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was on his march towards France, and ready to involve a great part of Europe in the confuſions of war, appeared to every perſon extremely unſeaſonable. It was intimated, however, to all the different courts by nuncios diſpatched of purpoſe <note n="k" place="bottom">Pallavie. Hiſt. Conc. Trid. 113.</note>. The Emperor, with an intention to gratify the Germans, had, during his reſidence at Rome, warmly ſolicited the Pope to call a council; but being at the ſame time willing to try every art in order to perſuade Paul to depart from the neutrality which he preſerved between him and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, he ſent Heldo his vice chancellor along with the nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio whom the Pope employed in Germany, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſecond all the nuncio's repreſentations, and to enforce them with the whole weight of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial authority (February 25, 1537). The Proteſtants gave them audience at Smalkalde, where they had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in a body, in order to receive them. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:011837_0731_0F9D8A23088C56D8"/>
weighing all their arguments, they unanimouſly refuſed to acknowledge a council ſummoned in the name and by the authority of the Pope alone; in which he aſſumed the ſole right of preſiding; which was to be held in a city not only far diſtant from Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, but ſubject to a Prince, a ſtranger to them, and cloſely connected with the court of Rome, and to which their Divines could not repair with ſafety, eſpecially after their doctrines had been ſtigmatized in the very bull of convocation with the name of hereſy. Theſe and many other objections againſt the council, which appeared to them unanſwerable, they enumerated in a large manifeſto, which they publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vindication of their conduct <note n="l" place="bottom">Sli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AGAINST this the court of Rome exclaimed as a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant proof of their obſtinacy and preſumption, and the Pope ſtill perſiſted in his reſolution to hold the council at the time and in the place appointed. But ſome unexpected difficulties being ſtarted by the Duke of Mantua, both about the right of juriſdiction over thoſe who reſorted to the council, and the ſecurity of his capital amidſt ſuch a concourſe of ſtrangers, the Pope, after fruitleſs endeavours to adjuſt theſe, firſt prorogued the council for ſome months, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards transferring the place of meeting to Vicenza in the Venetian territories, appointed it to aſſemble on the firſt of May in the following year. As neither the Emperor nor the French King, who had not then come to any accommodation would permit their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to repair thither, not a ſingle prelate appeared on the day prefixed, and the Pope, that his authority might not become altogether contemptible by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ineffectual intimations, put off the meeting by an indefinitive prorogation <note n="m" place="bottom">F. Paul, 117. Pallavic. 117.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, that he might not ſeem to have turned his whole attention towards a reformation which he was not able to accompliſh, while he neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which was in his power, he deputed a certain number of cardinals and biſhops with full authority to inquire into the abuſes and corruptions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man court; and to propoſe the moſt effectual method
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:011837_0732_0F9D8A234E6CA850"/>
of removing them (1538). This ſcrutiny, undertaken with reluctance, was carried on ſlowly and with remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All defects were touched with a gentle hand, afraid of probing too deep, or of diſcovering too much. But even by this partial examination, many irregularities were detected, and many chormities expoſed to light, while the remedies which they ſuggeſted as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were either inadequate, or were never applied. The report and reſolutions of theſe deputies, though intended to be kept ſecret, were tranſmitted by ſome accident into Germany, and being immediately made publick, afforded ample matter for reflection and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the Proteſtants <note n="n" place="bottom">Sleidan, 233.</note>. On the one hand they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the neceſſity of a reformation in the head as well as the members of the church, and even point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out many of the corruptions againſt which Luther and his followers had remonſtrated with the greateſt vehemence. They ſhewed on the other hand, that it was vain to expect this reformation from eccleſiaſticks themſelves, who, as Luther ſtrongly expreſſed it, pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled at curing warts, while they overlooked or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ulcers <note n="o" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 164.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE earneſtneſs with which the Emperor ſeemed, at firſt, to preſs their acquieſcing in the Pope's ſcheme of holding a council in Italy, having alarmed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes ſo much, that they thought it prudent to ſtrengthen their confederacy, by admitting ſeveral new members who ſolicited that privilege, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King of Denmark; Heldo, who during his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in Germany, had obſerved all the advantages which they derived from that union, endeavoured to counterbalance its effects by an alliance among the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick powers of the Empire (1539.) This league, diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Holy,</hi> was merely defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and though concluded by Heldo in the Emperor's name, was afterwards diſowned by him, and ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by very few Princes <note n="p" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 171.

                  <p>THE Proteſtants ſoon got intelligence of this aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, notwithſtanding all the endeavours of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties to conceal it; and their zeal, always
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:011837_0733_0F9D8A2418C840E8"/>
apt to ſuſpect and to dread, even to exceſs, every thing that ſeemed to threaten religion, inſtantly took the alarm, as if the Emperor had been juſt ready to enter upon the execution of ſome formidable plan for the extirpation of their opinions. In order to diſappoint this, they held frequent conſultations; they courted the Kings of France and England with great aſſiduity, and even began to think of raiſing the reſpective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents both in men and money, which they were obliged to furniſh by the treaty of Smalkalde. But it was not long before they were convinced, that theſe apprehenſions were without foundation, and that the Emperor, to whom repoſe was abſolutely neceſſary, after being exhauſted by efforts beyond his ſtrength in the war with France, had no thoughts of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tranquillity of Germany. As a proof of this, his ambaſſadors, at an interview with the Proteſtant Princes in Francfort, (April 19) agreed that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions in their favour, particularly thoſe contained in the pacification of Nuremberg, ſhould continue in force for fifteen months; that during this period, all proceedings of the Imperial chamber againſt them ſhould be ſuſpended; that a conference ſhould be held by a few divines of each party, in order to diſcuſs the points in controverſy, and to propoſe articles of accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhould be laid before the next diet. Though the Emperor that he might not irritate the Pope, who remonſtrated againſt the firſt part of this agreement as impolitick, and againſt the latter, as an impious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon his prerogative, never formally ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified this convention, it was obſerved with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exactneſs, and greatly ſtrengthened the baſis of that eccleſiaſtical liberty, for which the Proteſtants contended <note n="q" place="bottom">F.

                  <p>A FEW days after the convention at Francfort, (A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 24) happened the death of George Duke of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, an event of great advantage to the Reformation. That Prince, the head of the Albertine or younger branch of the Saxon family, poſſeſſed, as marquis of Miſnia and Thuringia, extenſive territories, comprehending Dreſden. Leipſick, and other cities now the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

in the electorate. From the firſt dawn of the Reformation, he had been its enemy as avowedly, as the electoral Princes were its protectors, and had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on his oppoſition not only with all the zeal flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from religious prejudices, but with a virulence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by perſonal antipathy to Luther, and imbittered by the domeſtick animoſity, ſubſiſting between him and the other branch of his family. By his death without iſſue, his ſucceſſion fell to his brother Henry, whoſe attachment to the Proteſtant religion, ſurpaſſed, if poſſible, that of his predeceſſor to popery. Henry no ſooner took poſſeſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

By their advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, he overturned, in a few weeks, the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of antient rites, eſtabliſhing the full exerciſe of the reformed religion, with the univerſal applauſe of his ſubjects, who had long wiſhed for this change, which the authority of their Duke alone had hitherto prevented <note n="r" place="bottom">Sleidan, 249.</note>. This revolution delivered the Proteſtants from the danger to which they were expoſed, by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inveterate enemy ſituated in the middle of their territories; and their dominions now extended in one great and almoſt unbroken line, from the ſhore of the Baltick to the banks of the Rhine.</p>
                  <p>SOON after the concluſion of the Truce at Nice, an event happened, which ſatisfied all Europe, that Charles had proſecuted the war to the utmoſt extremity, that the ſtate of his affairs would permit. Vaſt arrears were due to his troops, whom he had long amuſed with vain hopes and promiſes. As they now foreſaw that little attention would be paid to their demands, when by the re-eſtabliſhment of peace, their ſervices became of leſs importance, they loſt all patience, broke out into open mutiny, and declared, that they thought themſelves entitled to ſeize by violence, what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them contrary to all juſtice. Nor was this
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:011837_0735_0F9D8A259DA54778"/>
ſpirit of ſedition confined to one part of the Emperor's dominions; the mutiny was almoſt as general as the grievance which gave riſe to it. The ſoldiers in the Milaneſe, plundered the open country without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, and filled the capital itſelf with conſternation. Thoſe in garriſon at Goletta, threatned to give up that important fortreſs to Barbaroſſa. In Sicily, the troops proceeded to ſtill greater exceſſes; having chaſed away their officers, they elected others in their ſtead, defeated a body of men whom the viceroy ſent againſt them, took and pillaged ſeveral cities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting themſelves all the while, in ſuch a manner, that their operations reſembled rather the regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of a concerted rebellion, than the raſhneſs and violence of a military mutiny. But by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and prudence of the generals, who, partly by borrowing money in their own name, or in that of their maſter, partly by extorting large ſums from the cities in their reſpective provinces, raiſed what was ſufficient to diſcharge the arrears of the ſoldiers, theſe inſurrections were quelled. The greater part of the troops being diſbanded, ſuch a number only as was neceſſary for garriſoning the principal towns, and protecting the ſea coaſts from the inſults of the Turks, was kept in pay <note n="s" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſtor. l. xxxvii, 203. c.

                  <p>IT was happy for the Emperor, that the abilities of his generals extricated him out of theſe difficulties, which it exceeded his own power to have removed. He had depended, as his chief reſource for diſcharging the arrears due to his ſoldiers, upon the ſubſidies which he expected from his Caſtilian ſubjects. For this purpoſe, he aſſembled the Cortes of Caſtile at To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, and having repreſented to them the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his military operations, together with the vaſt debts in which theſe had neceſſarily involved him, he propoſed to levy ſuch ſupplies as the preſent exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his affairs demanded, by a general exciſe on commodities. But the Spaniards who already felt themſelves oppreſſed with a load of taxes unknown to their anceſtors, and who had often complained that
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:011837_0736_0F9D8A28F014E620"/>
their country, in order to proſecute quarrels in which it was not intereſted, and to fight battles from which it could reap no benefit, was drained not only of its wealth but of its inhabitants, determined not to add voluntarily to their own burthens, or to furniſh the Emperor with the means of engaging in new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes no leſs ruinous to the kingdom than moſt of thoſe which he had hitherto carried on. The nobles, in particular, inveighed with great vehemence againſt the impoſition propoſed, as an encroachment upon the valuable and diſtinguiſhing privilege of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that of being exempted from the payment of any tax. They demanded a conference with the the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the cities concerning the ſtate of the nation. They contended that if Charles would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example of his predeceſſors, who had reſided conſtantly in Spain, and would avoid entangling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a multiplicity of tranſactions foreign to the concerns of his Spaniſh dominions, the ſtated revenues of the crown would be fully ſufficient to defray the neceſſary expences of government. They repreſented to him that it would be unjuſt to lay new burthens upon the people, while this prudent and effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of re-eſtabliſhing public credit, and ſecuring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional opulence, was totally neglected <note n="t" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. vol. ii. 269.</note>. Charles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter employing arguments, entreaties and promiſes, but without ſucceſs, in order to overcome their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, diſmiſſed the aſſembly with great indignation. From that period neither the nobles nor the prelates have been called to theſe aſſemblies, on pretence that ſuch as pay no part of the public taxes, ſhould claim no vote in laying them on. None have been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Cortes but the procurators or repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of eighteen cities. Theſe to the number of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſix, being two from each community, form an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly which bears no reſemblance either in power or dignity or independence to the ancient Cortes, and are abſolutely at the devotion of the court in all their determinations <note n="u" place="bottom">Sandov. ibid. La Science du Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, par M. de Real, tom. ii. p. 102.</note>. Thus the imprudent zeal with which the Caſtilian nobles had ſupported the regal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:011837_0737_0F9D8A2A001D6758"/>
in oppoſition to the claims of the commons, during the commotions in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty-one, proved at laſt fatal to their own body. By enabling Charles to depreſs one of the orders in the ſtate, they deſtroyed that balance to which the conſtitution owed its ſecurity, and put it in his power and that of his ſucceſſors to humble the other, and to ſtrip it of its moſt valuable privileges.</p>
                  <p>AT that time, however, the Spaniſh grandees ſtill poſſeſſed extraordinary power as well as privileges, which they exerciſed and defended with an haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs peculiar to themſelves. Of this the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had a mortifying proof, during the meeting of the Cortes at Toledo. As he was returning one day from a tournament, accompanied by moſt of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, one of the ſerjeants of the court, out of officious zeal to clear the way for the Emperor, ſtruck the Duke of Infantado's horſe with his batton, which that haughty grandee reſenting, drew his ſword, beat and wounded the officer. Charles, provoked at ſuch an inſolent deed in his preſence, immediately ordered Ronquillo, the judge of the court, to arreſt the Duke; Ronquillo advanced to execute his charge, when the conſtable of Caſtile interpoſing, checked him, claimed the right of juriſdiction over a grandee as a privilege of his office, and conducted Infanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to his own apartment. All the nobles preſent were ſo pleaſed with the boldneſs of the conſtable in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rights of their order, that deſerting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, they attended him to his houſe with infinite applauſes, and Charles returned to the palace without any perſon along with him but the cardinal Tavera. The Emperor, how ſenſible ſoever of the affront, ſaw the danger of irritating a jealous and high-ſpirited or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, whom the ſlighteſt appearance of offence might drive to the moſt unwarrantable extremes. For that reaſon, inſtead of ſtraining at any ill-timed exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his prerogative, he prudently connived at the arrogance of a body too potent for him to controul, and ſent next morning to the Duke of Infantado, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to inflict what puniſhment he pleaſed on the perſon who had affronted him. The Duke conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:011837_0738_0F9D8A2A13C80A88"/>
this as a full reparation to his honour, inſtantly forgave the officer; beſtowing on him, beſides, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable preſent as a compenſation for his wound. Thus the affair was entirely forgotten <note n="x" place="bottom">Sandov. 11. 274. Ferreras, ix. 212. Miniana, 113.</note>; nor would it have deſerved to be mentioned, if it were not a ſtriking example of the haughty and independent ſpirit of the Spaniſh nobles in that age, as well as an inſtance of the Emperor's dexterity in accommodating his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the circumſtances in which he was placed.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES was far from diſcovering any ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion or lenity towards the citizens of Ghent, who not long after broke out into open rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his government. An event which happened in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-ſix, gave occaſion to this raſh inſurrection ſo fatal to that flouriſhing city. At that time the Queen dowager of Hungary, governeſs of the Netherlands, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders from her brother to invade France with all the forces ſhe could raiſe, ſhe aſſembled the States of the united Provinces, and obtained from them a ſubſidy of twelve hundred thouſand florins, to defray the expence of that undertaking. Of this ſum, the county of Flanders was obliged to pay a third part as its proportion. But the citizens of Ghent, the moſt conſiderable city in that country, averſe to a war with France with which they carried on an extenſive and gainful commerce, refuſed to pay their quota, and contended that in conſequence of ſtipulations between them and the anceſtors of their preſent ſovereign the Emperor, no tax could be levied upon them, unleſs they had given their expreſs conſent to the impoſition of it. The governeſs, on the other hand, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as the ſubſidy of twelve hundred thouſand flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins had been granted by the States of Flanders, of which their repreſentatives were members, they were bound, of courſe, to conform to what was enacted by them, as it is the firſt principle in ſociety, on which the tranquillity and order of government depend, that the inclinations of the minority muſt be over-ruled by the judgment and deciſion of the ſuperior number.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="unknown:011837_0739_0F9D8A2ACD800E00"/>THE citizens of Ghent, however, were not willing to relinquiſh a privilege of ſuch high importance as that which they claimed. Having been accuſtomed, under the government of the houſe of Burgundy, to enjoy extenſive immunities, and to be treated with much indulgence, they diſdained to ſacrifice to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated power of a regent thoſe rights and liberties which they had often and ſucceſsfully aſſerted againſt their greateſt Princes. The Queen, though ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at firſt to ſooth them, and to reconcile them to their duty by various conceſſions, was at laſt ſo much irritated by the obſtinacy with which they adhered to their claim, that ſhe ordered all the citizens of Ghent, on whom ſhe could lay hold in any part of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, to be arreſted. But this raſh action made an impreſſion very different from what ſhe expected on men, whoſe minds were agitated with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions which indignation at oppreſſion and zeal for liberty inſpire. Leſs affected with the danger of their friends and companions, than irritated at the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, they openly deſpiſed her authority, and ſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to the other towns of Flanders, conjuring them not abandon their country at ſuch a juncture, but to concur with them in vindicating its rights againſt the encroachments of a woman, who either did not know or did not regard their immunities. All but a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable towns declined entering into any confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy againſt the governeſs; however, they joined in petitioning her to put off the term for payment of the tax ſo long, that they might have it in their power to ſend ſome of their number into Spain, in order to lay their title to exemption before their ſovereign. This ſhe granted with ſome difficulty. But Charles receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their commiſſioners with an haughtineſs to which they were not accuſtomed from their ancient Princes, and enjoining them to yield the ſame reſpectful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his ſiſter, which they owed to him in perſon, remitted the examination of their claim to the council of Malines. This court, which is properly a ſtanding committee of the parliament or ſtates of the county, and which poſſeſſes the ſupreme juriſdiction in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                  <p>ENRAGED at this deciſion, which they conſidered as notoriouſly unjuſt, and rendered deſperate on ſeeing their rights betrayed by that very court which was bound to protect them, the people of Ghent ran to arms in a tumultuary manner, drove ſuch of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as reſided among them out of the city; ſecured ſeveral of the Emperor's officers; put one of them to the torture, whom they accuſed of having ſtolen or deſtroyed the record, that contained the privileges of exemption from taxes which they pleaded; choſe a council to whom they committed the direction of their affairs; gave orders for repairing and adding to their fortifications; and openly erected the ſtandard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their ſovereign <note n="z" place="bottom">Memoires ſur la revolte de Gantois en 1539, par Jean d'Hollander, ecrit en 1547.

Senſible, however, of their inability to ſupport what their zeal had prompted them to undertake, and deſirous of ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a protector againſt the formidable forces by which they might expect ſoon to be attacked, they ſent ſome of their number to Francis, offering not only to acknowledge him as their ſovereign, and to put him in immediate poſſeſſion of Ghent, but to aſſiſt him with all their forces in recovering thoſe provinces in the Netherlands, which had antiently belonged to the crown of France, and had been ſo lately re-united to it by the decree of the parliament of Paris. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected propoſition coming from perſons who had it in their power to have performed inſtantly one part of what they undertook, and who could contribute ſo effectually towards the execution of the whole, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vaſt as well as alluring proſpects to Francis's ambition. The counties of Flanders and Artois were of greater value than the dutchy of Milan, which he had ſo long laboured to acquire with paſſionate but fruitleſs deſire; their ſituation with reſpect to France
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:011837_0741_0F9D8A2C9E5EA880"/>
rendered it more eaſy to conquer or to defend them; and they might be formed into a ſeparate principality for the Duke of Orleans, no leſs ſuitable to his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than that which his father aimed at obtaining. From this, the Flemings, who were acquainted with the French manners and government, would not have been averſe; and his own ſubjects, weary of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive expeditions into Italy, would have turned their arms towards this quarter with more good will, and with greater vigour. Several conſiderations, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, prevented Francis from laying hold of this opportunity, the moſt favourable in appearance which had ever preſented itſelf, of extending his dominions or diſtreſſing the Emperor. From the time of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview at Aigues-mortes, Charles had continued to court the King of France with wonderful attention; and often flattered him with hopes of gratifying at laſt his wiſhes concerning the Milaneſe, by granting the inveſtiture of it either to him or to one of his ſons. But though theſe hopes and promiſes were thrown out with no other intention than to detach him from his confederacy with the grand Seignior, or to raiſe ſuſpicions in Solyman's mind by the appearance of a cordial and familiar intercourſe ſubſiſting between the courts of Paris and Madrid, Francis was weak enough to catch at the ſhadow by which he had been ſo often deceived, and from eagerneſs to ſeize it, relinquiſhed what muſt have proved a more ſubſtantial acquiſition. Beſides this, the Dauphin jealous to exceſs of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and unwilling that a Prince who ſeemed to be of a reſtleſs and enterprizing nature ſhould obtain an eſtabliſhment, which from its ſituation might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered almoſt as a domeſtick one, made uſe of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency, who by a ſingular piece of good fortune, was at the ſame time the favourite of the father and of the ſon, to defeat the application of the Flemings and to divert the King from eſpouſing their cauſe. Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency repreſented accordingly the reputation and power which Francis would acquire by recovering that footing which he had formerly in Italy, and that nothing could be ſo efficacious to overcome the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's averſion to this, as his adhering ſacredly to the
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:011837_0742_0F9D8A2D551BCB18"/>
truce, and refuſing on this occaſion to countenance his rebellious ſubjects. Francis, apt of himſelf to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rate the value of the Milaneſe, becauſe he eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it from the length of time as well as from the great efforts which he had employed in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer it, and fond of every action which had the appearance of generoſity, aſſented without difficulty to ſentiments ſo agreeable to his own, rejected the propoſitions of the citizens of Ghent, and diſmiſſed their deputies with an harſh anſwer <note n="a" place="bottom">Mem. de Bellay, p. 263. P. Heuter. Rer, Auſtr. lib. xi. 263.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOT ſatisfied with this, by a farther refinement in generoſity, he communicated to the Emperor his whole negociation with the malecontents, and all that he knew of their ſchemes and intentions <note n="b" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſtor. tom. ii. 282.</note>. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of Francis's dinſintereſtedneſs relieved Charles from the moſt diſquieting apprehenſions, and opened a way to extricate himſelf out of all difficulties. He had already received full information of all the tranſactions in the Netherlands, and of the rage with which the people of Ghent had taken arms againſt his government. He was thoroughly acquainted with the genius and qualities of his ſubjects in that country; their love of liberty; their attachment to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent privileges and cuſtoms; as well as the invincible obſtinacy with which their minds, ſlow but firm and perſevering, adhered to any meaſure on which they had leiſure to fix. He eaſily ſaw what encouragement and ſupport they would have derived from the aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of France; though now free from any danger on that quarter, he was ſtill ſenſible that ſome immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and vigorous interpoſition was neceſſary in order to prevent the ſpirit of diſaffection and rebellion from ſpreading in a country where the number of cities, the multitude of people, together with the great wealth diffuſed among them by commerce, rendered it pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly formidable, and would ſupply it with exhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſources. No expedient, after long deliberation, appeared to him ſo effectual as his going in perſon to the Netherlands; and the governeſs his ſiſter being of the ſame opinion, warmly ſolicited him to undertake
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:011837_0743_0F9D8A2DCB0BC628"/>
the journey. There were only two different routs which he could take; one by land through Italy and Germany, the other, entirely by ſea, from ſome port in Spain to one in the Low-Countries. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was more tedious than ſuited the preſent exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his affairs; nor could he in conſiſtency with his dignity or even his ſafety paſs through Germany with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a train both of attendants and of troops, as would have added greatly to the time that he muſt have conſumed in his journey; the latter was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at this ſeaſon, and not to be ventured upon, while he was on bad terms with the King of England, unleſs under the convoy of a powerful fleet. This perplexing ſituation, in which he was under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of chuſing, and did not know what to chuſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him at laſt with the ſingular and ſeemingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant thought of paſſing through France, as the moſt expeditious way of reaching the Netherlands. He propoſed in his council to demand Francis's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for that purpoſe. All his counſellors joined with one voice in condemning the meaſure as no leſs raſh than unprecedented, and which muſt infallibly expoſe him to diſgrace or to danger; to diſgrace if the demand were rejected in the manner that he had reaſon to expect; to danger, if he put his perſon in the power of an enemy whom he had often offended, who had ancient injuries to revenge, as well as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of preſent conteſt ſtill remaining undecided. But Charles who had ſtudied the character of his rival with greater care, and more profound diſcernment than any of his miniſters, perſiſted in his plan, and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf that it might be accompliſhed not only without danger to his own perſon, but even without the expence of any conceſſion detrimental to his crown.</p>
                  <p>WITH this view he communicated the matter to the French ambaſſador at his court, and ſent Granvelle his chief miniſter to Paris, in order to obtain from Francis permiſſion to paſs through his dominions, and to promiſe that he would ſoon ſettle the affair of the Milaneſe to his ſatisfaction; but at the ſame time to intreat that he would not exact any new promiſe, or
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:011837_0744_0F9D8A2E8F2DE128"/>
even inſiſt on former engagements, at this juncture, leſt whatever he ſhould grant, under his preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, might ſeem rather to be extorted by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, than to flow from friendſhip or the love of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Francis, inſtead of attending to the ſnare which ſuch a ſlight artifice ſcarce concealed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> dazzled with the ſplendour of overcoming an enemy by acts of generoſity, and ſo pleaſed with the air of ſuperiority, which the rectitude and diſintereſtedneſs of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings gave him on this occaſion, that he at once aſſented to all that was demanded. Judging of the Emperor's heart by his own, he imagined that the ſentiments of gratitude, ariſing from the remembrance of good offices and liberal treatment, would determine him more forcibly to fulfill what he had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, than the moſt preciſe ſtipulations that could be inſerted in any treaty.</p>
                  <p>UPON this, Charles, to whom every moment was precious, ſet out, notwithſtanding the fears and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of his Spaniſh ſubjects, with a ſmall but ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did train of an hundred perſons. At Bavonne, on the frontiers of France, he was received by the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin and the Duke of Orleans, attended by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Montmorency, The two Princes offered to go into Spain, and to remain there as hoſtages for the Emperor's ſafety; but this he rejected, declaring, that he relied with implicit confidence on the King's honour, and had never demanded, nor would accept of any other pledge for his ſecurity. In all the towns through which he paſſed, the greateſt poſſible magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence was diſplayed; the magiſtrates preſented him the keys of the gates; the priſon doors were ſet open; and by the royal honours paid to him, he appeared more like the ſovereign of the country, than a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The King advanced as far as Chatelherault to meet him; their interview was diſtinguiſhed by the warmeſt expreſſions of friendſhip and regard.

                  <p>CHARLES remained ſix days at Paris; but amidſt the perpetual careſſes of the French court, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious entertainments contrived to amuſe or to do him honour, he diſcovered an extreme impatience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his journey, ariſing as much from an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger which conſtantly oppreſſed him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſcious of the diſingenuity of his own intentions, he trembled when he reflected, that ſome fatal accident might betray them to his rival, or lead him to ſuſpect them; and though his artifices to conceal theſe ſhould be ſucceſsful, he could not help fearing that motives of intereſt, might at laſt triumph over the ſcruples of honour, and tempt Francis to avail himſelf of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage now in his hands. Nor were there wanting perſons among the French miniſters, who adviſed the King to turn his own arts againſt the Emperor, and as the retribution due for ſo many inſtances of fraud or falſehood, to ſeize and detain his perſon, till he granted him full ſatisfactson with regard to all the juſt claims of the French crown, (1540). But no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration could induce Francis to violate the faith which he had pledged, nor could any argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him, that Charles, after all the promiſes that he had given, and all the favours which he had received, might ſtill be capable of deceiving him. Full of this falſe confidence, he accompanied him to St. Quintin, and the two Princes, who had met him on the borders of Spain, did not take leave of him, until he entered his dominions in the Low-Countries.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as the Emperor reached his own territories (January 24) the French ambaſſadors demanded the accompliſhment of what he had promiſed, concerning the inveſtiture of Milan, but Charles, under the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretext, that his whole attention was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by the conſultations neceſſary towards ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the rebellion in Ghent, put off the matter for ſome time.

The near approach of danger made them, at laſt, ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their own folly, that they ſent ambaſſadors to the Emperor imploring his mercy, and offering to ſet open their gates at his approach. Charles without vouchſafing them any other anſwer, than that he would appear among them, as their ſovereign, with the ſceptre and the ſword in his hand, began his march at the head of his troops. Though he choſe to enter the city on the twenty-fourth of February, his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he was touched with nothing of that tenderneſs or indulgence, which was natural towards the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Cambray, 1719, tom. i. p. 169.</note>, and in order to bridle the ſeditious ſpirit of the citizens a ſtrong citadel was appointed to be erected, for defraying the expence of which a fine of an hundred and fifty thouſand florins

By theſe rigorous proceedings, Charles not only puniſhed the citizens of Ghent, but ſet an awful example of ſeverity before his other ſubjects in the Netherlands, whoſe immunities and privileges, partly the effect, partly the cauſe of their extenſive commerce, circumſcribed the royal prerogative within very narrow bounds, and often ſtood in the way of meaſures which he wiſhed to undertake, or fettered and retarded him in his operations.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES having thus vindicated and re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his authority in the Low-Countries, and being now under no neceſſity of continuing the ſame ſcene of falſehood and diſſimulation with which he had long amuſed Francis, began gradually to throw aſide the veil under which he had concealed his intentions with reſpect to the Milaneſe. At firſt, he eluded the demands of the French ambaſſadors, when they again reminded him of his promiſes; then he propoſed, by way of equivalent for the dutchy of Milan, to grant the Duke of Orleans the inveſtiture of Flanders, clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the offer, however, with impracticable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſuch as he knew would be rejected <note n="d" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier, i. 509. 514.</note>. At laſt, being driven from all his evaſions and ſubterfuges by their inſiſting on a categorical anſwer, he peremptorily refuſed to give up a territory of ſuch value, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to make ſuch a liberal addition to the ſtrength of an enemy, by diminiſhing his own power <note n="e" place="bottom">Ribier, i. 519.</note>.

                  <p>OF all the actions in the emperor's life, this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, reflects the greateſt diſhonour on his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note n="g" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſt. lib. xxxix. p. 238. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tho' Charles was not extremely ſcrupulous at other times about the means which he employed for accompliſhing his ends, or always obſervant of the ſtrict precepts of veracity and honour, he had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to maintained ſome regard for the maxims of that leſs

preciſe and rigid morality by which monarchs think themſelves entitled to regulate their conduct. But, on this occaſion, the ſcheme that he formed of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a generous and open-hearted Prince; the illiberal and mean artifices by which he carried it on; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility with which he received all the marks of his friendſhip, and the ingratitude with which he requit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; are all equally unbecoming the dignity of his character, and inconſiſtent with the grandeur of his views.</p>
                  <p>THIS tranſaction expoſed Francis to as much ſcorn as it did the Emperor to cenſure. After the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a long reign, after ſo many opportunities of diſcovering the duplicity and artifices of his rival, the credulous ſimplicity with which he truſted him at this juncture ſeemed to merit no other return than it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally met with. Francis, however, remonſtrated and exclaimed, as if this had been the firſt inſtance in which the Emperor had deceived him. Feeling, as is uſual, the inſult which was offered to his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill more ſenſibly than the injury done to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he diſcovered ſuch reſentment as made it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that he would lay hold on the firſt opportunity of being revenged, and that a war, no leſs rancorous than that which had ſo lately raged, would ſoon break out anew in Europe.</p>
                  <p>THIS year is rendered memorable by the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the order of Jeſuits; a body whoſe influence on eccleſiaſtical as well as civil affairs hath been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that an account of the genius of its laws and government juſtly merits a place in hiſtory. When men take a view of the rapid progreſs of this ſociety towards wealth and power; when they contemplate the admirable prudence with which it has been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; when they attend to the perſevering and ſyſtematick ſpirit with which its ſchemes have been carried on; they are apt to aſcribe ſuch a ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to the ſuperior wiſdom of its founder, and to ſuppoſe that he had formed and digeſted his plan with profound policy. But the Jeſuits, as well as the other monaſtic orders, are indebted for the exiſtence of their order not to the wiſdom of their founder, but to his

enthuſiaſm. Ignatio Loyola, whom I have already mentioned on occaſion of the wound which he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in defending Pampeluna <note n="h" place="bottom">Book ii. p. 84.</note>, was a fanatick diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by extravagancies in ſentiment and conduct, no leſs incompatible with the maxims of ſober reaſon, than repug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>PROMPTED by this fanatical ſpirit, or incited by the love of power and diſtinction, from which ſuch pretenders to ſuperior ſanctity are not exempt, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola was ambitious of becoming the founder of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious order. The plan which he formed of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and laws, was ſuggeſted, as he gave out, and as his followers ſtill teach, by the immediate inſpiration of heaven <note n="i" place="bottom">Compte rendu des Conſtitutions des Jeſuites, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Pope, to whom Loyola had applied for the ſanction of his authority to confirm the inſtitution, referred his petition to a committee of Cardinals. They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the eſtabliſhment to be unneceſſary as well as dangerous, and Paul refuſed to grant his approbation of it.

                     </gap>y, and of monaſtic obedience, which are common to all monaſtic orders, the members of his ſociety ſhould take a fourth vow of obedience to the Pope, binding themſelves to go whitherſoever he ſhould command for the ſervice of religion, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any thing from the Holy See for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. At a time when the papal authority had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a ſhock by the revolt of ſo many nations from the Romiſh church; at a time when every part of the popiſh ſyſtem was attacked with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſucceſs, the acquiſition of a body of men, thus peculiarly devoted to the ſee of Rome, and whom
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:011837_0750_0F9D8A3432B2DDD8"/>
it might ſet in oppoſition to all its enemies, was an object of the higheſt conſequence. Paul inſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this, confirmed the inſtitution of the Jeſuits by his bull (September 27;) granted the moſt ample pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges to the members of the ſociety; and appointed Loyola to be the firſt general of the order. The event had fully juſtified Paul's diſcernment, in expecting ſuch beneficial conſequences to the ſee of Rome from this inſtitution. In leſs than half a century, the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety obtained eſtabliſhments in every country that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the Roman catholic church; its power and wealth increaſed amazingly; the number of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers became great; their character and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſtill greater; and the Jeſuits were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the friends, and dreaded by the enemies of the Romiſh faith, as the moſt able and enterprizing order in the church.</p>
                  <p>THE conſtitution and laws of the ſociety were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Laynez and Aquavia, the two generals who ſucceeded Loyola, men far ſuperior to their maſter in abilities, and in the ſcience of government. They framed that ſyſtem of profound and artful policy which diſtinguiſhed the order. The large infuſion of fanaticiſm, mingled with its regulations, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Loyola its founder. Many circumſtances concurred in giving a peculiarity of character to the order of Jeſuits, and in forming the members of it not only to take greater part in the affairs of the world than any other body of monks, but to acquire ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or influence in the conduct of them.</p>
                  <p>THE primary object of almoſt all the monaſtic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is to ſeparate men from the world, and from any concern in its affairs. In the ſolitude and ſilence of the cloiſter, the monk is called to work out his own ſalvation by extraordinary acts of mortification and piety. He is dead to the world, and ought not to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in its tranſactions. He can be of no benefit to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but by his example and by his prayers. On the contrary, the Jeſuits are taught to conſider themſelves as formed for action. They are choſen ſoldiers, bound to exert themſelves continually in the ſervice of God, and of the Pope, his vicar on earth. Whatever tends
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:011837_0751_0F9D8A35327F94F0"/>
to inſtruct the ignorant; whatever can be of uſe to reclaim or to oppoſe the enemies of the Holy See, is their proper object. That they may have full leiſure for this active ſervice, they are totally exempted from thoſe functions, the performance of which is the chief buſineſs of other monks. They appear in no proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they practiſe no rigorous auſterities; they do not conſume one half of their time in the repetition of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious offices <note n="k" place="bottom">Compte Rendu, par M. de Monclar. p. 13. 290. Sur la deſtruct. des Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, par M. D'Alembert, p. 42.</note>. But they are required to attend to all the tranſactions of the world, on account of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which theſe may have on religion; they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to ſtudy the diſpoſitions of perſons in high rank, and to cultivate their friendſhip <note n="l" place="bottom">Compte par M. de Monclar. p. 12.</note>; and by the very conſtitution as well as genius of the order, a ſpirit of action and intrigue is infuſed into all its members.</p>
                  <p>AS the object of the ſociety of Jeſuits differed from that of the other monaſtic orders, the diverſity was no leſs in the form of its government. The other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are to be conſidered as voluntary aſſociations, in which whatever affects the whole body, is regulated by the common ſuffrage of all its members. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power is veſted in the perſons placed at the head of each convent, or of the whole ſociety; the legiſlative authority reſides in the community. Affairs of moment, relating to particular convents, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in conventual chapters; ſuch as reſpect the whole order are conſidered in general congregations. But Loyola, full of the ideas of implicit obedience, which he had derived from his military profeſſion, appointed that the government of his order ſhould be purely monarchial. A General, choſen for life by the deputies from the ſeveral provinces, poſſeſſed power that was ſupreme and independent, extending to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon, and to every caſe. He, by his ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority nominated provincials, rectors, and every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officer employed in the government of the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and could remove them at pleaſure. In him was veſted the ſovereign adminiſtration of the revenues and funds of the order. Every member belonging to it was at his diſpoſal; and by his uncontroulable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:011837_0752_0F9D8A354DAD7ED0"/>
he could impoſe on them any taſk, or employ them in what ſervice ſoever he pleaſed. To his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they were required to yield not only outward obedience, but to reſign up to him the inclinations of their own wills, and the ſentiments of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. They were to liſten to his injunctions, as if they had been uttered by Chriſt himſelf. Under his direction, they were to be mere paſſive inſtruments, like clay in the hands of the potter, or like dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes incapable of reſiſtance <note n="m" place="bottom">Compte rendu au Parlem. de Bretagne, par M. de Chalotais, p. 41, &amp;c. Compte par M. de Monclar. 83. 185. 334.</note>. Such a ſingular form of policy could not fail to impreſs its character on all the members of the order, and to give a peculiar force to all its operations. There is not in the annals of mankind any example of ſuch a perfect deſpotiſm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed not over monks ſhut up in the cells of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, but over men diſperſed among all the nations of the earth.</p>
                  <p>AS the conſtitutions of the order veſt, in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſuch abſolute dominion over all its members, they carefully provide for his being perfectly informed with reſpect to the character and abilities of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Every novice who offers himſelf as a candidate for entering into the order, is obliged to <hi>manifeſt his conſcience</hi> to the ſuperior, or to a perſon appointed by him: and is required to confeſs not only his ſins and defects, but to diſcover the inclinations, the paſſions, and the bent of his ſoul. This manifeſtation muſt be renewed every ſix months <note n="n" place="bottom">Compte par M. de Monclar. p. 121, &amp;c.</note>. The ſociety not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with penetrating in this manner into the innermoſt receſſes of the heart, directs each member to obſerve the words and actions of the novices; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſpies upon their conduct; and are bound to diſcloſe every thing of importance concerning them to the ſuperior. In order that this ſcrutiny into their character may be as compleat as poſſible, a long no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viciate muſt expire, during which they paſs through the ſeveral gradations of ranks in the ſociety, and they muſt have attained the full age of thirty three years, before they can be admitted to take the final vows, by

By theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious methods, the ſuperiors, under whoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſpection the novices are placed, acquire a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough knowledge of their diſpoſitions and talents. In order that the General, who is the ſoul that animates and moves the whole ſociety, may have under his eye every thing neceſſary to inform or direct him, the provincials and heads of the ſeveral houſes are obliged to tranſmit to him regular and frequent reports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the members under their inſpection.

                  <p>AS it was the profeſſed intention of the order of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits to labour with unwearied zeal in promoting the ſalvation of men, this engaged them, of courſe, in many active functions.

The novelty of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as the ſingularity of its objects procured the Order many admirers and patrons.

Before the expiration of the ſixteenth century, the Jeſuits had obtained the chief direction of the education of youth in every catholic country in Europe. They had become the confeſſors of almoſt all its monarchs, a function of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in any reign, but under a weak Prince, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior even to that of miniſter. They were the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guides of almoſt every perſon eminent for rank or power. They poſſeſſed the higheſt degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and intereſt with the papal court, as the moſt zealous and able champions for its authority. The advantages which an active and enterprizing body of men might derive from all theſe circumſtances are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. They formed the minds of men in their youth. They retained an aſcendant over them in their advanced years. They poſſeſſed, at different periods, the direction of the moſt conſiderable courts in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. They mingled in all affairs. They took part in every intrigue and revolution. The General, by means of the extenſive intelligence which he received, could regulate the operations of the order with the moſt perfect diſcernment, and by means of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power could carry them on with the utmoſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and effect <note n="r" place="bottom">When Lovola in the year 1540 petitioned the Pope to authorize the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the order, he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>TOGETHER with the power of the order, its wealth continued to increaſe. Various expedients were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for eluding the obligation of the vow of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

The order acquired ample poſſeſſions in every ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic country; and by the number as well as magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of its publick buildings, together with the value of its property, moveable or real, it vied with the moſt opulent of the monaſtic fraternities. Beſides the ſources of wealth common to all the regular cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the Jeſuits poſſeſſed one which was peculiar to themſelves. Under pretext of promoting the ſucceſs of their miſſions, and of facilitating the ſupport of their miſſionaries, they obtained a ſpecial licence from the court of Rome, to trade with the nations which they laboured to convert. In conſequence of this, they engaged in an extenſive and lucrative commerce, both in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies. They opened ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in different parts of Europe, in which they vended their commodities. Not ſatisfied with trade alone, they imitated the example of other commercial ſocieties, and aimed at obtaining ſettlements. They acquired poſſeſſion accordingly of a large and fertile province in the ſouthern continent of America, and reigned as ſovereigns over ſome hundred thouſand ſubjects. <note n="s" place="bottom">Hiſt. des Jeſ. iv. 168—196, &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>UNHAPPILY for mankind, the vaſt influence which the order of Jeſuits acquired by all theſe different means, has been often exerted with the moſt penicious effect. Such was the tendency of that diſcipline ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the ſociety in forming its members, and ſuch the fundamental maxims in its conſtitution, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Jeſuit was taught to regard the intereſt of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as the capital object, to which every conſideration was to be ſacrificed. This ſpirit of attachment to their order, the moſt ardent, perhaps, that ever influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any body of men <note n="t" place="bottom">Compte par M. de Moncl. p. 285.</note>, is the characteriſtic principle of the Jeſuits, and ſerves as a key to the genius of their policy, and to the peculiarities in their ſentiments and conduct.</p>
                  <p>AS it was for the honour and advantage of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that its members ſhould poſſeſs an aſcendant over perſons in high rank or of great power, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of acquiring and preſerving ſuch a direction of
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:011837_0756_0F9D8A3857A16C58"/>
their conduct, with greater facility, has led the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its to propagate a ſyſtem of relaxed and pliant mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which accommodates itſelf to the paſſions of men, which juſtifies their vices, which tolerates their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, which authorizes almoſt every action that the moſt andacious or crafty politician would wiſh to perpetrate.</p>
                  <p>AS the proſperity of the order was intimately connected with the preſervation of the papal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Jeſuits, influenced by the ſame principle of attachment to the intereſts of their ſociety, have been the moſt zealous patrons of thoſe doctrines, which tend to exalt eccleſiaſtical power on the ruins of civil government. They have attributed to the court of Rome a juriſdiction as extenſive and abſolute as was claimed by the moſt preſumptuous pontiffs in the dark ages. They have contended for the entire indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of eccleſiaſticks on the civil magiſtrate. They have publiſhed ſuch tenets concerning the duty of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Princes who were enemies of the catholic faith, as countenanced the moſt atrocious crimes, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſſolve all the ties which connect ſubjects with their rulers.</p>
                  <p>AS the order derived both reputation and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the zeal with which it ſtood forth in defence of the Romiſh church againſt the attacks of the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, its members, proud of this diſtinction, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it as their peculiar function to combat the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and to check the progreſs of the Proteſtants. They have made uſe of every art, and have employed every weapon againſt them. They have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in oppoſition to every gentle or tolerating mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their favour. They have inceſſantly ſtirred up againſt them all the rage of eccleſiaſtical and civil perſecution.</p>
                  <p>MONKS of other denominations have, indeed, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to teach the ſame pernicious doctrines, and have held opinions equally inconſiſtent with the order and happineſs of civil ſociety. But they, from reaſons which are obvious, have either delivered ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with greater reſerve, or have propagated them with leſs ſucceſs. Whoever recollects the events which
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:011837_0757_0F9D8A391D52C278"/>
have happened in Europe during two centuries, will find that the Jeſuits may juſtly be conſidered as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for moſt of the pernicious effects ariſing from that corrupt and dangerous caſuiſtry, from thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant tenets concerning eccleſiaſtical power, and from that intolerant ſpirit, which have been the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the church of Rome throughout that period, and which have brought ſo many calamities upon ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety <note n="u" place="bottom">Encyclopedie, Art, <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> tom. viii. 513.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT amidſt many bad conſequences flowing from the inſtitution of this order, mankind, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, have derived from it ſome conſiderable advantages. As the Jeſuits made the education of youth one of their capital objects, and as their firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to eſtabliſh colleges for the reception of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents were violently oppoſed by the univerſities in different countries, it became neceſſary for them, as the moſt effectual method of acquiring the publick fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to ſurpaſs their rivals in ſcience and induſtry. This prompted them to cultivate with great ardour the ſtudy of ancient literature. This put them upon various methods for facilitating the inſtruction of youth; and by the improvements which they made in it, they have contributed not a little towards the progreſs of polite learning, and have on this account me rited well of ſociety. Nor has the order of Jeſuits been ſucceſsful only in teaching the elements of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it has produced likewiſe eminent maſters in many branches of ſcience, and can alone boaſt of a greater number of ingenious authors, than all the other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fraternities taken together <note n="x" place="bottom">M. d'Alembert has obſerved that though the Jeſuits have made extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry progreſs in erudition of every ſpecies; though they can reckon up many of their brethren who have been eminent mathematicians, antiquarians, and criticks; though they have even formed ſome orators of reputation; yet the order has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produced one man, whoſe mind was ſo much enlightened with ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to merit the name of a philoſopher. But it ſeems to be the unavoidable effect of monaſtick education to contract and fetter the human mind. The partial attachment of a monk to the intereſt of his order, which is often incompatible with that of other citizens; the habit of implicit obedience to the will of a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, together with the frequent return of the weariſome and frivolous duties of the cloiſter, debaſe his faculties, and extinguiſh that generoſity of ſentiment and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which qualifies men for thinking or feeling juſtly with repect to what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in life and conduct. Father Paul of Venice is, perhaps, the only perſon edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in a cloiſter, that ever was altogether ſuperior to its prejudices, or who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the tranſactions of men, and reaſoned concerning the intereſts of ſociety, with the enlarged ſentiments of a philoſopher, with the diſcernment of a man converſant in affairs, and with the liberality of a gentleman.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="356" facs="unknown:011837_0758_0F9D8A3A01F5C520"/>BUT it is in the new world that the Jeſuits have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the moſt wonderful diſplay of their abilities, and have contributed moſt effectually to the benefit of the human ſpecies. The conquerors of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate quarter of the globe had nothing in view but to plunder, to enſlave, and to exterminate its inhabitants. The Jeſuits alone have made humanity the object of their ſettling there. About the beginning of the laſt century they obtained admiſſion into the fertile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Paraguay, which ſtretches acroſs the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern continent of America, from the bottom of the mountains of Potoſi to the confines of the Spaniſh and Portugueſe ſettlements on the banks of the river de la Plata: they found the inhabitants in a ſtate little different from that which takes place among men when they firſt begin to unite together; ſtrangers to the arts; ſubſiſting precariouſly by hunting or fiſhing; and ſcarce acquainted with the firſt principles of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and government. The Jeſuits ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to inſtruct and to civiliſe theſe ſavages. They taught them to cultivate the ground, to rear tame animals, and to build houſes. They brought them to live together in villages. They trained them to arts and manufactures. They made them taſte the ſweets of ſociety; and accuſtomed them to the bleſſings of ſecurity and order. Theſe people became the ſubjects of their benefactors; who have governed them with a tender attention, reſembling that, with which a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directs his children. Reſpected and beloved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to adoration, a few Jeſuits preſided over ſome hundred thouſand Indians. They maintained a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equality among all the members of the community. Each of them was obliged to labour not for himſelf alone but for the public. The produce of their fields, together with the fruits of their induſtry of every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were depoſited in common ſtorehouſes, from which each individual received every thing neceſſary for the ſupply of his wants. By this inſtitution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the paſſions which diſturb the peace of ſociety,

and render the members of it unhappy, were extin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guiſhed. A few magiſtrates, choſen by the Indians themſelves, watched over the publick tranquillity, and ſecured obedience to the laws. The ſanguinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments frequent under other governments were unknown. An admonition from a Jeſuit; a ſlight mark of infamy; or, on ſome ſingular occaſion, a few laſhes with a whip, were ſufficient to maintain good order among theſe innocent and happy people <note n="y" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Paraguay par Pere de Charlevoix, tom. ii. 42. &amp;c.

                  <p>BUT even in this meritorious effort of the Jeſuits for the good of mankind, the genius and ſpirit of their order have mingled and are diſcernible. They plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aimed at eſtabliſhing in Paraguay an independant empire, ſubject to the ſociety alone, and which, by the ſuperior excellence of its conſtitution and police, could ſcarce have failed to extend its dominion over all the ſouthern continent of America. With this view, in order to prevent the Spaniards or Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe in the adjacent ſettlements, from acquiring any influence over the people whom they governed that might be dangerous, the Jeſuits endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the Indians with hatred and contempt of theſe nations. They cut off all intercourſe between their ſubjects and the Spaniſh or Portugueſe ſettlements. They prohibited any private trader of either nation from entering their territories. When they were obliged to admit any perſon in a publick character from the neighbouring governments, they did not permit him to have any converſation with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and no Indian was allowed even to enter the houſe where theſe ſtrangers reſided, unleſs in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Jeſuit. In order to render any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them as difficult as poſſible, they induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly avoided giving the Indians any knowledge of the Spaniſh or any other European language; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the different tribes, which they had civilized, to acquire a certain dialect of the Indian tongue, and laboured to make that the univerſal language through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their dominions. As all theſe precautions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:011837_0760_0F9D8A3D82ECCF50"/>
military force, would have been inſufficient to have rendered their empire ſecure and permanent, they inſtructed their ſubjects in the European arts of war. They formed them into bodies of cavalry and infantry, completely armed and regularly diſciplined. They provided a great train of artillery, as well as magazines ſtored with all the implements of war. Thus they eſtabliſhed an army ſo numerous and well appointed, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THE Jeſuits gained no conſiderable degree of power during the reign of Charles V. who, with his uſual ſagacity, diſcerned the dangerous tendency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and checked its progreſs <note n="a" place="bottom">Compte par M. de Moncl. p. 312.</note>.

Europe had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, for two centuries, the ambition and power of the order. But while it felt many fatal effects of theſe, it could not fully diſcern the cauſes to which they were to be imputed. It was unacquainted with many of the ſingular regulations in the political conſtitution or government of the Jeſuits, which formed that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of intrigue and enterprize which diſtinguiſhed its members, and elevated the body itſelf to ſuch a height of power. It was a favourite maxim with the Jeſuits, from their firſt inſtitution, not to publiſh the rules of their order. Theſe they kept concealed as an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable myſtery. They never communicated them to ſtrangers; nor even to the greater part of their own members. They refuſed to produce them when required by courts of juſtice <note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſt. des Jeſ. tom. iii. 236, &amp;c.

in policy, the civil power in different countries authorized or connived at the eſtabliſhment of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men, whoſe conſtitution and laws were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed with a ſollicitude, which alone was a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for having excluded them. During the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lately carried on againſt them in Portugal and France, the Jeſuits have been ſo inconſiderate as to produce the myſterious volumes of their inſtitute.

The maxims of an intriguing, ambitious intereſted policy, might influence thoſe who governed the ſociety, and might even corrupt the heart, and pervert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſome individuals, while the greater number, engaged in literary purſuits, or employed in the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion, was left to the guidance of thoſe common principles which reſtrain men from vice, and excite them to what is becoming and laudable. The cauſes which occaſioned the ruin of this mighty body, as well as the circumſtances and effects with which it has been attended in the different countries of Europe, though objects extremely worthy the attention of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intelligent obſerver of human affairs, do not fall within the period of this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner had Charles re-eſtabliſhed order in the
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:011837_0762_0F9D8A3E60EECD28"/>
Low-Countries, than he was obliged to turn his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the affairs of Germany. The Proteſtants preſſed him earneſtly to appoint that conference betwen a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect number of the divines of each party, which had been ſtipulated in the convention at Frankfort. The Pope, conſidering ſuch an attempt to examine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the points in diſpute as derogatory to his right of being the ſupreme judge in controverſy, and perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it would either be ineffectual by determining nothing, or prove dangerous by determining too much, employed every art to prevent the meeting. The Emperor, however, finding it more for his intereſt to ſooth the Germans, than to gratify Paul, paid little regard to his remonſtrances. In a diet held at Haguenaw, matters were ripened for the conference. In another diet aſſembled at Worms, the conference was begun, Melancthon on the one ſide and Eckius on the other, ſuſtaining the principal part in the diſpute; but after they had made ſome progreſs, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concluding any thing, it was ſuſpended by the Emperor's command, Dec. 6, that it might be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with greater ſolemnity in his own preſence in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſummoned to meet at Ratiſbon, 1541. This aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was opened with great pomp, and with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expectation that its proceedings would be vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and deciſive. By the conſent of both parties, the Emperor was entruſted with the power of nominating the perſons who ſhould manage the conference, which it was agreed ſhould be conducted not in the form of a public diſputation, but as a friendly ſcrutiny or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination into the articles which had given riſe to the preſent controverſies. He appointed Eckius, Gropper and Pflug, on the part of the Catholicks, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacthon, Bucer and Piſtorius, on that of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, all men of diſtinguiſhed reputation among their own adherents, and, except Eckius, all eminent for their moderation, as well as deſirous of peace. As they were about to begin their conſultations, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror put into their hands a book, compoſed, as he ſaid, by a learned divine in the Low-Countries, with ſuch extraordinary perſpicuity and temper, as might go far, in his opinion, to unite and comprehend the
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:011837_0763_0F9D8A3F1D42EBC8"/>
two contending parties. Gropper, a canon of Cologne, whom he had named among the managers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, a man of addreſs as well as of erudition, was afterwards ſuſpected to be the author of this ſhort treatiſe. It contained poſitions with regard to twenty-two of the chief articles in theology, which included moſt of the queſtions then agitated in the controverſy between the Lutherans and the church of Rome. By ranging his ſentiments in a natural order, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with great ſimplicity; by employing often the very words of ſcripture, or of the primitive fathers; by ſoftening the rigour of ſome opinions, and explaining away what was abſurd in others; by conceſſions, now on one ſide, and now on the other; and eſpecially by baniſhing as much as poſſible ſcholaſtic phraſes, thoſe words and terms of art in controverſy, which ſerve as badges of diſtinction to the different ſects, and for which theologians often contend more fiercely than for opinions themſelves; he framed his work in ſuch a manner, as promiſed fairer than any thing that had hitherto been attempted, to compoſe and to terminate religious diſſenſions <note n="e" place="bottom">Goldaſt.

                  <p>BUT the attention of the age was turned, with ſuch acute obſervation, towards theological contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, that it was not eaſy to impoſe on it by any gloſs how artful or ſpecious ſoever. The length and eagerneſs of the diſpute had ſeparated the contending parties ſo compleatly, and had ſet their minds at ſuch variance, that they were not to be reconciled by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conceſſions. All the zealous Catholics, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the eccleſiaſtics who had a ſeat in the diet, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in condemning Gropper's treatiſe as too favourable to the Lutheran opinions, the poiſon of which hereſy it conveyed, as they pretended, with greater danger, becauſe it was in ſome degree diſguiſed. The rigid Proteſtants, eſpecially Luther himſelf, and his patron, the Elector of Saxony, were for rejecting it as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious compound of error and truth, craftily prepared that it might impoſe on the weak, the timid, and the unthinking. But the divines, to whom the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:011837_0764_0F9D8A4014E94968"/>
of it was committed, entered upon that buſineſs with greater deliberation and temper. As it was more eaſy in itſelf, as well as more conſiſtent with the dignity of the church to make conceſſions, and even alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with regard to ſpeculative opinions, the diſcuſſion whereof is confined chiefly to ſchools, and which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nothing to the people that either ſtrikes their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or affects their ſenſes, they came to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation about thoſe without much labour, and even defined the great article concerning juſtification to their mutual ſatisfaction. But, when they proceeded to points of juriſdiction, where the intereſt and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Roman See were concerned, or the rites and forms of external worſhip, where every change that could be made muſt be public, and draw the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, there the Catholics were altogether untractable; nor could the church either with ſafety or with honour aboliſh its ancient inſtitutions. All the articles relative to the power of the Pope, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of councils, the adminiſtration of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the worſhip of ſaints, and many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars did not, in their nature, admit of any tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament; ſo that after labouring long to bring about an accommodation with reſpect to theſe, the Emperor found all his endeavours ineffectual. Being impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, however, to cloſe the diet, July 28, he at laſt prevailed on a majority of the members to approve of the following receſs; "That the articles concerning which the divines had agreed in the conference, ſhould be held as points decided, and be obſerved inviolably by all; that the other articles about which they had differed, ſhould be referred to the determination of a general council, or if that could not be obtained, to a national ſynod of Germany; and if it ſhould prove impracticable, likewiſe to aſſemble a ſynod, that a general diet of the Empire ſhould be called with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eighteen months, in order to give ſome final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the whole controverſy; that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſhould uſe all his intereſt and authority with the Pope, to procure the meeting either of a general council or ſynod; that in the mean time, no innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be attempted, no endeavours ſhould be
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:011837_0765_0F9D8A40B4224870"/>
employed to gain proſelytes; and neither the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the church, nor the rights of the monaſteries, ſhould be invaded <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleidan, 267. &amp;c. Pallav. l. 4. c. 11. p. 136. F. Paul, p. 86. Seckend. l. iii. 256.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ALL the proceedings of this diet, as well as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in which they terminated, gave great offence to the Pope. The power which the Germans had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed of appointing their own divines to examine and determine matters of controverſy, he conſidered as a very dangerous invaſion on his rights; the renewing of their ancient propoſal concerning a national ſynod, which had been ſo often rejected by him and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, appeared extremely undutiful; but the bare mention of allowing a diet, compoſed chiefly of laymen, to paſs judgment with reſpect to articles of faith, was deemed no leſs criminal and profane, than the worſt of thoſe hereſies which they ſeemed zealous to ſuppreſs. On the other hand, the Proteſtants were no leſs diſſatisfied with a receſs, which conſiderably abridged the liberty which they enjoyed at that time. As they murmured loudly againſt it, Charles, unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave any ſeeds of diſcontent in the Empire, granted them a private declaration, in the moſt ample terms, exempting them from whatever they thought oppreſſive or injurious in the receſs, and aſcertaining to them the full poſſeſſion of all the privileges which they had ever enjoyed <note n="g" place="bottom">Sleid. 283. Seckend. 366. Dumont Corps Diplom. iv. p. ii, p. 210.</note>.</p>
                  <p>EXTRAORDINARY as theſe conceſſions may appear, the ſituation of his affairs at this juncture made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Emperor to grant them. He foreſaw a rupture with France to be unavoidable, as well as near at hand, and durſt not give any ſuch cauſe of diſguſt or fear to the Proteſtants, as might force them, in ſelf-defence. to court the protection of the French King, from whom, at preſent, they were much alienated. The rapid progreſs of the Turks in Hungary, was a more powerful and preſent cauſe of the moderation which Charles diſcovered. A great revolution had happened in that kingdom; John Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol Scaepus having choſen, as has been related, rather
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:011837_0766_0F9D8A41571A1BB8"/>
to poſſeſs a tributary kingdom, than to renounce the royal dignity to which he had been accuſtomed, had, by the aſſiſtance of his mighty protector Solyman, wreſted from Ferdinand a great part of the country, and left him only the precarious poſſeſſion of the reſt. But being a prince of pacific qualities, the frequent attempts of Ferdinand, or of his partizans among the Hungarians, to recover what they had loſt, gave him great pain; and the neceſſity, on theſe occaſions, of calling in the Turks, whom he conſidered and felt to be his maſters rather than auxiliaries, were ſcarce leſs mortifying. In order, therefore, to avoid theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and to ſecure quiet and leiſure to enjoy the arts and amuſements in which he delighted, he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to an agreement with his competitor, on this condition; That Ferdinand ſhould acknowledge him as King of Hungary, and leave him, during life, the unmoleſted poſſeſſion of that part of the kingdom now in his power; but that, upon his demiſe, the ſole right to the whole ſhould devolve upon Ferdinand <note n="h" place="bottom">Iſluanhaffi Hiſt. Hung. lib. xii p. 135.</note>. As John had never been married, and was then far advanced in life, the terms of the contract ſeemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favourable to Ferdinand. But, ſoon after, ſome of the Hungarian nobles, ſollicitous to prevent a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner from aſcending their throne, prevailed on John to put an end to a long celibacy, by marrying Iſabella, the daughter of Sigiſmond, King of Poland. John had the ſatisfaction, before his death, which happened within leſs than a year thereafter, to ſee a ſon born to inherit his kingdom. To him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding his treaty with Ferdinand, which he conſidered, no doubt, as void, upon an event not foreſeen when it was concluded, he bequeathed his crown; appointing the Queen and George Martinuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi, biſhop of Waradin, guardians of his ſon; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the kingdom. The greater part of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians immediately acknowledged the young King, to whom, in memory of the founder of their monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, they gave the name of Stephen <note n="i" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſt. lib. 39. p. 239, a. &amp;c.</note>.</p>

He ſent ambaſſadors to the Queen to claim poſſeſſion, and to offer the province of Tranſylvania as a ſettlement for her ſon, preparing at the ſame time to aſſert his right by force of arms. But John had committed the care of his ſon to perſons, who had too much ſpirit to give up the crown tamely, and who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed abilities ſufficient to defend it. The Queen, to all the addreſs peculiar to her own ſex, added a maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line courage, ambition, and magnanimity. Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuzzi, who had raiſed himſelf from the loweſt rank in life to his preſent dignity, was one of thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary men, who by the extent as well as variety of their talents, are fitted to act a ſuperior part in buſtling and factious times. In diſcharging the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his eccleſiaſtical office, he put on the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of an humble and auſtere ſanctity. He diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in civil tranſactions, induſtry, dexterity and boldneſs. During war he laid aſide the caſſock, and appeared on horſeback with his ſcymeter and buckler, as active, as oſtentatious, and as gallant as any of his countrymen. Amidſt all theſe different and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory forms which he could aſſume, an inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of dominion and authority was conſpicuous. From ſuch perſons it was obvious what anſwer Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand had to expect. He ſoon perceived that he muſt depend on arms alone for recovering Hungary. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing levied for this purpoſe a conſiderable body of Germans, whom his partizans among the Hungarians joined with their vaſſals, he ordered them to march into that part of the kingdom which adhered to Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen. Martinuzzi, unable to make head againſt ſuch a powerful army in the field, ſatisfied himſelf with holding out the towns, all of which, eſpecially Buda, the place of greateſt conſequence, he provided with every thing neceſſary for defence; and in the mean time he ſent ambaſſadors to Solyman, be ſeeching him to extend towards the ſon, the ſame Imperial protection which had ſo long maintained the father on his throne. The Sultan, though Ferdinand uſed his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:011837_0768_0F9D8A42D5466940"/>
to thwart this negociation, and even offered to accept of the Hungarian crown on the ſame ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious condition of paying tribute to the Ottoman Porte, by which John had held it, ſaw ſuch proſpects of advantage from eſpouſing the intereſt of the young King, that he inſtantly promiſed him his protection; and commanding one army to advance towards Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, he himſelf followed with another. Meanwhile the Germans, hoping to terminate the war by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a city in which the King and his mother were ſhut up, had formed the ſiege of Buda. Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuzzi, having drawn thither the ſtrength of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian nobility, defended the town with ſuch courage and ſkill, as allowed the Turkiſh forces time to come up to his relief. They inſtantly attacked the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, weakened by fatigue, diſeaſes and deſertion, and defeated them with great ſlaughter <note n="k" place="bottom">Iſluanhaffi. hiſt. Hung. lib. 14. p. 150.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SOLYMAN ſoon after joined his victorious troops, and being weary of ſo many expenſive expeditions undertaken in defence of dominions which were not his own, or being unable to reſiſt this alluring opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſeizing a kingdom, while poſſeſſed by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, under the guardianſhip of a woman and a prieſt, he allowed intereſted conſiderations to triumph with too much facility over the principles of honour and the ſentiments of humanity. What he planned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generouſly, he executed by fraud. Having prevailed on the Queen to ſend her ſon, whom he pretended to be deſirous of ſeeing, into his camp, and having at the ſame time invited the chief of the nobility to an entertainment there, while they, ſuſpecting no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, gave themſelves up to the mirth and jollity of the feaſt, a ſelect band of troops by the Sultan's orders ſeized one of the gates of Buda. Being thus maſter of the capital, of the King's perſon and of the leading men among the nobles, he ordered the Queen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her ſon to be conducted to Tranſylvania, which province he allotted to them, and appointing a Baſha to reſide in Buda with a large body of ſoldiers, annexed Hungary to the Ottoman Empire. The tears and complaints of the unhappy Queen had no influence
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:011837_0769_0F9D8A43981AAB68"/>
to change his purpoſe, nor could Martinuzzi either reſiſt his abſolute and uncontroulable command, or prevail on him to recal it <note n="l" place="bottom">Iſluanhaffi. lib. 14 p. 56. Jovii hiſt. lib. 39. p. 2476, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE the account of this violent uſurpation reached Ferdinand he was ſo unlucky as to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched new ambaſſadors to Solyman with a freſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of his right to the crown of Hungary, as well as a renewal of his former overture to hold the kingdom, of the Ottoman Porte, and to pay for it an annual tribute. This ill-timed propoſal was rejected with ſcorn. The Sultan elated with ſucceſs, and thinking that he might preſcribe what terms he pleaſed to a prince who voluntarily profered conditions ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming his own dignity, declared that he would not ſuſpend the operations of war, unleſs Ferdinand inſtantly evacuated all the towns which he held in Hungary, and conſented to the impoſition of a tribute upon Auſtria, in order to reimburſe the ſums, which his preſumptuous invaſion of Hungary had obliged the Ottoman Porte to expend in defence of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="m" place="bottom">Iſluanhaffi. hiſt. Hung. l. 14. p. 158,</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the ſtate of affairs in Hungary. As the unfortunate events there had either happened before the diſſolution of the diet at Ratiſbon, or were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time, Charles ſaw the danger of irritating and inflaming the minds of the Germans, while ſuch a formidable enemy was ready to break into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and perceived that he could not expect any vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſiſtance either towards the recovery of Hungary or the defence of the Auſtrian frontiers, unleſs he courted and ſatisfied the Proteſtants. By the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which have been mentioned, he gained this point, and ſuch liberal ſupplies both of men and money were voted for carrying on the war againſt the Turks, as left him under little anxiety about the ſecurity of Germany during next campaign <note n="n" place="bottom">Sleid. 283.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY upon the concluſion of the diet, the Emperor ſet out for Italy. As he paſſed through Lucca he had a ſhort interview with the Pope, but nothing could be concluded concerning the proper
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:011837_0770_0F9D8A445E0FA9D8"/>
method of compoſing the religious diſputes in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, between two princes whoſe views and intereſt with regard to that matter were at this juncture ſo oppoſite. The Pope's endeavours to remove the cauſes of diſcord between Charles and Francis, and to extinguiſh all thoſe mutual animoſities which threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break out ſuddenly into open hoſtility, were not more ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor's thoughts were bent ſo entirely, at that time, on the great enterprize which he had concerted againſt Algiers, that he liſtened with little attention to the Pope's ſchemes or overtures, and haſtened to join his army and fleet <note n="o" place="bottom">Sandov. hiſtor. tom. ii. 298</note>.</p>
                  <p>ALGIERS ſtill continued in that ſtate of dependence on the Turkiſh empire to which Barbaroſſa had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it. Ever ſince he, as captain Baſha, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ottoman fleet, Algiers had been governed by Haſcen-Aga, a renegado eunuch, who by paſſing through every ſtation in the Corſairs ſervice, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great experience in war, and was well fitted for a ſtation which required a man of tried and daring courage. Haſcen, in order to ſhew how well he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that dignity, carried on his piratical depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Chriſtian ſtates with amazing activity, and out-did, if poſſible, Barbaroſſa himſelf in boldneſs and cruelty. The commerce of the Mediterranean was greatly interrupted by his cruiſers, and ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent alarms given to the coaſts of Spain, that there was a neceſſity of erecting watch-towers at proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and of keeping guards conſtantly on foot, in order to diſcry the approach of his ſquadrons, and to protect the inhabitants from their deſcents <note n="p" place="bottom">Jovii hiſt. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>. p. 266.</note>. Of this the Emperor's ſubjects had long complained, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it as an enterprize correſponding to his power, and becoming his humanity, to reduce Algiers, which ſince the conqueſt of Tunis, was the common recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of all the free booters; and to exterminate that lawleſs race, the implacable enemies of the Chriſtian name. Moved partly by their intreaties, and party allured by the hope of adding to the glory which he had acquired by his laſt expedition into Africa, Charles
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:011837_0771_0F9D8A4508886AF0"/>
before he left Madrid in his way to the Low-Countries, had iſſued orders both in Spain and Italy to prepare a fleet and army for this purpoſe. No change in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſince that time, could divert him from this reſolution, or prevail on him to turn his arms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Hungary; though the ſucceſs of the Turks in that country ſeemed more immediately to require his preſence there; though many of his moſt faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents in Germany urged that the defence of the Empire ought to be his firſt and peculiar care; though ſuch as bore him no good will ridiculed his prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conduct in flying from an enemy almoſt at hand, that he might go in queſt of a remote and more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foe. But to attack the Sultan in Hungary, how ſplendid ſoever that meaſure might appear, was an undertaking which exceeded his power, and was not conſiſtent with his intereſt. To draw troops out of Spain or Italy, to march them into a country ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as Hungary, to provide the vaſt apparatus neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for tranſporting thither the artillery, ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and baggage of a regular army, and to puſh the war in that quarter, where it could ſcarce be brought to any iſſue during ſeveral campaigns, were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings ſo extenſive and unwieldly as did not correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with the low condition of the Emperor's treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. While his principal force was thus employed, his dominions in Italy and the Low-countries muſt have lain open to the French King, who would not have allowed ſuch a favourable opportunity of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to go unimproved. Whereas the African expedition, the preparations for which were already finiſhed and almoſt the whole expence of it defrayed, would depend upon a ſingle effort, and beſides the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and ſatisfiaction which the ſucceſs of it muſt give his ſubjects, would detain him during ſo ſhort a ſpace, that Francis could ſcarce take advantage of his abſence, to invade his dominions in Europe.</p>
                  <p>ON all theſe accounts, Charles adhered to his firſt plan, and with ſuch determined obſtinacy, that he paid no regard to the Pope who adviſed, or to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Doria who conjured him not to expoſe his whole armament to almoſt unavoidable deſtruction, by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:011837_0772_0F9D8A45E5563E28"/>
at ſuch an advanced ſeaſon of the year, and while the autumnal winds were ſo violent, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the dangerous coaſt of Algiers. Having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board Doria's gallies at Porto Venere in the Genoeſe territories, he ſoon found that this experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſailor had not judged wrong concerning the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which he was ſo well acquainted; for ſuch a ſtorm aroſe that it was with the utmoſt difficulty and danger he reached Sardinia, the place of general rendezvous. But as his courage was undaunted, and his temper often inflexible, neither the remonſtrances of the Pope and Doria, nor the danger to which he had already been expoſed by diſregarding them, had any other effect than to confirm him in his fatal reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. The force, indeed, which he had collected was ſuch as might have inſpired a Prince leſs adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, and leſs confident in his own ſchemes, with the moſt ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs. It conſiſted of twenty thouſand foot and two thouſand horſe, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, Italians and Germans, moſtly veterans, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with three thouſand volunteers, the flower of the Spaniſh and Italian nobility, fond of paying court to the Emperor by attending him in this favourite expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and eager to ſhare in the glory which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he was going to reap; to theſe were added a thouſand ſoldiers ſent from Malta by the order of St. John, led by an hundred of its moſt gallant Knights.</p>
                  <p>THE voyage, from Majorca to the African coaſt, was not leſs tedious, or full of hazard, than that which he had juſt finiſhed. When he approached the land, the roll of the ſea, and vehemence of the winds, would not permit the troops to diſembark. But at laſt, the Emperor ſeizing a favourable opportunity, landed them without oppoſition, not far from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, and immediately advanced towards the town. To oppoſe this mighty army, Haſcen had only eight hundred Turks, and five thouſand Moors, partly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Africa, and partly refugees from Granada. He returned, however, a fierce and haughty anſwer when ſummoned to ſurrender. But with ſuch a handful of ſoldiers, neither his deſperate courage, nor conſummate ſkill in war could have long reſiſted
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:011837_0773_0F9D8A4687ABDA18"/>
forces ſuperior to thoſe which had defeated Barbaroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa at the head of ſixty thouſand men, and had reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tunis, in ſpite of all his endeavours to ſave it.</p>
                  <p>BUT how far ſoever the Emperor might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond the reach of any danger from the enemy, he was ſuddenly expoſed to a more dreadful calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and one againſt which human prudence, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man efforts availed nothing. On the ſecond day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his landing, and before he had time for any thing but to diſperſe ſome light armed Arabs who moleſted his troops on their march, the clouds began to gather, and the heavens to appear with a fierce and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning aſpect. Towards evening rain began to fall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with violent wind, and the rage of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt increaſing during the night, the ſoldiers, who had brought nothing aſhore but their arms, remained expoſed to all its fury without tents, or ſhelter, or cover of any kind. The ground was ſo wet that they could not lie down on it; their camp being in a low ſituation was overflowed with water, and they ſunk at every ſtept to the ancles in mud; while the wind blew with ſuch impetuoſity, that to prevent their falling they were obliged to thruſt their ſpears into the ground, and to ſupport themſelves by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of them. Haſcen was too vigilant an officer to allow an enemy in ſuch diſtreſs to remain unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. About the dawn of morning, he ſallied out with ſoldiers, who having been ſcreened from the ſtorm under their own roofs, were freſh and vigorous. A body of Italians who were ſtationed neareſt the city, diſpirited and benumbed with cold, fled at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Turks. The troops at the poſt behind them, diſcovered greater courage, but as the rain had extinguiſhed their matches and wet their powder, their muſkets were uſeleſs, and having ſcarce ſtrength to handle their other arms, they were ſoon thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſion. Almoſt the whole army, with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf in perſon, was obliged to advance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemy could be repulſed, who, after ſpreading ſuch general conſternation, and killing a conſiderable number of men, retired at laſt in good order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="372" facs="unknown:011837_0774_0F9D8A4A01169850"/>BUT all feeling or remembrance of this loſs and danger were quickly obliterated by a more dreadful as well as affecting ſpectacle. It was now broad day; the hurricane had abated nothing of its violence, and the ſea appeared agitated with all the rage of which that deſtructive element is capable; all the ſhips, on which alone the whole army knew that their ſafety and ſubſiſtence depended, were ſeen driven from their anchors, ſome daſhing againſt each other, ſome beat to pieces on the rocks, many forced aſhore, and not a few ſinking in the waves. In leſs than an hour, fifteen ſhips of war, and an hundred and forty tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with eight thouſand men periſhed; and ſuch of the unhappy crews as eſcaped the fury of the ſea, were murdered, without mercy, by the Arabs, as ſoon as they reached land. The Emperor ſtood in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent anguiſh and aſtoniſhment beholding this fatal event, which at once blaſted all his hopes of ſucceſs, and buried in the depths the vaſt ſtores which he had provided as well for annoying the enemy, as for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting his own troops. He had it not in his power to afford them any other aſſiſtance or relief, than by ſending ſome troops to drive away the Arabs, and thus delivering a few who were ſo fortunate as to get aſhore from the cruci fate which their companions had met with. At laſt the wind began to fall, and to give ſome hopes that as many ſhips might eſcape, as to ſave the army from periſhing by famine, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them back to Europe. But theſe were only hopes; the approach of evening covered the ſea with darkneſs; and it being impoſſible for the officers on board the ſhips, that had out-lived the ſtorm, to ſend any intelligence to their companions who were aſhore, they remained during the night, in all the anguiſh of ſuſpenſe and uncertainty. Next day, a boat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by Doria, made ſhift to reach land, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that having weathered out the ſtorm, to which, during fifty years knowledge of the ſea, he had never ſeen any equal in fierceneſs and horror; he had found it neceſſary to bear away with his ſhattered ſhips to Cape Metafuz. He adviſed the Emperor, as the face of the ſky was ſtill lowering and tempeſtuous,
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:011837_0775_0F9D8A4B42739810"/>
to march with all ſpeed to that place, where the troops could reimbark with greater eaſe.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER comfort this intelligence afforded Charles, from being aſſured that part of his fleet had eſcaped, was balanced by the new cares and perplexity in which it involved him with regard to his army. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafuz was at leaſt three days march from his preſent camp; all the proviſions which he had brought aſhore at his firſt landing were now conſumed; his ſoldiers worn out with fatigue, were ſcarce able for ſuch a journey, even in a friendly country; and being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited by a ſucceſſion of hardſhips, which victory it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would ſcarce have rendered tolerable, they were in no condition to undergo new toils. But the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the army was ſuch, as allowed not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for deliberation, nor left it in the leaſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what to chuſe. They were ordered inſtantly to march, the wounded, the ſick and the feeble being placed in the centre; ſuch as ſeemed moſt vigorous were ſtationed in the front and rear. Then the ſad effects of what they had ſuffered began to appear more manifeſtly than ever, and new calamities were added to all theſe which they had already endured. Some could ſcarce bear the weight of their arms; others, ſpent with the toil of forcing their way through deep and almoſt impaſſable roads, ſunk down and died; many periſhed by famine, as the whole army ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly on roots and berries, or the fleſh of horſes, killed by the Emperor's order, and diſtributed among the ſeveral battalions; many were drowned in brooks which were ſwoln ſo much by the exceſſive rains, that in paſſing them they waded up to the chin; not a few were killed by the enemy, who during the greateſt part of their retreat, alarmed, harraſſed and annoyed them night and day. At laſt they arrived at Metafuz; and the weather being now ſo calm as to reſtore their communication with the fleet, they were ſupplied with plenty of proviſions, and cheered with the proſpect of ſafety.</p>
                  <p>DURING this dreadful ſeries of calamities, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror diſcovered great qualities, many of which an almoſt uninterrupted flow of proſperity had hitherto
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:011837_0776_0F9D8A4BE8F99FC0"/>
afforded him no opportunity of diſplaying. He was conſpicuous for firmneſs and conſtancy of ſpirit, for magnanimity, fortitude, humanity and compaſſion. He endured as great hardſhips as the meaneſt ſoldier; he expoſed his own perſon wherever danger appeared; he encouraged the deſponding; viſited the ſick and wounded; and animated all by his words and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the army embarked, he was among the laſt who left the ſhore, although a body of Arabs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at no great diſtance, ready to fall on the rear. By theſe virtues, Charles attoned, in ſome degree, for his obſtinancy and preſumption in undertaking an expedition ſo fatal to his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>THE calamities which attended this unfortunate enterprize did not end here; for no ſooner were the forces got on board, than a new ſtorm ariſing, though leſs furious than the former, ſcattered the fleet, and obliged them, ſeparately, to make towards ſuch ports in Spain or Italy as they could firſt reach; thus ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the account of their diſaſters, with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of aggravation and horror, which their fear or fancy ſuggeſted. The Emperor himſelf, after eſcaping great dangers, and being forced into the port of Bugia in Africa, where he was obliged, by contrary winds, to remain ſeveral weeks, arrived at laſt in Spain, (December 2.) in a condition very different from that in which he had returned from his former expedition againſt the Inſidels <note n="z" place="bottom">Carol. v.

                  <p>IMPRESSED with the deepeſt ſenſations of gratitude, the Editor takes this opportunity of ſincerely thanking the numerous Subſcribers to the American edition of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertſon's Hiſtory of Charles the Fifth, in periodical Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.—Vivified by the encouragement afforded him in your acceptance of each Volume ſewed in blue boards, as an equivalent for One Dollar;—And animated by this practical proof of your alacrity to promote native fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he reſpectfully layeth before the American Public, Propoſals for reprinting in periodical Volumes by ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Thus humbly to attempt, in the New World, the reprinting of ſuch celebrated Books at moderate Prices, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for this Meridian, as Men of Literary Taſte, and Lovers of Country-born Manufactures, are pleaſed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their names to encourage the republication of in America. —Becauſe ſome inimical incendiaries, who daily foſter the exiguity of their underſtandings, by barricading their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the vile and almoſt impregnable caſtle of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, exotics to the native rights of American Freedom, have inſinuated, that this Edition is an infraction on the monopoly of literary property in Great-Britain, the Editor requeſts their attention to this ſubject <hi>for a few moments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the year 1709, the Legiſlature of Great-Britain, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally aſcertained to every author the ſale of his works for fourteen years certain.—However reaſonable this mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly of literature might appear in a country over-grown with riches, thank God and government, this monopoly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth no farther than Great-Britain.—As precedents
<pb facs="unknown:011837_0799_0F9D898C750958C8"/>
are uſeful even in the ſupport of ſelf-evident truths, I hope the candid Reader will have patience to read one, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtibility of which is univerſally known.</p>
                  <p>IRELAND is a dependent and ſubordinate kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Great-Britain: It was not till the year 1730, that a taſte for literary knowledge made any conſiderable progreſs there; but, ever ſince the year 1740, this taſte hath made ſuch rapid and univerſal progreſs, among the higher rank of people in Ireland, that, as ſoon as any new Book appears in London, it is immediately reprinted by the Iriſh Bookſellers in Dublin.</p>
                  <p>THUS the depreſſed, I had almoſt ſaid, the opp—ſſ—d people of Ireland, hath reprinted two editions of Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Charles V. three editions of Blackſtone's Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, two editions of the Univerſal Hiſtory, one edition of Chambers's Dictionary, and editions of every valuable Work produced in Great-Britain, without rendering the ſmalleſt pecuniary regard either to Authors or to Bookſellers. —The reaſon is obvious; becauſe the monopoly doth not reach beyond the limits of Great-Britain, and cannot extend into any country governed by an Aſſembly of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, until they become ſo corrupted, as to barter away the birth-rights of the people, which they were elected to preſerve, and to increaſe rather than to diminiſh.—Dr. Robertſon did receive for his manuſcript copy of Charles V. the ſum of Four Thouſand Guineas; and the Britiſh Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, who gave this money, were purchaſers with full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for they abſolutely and poſitively knew, that, if they were to give him or any other author Four Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Guineas, they could not purchaſe the monopoly of that work in the kingdom of Ireland, nor in the provinces on the vaſt Continent of North-America.—The Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people in Ireland will never give up this high-born privilege of freely diſſeminating knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nation, when compared with the former inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have been by this means, not only Humanified, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Angelified:

                        <p>AS to Ireland, that is ſtill a diſtinct kingdom; though a dependent, ſubordinate kingdom. It was only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled the dominion or lordſhip of Ireland, and the king's ſtile was no other than <hi>dominus Hiberniae,</hi> lord of Ireland, till the thirty-third year of king Henry the eighth; when he aſſumed the title of King, which is recognized by act of parliament, 35 Hen. VIII. c. 3. But, as Scotland and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are now one and the ſame kingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws; ſo England and Ireland are, on the other hand, diſtinct kingdoms, and yet in general agree in their laws. The inhabitants of Ireland are, for the moſt part, deſcended from the Engliſh, who planted it as a kind of colony, after the conqueſt of it by King Henry the ſecond; and the laws of England were then received and ſworn to by the Iriſh nation, aſſembled at the council of Liſmore. And as Ireland, thus conquered, planted, and governed, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a ſtate of dependence, it muſt neceſſarily conform
<pb facs="unknown:011837_0801_0F9D898DF0AC7EB8"/>
to, and be obliged by, ſuch laws as the ſuperior ſtate thinks proper to preſcribe.</p>

                        <p>THE iſlands of Jerſey, Guernſey, Sark, Alderney, and their appendages, were parcel of the duchy of Normandy, and were united to the crown of England by the firſt princes of the Norman line.</p>

                        <p>BESIDES theſe adjacent iſlands, our more diſtant planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in America, and elſewhere, are alſo in ſome reſpects ſubject to the Engliſh laws. Plantations or colonies in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant countries, are either ſuch where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them deſart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, and peopling them from the mother country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by conqueſt, or ceded to us by treaties. And both theſe rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at leaſt upon that of nations. But there is a difference between theſe two ſpecies of colonies, with reſpect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be diſcovered and planted by Engliſh ſubjects, all the Engliſh laws then in being, which are the birthright of every ſubject, are immediately there in force. BUT THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD WITH VER<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> MANY AND VERY GREAT RESTRICTIONS. Such coloniſts carry with them only ſo much of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh law, as is applicable to their own ſituation and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of an infant colony; ſuch, for inſtance, as the general rules of inheritance, and of protection from perſonal inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The artificial refinements and diſtinctions incident to the property of a great and commercial people, the laws of police and revenue, (ſuch eſpecially as are inforced by penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) the mode of maintenance for the eſtabliſhed clergy, the juriſdiction of ſpiritual courts, and a multitude of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ARE NEITHER NECESSARY NOR CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENIENT FOR THEM, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT IN FORCE. What ſhall be admitted and what
<pb facs="unknown:011837_0802_0F9D898EB1735510"/>
rejected, at what times, and under what reſtrictions, muſt, in caſe of diſpute, be decided in the firſt inſtance by their own provincial judicature, ſubject to the reverſion and control of the king in council, the whole of their conſtitution being alſo liable to be new-modelled and reformed, by the general ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending power of the legiſlature in the mother country. But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the king may indeed alter and change thoſe laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unleſs ſuch as are againſt the law of God, as in the caſe of an infidel country. Our American plantations are principally of this latter ſort, being obtained in the laſt century either by right of conqueſt and driving out the natives (with what natural juſtice I ſhall not at preſent enquire) or by treaties. And therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of England, as ſuch, has no allowance or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there; they being no part of the mother country, but diſtinct (though dependent) dominions.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VII.</head>
                  <p>THE calamities which the Emperor ſuffered in his unfortunate enterprize againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers were great; and the account of theſe, which augmented in proportion as it ſpread at a greater diſtance from the ſcene of his diſaſters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Francis to begin hoſtilities, on which he had been for ſome time reſolved. But he did not think it prudent, to produce as the motives of this reſolution, either his antient pretenſions to the dutchy of Milan, or the Emperor's diſingenuity in violating his repeated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes with regard to the reſtitution of that country. The former might have been a good reaſon againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the truce of Nice, but was none for breaking it; the latter could not be urged without expoſing his own credulity as much as the Emperor's want of integrity. A violent and unwarrantable action of one of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial generals furniſhed him with a reaſon to juſtify his taking arms, which was of greater weight than either of theſe, and ſuch as would have rouzed him, if he had been as deſirous of peace, as he was eager for war. Francis, by ſigning the treaty of truce at Nice, without conſulting Solyman, gave (as he foreſaw) great offence to that haughty Monarch, who conſidered an alliance
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011837_0821_0F9D899D77766CE0"/>
with him as an honour of which a Chriſtian Prince had cauſe to be proud. The French King's friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with the Emperor in Provence, followed by ſuch extraordinary appearances of union and confidence as accompanied Charles's reception in France, induced the Sultan to ſuſpect that the two rivals had at laſt forgotten their antient enmity, in order that they might form ſuch a general confederacy againſt the Ottoman power, as had been long wiſhed for in Chriſtendom and often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in vain. Charles, with his uſual art, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to confirm and ſtrengthen theſe ſuſpicions, by inſtructing his emiſſaries at Conſtantinople, as well as in thoſe courts with which Solyman held any intelligence, to repreſent the concord between him and Francis to be ſo entire, that their ſentiments, views and purſuits, would be the ſame for the future <note n="a" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. p. 502.</note>. It was not without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that Francis effaced theſe impreſſions; but the addreſs of Rincon, the French ambaſſador at the Porte, together with the manifeſt advantage of carrying on ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities againſt the houſe of Auſtria in concert with France, prevailed at length on the Sultan to enter into a cloſer conjunction with Francis than ever. Rincon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into France, in order to communicate to his maſter a ſcheme of the Sultan's for gaining the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Venetians in their operations againſt the common enemy. Solyman having lately concluded a peace with that republic, to which the mediation of Francis, and the good offices of Rincon had greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, thought it not impoſſible to allure the ſenate by ſuch advantages, as, together with the example of the French Monarch, might over-balance any ſcruples ariſing either from decency or caution that could operate on the other ſide. Francis, warmly approving of this meaſure, diſpatched Rincon back to Conſtantinople, and directing him to go by Venice along with Fergoſo, a Genoeſe exile, whom he appointed his ambaſſador to that republic, empowered them to negociate the matter with the ſenate, to whom Solyman had ſent an envoy for the ſame purpoſe <note n="b" place="bottom">Hiſt. de Venet. de Purata, iv. 125.</note>. The Marquis del Guaſto, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011837_0822_0F9D899DAE6A9568"/>
of the Milaneſe, an officer of great abilities, but capable of attempting and executing the moſt atrocious actions, got intelligence of the motions and deſtination of theſe ambaſſadors. As he knew how much his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wiſhed to diſcover the intentions of the French King, and of what conſequence it was to retard the execution of his meaſures, he employed ſome ſoldiers belonging to the garriſon of Pavia to lie in wait for Rincon and Fergoſo as they ſailed down the Po, who murdered them and moſt of their attendants, and ſeized their papers. Upon receiving an account of this barbarous outrage, committed, during the ſubſiſtence of truce, againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons held ſacred by the moſt uncivilized nations, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis's grief for the unhappy fate of two ſervants whom he loved and truſted, his uneaſineſs at the interruption of his ſchemes by their death, and every other paſſion were ſwallowed up and loſt in the indignation which this inſult on the honour of his crown excited. He exclaimed loudly againſt Guaſto, who, having drawn upon himſelf all the infamy of aſſaſſination without making any diſcovery of importance, as the ambaſſadors had left their inſtructions and other papers of conſequence behind them, now boldly denied his being acceſſary in any wiſe to the crime. He ſent an ambaſſador to the Emperor to demand ſuitable reparation for an indignity, which no Prince, how inconſiderable ſoever, or puſillanimous, could tamely endure: And when Charles, impatient at that time to ſet out on his African expedition, endeavoured to put him off with an evaſive anſwer, he appealed to all the courts in Europe, ſetting forth the heinouſneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, the ſpirit of moderation with which he had applied for redreſs, and the iniquity of the Emperor in diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding this juſt requeſt.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the confidence with which Guaſto aſſerted his own innocence, the accuſations of the French gained greater credit than all his proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Bellay, the French commander in Piedmont, procured, at length, by his induſtry and addreſs, ſuch a minute detail of the tranſactions, with the teſtimony of ſo many of the parties concerned, as amounted almoſt to a legal proof of the Marquis's guilt. In conſequence of this opinion of the public, confirmed by ſuch ſtrong
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011837_0823_0F9D899E6F24F458"/>
evidence, Francis's complaints were univerſally allowed to be well founded, and the ſteps he took towards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing hoſtilities were aſcribed not merely to ambition or reſentment, but to the unavoidable neceſſity of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the honour of his crown <note n="c" place="bottom">Bellay, 367, &amp;c. Jovii Hiſt. lib. 40. 268.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT how juſt ſoever Francis might eſteem his own cauſe, he did not truſt ſo much to that, as to neglect the proper precautions for gaining other allies beſides the Sultan, by whoſe aid he might counterbalance the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's ſuperior power. But his negociations to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect were attended with very little ſucceſs. Henry VIII. more and more bent upon ſchemes againſt Scotland, which he knew would at once diſſolve his union with France, was inclinable rather to take part with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror than to contribute in any degree towards favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the operations againſt him. The Pope adhered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably to his antient ſyſtem of neutrality. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, notwithſtanding Solyman's ſolicitations, imitated the Pope's example. The Germans, ſatisfied with the religious liberty which they enjoyed, found it more their intereſt to gratify than to irritate the Emperor; ſo that the Kings of Denmark and Sweden, who on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were firſt drawn in to intereſt themſelves in the quarrels of the more potent Monarchs of the ſouth, and the Duke of Cleves, who had a diſpute with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror about the poſſeſſion of Gueldres, were the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Francis ſecured. But the dominions of the two former lay at ſuch a diſtance, and the power of the latter was ſo inconſiderable, that he gained little by their alliance.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS, however, ſupplied all defects by his own activity. Being afflicted at this time with a diſtemper, the effect of his irregular pleaſures, and which prevented his purſuing them with the ſame licentious indulgence, he applied to buſineſs with more than his uſual induſtry. The ſame cauſe which occaſioned this extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his affairs, rendered him moroſe and diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the miniſters whom he had hitherto employed. This accidental peeviſhneſs of temper being ſharpened by reflecting on the falſe ſteps into which he had lately
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011837_0824_0F9D899F2E0BE720"/>
been betrayed, and the inſults to which he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſome of thoſe in whom he had hitherto placed the greateſt confidence, felt the effects of this change in his temper, and were deprived of their offices. At laſt he diſgraced Montmorency himſelf, who had long directed affairs, as well civil as military, with all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a miniſter no leſs beloved than truſted by his maſter; and Francis being fond of ſhewing that the fall of ſuch a powerful favourite did not affect the vigour or prudence of his adminiſtration, this was a new motive to redouble his diligence in preparing to open the war by ſome ſplendid and extraordinary effort.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS accordingly brought into the field five ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. One to act in Luxembourg under the Duke of Orleans, accompanied by the Duke of Lorraine as his inſtructor in the art of war. Another commanded by the Dauphin marched towards the frontiers of Spain. A third led by Van Roſſem the marſhal of Guelders, and compoſed chiefly of the troops of Cleves, had Brabant allotted for the theatre of its operations. A fourth, of which the Duke of Vendome was general, hovered on the borders of Flanders. The laſt, conſiſting of the forces cantoned in Piedmont, was deſtined for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Annibaut. The Dauphin and his brother were appointed to command where the chief exertion was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and the greateſt honour to be reaped; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the former amounted to forty thouſand, that of the latter to thirty thouſand men. Nothing appears more ſurprizing than that Francis did not pour theſe numerous and irreſiſtible armies into the Milaneſe, which had ſo long been the object of his wiſhes as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, and that he ſhould chooſe rather to turn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt his whole ſtrength into another direction, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards new conqueſts. But the remembrance of the diſaſters which he had met with in his former expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into Italy, together with the difficulty of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a war carried on at ſuch a diſtance from his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, had gradually abated his violent inclination to obtain footing in that country, and made him willing to try the fortune of his arms in another quarter. At the ſame time, he expected to make ſuch a powerful imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the frontier of Spain, where there were few towns
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011837_0825_0F9D899FED9D4EA0"/>
of any ſtrength, and no army aſſembled to oppoſe him, as might enable him to recover poſſeſſion of the county of Rouſillon, lately diſmembered from the French crown, before Charles could bring into the field any force able to obſtruct his progreſs. The neceſſity of ſupporting his ally the Duke of Cleves, and the hope of drawing a conſiderable body of ſoldiers out of Germany by his means, determined him to act with vigour in the Low-Countries.</p>
                  <p>THE Dauphin and Duke of Orleans opened the campaign much about the ſame time, the former laying ſiege to Perpignan the capital of Rouſillon, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entering Luxembourg. The Duke of Orleans puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his operations with the greateſt rapidity and ſucceſs, one town falling after another, until no place in that large dutchy remained in the Emperor's hands but Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onville. Nor could he have failed of over-running the adjacent provinces with the ſame eaſe, if he had not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſtopt ſhort in his career of victory. But a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port prevailing that the Emperor had determined to hazard a battle in order to ſave Perpignan, on a ſudden the Duke, prompted by youthful ardour, or moved, perhaps, by jealouſy of his brother, whom he both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied and hated, abandoned his own conqueſts, and haſtened towards Rouſillon in order to divide with him the glory of the victory.</p>
                  <p>ON his departure, ſome of his troops were diſbanded, others deſerted their colours, and the reſt, cantoned in the towns which he had taken, remained inactive. By this conduct, which leaves a diſhonourable imputation either on his underſtanding or his heart, or on both, he not only renounced whatever he could have hoped from ſuch a promiſing opening of the campaign, but gave the enemy an opportunity of recovering, before the end of ſummer all the conqueſts which he had gained. On the Spaniſh frontier, the Emperor was not ſo inconſiderate as to venture on a battle, the loſs of which might have endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered his kingdom. Perpignan, though poorly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and briſkly attacked, having been largely ſupplied with ammunition and proviſions by the vigilance of Doria <note n="d" place="bottom">Sigonii Vita A. Doriae, p. 1191.</note>, was defended ſo long and ſo vigorouſly by the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011837_0826_0F9D89A0AEE8ED28"/>
Duke of Alva, the perſevering obſtinacy of whoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fitted him admirably for ſuch ſervice, that at laſt the French, after a ſiege of three months, waſted by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, repulſed in ſeveral aſſaults, and deſpairing of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, relinquiſhed the undertaking, and retired into their own country <note n="e" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. tom. ii. 315.</note>. Thus all Francis's mighty prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either from ſome defect in his own conduct, or from the ſuperior power and prudence of his rival, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no effects that bore any proportion to his expence and efforts, or ſuch as gratified, in any degree, his own hopes, or anſwered the expectation of Europe. The only ſolid advantage of the campaign was the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a few towns in Piedmont, which Bellay gamed rather by ſtratagem and addreſs, than by the force of his arms <note n="f" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſt. ii. 318. Bellay, 387, &amp;c. Ferrer. 9. 237.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the Emperor and Francis, though both conſiderably exhauſted by ſuch great but indeciſive ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, diſcovering no abatement of their mutual animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, employed all their attention, tried every expedient, and turned themſelves towards every quarter, in order to acquire new allies, together with ſuch a reinforcement of ſtrength, as would give them the ſuperiority in the enſuing campaign. Charles, taking advantage of the terror and reſentment of the Spaniards, upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den invaſion of their country prevailed on the Cortes of the ſeveral kingdoms to grant him ſubſidies with a more liberal hand than uſual. At the ſame time, he borrowed a large ſum from John King of Portugal, putting him in poſſeſſion by way of ſecurity for his being repaid, of the Molucca iſles in the Eaſt Indies, with the gainful commerce of precious ſpices, which that ſequeſtered corner of the globe yields. Not ſatisfied with this, he negociated a marriage between Philip his only ſon, now in his ſixteenth year, and Mary daughter of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, with whom her father, the moſt opulent Prince in Europe, gave a large dower; and having likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the Cortes of Aragon and Valencia to recognize Philip as the heir of theſe crowns, he obtained from them the donative uſual on ſuch occaſions <note n="g" place="bottom">Ferreras, 9. 238. 241. Jovii Hiſt. lib. 42. 298. 6.</note>. Theſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011837_0827_0F9D89A174D5B9F0"/>
extraordinary ſupplies enabled him to make ſuch addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his forces in Spain, that he could detach a great body into the Low-Countries, and yet reſerve as many as were ſufficient for the defence of the kingdom. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus provided for the ſecurity of Spain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the government of it to his ſon, he ſailed for Italy, in his way to Germany. But how attentive ſoever to raiſe the funds for carrying on the war, or eager to graſp at any new expedient for that purpoſe, he was not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate as to accept of the overture which Paul, knowing his neceſſities, artfully threw out to him. That ambitious Pontiff, no leſs ſagacious to diſcern, than watchful to ſeize opportunities of aggrandizing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſolicited him to grant Octavio his grandchild, whom the Emperor had admitted to the honour of being his ſon-in-law, the inveſtiture of the dutchy of Milan, in return for which he promiſed ſuch a vaſt ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as would have gone far towards ſupplying his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exigencies. But Charles, as well from unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to alienate a province of ſo much value, as from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt at the Pope, who had hitherto refuſed to join in the war againſt Francis, rejected the propoſal. His diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with Paul at that juncture was ſo great, that he even refuſed to approve his alienating Parma and Placentia from the patrimony of St. Peter, and ſettling them on his own ſon and grandſon as a fief to be held of the holy ſee. As no other expedient for raiſing money among the Italian ſtates remained, he conſented to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the garriſons which he had hitherto kept in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels of Florence and Leghorn, in conſideration for which, he received a large preſent from Coſmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici, who by this means ſecured his own independance and got poſſeſſion of two forts, which were juſtly called the fetters of Tuſcany <note n="h" place="bottom">Adriani Iſtoria i. 195.

                  <p>BUT Charles, while he ſeemed to have turned his whole attention towards raiſing the ſums neceſſary for defraying the expences of the year, had not been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of objects more diſtant, though no leſs important, and had concluded a league offenſive and defenſive
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011837_0828_0F9D89A23286B910"/>
with Henry VIII. from which he derived in the end, greater advantage than from all his other preparations. Several ſlight circumſtances, which have already been mentioned, had begun to alienate the affections of that Monarch from Francis, his preſent ally, and new inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of greater moment had occurred to increaſe his diſguſt and animoſity. Henry, deſirous of eſtabliſhing an uniformity in religion in Great-Britain, as well as fond of making proſelytes to his own opinions, had formed a ſcheme of perſuading his nephew the King of Scotland to renounce the Pope's ſupremacy, and to adopt the ſame ſyſtem of reformation which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into England. This meaſure he purſued with his uſual eagerneſs and impetuoſity, making ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous overtures to James, whom he conſidered as not over ſcrupulouſly attached to any religious tenets, that he ſcarce doubted of ſucceſs. His propoſitions were accordingly received in ſuch a manner that he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered himſelf with having gained his point. But the Scottiſh eccleſiaſtics, foreſeeing the ruin of the church to be the conſequence of the King's union with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and the partizans of France, no leſs convinced that it would put an end to the influence of that crown upon the public councils of Scotland, combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by their inſinuations defeated Henry's ſcheme at the very moment when he expected it to have taken effect. Too haughty to brook ſuch a diſappointment, which he imputed as much to the arts of the French, as to the levity of the Scottiſh Monarch, he took arms againſt Scotland, threatening to ſubdue the kingdom, ſince he could not gain the friendſhip of its King. At the ſame time, his reſentment at Francis quickened his negociations with the Emperor, an alliance with whom he was now as forward to accept, as the other could be to offer it. During this war with Scotland, and before the concluſion of his negociations with Charles, James V. died, leaving his crown to Mary, his only daughter, an infant a few days old. Upon this event, Henry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at once his whole ſyſtem with regard to Scotland, and abandoning all thoughts of conquering it, aimed at what was more advantageous as well as practicable, an union with that kingdom by a marriage between Edward
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011837_0829_0F9D89A2F72687C0"/>
his only ſon and the young Queen. But, here too, he apprehended a vigorous oppoſition from the French faction in Scotland, which began to beſtir itſelf in order to thwart the meaſure. The neceſſity of cruſhing this party among the Scots, and of preventing Francis from furniſhing them with any effectual aid, confirmed Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's reſolution of breaking with France, and puſhed him on to put a finiſhing hand to the treaty of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>IN this league were contained firſt of all, articles for ſecuring their future amity and mutual defence; then were enumerated the demands which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to make upon Francis; and the plan of their proceedings was fixed, if he ſhould refuſe to grant them ſatisfaction. They agreed to require, that Francis ſhould not only renounce his alliance with Solyman, which had been the ſource of infinite calamities to Chriſtendom, but alſo that he ſhould make reparation for the damages which that unnatural union had occaſioned; that he ſhould reſtore Burgundy to the Emperor; that he ſhould deſiſt immediately from hoſtilities, and leave Charles at leiſure to oppoſe the common enemy of the Chriſtian faith; and that he ſhould immediately pay the ſums due to Henry, or put ſome towns in his hands as ſecurity to that effect. If, within forty days, he did not comply with theſe demands, they then engaged to invade France each with twenty thouſand foot, and five thouſand horſe, and not to lay down their arms until they had recovered Burgundy, together with the towns on the Somme for the Emperor, and Normandy and Guienne, or even the whole realm of France for Henry <note n="i" place="bottom">Rym. xiv. 768. Herb. 238.</note>. Their heralds, accordingly, ſet out with theſe haughty requiſitions; but not being permitted to enter France, could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their commiſſion, and the two Monarchs held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fully entitled to execute whatever was ſtipulated in their treaty.</p>
                  <p>FRANCIS, on his part, was no leſs diligent in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the approaching campaign. Having early ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſymptoms of Henry's diſguſt and alienation, and finding all his endeavours to ſooth and reconcile
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011837_0830_0F9D89A3B59E74A8"/>
him ineffectual, he knew his temper too well not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that open hoſtilities would quickly follow upon this ceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of friendſhip. For this reaſon he redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his endeavours to obtain from Solyman ſuch aid as might counterbalance the great acceſſion of ſtrength which the Emperor would receive by his alliance with England. In order to ſupply the place of his two am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors murdered by Guaſto, he ſent as his envoy firſt to Venice, and then to Conſtantinople, Paulin, a captain of foot, a man of a daring and active ſpirit, and on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe qualities thought worthy of this ſervice, to which he was recommended by Bellay, who had trained him to the arts of negociation, and made trial of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and addreſs on ſeveral occaſions. Nor did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the opinion conceived of his courage and abilities. Haſtening to Conſtantinople, without regarding the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to which he was expoſed, he urged his maſter's demands with ſuch boldneſs, and availed himſelf of every circumſtance with ſuch dexterity, that he remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Sultan's own difficulties. He ſilenced like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome of the Baſſas, who either ſwayed by opinion, or having been gained by the Emperor, whoſe emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had made their way even into that court, had declared in the Divan againſt acting in concert with France <note n="k" place="bottom">Sandov. Hiſtor. tom ii. 346. Jovii Hiſt. lib. 41. 285, &amp;c. 300, &amp;c. Brantome.</note>. At laſt he obtained orders for Barbaroſſa to ſail with a powerful fleet, and to regulate all his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the directions of the French King. Francis was not equally ſucceſsful in his attempts to gain the Princes of the empire. The extraordinary rigour with which he thought it neceſſary to puniſh ſuch of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as had embraced the Proteſtant opinions, in order to give ſome notable evidence of his own zeal for the Catholic faith, and to wipe off the imputation to which he was liable from his confederacy with the Turks, placed an inſuperable barrier between him and ſuch of the Germans as intereſt and inclination would have prompted moſt readi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y to join him <note n="l" place="bottom">Seck. lib. iii. 403.</note>. His chief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, however, over the Emperor he derived on this, as on other occaſions, from the contiguity of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011837_0831_0F9D89A471862960"/>
as well as from the extent of the royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in France, which exempted him from all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and diſappointments unavoidable wherever popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar aſſemblies provide for the expences of government by occaſional and frugal ſubſidies. Hence his domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic preparations were always carried on with vigour and rapidity, while thoſe of the Emperor, unleſs when quickened by ſome foreign ſupply, or ſome temporary expedient, were to the laſt degree ſlow and dilatory.</p>
                  <p>LONG before any army was in readineſs to oppoſe him, Francis took the field in the Low-Countries, againſt which he turned the whole weight of the war. He made himſelf maſter of Landrecy, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to keep as the key to the whole province of Hainault; and ordered it to be fortified with great care. Turning from thence to the right, he entered the dutchy of Luxembourg, and found it in the ſame defenceleſs ſtate as in the former year. Meanwhile, the Emperor, having drawn together an army compoſed of all the different nations ſubject to his government, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the territories of the Duke of Cleves, on whom he had vowed to inflict exemplary vengeance. This Prince, whoſe conduct and ſituation were ſimilar to that of Robert de la Mark in the firſt war between Charles and Francis, reſembled him likewiſe in his fate. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with his feeble army, to face the Emperor, who advanced at the head of forty four thouſand men, he retired at his approach; and the Imperialiſts being at liberty to act as they pleaſed, immediately inveſted Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. That town, though gallantly defended, was won by aſſault, all the inhabitants put to the ſword, and the place itſelf reduced to aſhes. This dreadful example of ſeverity ſtruck the people of the country with ſuch general terror, that all the other towns, even ſuch as were capable of reſiſtance, ſent their keys to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and before a body of French, detached to his aſſiſtance, could come up, the Duke himſelf was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make his ſubmiſſion to Charles in the moſt abject manner. Being admitted into the Imperial preſence, he kneeled, together with eight of his principal ſubjects, and implored mercy. The Emperor allowed him to remain in that ignominious poſture, and eyeing him with
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011837_0832_0F9D89A5312AE618"/>
an haughty and implacable look, without deigning to anſwer a ſingle word, remitted him to his miniſters. The conditions, however, which they preſcribed were not ſo rigorous as he had reaſon to have expected after ſuch a reception. He was obliged to renounce his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with France and Denmark; to reſign all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to the dutchy of Guelders; to enter into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual amity with the Emperor and King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. In return for which all his hereditary dominions were reſtored, except two towns which the Emperor kept as pledges of his fidelity during the continuance of the war, and he was re-inſtated in his privileges as a Prince of the empire. Not long after, Charles, as a proof of the ſincerity of his reconcilement, gave him in marriage one of the daughters of his brother Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand <note n="m" place="bottom">Haraei. Annal. Brabant. t. 1. 628. Becueil des Traites, t. ii. 226.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus chaſtiſed the preſumption of the Duke of Cleves, detached one of his allies from Francis, and added to his dominions in the Low-Countries a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable province which lay contiguous to them, Charles advanced towards Hainault, and laid ſiege to Landrecy. There, as the firſt fruits of his alliance with Henry, he was joined by ſix thouſand Engliſh, under Sir John Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop. The garriſon, conſiſting of veteran troops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by de la Lande and Deſſe, two officers of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, made a vigorous reſiſtance. Francis approached with all his forces to relieve the place; Charles covered the ſiege; both were determined to hazard an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all Europe expected to ſee this conteſt, which had continued ſo long, decided at laſt by a battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two great armies led by them in perſon. But the ground which ſeparated their two camps was ſuch, as put the diſadvantage manifeſtly on his ſide who ſhould venture to attack, and neither of them choſe to run that riſque: Amidſt a variety of movements, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to draw the enemy into this ſnare, or to avoid it themſelves, Francis, with admirable conduct, and equal good fortune, threw firſt a ſupply of freſh troops, and then a convoy of proviſions into the town, ſo that the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011837_0833_0F9D89A5F2C4FE78"/>
Emperor, deſpairing of ſucceſs, withdrew into winter-quarters <note n="n" place="bottom">Bellay 405, &amp;c.</note>, in order to preſerve his army from being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ruined by the rigour of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Solyman fulfilled his engagements to the French King with great punctuality. He himſelf marched into Hungary with a numerous army, and as the Princes of the empire made no great effort to ſave a country which Charles, by employing his whole force againſt Francis, ſeemed willing to ſacrifice, there was no appearance of any body of troops to oppoſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. He beſieged one after another, Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inque Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae, Alba and Gran, the three moſt conſiderable towns in the kingdom, of which Ferdinand kept poſſeſſion. The firſt was taken by ſtorm; the other two ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and the whole kingdom, a ſmall corner except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſubjected to the Turkiſh yoke <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſtuanhaff. Hiſtor. Hung. l. 15. 167. Paliavic. 160.</note>. About the ſame time, Barbaroſſa ſailed with a fleet of an hundred and ten gallies, and coaſting along the ſhore of Calabria, made a deſcent at Rheggio, which he plundered and burnt; and advancing from thence to the mouth of the Tiber, he ſtopt there to water. The citizens of Rome, ignorant of his deſtination, and filled with terror, began to fly with ſuch general precipitation, that the city would have been left deſerted, if they had not reſumed cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage upon letters from Polin the French envoy, aſſuring them that no violence or injury would be offered by the Turks to any ſtate in alliance with the King his maſter <note n="p" place="bottom">Jovii Hiſt. l. 43. 304, &amp;c.</note>. From Oſtia Barbaroſſa ſailed to Marſeilles, and being joined by the French fleet with a body of land forces on board under the Count d'Enguien, a gallant young Prince of the houſe of Bourbon, they directed their courſe towards Nice, the ſole retreat of the unfortunate Duke of Savoy. There, to the aſtoniſhment and ſcandal of all Chriſtendom, the Lillies of France and Creſcent of Mahomet appeared in conjunction againſt the fortreſs on which the croſs of Savoy was diſplayed. The town, however, was bravely defended againſt their combined force by Montfort, a Savoyard gentleman, who ſtood a general aſſault, and repulſed the enemy with great
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011837_0834_0F9D89A6B055C398"/>
loſs, before he retired into the caſtle. That ſort, ſituated upon a rock, on which the artillery made no impreſſion, and which could not be undermined, he held out ſo long, that Doria had time to approach with his fleet, and the Marquis del Guaſto to march with a body of troops from Milan. Upon intelligence of this, the French and Turks raiſed the ſiege <note n="q" place="bottom">Guichenon hiſtoire de Savoye, t. 1. p. 651. Bellay, 425, &amp;c.</note>; and Francis had not even the conſolation of ſucceſs, to render the infamy, which he drew on himſelf by calling in ſuch an auxiliary, more tolerable.</p>
                  <p>FROM the ſmall progreſs of either party during this campaign, it was obvious to what a length the war might be drawn out between two Princes, whoſe power was ſo equally balanced, and who by their own talents or activity, could ſo vary and multiply their reſources. The trial they had now made of each other's ſtrength might have taught them the imprudence of perſiſting in a war, wherein there was greater appearance of their diſtreſſing their own dominions, than of conquering thoſe of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and ſhould have diſpoſed both to wiſh for peace. If Charles and Francis had been influenced by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of intereſt or prudence alone, this, without doubt, muſt have been the manner in which they would have reaſoned, but the perſonal animoſity, which ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led itſelf in all their quarrels, had grown to be ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and implacable, that for the pleaſure of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, they diſregarded every thing elſe; and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ſolicitous how to hurt their enemy, than how to ſecure what would be of advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. No ſooner then did the ſeaſon force them to ſuſpend hoſtilities, than without paying any attention to the Pope's repeated endeavours, or paternal exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to re-eſtabliſh peace, they began to provide for the operations of the next year with new vigour, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity increaſing with their hatred. Charles turned his chief attention towards gaining the Princes of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and endeavouring to rouze the formidable but unweildy ſtrength of the Germanic body againſt Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. In order to underſtand the propriety of the ſteps which he took for that purpoſe, it is neceſſary to review
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011837_0835_0F9D89A7724A5420"/>
the chief tranſactions in that country ſince the Diet of Ratiſbon in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty one.</p>
                  <p>MUCH about the time that aſſembly broke up, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice ſucceeded his father Henry in the government of that part of Saxony which belonged to the Albertine branch of the Saxon family. This young Prince, then only in his twentieth year, had, even at that early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, begun to diſcover the great talents which qualified him for acting ſuch a diſtinguiſhed part in the affairs of Germany. As ſoon as he entered upon the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſtruck out into ſuch a new and ſingular path, as ſhewed that he aimed, from the beginning, at ſomething great and uncommon. Though zealouſly attached to the Proteſtant opinions both from education and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he refuſed to accede to the league of Smalkalde, being determined, as he ſaid, to maintain the purity of religion which was the original object of that confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, but not to entangle himſelf in the political inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts or combinations to which it had given riſe. At the ſame time, foreſeeing a rupture between Charles and the confederates of Smalkalde, and perceiving which of them was moſt likely to prevail in the conteſt, inſtead of that jealouſy and diſtruſt which the other Proteſtants expreſſed of all the Emperor's deſigns, he affected to place in him an unbounded confidence; and courted his favour with the utmoſt aſſiduity. When the other Proteſtants, in the year fifteen hundred and forty two, either declined aſſiſting Ferdinand in Hungary, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him reluctant and feeble aid, Maurice marched thither in perſon, and rendered himſelf conſpicuous by his zeal and courage. From the ſame motive, he had led to the Emperor's aſſiſtance, during the former cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign a body of his own troops; and the gracefulneſs of his perſon, his dexterity in all military exerciſes, together with his intrepidity which courted and delighted in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, did not diſtinguiſh him more in the field, than his great abilities and inſinuating addreſs won upon the Emperor's confidence and favour <note n="r" place="bottom">Sleid. 317. Seck. l. iii. 371, 386, 428.</note>. While by this conduct, which appeared extraordinary to thoſe who held
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011837_0836_0F9D89A8367A5D88"/>
the ſame opinions with him concerning religion, Maurice endeavoured to pay court to the Emperor, he began to diſcover ſome degree of jealouſy of his couſin the Elector of Saxony. This, which proved in the ſequel ſo fatal to the Elector, had almoſt occaſioned an open rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and ſoon after Maurice's acceſſion to the government, they both took arms with equal rage, upon account of a diſpute about the right of juriſdiction over a paltry town ſituated on the Moldaw. They were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, however, from coming to blows by the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Landgrave of Heſſe, whoſe daughter Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice had married, as well as by the powerful and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratative admonitions of Luther<note n="s" place="bottom">Sleid. 292. Seck. l. iii. 403.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the Pope, though extremely irritated at the Emperor's conceſſions to the Proteſtants in the Diet of Ratiſbon, was ſo warmly ſolicited on all hands, by ſuch as were moſt devoutly attached to the ſee of Rome, no leſs than by thoſe whoſe fidelity or deſigns he ſuſpected, to ſummon a general council, that he found it impoſſible to avoid any longer calling that aſſembly. The impatience for its meeting, and the expectations of great effects from its deciſions ſeemed to grow in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the difficulty of obtaining it. He ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered, however, to his original reſolution of holding it in ſome town of Italy, where, by the number of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics, retainers to his court, and depending on his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who could repair to it without difficulty or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he might influence and even direct all its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This propoſition, though often rejected by the Germans, he inſtructed his nuncio to the Diet held at Spires, in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty two, to renew once more; and if he found it gave no greater ſatisfaction than formerly, he empowered him, as a laſt conceſſion, to propoſe for the place of meeting, Trent, a city in the Tyrol, ſubject to the King of the Romans, and ſituated on the confines between Germany and Italy. The Catholic Princes in the Diet, after giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as their opinion that the council might have been held with greater advantage in Ratiſbon, Cologne, or ſome of the great cities in the empire, approved of the place which the Pope had named. The Proteſtants
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011837_0837_0F9D89A8F3FB30A0"/>
unanimouſly expreſſed their diſſatisfaction, declaring that they would pay no regard to a council held without the precincts of the empire, called by the Pope's authority, and in which he aſſumed the right of preſiding <note n="t" place="bottom">Sleid. 291. Seck. l. iii. 283.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, without taking any notice of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, publiſhed the bull of intimation, named three cardinals to preſide as his legates, and appointed them to repair to Trent before the firſt of November, the day he had fixed for opening the council. But if Paul had deſired the meeting of a council as ſincerely as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he would not have pitched on ſuch an improper time for calling it. Inſtead of that general union and tranquillity, without which the deliberations of a council could neither be conducted with ſecurity, nor attended with authority, ſuch a fierce war was juſt kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperor and Francis, as rendered it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the eccleſiaſtics from many parts of Europe to reſort thither in ſafety. The legates, accordingly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſeveral months at Trent without any perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, except a few prelates from the eccleſiaſtical ſtate; upon which the Pope, in order to avoid the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule and contempt which this drew upon him from the enemies of the church, recalled them and prorogued the council <note n="u" place="bottom">F. Paul, p. 97. Sleid 296.</note>.</p>
                  <p>UNHAPPILY for the authority of the papal ſee, at the very time that the German Proteſtants took every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of pouring contempt upon it, the Emperor and King of the Romans found it neceſſary not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at their conduct, but to court their favour by repeated acts of indulgence. In the ſame Diet of Spires, wherein they had proteſted in the moſt diſreſpectful terms againſt aſſembling a council at Trent, Ferdinand, who depended on their aid for the defence of Hungary, not only permitted that proteſtation to be inſerted in the records of the Diet, but renewed in their favour all the Emperor's conceſſions at Ratiſbon, adding to them whatever they could demand for their farther ſecurity. Among other particulars, he granted a ſuſpenſion of a decree of the Imperial chamber againſt the city of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, one of thoſe which had entered into the league of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011837_0838_0F9D89A9B01B27B0"/>
Smalkalde, on account of its having ſeized the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical revenues within its domains, and enjoined Henry Duke of Brunſwick to deſiſt from his attempts to carry that decree into execution. But Henry, a furious bigot, and no leſs obſtinate than raſh in all his undertakings, continuing to diſquiet the people of Goſlar by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſe, that they might not ſuffer any member of the Smalkaldic body to be oppreſſed, aſſembled their forces, declared war in form againſt Henry, and in the ſpace of a few weeks ſtript him entirely of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and drove him as a wretched exile to take refuge in the court of Bavaria.

                  <p>EMBOLDENED by ſo many conceſſions in their favour, as well as by the progreſs which their opinions daily made, the Princes of the league of Smalkalde took a ſolemn proteſt againſt the Imperial chamber, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined its juriſdiction for the future, becauſe that court had not been viſited or reformed according to the decree of Ratiſbon, and continued to diſcover a moſt indecent partiality in all its proceedings.

He began, accordingly, with courting the Elector of Saxony, and Landgrave of Heſſe, the heads of the Proteſtant party, and by giving up ſome things in their favour, and granting liberal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes with regard to others, he ſecured himſelf from any danger of oppoſition on their part. Having aſcertained this capital point, he then ventured to addreſs the Diet with greater freedom. He began by repreſenting his own zeal, and unwearied efforts with regard to two things moſt eſſential to Chriſtendom, the procuring of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral council, in order to compoſe the religious diſſenſions which had unhappily ariſen in Germany, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſome proper means for checking the formidable progreſs of the Turkiſh arms; but that his pious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours had been entirely defeated by the unjuſtifiable ambition of the French King, who having wantonly kindled the flame of war in Europe, which had been ſo lately extinguiſhed by the truce of Nice, rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the fathers of the church to aſſemble in council, or to deliberate with ſecurity; and obliged him to employ thoſe forces in his own defence, which, with greater ſatisfaction to himſelf, as well as more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Chriſtendom, he would have turned againſt the Infidels: That Francis, not thinking it enough to have called him off from oppoſing the Infidels, had, with unexampled impiety, invited them into the heart of Chriſtendom, and joining his arms to theirs, had openly attacked the Duke of Savoy, a member of the empire. That Barbaroſſa's fleet was now in one of the ports of France, waiting only the return of ſpring, to carry ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deſolation to the coaſt of ſome Chriſtian ſtate.

That, in truth, a war againſt the French King and the Sultan ought to be conſidered as the ſame thing; and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage gained over the former, was a ſevere and ſenſible blow to the latter. That, therefore, he now demanded their aid againſt Francis, not merely as an enemy of the Germanic body, or of him who was its head, but as an avowed ally of the Infidels, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic enemy to the Chriſtian name.</p>
                  <p>IN order to give greater weight to this violent invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Emperor, the King of the Romans ſtood up, and related the rapid conqueſts of the Sultan in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, occaſioned, as he ſaid, by the fatal neceſſity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on his brother of employing his arms againſt France; and the ambaſſadors of Savoy gave a detail of Barbaroſſa's operations at Nice, and of the ravages which he had committed on that coaſt. All theſe, added to the general indignation which Francis's unprecedented union with the Turks excited in Europe, made ſuch an impreſſion on the Diet as the Emperor wiſhed, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed moſt of the members to grant him ſuch effectual aid as he had demanded. The ambaſſadors Francis had ſent to explain the motives of his conduct, were not permitted to enter the bounds of the empire; and the apology which they publiſhed for their maſter, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his alliance with Solyman, by examples drawn from Scripture, and the practice of Chriſtian Princes, was little regarded by men, irritated already, or prejudiced againſt him to ſuch a degree, as to be incapable of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their proper weight to any arguments in his behalf.</p>
                  <p>SUCH being the favourable diſpoſition of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Charles perceived that nothing could now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his gaining all that he aimed at, but the fears and jealouſies of the Proteſtants, which he determined to quiet by granting every thing, that the utmoſt ſolicitude of theſe paſſions could deſire for the ſecurity of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011837_0841_0F9D89ABF21B50F8"/>
With this view, he conſented to a receſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the rigorous edicts, hitherto iſſued againſt the Proteſtants were ſuſpended; a council either general or national to be aſſembled in Germany was declared ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to re-eſtabliſh peace in the church; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til one of theſe ſhould be held, (which the Emperor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to bring about as ſoon as poſſible) the free and public exerciſe of the Proteſtant religion was authorized; the Imperial chamber was to give no moleſtation to the Proteſtants; and when the term, for which the preſent judges in that court were elected, ſhould expire, perſons duly qualified were then to be admitted as members, without any diſtinction on account of religion. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for theſe extraordinary acts of indulgence, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants concurred, with the other members of the Diet, in declaring war againſt Francis, in the name of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; in voting the Emperor a body of twenty-four thouſand foot, and four thouſand horſe, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the public expence for ſix months, and to be employed againſt France; and at the ſame time the Diet impoſed a poll-tax to be levied throughout all Germany, on every perſon without exception, for the ſupport of the war againſt the Turks.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES, while he gave the greateſt attention to the minute and intricate detail of particulars neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conducting the deliberations of a numerous and divided aſſembly to ſuch a ſucceſsful period, negociated a ſeparate peace with the King of Denmark, who, tho' he had hitherto performed nothing conſiderable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his alliance with Francis, had it in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, however, to make a formidable diverſion in favour of that Monarch <note n="z" place="bottom">Dumont Corps Diplom. t. iv. p. ii. p. 274.</note>.

Henry, however, did not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don an object of ſo much importance. As the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Francis, beſides the pleaſure of taking revenge upon an enemy who had diſappointed a favourite mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, appeared the moſt effectual method of bringing the Scots to accept once more of the treaty which they had rejected; he was ſo fond of this ſcheme, that he was ready to ſecond whatever the Emperor could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be attempted againſt that Monarch. The plan, accordingly, which they concerted, was ſuch as, if it had been punctually executed, muſt have ruined France in the firſt place, and would have augmented ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly the Emperor's power and territories as might in the end have proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They agreed to invade France, each with an army of twenty-five thouſand men, and, without loſing time in beſieging the frontier towns, to advance directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the interior provinces, and to join their forces near Paris <note n="a" place="bottom">Herbert 245. Bellay, 448.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Francis ſtood alone in oppoſition to all the enemies that Charles was muſtering againſt him. Solyman was the only ally who had not deſerted him; but the aſſiſtance he received from him had rendered him ſo odious to all Chriſtendom, that he reſolved rather to forego all the advantages of his friendſhip, than to become, on that account, the object of general horror and deteſtation. For this reaſon, he diſmiſſed Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa as ſoon as winter was over, who, after ravaging the coaſts of Naples and Tuſcany, returned to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. As Francis could not hope to equal the forces of his rival, he endeavoured to ſupply that defect by diſpatch, which was more in his power, and to get the ſtart of him in taking the field. Early in the ſpring the Count d'Enguien inveſted Carignan, a town in Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, which the Marquis de Guaſto, the Imperial ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, having ſurprized the former year, conſidered as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011837_0843_0F9D89AD6E24F530"/>
of ſo much importance, that he had fortified it at great expence. The Count puſhed the ſiege with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, that Guaſto, fond of his own conqueſt, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way of ſaving it from falling into the hands of the French, reſolved to hazard a battle in order to relieve it. He began his march from Milan for this purpoſe, and as he was at no pains to conceal his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was ſoon known in the French camp. Enguien, a gallant and enterprizing young man, wiſhed paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to try the fortune of a battle; his troops deſired it with no leſs ardour; but the peremptory injunction of the King not to venture a general engagement, flowing from a prudent attention to the preſent ſituation of affairs, as well as from the remembrance of former diſaſters, tied up his hands. Unwilling, however, to abandon Carignan, when it was juſt ready to yield, and eager to diſtinguiſh his command by ſome memorable action, he diſpatched Monluc to court, in order to lay before the King the advantages of fighting the enemy, and the hopes which he had of victory. The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the matter to the council; all the miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, one after another, againſt fighting, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported their ſentiments by reaſons extremely plauſible.

Upon this, Monluc, a plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Francis, catching the ſame enthuſiaſm which had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his troops, ſuddenly ſtarted up, and having lifted his hands to heaven, and implored the divine protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and aid, he then addreſſed himſelf to Monluc, "Go," ſays he, "return to Piedmont, and fight in the name of God <note n="a" place="bottom">Memoires de Monluc.</note>."</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner was it known that the King had given En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien leave to fight the Imperialiſts, than ſuch was the martial ardour of the gallant and high ſpirited gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that age, that the court was quite deſerted, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon deſirous of reputation, or capable of ſervice, hurrying to Piedmont in order to ſhare, as volunteers, in the danger and glory of the action. Encouraged by the arrival of ſo many brave officers, Enguien imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately prepared for battle, nor did Guaſto decline the combat. The number of cavalry was almoſt equal, but the Imperial infantry exceeded the French by at leaſt ten thouſand men. They met near Ceriſoles, in an open plain, which afforded to neither any advantage of ground, and both had full time to form their army in proper order. The ſhock was ſuch as might have been expected between veteran troops, violent and obſtinate. The French cavalry running to the charge with their uſual vivacity, bore down every thing that oppoſed them, but on the other hand, the ſteady and diſciplined valour of the Spaniſh infantry having forced the body which they encountered to give way, victory remained in ſuſpence, ready to declare for which ever general could make the beſt uſe of that critical moment. Guaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, engaged in that part of his army which was thrown into diſorder, and afraid of falling into the hands of the French, whoſe vengeance he dreaded on account of the murder of Rincon and Fregoſo, loſt his preſence of mind, and forgot to order a large body of reſerve to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; whereas Enguien, with admirable courage and equal conduct, ſupported, at the head of his gens d'armes, ſuch of his battalions as began to yield; and at the ſame time he ordered the Swiſs in his ſervice, who had been victorious wherever they fought, to fall upon the Spaniards. This motion proved deciſive. All that followed was confuſion and ſlaughter. The Marquis de Guaſto wounded in the thigh, eſcaped only by the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his horſe. The victory of the French was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, ten thouſand of the Imperialiſts being ſlain, and a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011837_0845_0F9D89CA1268FF58"/>
conſiderable number, with all their tents, baggage and artillery, taken. On the part of the conquerors, their joy was without allay, a few only being killed, and among theſe no officer of diſtinction <note n="b" place="bottom">Bellay, 429, &amp;c. Memoires de Monluc. Jovii hiſt. l. 44. p. 327. 6.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſplendid action, beſides the reputation with which it was attended, delivered France from an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, as it ruined the army with which Guaſto had intended to invade the country between the Rhoſne and Saone, where there were neither fortified towns nor regular forces to oppoſe his progreſs. But it was not in Francis's power to purſue the victory with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour as to reap the advantages which it might have yielded; for though the Milaneſe remained now almoſt defenceleſs; though the inhabitants who had long mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured under the rigour of the Imperial government, were ready to throw off the yoke; though Enguien, fluſhed with ſucceſs, urged the King to ſeize this happy opportunity of recovering a country, the acquiſition of which had been long his favourite object; yet as the Emperor and King of England were preparing to break in upon the oppoſite frontier of France with ſuch ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior force, it became neceſſary to ſacrifice all thoughts of conqueſt to the public ſafety, and to recal twelve thouſand of Enguien's beſt troops to be employed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the kingdom. Enguien's ſubſequent opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, of conſequence, ſo languid and inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the reduction of Carignan and ſome other towns in Piedmont, was all he gained by his great vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory at Ceriſoles <note n="c" place="bottom">Bellay, 438, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, as uſual, was late in taking the field, but he appeared, towards the beginning of June, at the head of an army more numerous, and better appointed than any which he had hitherto led againſt France. It amounted almoſt to fifty thouſand men, and part of it having reduced Luxembourg and ſome other towns in the Netherlands, before he himſelf joined it, he now marched with the whole towards the frontiers of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne. Charles, according to his agreement with the King of England, ought to have advanced directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011837_0846_0F9D89CC84F23858"/>
Paris; and the Dauphin, who commanded the only army to which Francis truſted for the ſecurity of his dominions, was in no condition to oppoſe him. But the ſucceſs with which the French had defended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-ſix, had taught them the moſt effectual method of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing an invading enemy. Champagne, a country abounding more in vines than corn, was incapable of maintaining a great army, and before the Emperor's approach, whatever could be of any uſe to him had been carried off or deſtroyed. This rendered it neceſſary for him to be maſter of ſome places of ſtrength, in order to ſecure the convoys on which alone he now perceived that he muſt depend for ſubſiſtence; and he found the frontier towns ſo ill provided for defence, that he hoped it would not be a work either of much time or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to reduce them. Accordingly, Ligny and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy, which he firſt attacked, ſurrendered after a ſhort reſiſtance. He then inveſted St. Diſier, which, though it commanded an important paſs on the Marne, was deſtitute of every thing neceſſary for ſuſtaining a ſiege. But the Count de Sancerre and M. de la Lande, who had acquired ſuch reputation by the defence of Landrecy, generouſly threw themſelves into the town, and undertook to hold it out to the laſt extremity. The Emperor ſoon found how capable they were of making good their promiſe, and that he could not expect to take the town without beſieging it in form. This accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he undertook; and as it was his nature never to abandon any enterprize in which he had once engaged, he perſiſted in it with an inconſiderate obſtinacy.</p>
                  <p>THE King of England's preparations for the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign were compleat long before the Emperor's; but as he did not chooſe, on the one hand, to encounter alone the whole power of France, and was unwilling, on the other, that his troops ſhould remain unactive, he took that opportunity of chaſtiſing the Scots, by ſending his fleet, together with a conſiderable part of his infantry, under the Earl of Hertford, to invade their country. Hertford executed his commiſſion with vigour, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and burnt Edinburgh and Leith, laid waſte the adjacent country, and reimbarked his men with ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011837_0847_0F9D89CD08C0BCE8"/>
diſpatch, that they joined their Sovereign ſoon after his landing in France. When Henry arrived in that kingdom, he found the Emperor engaged in the ſiege of St. Diſier; an ambaſſador, however, whom he ſent to congratulate the Engliſh Monarch on his ſafe arrival on the continent, ſolicited him to march, in terms of the treaty, directly to Paris. But Charles had ſet his ally ſuch an ill example of fulfilling the conditions of their confederacy with exactneſs, that Henry, obſerving him employ his time and forces in taking towns for his own behoof, ſaw no reaſon why he ſhould not attempt the reduction of ſome places that lay conveniently for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Without paying any regard to the Emperor's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, he immediately inveſted Bologne, and commanded the Duke of Norfolk to preſs the ſiege of Montreuil, which had been begun before his arrival, by a body of Flemings, in conjunction with ſome Engliſh troops. While Charles and Henry ſhewed ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion each to his own intereſt, they both neglected the common cauſe; and, inſtead of the union and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence requiſite towards conducting the great plan they had formed, they early diſcovered a mutual jealouſy of each other, which, by degrees, begot diſtruſt, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in open hatred <note n="d" place="bottom">Herbert.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Francis had, with unwearied induſtry, drawn together an army capable, as well from the number as from the valour of the troops, of making head againſt the enemy. But the Dauphin, who ſtill acted as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, prudently declining a battle, the loſs of which would have endangered the kingdom, ſatisfied himſelf with haraſſing the Emperor with his light troops, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his convoys, and laying waſte the country around him. Though extremely diſtreſſed by theſe operations, Charles ſtill preſſed the ſiege of St. Diſier, which Sancerre defended with aſtoniſhing fortitude and conduct. He ſtood repeated aſſaults, repulſing the enemy in them all; and undiſmayed even by the death of the brave de la Lande, who was killed by a cannon ball, he continued to ſhew the ſame bold countenance and obſtinate reſolution. At the end of five weeks he
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011837_0848_0F9D89CF2BDF1FF8"/>
was ſtill capable of holding out ſome time longer, when an artifice of Granvelle's induced him to ſurrender. That crafty politician, having intercepted the key to the cypher which the Duke of Guiſe uſed in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating intelligence to Sancerre, forged a letter in his name, authorizing Sancerre to capitulate, as the King, though highly ſatisfied with his behaviour, thought it imprudent to hazard a battle for his relief. This letter he conveyed into the town in a manner which could raiſe no ſuſpicion, and the governor fell into the ſnare. Even then, he obtained ſuch honourable conditions as his gallant defence merited, and among others a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hoſtilities for eight days, at the expiration of which he bound himſelf to open the gates, if Francis, during that time, did not attack the Imperial army, and throw freſh troops into the town <note n="e" place="bottom">Brantome, tom. vi. 489.</note>. Thus Sancerre, by detaining the Emperor ſo long before an inconſiderable place, afforded his Sovereign full time to aſſemble all his forces, and, what rarely falls to an officer in ſuch an inferior command, acquired the glory of having ſaved his country.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as St. Diſier ſurrendered, the Emperor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the heart of Champagne, but Sancerre's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſiſtance had damped his ſanguine hopes of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating to Paris, and led him ſeriouſly to reflect on what he might expect before towns of greater ſtrength, and defended by more numerous garriſons. At the ſame time, the procuring ſubſiſtence for his army was attended with great difficulty, which increaſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he withdrew from his own frontier. He had loſt a great number of his beſt troops in the ſiege of St. Diſier, and many fell daily in ſkirmiſhes, which it was not in his power to avoid, though they waſted his army inſenſibly, without leading to any deciſive action. The ſeaſon advanced apace, and he had not yet the command either of a ſufficient extent of territory, or of any ſuch conſiderable town as rendered it ſafe to winter in the enemy's country. Great arrears too, were due to his ſoldiers, who were upon the point of mutinying for their pay, while he knew not from what funds to ſatisfy

                     </gap> ſiſter the Queen of France, had ſecretly made to his confeſſor, a monk of the ſame order. In conſequence of this, plenipotentiaries were named on both ſides, and began their conferences in Chauſſe, a ſmall village near Chalons. At the ſame time, Charles, either from a deſire of making one great final effort againſt France, or merely to gain a pretext for deſerting his ally and concluding a ſeparate peace, ſent an ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador formally to require Henry, according to the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in their treaty, to advance towards Paris. While he expected a return from him, and waited the iſſue of the conferences at Chauſſe, he continued to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though in the utmoſt diſtreſs from ſcarcity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. But at laſt, by a fortunate motion on his part, or through ſome neglect or treachery on that of the French, he ſurprized firſt Eſpernay and then Chateau Thierry, in both which were conſiderable magazines. No ſooner was it known that theſe towns, the latter of which is not two days march from Paris, were in the hands of the enemy, than that great capital, defenceleſs, and ſuſceptible of any violent alarm in proportion to its greatneſs, was filled with conſternation. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as if the Emperor had been already at their gates, fled in the wildeſt confuſion and deſpair, many ſending their wives and children down the Seine to Rouën, others to Orleans, and the towns upon the Loire. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis himſelf, more afflicted with this than with any other event during his reign, and ſenſible as well of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph his rival would enjoy in inſulting his capital, as of the danger to which the kingdom was expoſed, could not refrain, in the firſt emotion of his ſurprize and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, from crying out, "How dear, O my God, do I pay for this crown, which I thought thou hadſt granted me freely <note n="f" place="bottom">Brantome, tom. vi. 381.</note>." But recovering in a moment from this ſudden ſally of peeviſhneſs and impatience, he devoutly added, "Thy will, however, be done;" and proceeded to iſſue the neceſſary orders for oppoſing the enemy with his uſual compoſure and preſence of mind. The

Dauphin detached eight thouſand men to Paris, which revived the courage of the affrighted citizens; he threw a ſtrong garriſon into Meaux, and by a forced march, got into Ferte, between the Imperialiſts and the capital.</p>
                  <p>UPON this, the Emperor who began again to feel the want of proviſions, perceiving that the Dauphin ſtill prudently declined a battle, and not daring to attack his camp with forces ſo much ſhattered and reduced by hard ſervice, turned ſuddenly to the right, and began to fall back towards Soiſſons. Having about this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Henry's anſwer, whereby he refuſed to abandon the ſieges of Bologne and Montreuil, of both which he expected every moment to get poſſeſſion, he thought himſelf abſolved from all obligations of adhering to the treaty with him, and at full liberty to conſult his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in what manner ſoever he pleaſed. He conſented, therefore, to renew the conference, which the ſurprize of Eſpernay had broke off. To conclude a peace between two Princes, one of whom greatly deſired, and the other greatly needed it, did not require a long negociation. It was ſigned at Creſpy, a ſmall town near Meaux, on the eighteenth of September. The chief articles of it were, That all the conqueſts which either party had made ſince the truce of Nice ſhall be reſtored; that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ſhall give in marriage to the Duke of Orleans, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own eldeſt daughter, or the ſecond daughter of his brother Ferdinand; that if he choſe to beſtow on him his own daughter, he ſhall ſettle on her all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Low-Countries, to be erected into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſtate, which ſhall deſcend to the male iſſue of the marriage; that if he determined to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>BESIDES the immediate motives to this peace ariſing from the diſtreſs of his army through want of proviſions; from the difficulty of retreating out of France; and the impoſſibility of ſecuring winter-quarters there; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was influenced by other conſiderations, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, indeed, but not leſs weighty. The Pope was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to a great degree, as well at his conceſſions to the Proteſtants in the late Diet, as at his conſenting to call a council, and to admit of public diſputations in Germany, with a view of determining the doctrines in controverſy; and conſidering both theſe ſteps as ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious encroachments on the juriſdiction as well as privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the holy ſee, he had addreſſed to him a remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, rather than a letter on this ſubject, written with ſuch acrimony of language, and in a ſtile of ſuch high authority, as diſcovered more of an intention to draw on a quarrel, than of a deſire to reclaim him. This ill humour was not a little enflamed by the Emperor's league with Henry, which being contracted with an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic, excommunicated by the apoſtolic ſee, appeared to the Pope a profane alliance, and was not leſs dreaded by him, than that of Francis with Solyman. Paul's ſon and grandſon, highly incenſed at the Emperor for having refuſed to gratify them with regard to the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Parma and Placentia, contributed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions to ſour and diſguſt him ſtill more. To all which was added the powerful operation of the flattery and promiſes which Francis inceſſantly employed to gain him. Though from his deſire of maintaining a neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Pope had hitherto ſuppreſſed his own reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had eluded the artifices of his own family, and reſiſted the ſolicitations of the French King, it was not

ſafe to rely much on the ſteadineſs of a man whom his paſſions, his friends, and his intereſt combined to ſhake. The union of the Pope with France, Charles well knew would inſtantly expoſe his dominions in Italy to be attacked. The Venetians, he foreſaw, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably follow the example of a Pontiff, who was conſidered as a model of a political wiſdom among the Italians; and thus, at a juncture, when he felt himſelf ſcarce equal to the burthen of the preſent war, he would be overwhelmed with the weight of a new confederacy againſt him <note n="h" place="bottom">F.

Hiſt. Hung. 177.</note>. Above all theſe, the extraordinary progreſs of the Proteſtant doctrines in Germany, and the dangerous combination into which the Princes of that profeſſion had entered, called for his immediate attention. Almoſt one half of Germany had revolted from the eſtabliſhed church; the fidelity of the reſt was much ſhaken; the nobility of Auſtria had demanded of Ferdinand the free exerciſe of religion <note n="k" place="bottom">Sleid. 285.</note>; the Bohemians, among whom ſome ſeeds of the doctrines of Huſs ſtill remained, openly favoured the new opinions; the archbiſhop of Cologne, with a zeal rare among eccleſiaſtics, had begun the reformation of his dioceſe; nor was it poſſible, unleſs ſome timely and effectual check were given to the ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to foreſee where it would end. He himſelf had been a witneſs, in the late Diet, to the peremptory and deciſive tone which the Proteſtants had now aſſumed; and had ſeen how, from confidence in their number and union, they had forgotten the humble ſtile of their firſt petitions, having grown to ſuch boldneſs as openly to deſpiſe the Pope, and to ſhew no great reverence for the Imperial dignity itſelf. If, therefore, he wiſhed to maintain either the antient religion, or his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and would not chooſe to dwindle into a mere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal head of the empire, ſome vigorous effort was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, which could not be made during a war that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

the greateſt exertion of his ſtrength againſt a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and powerful enemy.</p>
                  <p>SUCH being the Emperor's inducements to peace, he had the addreſs to frame the treaty of Creſpy, ſo as to promote all the ends which he had in view. By coming to an agreement with Francis, he took from the Pope all proſpect of advantage, in courting the friendſhip of that Monarch, in preference to his. By the proviſo with regard to a war with the Turks, he not only deprived Solyman of a powerful ally, but turned the arms of that ally againſt him. By a private article, not inſerted in the treaty, that it might not raiſe any unſeaſonable alarm, he agreed with Francis that both ſhould exert all their influence and power, in order to procure a general council, to aſſert its authority, and to exterminate the Proteſtant hereſy out of their dominions. This cut off all hopes of aſſiſtance which the confederates of Smalkalde might expect from the French King <note n="l" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 496.</note>; and leſt their ſolicitations, or his jealouſy of an antient rival, ſhould hereafter tempt Francis to forget this engagement, he left him embaraſſed with a war againſt England, which would put it out of his power to take any part in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Germany.</p>
                  <p>HENRY, poſſeſſed at all times with an high idea of his own power and importance, felt, in the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner, the neglect with which the Emperor had treated him in concluding a ſeparate peace. But the ſituation of his affairs was ſuch as ſomewhat alleviated the mortification which this occaſioned. For though he was obliged to recal the Duke of Norfolk from the ſiege of Montreuil, becauſe the Flemiſh troops received orders to retire, Bologne had ſurrendered before the negociations at Creſpy were brought to an iſſue. While elated with vanity on account of this conqueſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with indignation againſt the Emperor, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors whom Francis ſent to make overtures of peace, found him too arrogant to grant what was moderate or equitable. His demands were indeed extravagant, and made in the tone of a conqueror; that Francis ſhould renounce his alliance with Scotland, and not only pay
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011837_0854_0F9D89D4F86CE2A0"/>
up the arrears of former debts, but reimburſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which he had expended in the preſent war. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, though ſincerely deſirous of peace, and willing to yield a great deal, in order to obtain it, being now free from the preſſure of the Imperial arms, rejected theſe ignominious propoſitions with diſdain; and Henry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting for England, hoſtilities continued between the two nations <note n="m" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier, t. i. p. 572. Herbert, 244.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE treaty of peace, how acceptable ſoever to the people of France, whom it delivered from the dread of an enemy who had penetrated into the heart of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was loudly complained of by the Dauphin. He conſidered it as a manifeſt proof of the King his father's extraordinary partiality towards his younger brother, now Duke of Orleans, and complained that from his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs to gain an eſtabliſhment for a favourite ſon, he had ſacrificed the honour of the kingdom, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the moſt antient and valuable rights of the crown. But as he durſt not venture to offend the King by refuſing to ratify it, though extremely deſirous at the ſame time of ſecuring to himſelf the privilege of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming what was now alienated ſo much to his detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſecretly proteſted, in preſence of ſome of his adherents, againſt the whole tranſaction; and declared, whatever he ſhould be obliged to do in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, null in itſelf, and void of all obligation. The parliament of Thoulouſe, probably by the inſtigation of his partizans, did the ſame <note n="n" place="bottom">Recueil de Traitez, t. ii. 235, 238.</note>. But Francis, highly pleaſed as well with having delivered his ſubjects from the miſeries of an invaſion, as with the proſpect of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring an independent ſettlement for his ſon, at no greater price than the renouncing conqueſts to which he had no juſt claim; titles which had hitherto proved the ſource of expence or diſaſters to the nation; and rights grown to be obſolete, and of no value; ratified the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with great joy. Charles, within the time preſcribed by the treaty, declared his intention of giving Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand's daughter in marriage to the Duke of Orleans, together with the dutchy of Milan, as her dowry <note n="o" place="bottom">Recueil de Traitez, t. ii. 238.</note>.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011837_0855_0F9D89D642C1DB38"/>
Every circumſtance ſeemed to promiſe the continuance of peace. The Emperor, cruelly afflicted with the gout, appeared to be in no condition to undertake any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize where great activity was requiſite, or much fatigue to be endured. He himſelf felt this, or wiſhed at leaſt that it ſhould be believed; and being ſo much diſabled by this excrutiating diſtemper, when a French ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor followed him to Bruſſels, in order to be preſent at his ratification of the treaty of peace, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty he ſigned his name; he obſerved, that there was no great danger of his violating theſe articles, as a hand that could ſcarce hold a pen, was little able to brandiſh a lance.</p>
                  <p>THE violence of his diſeaſe confined the Emperor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months in Bruſſels, and was the apparent cauſe of putting off the execution of the vaſt ſchemes which he had formed in order to humble the Proteſtant party in Germany. But there were other reaſons for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. For, how prevalent ſoever the motives were which determined him to undertake this enterprize, the nature of that great body which he was about to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, as well as the ſituation of his own affairs, made it neceſſary to deliberate long, to proceed with caution, and not to throw aſide too ſuddenly the veil under which he had hitherto concealed his real ſentiments and ſchemes. He was ſenſible that the Proteſtants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own ſtrength, but under continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his deſigns, had all the boldneſs of a powerful party, and all the jealouſy of a feeble faction; and were no leſs quick-ſighted to diſcern the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of danger, than ready to take arms in order to repel it. At the ſame time, he continued involved in a Turkiſh war; and though, in order to deliver himſelf from this incumbrance, he had determined to ſend an envoy to the Porte, with moſt advantageous, and even ſubmiſſive overtures of peace, the reſolutions of that haughty court were ſo uncertain, that before theſe were known, it would have been the height of imprudence to have kindled the flames of civil war in his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>UPON this account, he appeared diſſatisfied with a bull iſſued by the Pope immediately after the peace of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011837_0856_0F9D89D6CC474F80"/>
Creſpy, ſummoning the council to aſſemble at Trent ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next ſpring, and exhorting all Chriſtian Princes to embrace the opportuity that the preſent happy interval of tranquillity afforded them, of ſuppreſſing thoſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies which threatened to ſubvert whatever was ſacred or venerable among Chriſtians. But after ſuch a ſlight expreſſion of diſlike, as was neceſſary, in order to cover his deſigns, he determined to countenance the council, which might become no inconſiderable inſtrument towards accompliſhing his projects, and therefore not only appointed ambaſſadors to appear there in his name, but ordered the eccleſiaſtics in his dominions to attend at the time prefixed <note n="p" place="bottom">F. Paul, 104.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH were the Emperor's views, when the Imperial Diet, after ſeveral prorogations, was opened at Worms. The Proteſtants, who enjoyed the free exerciſe of their religion by a very precarious tenure, having no other ſecurity for it than the receſs of the laſt Diet, which was to continue in force only until the meeting of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, wiſhed earneſtly to eſtabliſh that important privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege upon ſome firmer baſis, and to hold it by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, not a temporary title. But, inſtead of offering them any additional ſecurity, Ferdinand opened the Diet with obſerving, that there were two points, chiefly, which required conſideration; the proſecution of the war againſt the Turks, and the ſtate of religion; that the former was the moſt urgent, as Solyman, after conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt part of Hungary, was now ready to fall upon the Auſtrian provinces; that the Emperor, who, from the beginning of his reign, had neglected no opportunity of annoying this formidable enemy, and with the hazard of his own perſon, had reſiſted his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, being animated ſtill with the ſame zeal, had now conſented to ſtop ſhort in the career of his ſucceſs againſt France, that, in conjunction with his antient rival, he might turn his arms with greater vigour againſt the common adverſary of the Chriſtian faith; that it became all the members of the empire to ſecond theſe pious endeavours of its head; that, therefore, they ought, without delay, to vote him ſuch effectual
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011837_0857_0F9D89D78FF12D40"/>
aid as both their duty, and their intereſt, called upon them to furniſh; that the controverſies about religion were ſo intricate, and of ſuch difficult diſcuſſion, as to give no hope of its being poſſible to bring them at preſent to any final iſſue; that by perſeverance and repeated ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations the Emperor had at length prevailed on the Pope to call a council, for which they had ſo often wiſhed and petitioned; that the time appointed for its meeting was now come, and both parties ought to wait for its decrees, and ſubmit to them as the deciſions of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal church.</p>
                  <p>THE popiſh members of the Diet received this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration with great applauſe, and ſignified their entire acquieſcence in every particular which it contained. The Proteſtants expreſſed great ſurprize at propoſitions, which were ſo manifeſtly repugnant to the receſs of the former Diet; they inſiſted that the queſtions with regard to religion, as firſt in dignity and importance, ought to come firſt under deliberation; that alarming as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Turks was to all Germany, the ſecuring the free exerciſe of their religion touched them ſtill more nearly, nor could they proſecute a foreign war with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, while ſolicitous and concerned about their domeſtic tranquillity; that if the latter were once rendered firm and permanent, they would concur with their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in puſhing the former, and yield to none of them in activity or zeal. But if the danger from the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh arms was indeed ſo imminent, as not to admit of ſuch a delay as would be occaſioned by an immediate examination of the controverted points in religion, they required that a Diet ſhould be inſtantly appointed, to which the final ſettlement of their religious diſputes ſhould be referred; and that, in the mean time, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the former Diet, concerning religion, ſhould be explained in a point which they deemed eſſential. By the receſs of Spires it was provided, that they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy unmoleſted the public exerciſe of their religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the meeting of a legal council; but as the Pope had now called a council, to which Ferdinand had required them to ſubmit, they began to ſuſpect that their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries might take advantage of an ambiguity in the terms of the receſs, and pretending that the event therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011837_0858_0F9D89D857C47900"/>
had taken place, might pronounce them to be no longer intitled to the ſame indulgence. In order to guard againſt this interpretation, they renewed their former remonſtrances againſt a council called to meet without the bounds of the empire, ſummoned by the Pope's authority, and in which he aſſumed the right of preſiding; and declared, that notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of any ſuch illegal aſſembly, they ſtill held the receſs of the late Diet to be in full force.</p>
                  <p>AT other junctures, when the Emperor thought it of advantage to ſooth and gain the Proteſtants, he had deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expedients for giving them ſatisfaction, with regard to demands ſeemingly more extravagant; but his views at preſent being very different, Ferdinand, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, adhered inflexibly to his firſt propoſitions, and would make no conceſſions which had the moſt remote tendency to throw diſcredit on the council, or to weaken its authority. The Proteſtants, on their part, were no leſs inflexible; and after much time ſpent in fruitleſs endeavours to convince each other, they came to no concluſion. Nor did the preſence of the Emperor, who upon his recovery arrived at Worms, contribute in any degree to render the Proteſtants more compliant. Fully convinced that they were maintaining the cauſe of God and of truth, they ſhewed themſelves ſuperior to the allurements of intereſt, or the ſuggeſtions of fear; and in proportion as the Emperor redoubled his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or diſcovered his deſigns, their boldneſs ſeems to have increaſed. At laſt they openly declared, that they would not even deign to vindicate their tenets in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a council, aſſembled not to examine, but to condemn them; and that they would pay no regard to an aſſembly held under the influence of a Pope, who had already precluded himſelf from all title to act as a judge, by his having ſtigmatized their opinions with the name of hereſy, and denounced againſt them the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt cenſures, which, in the plenitude of his uſurped power, he could inflict <note n="q" place="bottom">Sleid. 343, &amp;c. Seck. iii. 543, &amp;c. Thuan. Hiſtor. lib. ii. p. 56.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the Proteſtants, with ſuch union as well as firmneſs, rejected all intercourſe with the council, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011837_0859_0F9D89D94A2FE900"/>
refuſed their aſſent to the Imperial demands in reſpect to the Turkiſh war, Maurice of Saxony alone ſhewed an inclination to gratify the Emperor with regard to both. Though he profeſſed an inviolable regard for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, he aſſumed an appearance of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion peculiar to himſelf, by which he confirmed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſentiments that the Emperor already enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him, and gradually paved the way for execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ambitious deſigns which always occupied his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and enterprizing mind <note n="r" place="bottom">Seck. iii. 571.</note>. His example, however, had little influence upon ſuch as agreed with him in their religious opinions; and Charles perceived, that he could not hope either to procure preſent aid from the Proteſtants againſt the Turks, or to quiet their fears and jealouſies on account of their religion. But as his ſchemes were not yet ripe for execution, nor his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſo far advanced that he could force their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, or puniſh their obſtinacy, he artfully concealed his own intentions; and that he might augment their ſecurity, he appointed a Diet to be held at Ratiſbon early next year, in order to adjuſt what was now left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined; and previous to it, he agreed that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of divines of each party ſhould meet, in order to confer upon the points in diſpute <note n="s" place="bottom">Sleid. 351.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT how far ſoever this appearance of a deſire to maintain the preſent tranquillity might have impoſed upon the Proteſtants, the Emperor was incapable of ſuch uniform and thorough diſſimulation, as to hide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from their view the dangerous deſigns which he was meditating againſt them. Herman Count de Wied, Archbiſhop and Elector of Cologne, a prelate, conſpicuous for his virtue and primitive ſimplicity of manners, though not more diſtinguiſhed for learning than the other deſcendants of noble families, who in that age poſſeſſed moſt of the great benefices in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, having become a proſelyte to the doctrines of the Reformers, had begun in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty-three, with the aſſiſtance of Melacthon and Bucer, to aboliſh the antient ſuperſtition in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, and to introduce in its place the rites eſtabliſhed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011837_0860_0F9D89D9CF377A30"/>
among the Proteſtants. But the canons of his cathedral, who were not poſſeſſed with the ſame ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and who foreſaw how fatal the levelling genius of the new ſect would prove to their dignity and wealth, oppoſed, from the beginning, this unprecedented en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize of their archbiſhop with all the zeal flowing from reverence for old inſtitutions, heightened by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for their own intereſt. This oppoſition, which the archbiſhop conſidered only as a new argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the neceſſity of a reformation, neither ſhook his reſolution nor ſlackened his ardour in proſecuting his plan. The canons, perceiving all their endeavours to check his career to be ineffectual, ſolemnly proteſted againſt his proceedings, and appealed for redreſs to the Pope and Emperor, the former as his eccleſiaſtical, the latter as his civil ſuperior. This appeal being laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor, during his reſidence in Worms, he took the canons of Cologne under his immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; enjoined them to proceed with rigour againſt all who revolted from the eſtabliſhed church; prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the archbiſhop to make any innovation in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe; and ſummoned him to appear at Bruſſels within thirty days, to anſwer the accuſations which ſhould be preferred againſt him <note n="t" place="bottom">Sleid 310, 340, 351. Seckend. iii, 443, 553.</note>.</p>
                  <p>TO this clear evidence of his hoſtile intentions againſt the Proteſtant party, Charles added other proofs ſtill more explicit. In his hereditary dominions of the Low-Countries, he perſecuted all who were ſuſpected of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſm with unrelenting vigour. As ſoon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Worms, he ſilenced the Proteſtant preachers in that city. He allowed an Italian monk to inveigh againſt the Lutherans from the pulpit of his chapel, and to call upon him, as he regarded the favour of God, to exterminate that peſtilent hereſy. He diſpatched the embaſſy, which has been already mentioned, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, with overtures of peace, that he might be free from any apprehenſions of danger or interruption from that quarter. Nor did any of theſe ſteps, or their dangerous tendency, eſcape the jealous obſervation of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011837_0861_0F9D89DCBAF71F90"/>
the Proteſtants, or fail to alarm their fears, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite their ſolicitude for the ſafety of their ſect.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE Charles's good fortune which predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on all occaſions over that of his rival Francis, extricated him out of a difficulty, from which, with all his ſagacity and addreſs, he would have found it no eaſy matter to have diſentangled himſelf. Juſt about the time when the Duke of Orleans ſhould have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ferdinand's daughter in marriage, and together with her the poſſeſſion of the Milaneſe, he died of a peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fever. By this event, the Emperor was freed from the neceſſity of giving up an important province into the hands of an enemy, or from the indecency of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating a recent and ſolemn engagement, which muſt have occaſioned an immediate rupture with France. He affected, however, to expreſs great ſorrow for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, death of a young Prince, who was to have been ſo nearly allied to him; but he carefully avoided enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into any freſh diſcuſſions concerning the Milaneſe, and would not liſten to a propoſal which came from Francis of new-modelling the treaty of Creſpy, ſo as to make him ſome reparation for the advantages which he had loſt by the demiſe of his ſon. In the more active and vigorous part of Francis's reign, a declaration of war would have been the certain and inſtantaneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a flat refuſal to comply with a demand ſeemingly ſo equitable; but the declining ſtate of his own health, the exhauſted condition of his kingdoms, together with the burden of the war againſt England, obliged him, at preſent, to diſſemble his reſentment, and to put off thoughts of revenge to ſome other juncture. In conſequence of this event, the unfortunate Duke of Savoy loſt all hope of obtaining the reſtitution of his territories; and the rights or claims relinquiſhed by the treaty of Creſpy, returned in full force to the crown of France, to ſerve as pretexts for future wars <note n="u" place="bottom">Balcarii Comment. 769. Paruta, Hiſt. Venet. iv. p. 177.</note>.</p>
                  <p>UPON the firſt intelligence of the Duke of Orleans's death, the confederates of Smalkalde flattered themſelves that the eſſential alterations which it occaſioned could ſcarce fail of producing a rupture, which would prove
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011837_0862_0F9D89DDE52D9400"/>
the means of their ſafety. But they were not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed with regard to this, than in their expectations from an event which ſeemed to be the certain prelude of a quarrel between the Emperor and the Pope. Paul, whoſe paſſion for aggrandizing his family, increaſed as he advanced in years, and as he ſaw the dignity and power which they derived immediately from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more precarious, finding that he could not bring the Emperor to approve of his ambitious ſchemes, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, though at the riſque of incurring his diſpleaſure, to grant his ſon Peter Lewis the inveſtiture of Parma and Placentia. At a time when a great part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope inveighed openly againſt the corrupt manners and exorbitant power of eccleſiaſtics, and when a council was ſummoned to reform the diſorders in the church, this indecent grant of ſuch a principality to a ſon of whoſe illegitimate birth the Pope ought to have been aſhamed, and whoſe licentious morals all good men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, gave general offence. Some cardinals in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial intereſt remonſtrated againſt ſuch an unbecoming alienation of the patrimony of the church; the Spaniſh ambaſſador would not be preſent at the ſolemnity of his enfeofment; and the Emperor peremptorily refuſed, upon pretext that theſe cities were part of the Milaneſe ſtate, to confirm the deed of inveſtiture. But both the Emperor and Pope being intent upon one common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in Germany, ſacrificed their particular paſſions to that public cauſe, and ſuppreſſed the emotions of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy or reſentment which were riſing on this occaſion, that they might jointly purſue what each eſteemed of greater importance <note n="x" place="bottom">Paruta, Hiſt. Venet. iv. 178. Pallavii 180.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT this time the peace of Germany was diſturbed by a violent but ſhort eruption of Henry Duke of Brunſwick. This Prince, though ſtill ſtript of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, which the Emperor held in ſequeſtration, until his differences with the confederates of Smalkalde ſhould be adjuſted, poſſeſſed, however, ſo much credit in Germany, that he undertook to raiſe for the French King, a conſiderable body of troops to be employed in the war againſt England. The money ſtipulated for
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011837_0863_0F9D89DEA5E27898"/>
this purpoſe was duly advanced by Francis; the troops were levied; but Henry, inſtead of leading them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards France, ſuddenly entered his own dominions at their head, in hopes of recovering them before any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could be aſſembled to oppoſe him. The confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were not more ſurprized at this unexpected at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, than the King of France was aſtoniſhed at a mean thieviſh fraud, ſo unbecoming the character of a Prince. But the Landgrave of Heſſe, with incredible expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, collected as many men as put a ſtop to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Henry's undiſciplined forces, and being joined by his ſon-in-law Maurice, and ſome of the troops of the Elector of Saxony, he gained ſuch advantages over Henry, who was raſh and bold in forming his ſchemes, but feeble and undetermined in executing them, as obliged him to diſband his army, and to ſurrender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, together with his eldeſt ſon, priſoners at diſcretion. He was kept in cloſe confinement, until a new reverſe of affairs procured him liberty <note n="y" place="bottom">Sleid. 352. Seck. iii. 567.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AS this defeat of Henry's wild enterprize added new reputation to the arms of the Proteſtants, the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Palatinate brought a great acceſſion of ſtrength to their party. Frederick, who ſucceeded his brother Lewis in that Electorate, had long been ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſecret propenſity to the doctrines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, which, upon his acceſſion to the principality, he openly manifeſted. But as he expected that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing effectual towards a general and legal eſtabliſhment of religion would be the fruit of ſo many Diets, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and negociations, he did not at firſt attempt any public innovation in his dominions. Finding all theſe iſſue in nothing, he thought himſelf called, at length, to countenance by his authority the ſyſtem which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and to gratify the wiſhes of his ſubjects, who by their intercourſe with the Proteſtant ſtates had uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally imbibed their opinions. As the warmth and impetuoſity which accompanied the ſpirit of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its firſt efforts had ſomewhat abated, this change was made with great order and regularity; the antient rights were aboliſhed, and new forms introduced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011837_0864_0F9D89DF203A36B0"/>
any act of violence, or ſymptom of diſcontent. Though Frederick adopted the religious ſyſtem of the Proteſtants, he imitated the example of Maurice, and did not accede to the league of Smalkalde <note n="z" place="bottom">Sleid. 356. Seck. l. iii. 616.</note>.</p>
                  <p>A FEW weeks before this revolution in the Palatinate, the general council was opened with the accuſtomed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities at Trent. The eyes of the Catholic ſtates were turned with much expectation towards an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which all had conſidered as a natural and adequate remedy for the diſorders of the church when they firſt broke out, though many were afraid that it was now too late to hope for great benefit from it, when the malady, by being ſuffered to make progreſs during twenty-eight years, had become inveterate, and grown to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme violence. The Pope, by his laſt bull of convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, had appointed the firſt meeting to be held in March. But his views and thoſe of the Emperor were ſo different, that almoſt the whole year was ſpent in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations. Charles, who foreſaw that the rigorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the council againſt the Proteſtants would ſoon drive them, in ſelf-defence, as well as from reſentment, to ſome deſperate extreme, laboured to put off its meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until his warlike preparations were ſo far advanced that he might be in a condition to ſecond its deciſions by the force of his arms. The Pope, who had early ſent to Trent the legates who were to preſide in his name, knowing to what contempt it would expoſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and what ſuſpicions it would beget of his intentions, if the fathers of the council ſhould remain in a ſtate of inactivity, when the church was in ſuch danger as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their immediate and vigorous interpoſition, inſiſted either upon tranſlating the council to ſome city in Italy, or upon ſuſpending its proceedings at that juncture, or upon authoriſing it to begin its deliberations immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. The Emperor rejected the two former as equally offenſive to the Germans of every denomination; but finding it impoſſible to elude the latter, he propoſed that the council ſhould begin with reforming the diſorders in the church, before it proceeded to examine or define ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith. This was the very thing which the court
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011837_0865_0F9D89DFD8D27E00"/>
of Rome dreaded moſt, and which had prompted it to employ ſo many artifices, in order to prevent the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a dangerous judicatory. Paul, though more compliant than ſome of his predeceſſors with regard to calling a council, was no leſs jealous than they had been of its juriſdiction, and ſaw what matter of triumph ſuch a method of proceeding would afford the heretics. He apprehended conſequences not only humbling, but fatal to the papal ſee, if the council came to conſider an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt into abuſes as their only buſineſs; or if inferior prelates were allowed to gratify their own envy and peeviſhneſs, by preſcribing rules to thoſe who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above them in dignity and power. Without liſtening, therefore, to this inſidious propoſal of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he inſtructed his legates to open the council.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt ſeſſion was ſpent in matters of form. In a ſubſequent one, it was agreed that the framing of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, containing all the articles which the church required its members to believe, ought to be the firſt and principal buſineſs of the council; but that, at the ſame time, it ſhould give attention to what was neceſſary towards the reformation of manners and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. From this firſt ſymptom of the ſpirit with which the council was animated, from the high tone of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the legates who preſided in it aſſumed, and from the implicit deference with which moſt of the members followed their directions, the Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured with eaſe what deciſions they might expect. It aſtoniſhed them, however, to ſee forty prelates, (for no greater number was yet aſſembled) aſſume authority as repreſentatives of the univerſal church, and proceed to determine the moſt important points of doctrine in its name. Senſible of this indecency, as well as of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule with which it might be attended, the council ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſlowly in its deliberations, and all its proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were for ſome time languiſhing and feeble <note n="a" place="bottom">F. Paul. 120, &amp;c. Pallavic, p. 180, &amp;c.</note>. As ſoon as the confederates of Smalkalde received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the opening of the council, they publiſhed a long manifeſto, containing a renewal of their proteſt againſt its meeting, together with the reaſons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011837_0866_0F9D89E08D4C1168"/>
them to decline its juriſdictions <note n="b" place="bottom">Seckend. l. iii. 602, &amp;c.</note>. The Pope and Emperor, meanwhile, were ſo little ſolicitous to quicken or add vigour to its operations, as plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that ſome object of greater importance occupied and intereſted them.</p>
                  <p>THE Proteſtants, as they were not inattentive or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſpectators of their motions, entertained every day more violent ſuſpicions of their intentions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived intelligence from different quarters of the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations carrying on againſt them. The King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land informed them, that the Emperor having long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to exterminate their opinions, would not fail to employ this interval of tranquillity which he now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, as the moſt favourable juncture for carrying his deſign into execution. The merchants of Augſburg, which was at that time a city of extenſive trade, received advice by means of their correſpondents in Italy, among whom were ſome who ſecretly favoured the Proteſtant cauſe <note n="c" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 579.</note>, that a dangerous confederacy againſt it was forming between the Pope and Emperor. In confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, they heard from the Low-Countries that Charles had iſſued orders, though with every precaution which could keep the meaſure concealed, for raiſing troops both there and in other parts of his dominions. Such a variety of information, corroborating with all that their own jealouſy or obſervation led them to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, left the Proteſtants little reaſon to doubt of the Emperor's hoſtile intentions. Under this impreſſion, the deputies of the confederates of Smalkalde aſſembled at Frankfort, and by communicating their intelligence and ſentiments to each other, reciprocally heightened their ſenſe of the impending danger. But their union was not ſuch as their ſituation required, or the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their enemies rendered neceſſary. Their league had now ſubſiſted ten years. Among ſo many members whoſe territories were intermingled with each other, and who, according to the cuſtom of Germany, had created an infinite variety of mutual rights and claims by intermarriages, alliances, and contracts of different kinds, ſubjects of jealouſy and diſcord had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011837_0867_0F9D89E1C1245008"/>
ariſen. Some of the confederates, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Duke of Brunſwick, were highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with the Landgrave, on account of the rigour with which he had treated that raſh but unfortunate Prince. Others taxed the Elector of Saxony and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, the heads of the league, with having involved the members in unneceſſary and exorbitant expences by their profuſeneſs or want of oeconomy. The views, likewiſe, of theſe two great Princes, who, by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power and authority, influenced and directed the whole body, being extremely different, rendered all its motions languid, at a time when the utmoſt vigour and diſpatch were requiſite. The Landgrave, of a violent and enterprizing temper, but not forgetful, amidſt his zeal for religion, of the uſual maxims of human policy, inſiſted that the danger which threatened them, being manifeſt and unavoidable, they ſhould have recourſe to the moſt effectual expedient for ſecuring their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by courting the protection of the Kings of France and England, or by joining in alliance with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cantons of Switzerland, from whom they might expect ſuch powerful and preſent aſſiſtance as their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion demanded. The Elector, on the other hand, with the moſt upright intentions of any Prince in that age, and with talents which might have qualified him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for the adminiſtration of government in any tranquil period, was poſſeſſed with ſuch ſuperſtitious veneration for all the parts of the Lutheran ſyſtem, and ſuch bigotted attachment to all its tenets, as made him averſe to an union with thoſe who differed from him in any article of faith, and rendered him very incapable of undertaking its defence in times of difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He ſeemed to think, that the concerns of religion were to be regulated entirely by principles and maxims different from thoſe which apply to the common affairs of life; and being ſwayed too much by the opinions of Luther, who was not only a ſtranger to the rules of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical conduct, but deſpiſed them; he often diſcovered an uncomplying ſpirit, which proved of the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the cauſe that he wiſhed to ſupport. Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, on this occaſion, by the ſevere and rigid notions of that reformer, he refuſed to enter into any confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011837_0868_0F9D89E20C3DF8E0"/>
with Francis, becauſe he was a perſecutor of the truth; or to ſolicit the friendſhip of Henry, becauſe he was no leſs impious and profane than the Pope himſelf; or even to join in alliance with the Swiſs, becauſe they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from him in ſeveral eſſential articles of faith. This diſſenſion, about a point of ſuch conſequence, produced its natural effects. Each ſecretly cenſured and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other. The Landgrave conſidered the Elector as fettered by narrow prejudices, unworthy of a Prince called to act a chief part in a ſcene of ſuch importance. The Elector ſuſpected him of looſe principles and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious views, which correſponded ill with the ſacred cauſe in which they were engaged. But though the Elector's ſcruples prevented their timely application for foreign aid; and the jealouſy or diſcontent of the other Princes defeated a propoſal for renewing their original confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, the term during which it was to continue in force being on the point of expiring; yet the ſenſe of their common danger induced them to agree with regard to other points; particularly that they would never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the aſſembly at Trent as a lawful council, nor ſuffer the archbiſhop of Cologne to be oppreſſed on account of the ſteps which he had taken towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his dioceſe <note n="d" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 566, 570, 613. Sleid. 355.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Landgrave, meanwhile, deſirous of penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bottom of the Emperor's intentions, wrote to Granvelle, whom he knew to be thoroughly acquainted with all his maſter's ſchemes, informing him of the ſeveral particulars which raiſed the ſuſpicions of the Proteſtants, and begging an explicit declaration of what they had to fear or to hope. Granvelle, in return, aſſured them that the intelligence which they had received of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's military preparations was exaggerated, and all their ſuſpicions deſtitute of foundation; that, though in order to guard his frontiers againſt any inſult of the French or Engliſh, he had commanded a ſmall body of men to be raiſed in the Low-Countries, he was as ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous as ever to maintain tranquillity in Germany <note n="e" place="bottom">Sleid. 356.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Emperor's actions did not correſpond with theſe profeſſions. For, inſtead of appointing men of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011837_0869_0F9D89E37577BE80"/>
known moderation and a pacific temper, to appear in defence of the Catholic doctrines, at the conference which had been agreed on, he made choice of fierce bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, attached to their own ſyſtem with a blind obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which rendered all hope of reconcilement deſperate. Malvenda, a Spaniſh divine, who took the conduct of the debate on the part of the Catholics, managed it with all the ſubtle dexterity of a ſcholaſtic metaphyſician, more ſtudious to perplex his adverſaries, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, and more intent on palliating error than on diſcovering truth. The Proteſtants filled with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as well at his ſophiſtry, as at ſome regulations which the Emperor endeavoured to impoſe on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants, broke off the conference abruptly, being fully convinced of the Emperor's having had nothing in view but to amuſe them, and to gain time for ripening his own ſchemes <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid. 358.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VIII.</head>
                  <p>WHILE appearances of danger daily encreaſed, and the tempeſt which had been ſo long a gathering was ready to break forth in all its violence againſt the Proteſtant church, Luther was ſaved, by a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able death, from feeling or beholding its deſtructive rage. Having gone, though in a declining ſtate of health, and during a rigorous ſeaſon, to his native city of Eyſleben, in order to compoſe, by his authority, a diſſenſion among the Counts of Mansfield, he was ſeized with a violent inflammation in his ſtomach, which in a few days put an end to his life, in the ſixty-third year of his age. As he was raiſed up by Providence to be the author of one of the greateſt and moſt intereſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions recorded in hiſtory, there is not any perſon perhaps whoſe character has been drawn with ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite colours. In his own age, one party, ſtruck with horror, and inflamed with rage, when they ſaw with what a daring hand he overturned every thing which they held to be ſacred, or valued as beneficial, imputed to him not only all the defects and vices of a man, but the qualities of a daemon. The other, warmed with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and gratitude, which they thought he merited as
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011837_0871_0F9D89E4B2D62518"/>
the reſtorer of light and liberty to the Chriſtian church, aſcribed to him perfections above the condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and viewed all his actions with a veneration bordering on that which ſhould be paid only to thoſe who are guided by the immediate inſpiration of heaven. It is his own conduct, not the undiſtinguiſhing cenſure, or the exaggerated praiſe of his contemporaries, which ought to regulate the opinions of the preſent age concerning him. Zeal for what he regarded as truth, undaunted intrepidity to maintain it, abilities both natural and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to defend it, and unwearied induſtry to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it, are virtues which ſhine ſo conſpicuouſly in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of his behaviour, that even his enemies muſt allow him to have poſſeſſed them in an eminent degree. To theſe may be added with equal juſtice, ſuch purity and even auſterity of manners, as became one who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the character of a Reformer; ſuch ſanctity of life as ſuited the doctrine which he delivered; and ſuch perfect diſintereſtedneſs as affords no ſlight preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſincerity. Superior to all ſelfiſh conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, a ſtranger to the elegancies of life, and deſpiſing its pleaſures, he left the honours and emoluments of the church to his diſciples, remaining ſatisfied himſelf in his original ſtate of profeſſor in the Univerſity, and paſtor of the town of Wittemberg, with the moderate appointments annexed to theſe offices. His extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary qualities were allayed with no inconſiderable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of human frailty and human paſſions. Theſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, were of ſuch a nature, that they cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to malevolence or corruption of heart, but ſeem to have taken their riſe from the ſame ſource with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his virtues, his mind forcible and vehement in all its operations, rouzed by great objects, or agitated by violent paſſions, broke out, on many occaſions, with an impetuoſity which aſtoniſhes men of feebler ſpirits, or ſuch as are placed in a more tranquil ſituation. By carrying ſome praiſe-worthy diſpoſitions to exceſs, he bordered ſometimes on what was culpable, and was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten betrayed into actions which expoſed him to cenſure. His confidence that his own opinions were well founded, approached to arrogance; his courage in aſſerting them, to raſhneſs; his firmneſs in adhering to them, to obſtinacy;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011837_0872_0F9D89E50C337D48"/>
and his zeal in confuting his adverſaries, to rage and ſcurrility. Accuſtomed himſelf to conſider every thing as ſubordinate to truth, he expected the ſame deference for it from other men; and without making any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for their timidity or prejudices, he poured forth againſt thoſe, who diſappointed him in this particular, a torrent of invective mingled with contempt. Regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of any diſtinction of rank or character when his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines were attacked, he chaſtiſed all his adverſaries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately, with the ſame rough hand; neither the royal dignity of Henry VIII. nor the eminent learning and abilities of Eraſmus, ſcreened them from the ſame groſs abuſe with which he treated Tetzel or Eccius.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe indecencies of which Luther was guilty, muſt not be imputed wholly to the violence of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. They ought to be charged, in part, on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the age. Among a rude people, unacquainted with thoſe maxims, which, by putting continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints on the paſſions of individuals, have poliſhed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and rendered it agreeable, diſputes of every kind were managed with heat, and ſtrong emotions were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their natural language, without reſerve or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy. At the ſame time, the works of learned men were all compoſed in Latin, and they were not only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, by the example of eminent writers in that language to uſe their antagoniſts with the moſt illiberal ſcurrility; but in a dead tongue indecencies of every kind appear leſs ſhocking than in a living language, whoſe idioms and phraſes ſeem groſs, becauſe they are familiar.</p>
                  <p>IN paſſing judgment upon the characters of men, we ought to try them by the principles and maxims of their own age, not by thoſe of another. For, although vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice are at all times the ſame, manners and cuſtoms vary continually. Some parts of Luther's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which to us appear moſt culpable, gave no diſguſt to his contemporaries. It was even by ſome of thoſe qualities, which we are now apt to blame, that he was fitted for accompliſhing the great work which he undertook. To rouze mankind, when ſunk in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſuperſtition, and to encounter the rage of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, armed with power, required the utmoſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011837_0873_0F9D89E5D80ED428"/>
of zeal, and a temper daring to exceſs. A gentle call would neither have reached, nor have excited thoſe to whom it was addreſſed. A ſpirit, more amiable, but leſs vigorous than Luther's, would have ſhrunk back from the dangers which he braved and ſurmounted. Towards the cloſe of Luther's life, though without any perceptible declenſion of his zeal or abilities, the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his temper increaſed upon him, ſo that he grew daily more peeviſh, more iraſcible, and more impatient of contradiction. Having lived to be witneſs of his own amazing ſucceſs; to ſee a great part of Europe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his doctrines; and to ſhake the foundation of the papal throne, before which the mightieſt Monarchs had trembled, he diſcovered, on ſome occaſions, ſymptoms of vanity and ſelf-applauſe. He muſt have been indeed more than man, if, upon contemplating all that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually accompliſhed, he had never felt any ſentiment of this kind riſing in his breaſt <note n="*" place="bottom">A remarkable inſtance of this, as well as of a certain ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and elevation of ſentiment, is found in his Laſt Will.

                  <p>SOME time before his death he felt his ſtrength de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, his conſtitution being worn out by a prodigious multiplicity of buſineſs, added to the labour of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his miniſterial function with unremitting diligence, to the fatigue of conſtant ſtudy, beſides the compoſition of works as voluminous as if he had enjoyed uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted leiſure and retirement. His natural intrepidity did not forſake him at the approach of death; his laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with his friends was concerning the happineſs reſerved for good men in a future world, of which he ſpoke with the fervour and delight natural to one who expected and wiſhed to enter ſoon upon the enjoyment
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011837_0874_0F9D89E6984F1178"/>
of it <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 362. Seck. lib iii. 632, &amp;c.</note>. The account of his death filled the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic party with exceſſive as well as indecent joy, and damped the ſpirits of all his followers; neither party ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conſidering that his doctrines were now ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, as to be in a condition to flouriſh indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the hand which firſt had planted them. His funeral was celebrated by order of the Elector of Saxony with extraordinary pomp. He left ſeveral children by his wife Catharine Bore, who ſurvived him; towards the end of the laſt century, there were in Saxony ſome of his deſcendants in decent and honourable ſtations <note n="b" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 651.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, meanwhile, purſued the plan of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation with which he had ſet out, employing every art to amuſe the Proteſtants, and to quiet their fears and jealouſies. For this purpoſe he contrived to have an interview with the Landgrave of Heſſe, the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all the confederates, and the moſt ſuſpicious of his deſigns. To him he made ſuch warm profeſſions of his concern for the happineſs of Germany, and of his averſion to all violent meaſures; he denied, in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, his having entered into any league, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun any military preparations which ſhould give cauſe of alarm to the Proteſtants, as ſeem to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all the Landgrave's doubts and apprehenſions, and ſent him away fully ſatisfied of his pacific inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This artifice was of great advantage, and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually anſwered the purpoſe for which it was intended. The Landgrave upon his leaving Spires, where he had been admitted to this interview, went to Worms, where the Smalkaldic confederates were aſſembled, and gave them ſuch a flattering repreſentation of the Emperor's favourable diſpoſition towards them, that they, too apt, as well from the temper of the German nation, as from the genius of all great aſſociations or bodies of men, to be ſlow and dilatory, and undeciſive in their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thought there was no neceſſity of taking any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate meaſures againſt danger, which appeared to be diſtant or imaginary <note n="c" place="bottom">Sleid.

                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:011837_0875_0F9D89E755853378"/>SUCH events, however, ſoon occurred, as ſtaggered the credit which the Proteſtants had given to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's declarations. The council of Trent, though ſtill compoſed of a ſmall number of Italian and Spaniſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, without a ſingle deputy from many of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which it aſſumed the right of binding by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, being aſhamed of its long inactivity, proceeded now to ſettle articles of the greateſt importance. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun with examining the firſt and chief point in controverſy between the church of Rome and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, concerning the rule which ſhould be held ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or deciſive, in matters of faith, the council, by its infallible authority, determined, "That the books to which the deſignation of <hi>Apocryphal</hi> hath been given, are of equal authority with thoſe which were received by the Jews and primitive Chriſtians into the ſacred canon; that the traditions handed down from the apoſtolic age, and preſerved in the church, are intitled to as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard as the doctrines and precepts which the inſpired authors have committed to writing; that the Latin tranſlation of the Scriptures, made or reviſed by St. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, and known by the name of the <hi>Vulgate</hi> tranſlation, ſhould be read in churches, and appealed to in the ſchools as authentic and canonical." Againſt all who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the truth of theſe tenets, anathemas were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the name and by the authority of the Holy Ghoſt. The deciſion of theſe points, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the main pillar of the Lutheran ſyſtem, was a plain warning to the Proteſtants what judgment they might expect when the council ſhould have leiſure to take into conſideration the particular and ſubordinate articles of their Creed <note n="d" place="bottom">F. Paul. 141. Pallav. 206.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS diſcovery of the council's readineſs to condemn their opinions, was ſoon followed by a ſtriking inſtance of the Pope's reſolution to puniſh ſuch as embraced them. The appeal of the canons of Cologne againſt their archbiſhop having been carried to Rome, Paul eagerly ſeized on that opportunity, both of diſplaying the extent of his own authority, and of teaching the German eccleſiaſtics the danger of revolting from the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:011837_0876_0F9D89E80D89A320"/>
eſtabliſhed church. As no perſon appeared in behalf of the archbiſhop, he was held to be convicted of the crime of hereſy, and a papal bull was iſſued, depriving him of his eccleſiaſtical dignity, inflicting on him the ſentence of excommunication, and abſolving his ſubjects from the oath of allegiance which they had taken to him as their civil ſuperior. The countenance which he had given to the Lutheran hereſy was the only crime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, as well as the only reaſon aſſigned to juſtify the extraordinary rigour of this decree. The Proteſtants could ſcarce believe that Paul, how zealous ſoever to defend the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, or to humble thoſe who invaded it, would have ventured to proceed to ſuch extremities againſt a Prince and Elector of the empire, without having previouſly ſecured ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful protection as would render his cenſure ſomething more than an impotent and deſpicable ſally of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They were of courſe deeply alarmed at this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the archbiſhop, conſidering it as a ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the malevolent intentions not only of the Pope, but of the Emperor, againſt the whole party <note n="e" place="bottom">Sleid. 354 F. Paul, 155. Pallavic. 224.</note>.</p>
                  <p>UPON this freſh revival of their fears, with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as is natural to men rouzed from a falſe ſecurity, and conſcious of their having been deceived, Charles ſaw that it was now neceſſary to throw aſide the veil, and to declare openly what part he determined to act. By a long ſeries of artifice and fallacy, he had gained ſo much time, that his meaſures, though not altogether ripe for execution, were greatly matured. The Pope, by his proceedings againſt the Elector of Cologne, as well as by the decree of the council, had precipitated matters into ſuch a ſituation, as rendered a breach between the Emperor and the Proteſtants almoſt unavoidable. Charles had no choice left him, but either to take part with them in overturning what the ſee of Rome had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, or to ſupport the authority of the church openly by force of arms. Nor did the Pope think it enough to have brought the Emperor under a neceſſity of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he preſſed him to begin his operations, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011837_0877_0F9D89E8C9F6EB28"/>
to ſecond him with ſuch vigour, as could ſcarce fail of ſecuring his ſucceſs. Tranſported by his zeal againſt hereſy, he forgot all the prudent and cautious maxims of the papal ſee, with regard to the danger of extending the Imperial authority beyond due bounds, and in order to cruſh the Lutherans, he was willing to contribute towards raiſing up a maſter that might prove formidable to himſelf as well as to the reſt of Italy.</p>
                  <p>BUT beſides the certain expectation of aſſiſtance from the Pope, Charles was now ſecure from any danger of interruption to his deſigns by the Turkiſh arms. His negociations at the Porte, which he had carried on with great aſſiduity ſince the peace of Creſpy, were on the point of being terminated in ſuch a manner as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Solyman, partly in compliance with the French King, who, in order to avoid the diſagreeable obligation of joining the Emperor againſt his antient ally, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great zeal to bring about an accommodation between them; and partly from its being neceſſary to turn his arms towards the eaſt, where the Perſians threatened to invade his dominions, conſented without difficulty to a truce for five years. The chief article of it was, that each ſhould retain poſſeſſion of what he now held in Hungary; and Ferdinand, as a ſacrifice to the pride of the Sultan, ſubmitted to pay an annual tribute of fifty thouſand crowns <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſtuanhaffii Hiſt. Hung. 180. Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. 582.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT it was upon the aid and concurrence of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans themſelves that the Emperor relied with the greateſt confidence. The Germanic body, he knew, was of ſuch vaſt ſtrength, as to be invincible if it were united, and that it was only by employing its own force that he could hope to ſubdue it. Happily for him, the union of the ſeveral members in this great ſyſtem was ſo feeble, the whole frame was ſo looſely compacted, and its different parts tended ſo violently towards ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from each other, that it was almoſt impoſſible for it, on any important emergence, to join in a general or vigorous effort. In the preſent juncture, the ſources of diſcord were as many, and as various as had been known
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011837_0878_0F9D89EA02B471A0"/>
on any occaſion. The Roman Catholics, animated with a zeal in defence of their religion proportional to the fierceneſs with which it had been attacked, were eager to ſecond any attempt to humble thoſe innovators, who had overturned it in many provinces, and endangered it in more. John and Albert of Brandenburgh, as well as ſeveral other Princes, incenſed at the haughtineſs and rigour with which the Duke of Brunſwick had been treated by the confederates of Smalkalde, were impatient to reſcue him, and to be revenged on them. Charles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with ſatisfaction, the working of theſe paſſions in their minds, and counting on them as ſure auxiliaries whenever he ſhould think it proper to act, he found it, meanwhile, more neceſſary to moderate than to inflame their rage.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the ſituation of affairs, ſuch the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which the Emperor foreſaw and provided for every event, when the Diet of the empire met at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſbon. Many of the Roman Catholic members ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there in perſon, but moſt of the confederates of Smalkalde, under pretence of their being unable to bear the expence occaſioned by the late unneceſſary frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch aſſemblies, ſent only deputies. Their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Emperor, and apprehenſions that violence, perhaps, might be employed in order to force their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of what he ſhould propoſe in the Diet, was the true cauſe of their abſence. The ſpeech with which the Emperor opened the Diet was extremely artful. After profeſſing, in common form, his regard for the proſperity of the Germanic body, and declaring, that in order to beſtow his whole attention upon the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its order and tranquillity, he had at preſent abandoned all other cares, rejected the moſt preſſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of his other ſubjects to reſide among them, and poſtponed affairs of the greateſt importance; he took notice, with ſome indignation, that his diſintereſted example had not been imitated; many members of chief conſideration having neglected to attend an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to which he had repaired with ſuch manifeſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to himſelf. He then mentioned their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py diſſenſions about religion; lamented the ill ſucceſs
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011837_0879_0F9D89EA84D6D0B8"/>
of his paſt endeavours to compoſe them; complained of the abrupt diſſolution of the late conference, and craved their advice with regard to the beſt and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method of reſtoring union to the churches of Germany, together with that happy agreement in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, which their anceſtors had found to be of no leſs advantage to their civil intereſt, than becoming their Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>BY this gracious and popular method of conſulting the members of the Diet, rather than of obtruding upon them any opinion of his own, beſides the appearance of great moderation, and the merit of paying much reſpect to their judgment, the Emperor dextrouſly avoided diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his own ſentiments, and reſerved to himſelf, as his only part, that of carrying into execution what they ſhould recommend. Nor was he leſs ſecure of ſuch a deciſion as he wiſhed for by referring it wholly to themſelves. The Roman Catholic members, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own zeal, or prepared by his intrigues, joined immediately in repreſenting that the authority of the council, now met at Trent, ought to be final in all matters of controverſy; that all Chriſtians ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to its decrees as the infallible rule of their faith; and therefore they beſought him to exert the power with which he was inveſted by the Almighty, in protecting that aſſembly, and in compelling the Proteſtants to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in its determinations. The Proteſtants, on the other hand, preſented a memorial, in which, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating their objections to the council of Trent, they propoſed, as the only effectual method of deciding the points in diſpute, that either a free general council ſhould be aſſembled in Germany, or a national council of the empire ſhould be called, or a ſelect number of divines ſhould be appointed out of each party to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and define articles of faith; they mentioned the receſſes of ſeveral Diets favourable to this propoſition, and which gave them hope of terminating all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in this amicable manner; they now conjured the Emperor not to depart from his former plan, and by offering violence to their conſciences to bring calamities upon Germany, the very thought of which muſt fill every lover of his country with horror. The Emperor
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011837_0880_0F9D89EC8F558D68"/>
receiving this paper with a contemptuous ſmile, paid no farther regard to it. Having already taken his final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and perceiving that nothing but force could compel them to acquieſce in it, he diſpatched the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Trent to Rome, in order to conclude an alliance with the Pope, the terms of which were already agreed on; he commanded a body of troops, levied on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Low-Countries, to advance towards Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he gave commiſſions to ſeveral officers for raiſing men in different parts of the empire; he warned John and Albert of Brandenburgh, that now was the proper time of exerting themſelves, in order to reſcue their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Henry of Brunſwick, from captivity <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid. 374. Seck. iii. 658.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ALL theſe things could not be tranſacted without the obſervation and knowledge of the Proteſtants. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret was now in many hands; under whatever veil of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, or ſecrecy, the Emperor ſtill affected to conceal his deſigns, his officers kept no ſuch myſterious reſerve, and his allies and ſubjects ſpoke out his intentions plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Alarmed with reports of this kind, from every quarter, as well as with the preparations of war which they ſaw begun, the deputies of the confederates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded audience of the Emperor, and in the name of their maſters, required to know whether theſe military preparations were carried on by his command, and for what end, and againſt what enemy. To a queſtion put in ſuch a tone, and at a time when facts were become too notorious to be denied, it was neceſſary to give an explicit anſwer. He owned the orders which he had iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and profeſſing his purpoſe not to moleſt any on account of religion who ſhould act as dutiful ſubjects, declared that he had nothing in view but to maintain the rights and prerogatives of the Imperial dignity, and by puniſhing ſome factious members to preſerve the antient conſtitution of the empire from being impaired or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by their irregular or licentious conduct. Though the Emperor did not name the perſons whom he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch high crimes, and deſtined to be the objects of his vengeance, it was obvious that he had the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſe in view. Their
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011837_0881_0F9D89EDA9373948"/>
deputies, conſidering what he had ſaid, as a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his hoſtile intentions, immediately retired from Ratiſbon <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 376.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Cardinal of Trent found it no difficult matter to treat with the Pope, who having at length brought the Emperor to adopt that plan which he had long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, aſſented with eagerneſs to every article that he propoſed. The league was ſigned a few days after the Cardinal's arrival at Rome. The pernicious hereſies which abounded in Germany, the obſtinacy of the Proteſtants in rejecting the holy council aſſembled at Trent, and the neceſſity of maintaining ſound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, together with good order in the church, are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the motives of this union between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties. In order to check the growth of theſe evils, and to puniſh ſuch as had impiouſly contributed to ſpread them, the Emperor, having long and without ſucceſs made trial of gentler remedies, engaged inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take the field with a ſufficient army, that he might compel by force all who diſowned the council, or had apoſtatized from the religion of their forefathers, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the boſom of the church, and to ſubmit with due obedience to the holy ſee. He likewiſe bound himſelf not to conclude a peace with them during ſix months without the Pope's conſent, nor without aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him his ſhare in any conqueſt which ſhould be made upon them; and that even after that period he ſhould not agree to any accommodation which might be detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the church, or the intereſt of religion. On his part, the Pope ſtipulated to depoſit a large ſum in the bank of Venice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards defraying the expence of the war; to maintain at his own charge, during the ſpace of ſix months, twelve thouſand foot, and five hundred horſe; to grant the Emperor for one year half of the eccleſiaſtical revenues throughout Spain; to authorize him by a bull to alienate as much of the lands belonging to religious houſes in that country, as would amount to the ſum of five hundred thouſand crowns; and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy not only ſpiritual cenſures, but military force
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011837_0882_0F9D89EE79E190E0"/>
againſt any Prince who ſhould attempt to interrupt or defeat the execution of this treaty <note n="b" place="bottom">Sleid. 381. Pallav. 255. Dumont Corps Diplom. 11.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the explicit terms in which the extirpation of hereſy was declared to be the object of the war which was to follow upon this treaty, Charles ſtill endeavoured to perſuade the Germans that he had no deſign to abridge their religious liberty, but that he aimed only at vindicating his own authority, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the inſolence of thoſe who had encroached upon it. With this view he wrote circular letters, in the ſame ſtrain with his anſwer to the deputies at Ratiſbon, to moſt of the free cities, and to ſeveral of the Princes who had embraced the Proteſtant doctrines. In theſe he complained loudly, but in general terms, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt into which the Imperial dignity had fallen, and of the preſumptuous as well as diſorderly behaviour of ſome members of the empire. He declared he now took arms, not in a religious but in a civil quarrel; not to oppreſs thoſe who continued to behave as quiet and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſubjects, but to humble the arrogance of ſuch as had thrown off all ſenſe of that ſubordination in which they were placed under him as head of the Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic body. Groſs as this deception was, and manifeſt as it might have appeared to all who conſidered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's conduct with attention, it became neceſſary for him to make trial of its effect; and ſuch was the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and dexterity with which he employed it, that he derived the moſt ſolid advantages from this artifice. If he had avowed at once an intention of overturning the Proteſtant church, and of reducing all Germany under its antient ſtate of ſubjection to the papal ſee, none of the cities or Princes who had embraced the new opinions could have remained neutral after ſuch a declaration, far leſs could they have ventured to aſſiſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in ſuch an enterprize. Whereas, by concealing and even diſclaiming any intention of that kind, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved himſelf from the danger of being overwhelmed by a general confederacy of all the Proteſtant ſtates, but he furniſhed the timid with an excuſe for continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, and the deſigning or intereſted with a pretext for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011837_0883_0F9D89EECA323AC0"/>
joining him without expoſing themſelves to the infamy of abandoning their own principles, or having an active hand in ſuppreſſing them. At the ſame time, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror well knew, that if he were enabled, by their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to break the power of the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave, he might afterwards preſcribe what terms he pleaſed to the feeble remains of a party without union or leaders, who would then regret, too late, their miſtaken confidence in him, and their inconſiderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of their aſſociates.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, by a ſudden and unforeſeen diſplay of his zeal, had well nigh diſconcerted this plan which the Emperor had formed with ſo much care and art. Proud of having been the author of ſuch a formidable confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy againſt the Lutheran hereſy, and happy in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the glory of extirpating it was reſerved for his Pontificate, he publiſhed the articles of his league with the Emperor as a proof of their pious intention, as well as of the extraordinary efforts which he himſelf was about to make for maintaining the faith in its purity. Not ſatisfied with this, he ſoon after iſſued a bull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining moſt liberal promiſes of indulgence to all who ſhould engage in this holy enterprize, together with warm exhortations to ſuch as could not bear a part in it themſelves, to increaſe the fervour of their prayers, and the ſeverity of their mortifications, that they might draw down the bleſſing of heaven upon thoſe who undertook it <note n="c" place="bottom">Du Mont, Corps Diplom.</note>. Nor was it zeal alone which puſhed the Pope to make declarations ſo inconſiſtent with the account which the Emperor himſelf gave of his motives for taking arms. He was much ſcandalized at Charles's diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch a cauſe; at his ſeeming to be aſhamed of owning his zeal for the church; and at his endeavours to make that paſs for a political conteſt, which he ought to have gloried in as a war which had no other object than the defence of religion. With as much ſolicitude, therefore, as the Emperor laboured to diſguiſe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the confederacy, did the Pope endeavour to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their real plan, in order that they might come at once to a rupture with the Proteſtants, that all hope of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011837_0884_0F9D89EF96D24CE8"/>
reconcilement might be cut off, and that Charles might be under fewer temptations, and have it leſs in his power than at preſent, to betray the intereſts of the church by an accommodation beneficial to himſelf <note n="d" place="bottom">F. Paul, 188. Thuan. Hiſt. i. 61.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, though not a little offended at the Pope's indiſcretion or malice in making this diſcovery, continued boldly to purſue his own plan, and to aſſert his intentions to be no other than what he had originally avowed. Several of the Proteſtant ſtates, whom he had previouſly gained, thought themſelves juſtified in ſome meaſure, by his declarations, for abandoning their aſſociates, and even for giving aſſiſtance to him.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe artifices did not impoſe on the greater and ſounder part of the Proteſtant confederates. They clearly perceived it to be againſt the reformed religion that the Emperor had taken arms, and that not only the ſuppreſſion of it, but the extinction of the German li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, would be the certain conſequence of his obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an entire ſuperiority as would enable him to execute his ſchemes in their full extent. They deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, therefore, to prepare for their own defence, and neither to renounce thoſe religious truths, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which they had attained by means ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor to abandon thoſe civil rights which had been tranſmitted to them by their anceſtors. In order to give the neceſſary directions for this purpoſe, their deputies met at Ulm, ſoon after their abrupt departure from Ratiſbon. Their deliberations were now conducted with ſuch vigour and unanimity, as the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which threatened them required. The contingent of troops, which each of the confederates was to furniſh having been fixed by the original treaty of union, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given for bringing them immediately into the field. Being ſenſible, at laſt, that through the narrow prejudices of ſome of their members, and the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſecurity of others, they had neglected too long to ſtrengthen themſelves by foreign alliances, they now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with great earneſtneſs to the Venetians and Swiſs.</p>
                  <p>TO the former, they repreſented the Emperor's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of overturning the preſent ſyſtem of Germany,

the Helvetic body was ſo divided with regard to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as rendered it unſafe for the Proteſtants to take any ſtep without conſulting their aſſociates; and among them the emiſſaries of the Pope and Emperor had ſuch influence, that a reſolution of maintaining an exact neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality between the contending parties, was the utmoſt which could be procured <note n="g" place="bottom">Sleid. 392.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BEING diſappointed in both theſe applications, they not long after had recourſe to the Kings of France and England; the approach of danger either overcoming the Elector of Saxony's ſcruples, or obliging him to yield to the importunities of his confederates. The ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the two Monarchs flattered them with hopes of ſucceſs. Hoſtilities between them had continued for ſome time after the peace of Creſpy. But becoming weary at laſt of a war, attended with no glory or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to either, they had lately terminated all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences by a peace concluded at Campe, near Ardres. Francis having with great difficulty procured his allies, the Scots, to be included in the treaty, in return for that conceſſion he engaged to pay a great ſum, which Henry demanded as due to him on ſeveral accounts, and he left Bologne in the hands of the Engliſh as a pledge for his faithful performance of that article. But though the re-eſtabliſhment of peace ſeemed to leave the two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs at liberty to turn their attention towards Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, ſo unfortunate were the Proteſtants, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived no immediate advantage from this circumſtance. Henry appeared unwilling to enter into any alliance with them, but on ſuch conditions as would render him not only the head, but the ſupreme director of their league, a pre-eminence which, as the bonds of union or intereſt between them were but feeble, and as he differed from them ſo widely in his religious ſentiments, they had no inclination to admit <note n="h" place="bottom">Rymer, xv. 93.

Francis, more powerfully inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by political conſiderations to furniſh them with aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, found his kingdom ſo much exhauſted by a long war, and was ſo much afraid of irritating the Pope by entering into cloſe union with excommunicated Heretics, that he durſt not undertake the protection of the Smalkal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic

                  <p>BUT, notwithſtanding their ill ſucceſs in their negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations with foreign courts, the confederates found no difficulty at home, in bringing a ſufficient force into the field. Germany abounded at that time in inhabitants the feudal inſtitutions ſubſiſted in full force, and enables the nobles to call out their numerous vaſſals, and to put them in motion on the ſhorteſt warning; the martial ſpirit of the Germans, not broken or enervated by the introduction of commerce and arts, had acquired addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional vigour during the continual wars in which they had been employed for half a century, either in the pay of the Emperors, or Kings of France. Upon every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of entering into ſervice, they were accuſtomed to run eagerly to arms; and to every ſtandard that was erected, voluntiers flocked from all quarters <note n="i" place="bottom">Seck. l. iii. 161.</note>.

Accident combined with all theſe circumſtances in facilitating the levy of ſoldiers among the confederates.

The Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Heſſe, the Duke of Wurtemberg, the Princes of Anhault, and the Imperial cities of Augſburgh, Ulm, and Straſburgh, were the only powers which contributed towards this great armament: The Electors of Cologne, of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and the Count Palatine, overawed by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's threats, or deceived by his profeſſions, remained ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE immenſe number of their troops, as well as the amazing rapidity wherewith, they had aſſembled them, aſtoniſhed the Emperor, and filled him with the moſt diſquieting apprehenſions. He was, indeed, in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to reſiſt ſuch a mighty force. Shut up in Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, a town of no great ſtrength, whoſe inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſtly Lutherans, would have been more ready to betray than to aſſiſt him, with only three thouſand Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh foot, whom he had called from the frontiers of Hungary, and about five thouſand Germans who had joined him from different parts of the empire, he muſt. have been overwhelmed by the approach of ſuch a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, which he could not fight, nor even hope to retreat from it in ſafety. The Pope's troops, though in full march to his relief, had ſcarce reached the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Germany; the forces which he expected from the Low-Countries had not yet begun to move, and were even far from being compleat <note n="m" place="bottom">Sleid. 389.

His ſituation, however, called for more immediate ſuccour, nor did it ſeem practicable for him to wait for ſuch diſtant auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries, with whom his junction was ſo precarious.</p>
                  <p>BUT it happened fortunately for Charles, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates did not avail themſelves of the advantage which lay ſo full in their view. In civil wars, the firſt

Influenced by theſe conſiderations, which happily for the peace of ſociety, operate powerfully on the human mind, the confederates could not think of throwing off that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which they regularly owed to the head of the empire, of turning their arms againſt him without one ſolemn appeal more to his candour, and the impartial judgment of their fellow ſubjects. For this purpoſe, they addreſſed a letter to the Emperor, and a manifeſto to all the inhabitants of Germany. The tenor of both was the ſame. They repreſented their own conduct with regard to civil affairs, as dutiful and ſubmiſſive; they mentioned the unviolable union in which they had lived with the Emperor, as well as the many and rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>BUT Charles, though in ſuch a perilous ſituation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His only reply to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and manifeſto of the Proteſtants, was to publiſh the ban of the empire againſt the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſe, their leaders, and againſt all who

The nobles, and free cities, who framed or perfected the conſtitution of the German government, had not been ſo negligent of their own ſafety and privileges as to truſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with this formidable juriſdiction. The authority of a Diet of the empire ought to have been interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of its members could be put under the ban. But Charles overlooked that formality, well knowing, that if his arms were crowned with ſucceſs, there would remain none who would have either power or courage to call in queſtion what he had done <note n="*" place="bottom">Sleid. 386.

                  <p>THE confederates, now perceiving all hopes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation to be at an end, had only to chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would ſubmit without reſerve to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's

A few days after the ban of the empire was publiſhed, they, according to the cuſtom of that age, ſent a herald to the Imperial camp with a ſolemn decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of war againſt Charles, to whom they no longer gave any other title than that of pretended Emperor and renounced all allegiance, homage or duty he might claim, or they had hitherto yielded to him.

The command of a conſiderable body of troops raiſed by the city of Augſburgh having been given to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Schertel, a ſoldier of fortune, who by the booty he had got when the Imperialiſts plundered Rome, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the merit of long ſervice, had acquired wealth and authority, which placed him on a level with the chief of the German nobles, that gallant veteran reſolved before he joined the main body of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to attempt ſomething ſuitable to his former ſame, and to the expectation of his countrymen. As the Pope's forces were haſtening towards Tyrol, in order to penetrate into Germany, by the narrow paſſes through the mountains which run acroſs that country, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thither with the utmoſt rapidity, and ſeized Ehren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg and Cuffſtein, two ſtrong caſtles which commanded the principal defiles. Without ſtopping a moment, he continued his march towards Inſpruck, by getting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of which, he would have obliged the Italians to ſtop ſhort, and with a ſmall body of men could have reſiſted all the efforts of the greateſt armies. Caſtlealto the governor of Trent, knowing what a fatal blow this would be to the Emperor, all whoſe deſigns muſt have proved abortive, if his Italian auxiliaries had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, raiſed a few troops with the utmoſt diſpatch, and threw himſelf into the town. Schertel, however, did not abandon the enterprize, and was preparing to attack the place, when the intelligence of the approach of the Italians, and an order from the Elector and Landgrave obliged him to deſiſt. By his retreat the paſſes were left open, and the Italians entered Germany without any oppoſition, but from the garriſons that Schertel had placed in Ehrenberg and Cuffſtein, which having no

As the ſupreme command of their army was committed, in terms of the league of Smalkalde, to the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſe with equal authority, all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ariſing from a divided and co-ordinate juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which is always of fatal conſequence in the operations of war, were immediately felt. The Elector, though intrepid in his own perſon to exceſs, and moſt ardently zealous in the cauſe was ſlow in deliberating, uncertain as well as irreſolute in his determinations, and conſtantly preferred meaſures which were cautious and ſafek, to ſuch as were bold and deciſive. The Landgrave, of a more active and enterprizing nature, formed all his reſolutions with promptitude, wiſhed to execute them with ſpirit, and uniformly preferred ſuch ſchemes as tended to bring the conteſt to a ſpeedy iſſue.

                  <p>THE arrival of theſe troops enabled the Emperor to ſend ſuch a reinforcement to the garriſon of Ratiſbon, that the confederates relinquiſhing all hopes of reducing that town, marched towards Ingoldſtadt on the Danube, near to which Charles was now encamped. Meanwhile, they exclaimed loudly againſt the Emperor's notorious violation of the laws and conſtitution of the empire, in having called in foreigners to lay waſte Germany, and to oppreſs its liberties. As in that age, the dominion of the Roman ſee was ſo odious to the Proteſtants, that the name of the Pope was ſufficient to inſpire them with horror at any enterprize which he countenanced, and to raiſe in their minds the blackeſt ſuſpicions, it came to be univerſally believed among them, that Paul, not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with attacking them openly by force of arms, had diſperſed his emiſſaries all over Germany to ſet on fire their towns and magazines, and to poiſon the wells and fountains of water. Nor did this rumour ſpread only among the vulgar, being extravagant as well as fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to make a deep impreſſion on their credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; even the leaders of the party, blinded by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, publiſhed a declaration, in which they accuſed the Pope of having employed theſe antichriſtian and diabolical arts againſt them <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 399.</note>. Theſe ſentiments of the confederates were confirmed in ſome meaſure, by the behaviour of the papal troops, who, thinking nothing too rigorous towards Heretics anathematized by the church, were guilty of great exceſſes in the Lutheran territories, and aggravated the calamities of war, by mingling with it all the cruelty of bigotted zeal.</p>

                     <pb n="76" facs="unknown:011837_0895_0F9D87E5711CD0A0"/>THE firſt operations in the field, however, did not correſpond with the violence of thoſe paſſions which animated individuals. The Emperor had prudently taken the reſolution of avoiding an action with an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo far ſuperior in number <note n="b" place="bottom">Avila, 78. a.</note>, eſpecially as he foreſaw that nothing could keep a body compoſed of ſo many and ſuch diſſimilar members from falling to pieces, but the preſſing to attack it with, an inconſiderate precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy. The confederates, though it was no leſs evident to them that every moment's delay was pernicious, were ſtill prevented by the weakneſs or diviſion of their leaders from exerting that vigour, with which their ſituation, as well as the ardour of their ſoldiers, ought to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them. On their arrival at Ingoldſtadt, they found the Emperor in a camp not remarkable for ſtrength, and ſurrounded only by a ſlight entrenchment. Before the camp lay a plain of ſuch extent, as afforded ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpace for drawing out their whole army, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to act at once. Every conſideration ſhould have determined them to have ſeized this opportunity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the Emperor; and their vaſt ſuperiority in numbers, the eagerneſs of their troops, together with the ſtability of the German infantry in pitched battles, afforded them the moſt probable expectation of victory. The Landgrave urged this with great warmth, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if the ſole command were veſted in him, he would terminate the war on that occaſion, and decide by one general action the fate of the two parties. But the Elector reflecting on the valour and diſcipline of the enemies forces, animated by the preſence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and conducted by the beſt officers of the age, would not venture upon an action, which he thought to be ſo doubtful, as the attacking ſuch a body of veterans on ground which they themſelves had choſen, and while covered by fortifications, which, though imperfect would afford them no ſmall advantage in the combat. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his heſitation and remonſtrances, it was agreed, to advance towards the enemies camp in battle array, in order to make trial whether by that inſult, and by a furious cannonade which they began, they could
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:011837_0896_0F9D87E635453118"/>
draw the Imperialiſts out of their works. But the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had too much ſagacity to fall into this ſnare. He adhered to his own ſyſtem with inflexible conſtancy; and drawing up his ſoldiers behind their trenches, that they might be ready to receive the confederates if they ſhould venture upon an aſſault, calmly waited their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and carefully reſtrained his own men from any excurſions or ſkirmiſhes that might bring on an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Meanwhile, he rode along the lines, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the troops of the different nations in their own language, encouraged them by the chearfulneſs of his voice and countenance; he expoſed himſelf in places of the greateſt danger, and amidſt the warmeſt fire of the enemies artillery, the moſt numerous that had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been brought into the field by any army. Rouz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his example, not a man quitted his ranks; it was thought infamous to diſcover any ſymptom of fear when the Emperor appeared ſo intrepid; and the meaneſt ſoldier plainly perceived, that their declining the combat at preſent was not the effect of timidity in their general, but the reſult of a well weighed caution. The confederates, after firing ſeveral hours on the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, with more noiſe and terror than execution, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no proſpect of alluring them to fight on equal terms, retired to their own camp. The Emperor employed the night with ſuch diligence in ſtrengthening his works, that the confederates, returning the cannonade next day, found that, though they had now been willing to venture upon ſuch a bold experiment, the opportunity of making an attack with advantage was loſt <note n="c" place="bottom">Sleid. 395, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AFTER ſuch a diſcovery, from their own feebleneſs and irreſolution, and of the prudence as well as firmneſs of the Emperor's conduct, the confederates turned their whole attention towards preventing the arrival of a powerful reinforcement of ten thouſand foot, and four thouſand horſe, which the Count de Buren was bringing to the Emperor from the Low-Countries. But though that general had to traverſe ſuch an extent of country; though his route lay through the territories of ſeveral ſtates warmly diſpoſed to favour the confederates;
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011837_0897_0F9D87E6F0DA1E68"/>
though they were apprized of his approach, and by their vaſt ſuperiority in numbers might eaſily have detached a force ſufficient to overpower him, he advanced with ſuch rapidity, and by ſuch well concerted movements, while they oppoſed him with ſuch remiſſneſs, and ſo little military ſkill, that he conducted this body to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial camp without any loſs <note n="d" place="bottom">Sleid. 403.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the arrival of the Flemings, in whom he placed great confidence, the Emperor altered, in ſome degree, his plan of operations, and began to act more upon the offenſive, though he ſtill avoided a battle with the utmoſt induſtry. He made himſelf maſter of Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Dillingen, and Donawert on the Danube; of Nordlingen, and ſeveral other towns, ſituated on the moſt conſiderable ſtreams that fall into that mighty river. By this he got the command of a great extent of country, though not without being obliged to engage in ſeveral encounters, of which the ſucceſs was various, nor without the moſt imminent danger oftener than once of being drawn into a battle. In this manner the whole autumn was ſpent; neither party gained any remarkable ſuperiority over the other, and nothing was yet done towards bringing the war to a period. The Emperor had often foretold, with confidence, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and the want of money would compel the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to diſperſe that unwieldy body, which they had neither abilities to guide, nor funds to ſupport <note n="e" place="bottom">Belli Smalkaldici Commentarius Graeco ſermone ſcriptus a Joach. Camerario ap. Freherum, vol. iii. p. 479.</note>; but though he waited with impatience for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his prediction, there was no proſpect of that event being at hand. Meanwhile, he himſelf began to ſuffer from the want of forage and proviſions; even the Catholic provinces being ſo much incenſed at the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of foreigners into the empire, that they ſupplied them with reluctance, while the camp of the confederates abounded with a profuſion of neceſſaries, which the zeal of their friends in the adjacent countries furniſhed with the utmoſt liberality and good-will. Great numbers of the Italians and Spaniards, unaccuſtomed to the climate or food of Germany, were become unfit for ſervice

through ſickneſs <note n="f" place="bottom">Camerar. ap. Freher. 483.</note>. Conſiderable, arrears were now due to the troops, who had ſcarce received any money from the beginning of the campaign; the Emperor, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing on this as well as on former occaſions, that his juriſdiction was more extenſive than his revenues, and that the former enabled him to aſſemble a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſoldiers, than the latter were ſufficient to pay. Upon all theſe accounts, he found it difficult to keep his army in the field; ſome of his ableſt generals, and even the Duke of Alva himſelf, perſevering and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as he uſually was in the proſecution of every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, adviſing him to diſperſe his troops into winter-quarters. But as the arguments urged againſt any plan which he had adopted, rarely made much impreſſion upon the Emperor, he paid no regard to their opinion, and determined to continue his efforts in order to weary out the confederates; being well aſſured that if he could once oblige them to ſeparate, their was little probability of their uniting again in a body <note n="g" place="bottom">Thuan. 83.</note>. Still, however, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a doubtful point, whether his ſteadineſs was moſt likely to fail, or their zeal to be exhauſted. It was ſtill uncertain which party, by firſt dividing its forces, would give the ſuperiority to the other; when an unexpected event decided the conteſt, and occaſioned a fatal reverſe in the affairs of the confederates.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE of Saxony having, by the arts which have already been deſcribed, inſinuated himſelf into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's confidence, no ſooner ſaw hoſtilities ready to break out between him and the confederates of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalde, than vaſt proſpects of ambition began to open upon him. That portion of Saxony, which deſcended to him from his anceſtors, was far from ſatisfying his aſpiring mind; and he perceived with pleaſure the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of civil war, as amidſt the revolutions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions which it occaſions, opportunities which at other times are ſought in vain, of aco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iring new power as well as additional dignity, preſent themſelves to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing ſpirit. As he was thoroughly acquainted with the ſtate of the two contending parties, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their leaders, he did not heſitate long in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011837_0899_0F9D87E871AD0A80"/>
on which ſide the greateſt advantages were to be expected. Having revolved all theſe things in his own mind, and having taken his final reſolution at join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperor, he prudently determined to declare early in his favour; that, by the merit of this, he might acquire a title to a proportional recompence. With the view he had repaired to Ratiſbon in the month of May, under pretext of attending the Diet; and after many conferences with Charles or his miniſters, concluded, though with the moſt myſterious ſecrecy, a treaty, in which he engaged to concur in aſſiſting the Emperor as a faithful ſubject; and Charles, in return, ſtipulated to beſtow on him all the ſpoils of the Elector of Saxony, his dignities as well as territories <note n="h" place="bottom">Haraec. Annal. Barbant. vol. i. 628. Struvii Corp. 1048. Thuan. 84.</note>. Hiſtory ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords any treaty which can be conſidered as a more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt violation of thoſe juſt principles which ought to influence human actions. Maurice, a profeſſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, at a time when the belief of religion, as well as zeal for its intereſts, took ſtrong poſſeſſion of every mind, binds himſelf to contribute his aſſiſtance towards carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a war, which had manifeſtly no other object than the extirpation of the Proteſtant doctrines. He engages to take arms againſt his father-in-law, and to ſtrip his neareſt relation of his honours and dominions. He joins a dubious friend againſt a known benefactor, to whom his obligations were both great and recent. Nor was the Prince who ventured upon all this, one of thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious politicians, who, provided they can accompliſh their ends, and ſecure their intereſt, diſregard avowedly the moſt ſacred obligations, and glory in contemning whatever is honourable or decent. Maurice's conduct, if the whole muſt be aſcribed to policy, was more artful and maſterly; he executed his plan in all its parts, and yet endeavoured to preſerve, in every ſtep which he took, the appearance of what was fair, and virtuous, and laudable. It is probable from his ſubſequent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that with regard to the Proteſtant religion at leaſt, his intentions were upright, that he fondly truſted to the Emperor's promiſes for its ſecurity, but that, according
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011837_0900_0F9D87E9B38AC360"/>
to the fate of all who refine too much in policy, and who tread in dark and crooked paths, in attempting to deceive others, he himſelf was, in ſome degree, deceived.</p>
                  <p>HIS firſt care, however, was to keep theſe engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the Emperor cloſely concealed: And ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a maſter was he in the art of diſſimulation, that the confederates, notwithſtanding his declining all connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them, and his remarkable aſſiduity in paying court to the Emperor, ſeemed to have entertained no ſuſpicion of his deſigns. Even the Elector of Saxony, when he marched at the beginning of the campaign to join his aſſociates, committed his dominions to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which Maurice, with an inſidious appearance of friendſhip, readily undertook <note n="i" place="bottom">Struvii Corp. 1046.</note>. But ſcarce had the Elector taken the field, when Maurice began to conſult privately with the King of the Romans how to invade thoſe very territories, with the defence of which he was entruſted. Soon after, the Emperor ſent him a copy of the Imperial ban denounced againſt the Elector and Landgrave. As he was next heir to the former, and particularly intereſted in preventing ſtrangers from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his dominions into their poſſeſſion, Charles required him, not only for his own ſake, but upon the allegiance and duty which he owed to the head of the empire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſeize and detain in his hands the forfeited eſtates of the Elector; warning him, at the ſame time, that if he neglected to obey theſe commands, he ſhould be held as acceſſary to the crimes of his kinſman, and be liable to the ſame puniſhment <note n="k" place="bottom">Sleid. 391.

                  <p>THIS artifice, which, it is probable Maurice himſelf ſuggeſted, was employed by him in order that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards the Elector might ſeem a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But in order to give ſome more ſpecious appearance to this thin veil with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cover his ambition, he had called together, ſoon after his return from Ratiſbon, the ſtates of his country; and repreſenting to them that a civil war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperor and confederates of Smalkalde was
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011837_0901_0F9D87E9F711CB28"/>
now become unavoidable, deſired their advice with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the part he ſhould act in that event. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared, no doubt, and tutored before-hand, as well as deſirous of gratifying their Prince, whom they both eſteemed and loved, gave ſuch counſel as they knew would be moſt agreeable; adviſing him to offer his mediation towards reconciling the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but if that were rejected, and he could obtain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſecurity for the Proteſtant religion, they delivered it as their opinion that he ought, in all other points, to yield obedience to the Emperor. Upon receiving the Imperial reſcript, together with the ban againſt the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Landgrave, he ſummoned the ſtates of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a ſecond time; he laid before them the orders which he had received, and the puniſhment with which he was threatened in caſe of diſobedience; he acquainted them that the confederates had refuſed to admit of his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the Emperor had given him the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory declarations with regard to religion; he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his own intereſt in ſecuring poſſeſſion of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral dominions, together with the danger of allowing ſtrangers to obtain an eſtabliſhment in Saxony; and, upon the whole, as the point under deliberation reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſubjects no leſs than himſelf, he deſired to know their ſentiments how he ſhould ſteer in that difficult and arduous conjuncture. The ſtates, no leſs obſequious and complaiſant, than formerly, relying on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's promiſes as a perfect ſecurity for their religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that before he had recourſe to more violent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, they would write to the Elector, exhorting him, as the beſt means of appeaſing the Emperor, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting his dominions from being ſeized by foreign or hoſtile powers, to give his conſent that Maurice ſhould take poſſeſſion of them quietly, and without oppoſition. Maurice himſelf ſeconded their arguments in a letter to the Landgrave, his father-in-law. Such an extravagant propoſition was rejected with the ſcorn and indignation which it deſerved. The Landgrave, in return to Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, taxed him with his treachery and ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a kinſman to whom he was ſo deeply indebted; be treated with contempt his affectation of executing the Imperial ban, which he could not but know to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011837_0902_0F9D87EAB0B1E1A0"/>
void, by the unconſtitutional and arbitrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it had been iſſued; he beſought him, not to ſuffer himſelf to be ſo far blinded by ambition, as to forget the obligations of honour and friendſhip, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Proteſtant religion, the extirpation of which out of Germany, even by the acknowledgment of the Pope himſelf, was the great object of the preſent war <note n="l" place="bottom">Sleid. 405, &amp;c. Thuan. 85. Camerar 484.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT Maurice had proceeded too far to be diverted from purſuing his plan by reproaches or arguments. Nothing now remained, but to execute with vigour what he had hitherto carried on by artifice and diſſimulation. Nor was his boldneſs in action inferior to his ſubtilty in contrivance. Having aſſembled about twelve thouſand men, he ſuddenly invaded one part of the electoral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, while Ferdinand with an army compoſed of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians and Hungarians, over-ran the other. Maurice, in two ſharp encounters, defeated the troops which the Elector had left to guard his country; and improving theſe advantages to the utmoſt, made himſelf maſter of the whole electorate, except Wittemberg, Gotha and Eiſenach, which being places of conſiderable ſtrength, and defended by ſufficient garriſons, refuſed to open their gates. The news of theſe rapid conqueſts ſoon reached the Imperial and confederate camps. In the former, their ſatisfaction with an event, which it was foreſeen would be productive of the moſt important conſequences, was expreſſed by every poſſible demonſtration of joy. The latter was filled with aſtoniſhment and terror. The name of Maurice was mentioned with execration, as an apoſtate from religion, a betrayer of the German liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a contemner of the moſt ſacred and natural ties. Every thing that the rage or invention of the party could ſuggeſt, in order to blacken and render him odious; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, ſatires and lampoons, the furious declamations of their preachers, together with the rude wit of their authors, were all employed againſt him. While he, truſting to the arts which he had ſo long practiſed, as if his actions could have admitted of any ſerious juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, publiſhed a manifeſto, containing the ſame frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reaſons for his conduct, which he had formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged

                  <p>THE Elector, upon the firſt intelligence of Maurice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> motions, propoſed to return home with his troops for the defence of Saxony. But the deputies of the league, aſſembled at Ulm, prevailed on him, at that time, to remain with the army, and to prefer the ſucceſs of the common cauſe before the ſecurity of his own dominions. At length the ſufferings and complaints of his ſubjects increaſed ſo much, that he diſcovered the utmoſt impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſet out, in order to reſcue them from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Maurice, and from the cruelty of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, who having been accuſtomed to that licentious and mercileſs ſpecies of war which was thought lawful againſt the Turks, committed, where ever they came, the wildeſt acts of rapine and violence. This deſire of the Elector's was ſo natural and ſo warmly urged, that the deputies at Ulm, though fully ſenſible of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſequences of dividing their army, durſt not refuſe their conſent, how unwilling ſoever to grant it. In the perplexity, they repaired to the camp of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates at Giengen on the Brenz, in order to conſult their conſtituents. Nor were they leſs at a loſs what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> determine in this preſſing emergence. But, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered ſeriouſly the open deſertion of ſome of their allies; the ſcandalous lukewarmneſs of others who had hitherto contributed nothing towards the war; the intolerable load which had fallen, of conſequence, upon ſuch members as were moſt zealous for the cauſe, or moſt faithful to their engagements; the ill ſucceſs of all their endeavours to obtain foreign aid; the unuſual length of the campaign; the rigour of the ſeaſon; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great number of ſoldiers, and even of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who had, on that account, quitted the ſervice; they concluded that nothing could ſave them, but either the bringing the conteſt to the immediate deciſion of a battle by attacking the Imperial army, or an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their differences with Charles by a treaty. Such was the deſpondency and dejection which now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, that of theſe two they choſe what was
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011837_0904_0F9D87EC319271E8"/>
moſt feeble and unmanly, empowering a minſter of the Elector of Brandenburgh to propound overtures of peace in their name to the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>NO ſooner did Charles perceive this haughty confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, which had ſo lately threatened to drive him out of Germany, condeſcending to make the firſt advances towards an agreement, than concluding their ſpirit to be gone, or their union to be broken, he immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the tone of a conqueror; and, as if they had been already at his mercy, would not hear of a negociation, but upon condition of the Elector of Saxony's conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previouſly to give up himſelf and his dominions ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to his diſpoſal <note n="a" place="bottom">Hortentius ap. Scard. ii. 485.</note>. As nothing more intolerable or ignominious could have been preſcribed, even in the worſt ſituation of their affairs, it is no wonder this propoſition was rejected by a party, humbled and diſconcerted rather than ſubdued. But though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit tamely to the Emperor's will, they wanted ſpirit to purſue the only plan which could have preſerved their independence; and forgetting that it was the union of their troops in one body which had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto rendered the confederacy formidable, and had more than once obliged the Imperialiſts to think of quitting the field; they inconſiderately abandoned that advantage, which, in ſpite of the diverſion in Saxony, would ſtill have kept the Emperor in awe; and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Elector's intreaties, conſented to his propoſal of dividing the army. Nine thouſand men were left in the dutchy of Wurtemberg, in order to protect that province, as well as the free cities of Upper Germany; a conſiderable body marched with the Elector towards Saxony; but the greater part returned with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective leaders into their own countries, and were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed there <note n="b" place="bottom">Sleid. 411.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE moment the troops ſeparated, the confederacy ceaſed to be the object of terror; and the members of it, who, while they compoſed part of a great body, had felt but little anxiety about their own ſecurity, began to tremble when they reflected that they now ſtood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſingly to the whole weight of the Emperor's ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011837_0905_0F9D87ECF0CD06D8"/>
Charles did not allow them leiſure to recover from their conſternation, or to form any new ſchemes of union. As ſoon as the confederates began to retire, he put his army in motion, and though it was now the depth of winter, he reſolved to keep the field, in order to make the moſt of that favourable juncture for which he had waited ſo long. Some ſmall towns in which the enemy had left garriſons immediately opened their gates. Norlingen, Rotenberg and Hall, Imperial cities, ſubmitted ſoon after. Though Charles could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Elector from levying, as he retreated, large contributions upon the archbiſhop of Mentz, the abbot of Fulda, and other eccleſiaſtics <note n="c" place="bottom">Thuan. 88.</note>, this was more than balanced by the ſubmiſſion of Ulm, one of the chief cities of Suabia, highly diſtinguiſhed by its zeal for the Smalkaldic league. As ſoon as an example was ſet of deſerting the common cauſe, the reſt of the members became inſtantly impatient to follow it, and ſeemed afraid leſt others, by getting the ſtart of them in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their duty, ſhould, on that account, obtain more favourable terms. The Elector Palatine, a weak Prince, who, notwithſtanding his profeſſions of neutrality, had very prepoſterouſly, ſent to the confederates four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe, a body ſo inconſiderable as to be ſcarce any addition to their ſtrength, but great enough to render him guilty in the eyes of the Emperor, made his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments in the moſt abject manner. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Augſburgh, ſhaken by ſo many inſtances of apoſtacy, expelled the brave Schertel out of their city, and accepted ſuch conditions as the Emperor was pleaſed to grant them.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke of Wurtemberg, though among the firſt who had offered to ſubmit, was obliged to ſue for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on his knees, and even after this mortifying humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation obtained it with difficulty <note n="d" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. 589.</note>. Memmingen, and other free cities in the circle of Suabia, being now abandoned by all their former aſſociates, found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to provide for their own ſafety by throwing themſelves on the Emperor's mercy. Straſburgh and Frankfort on the Maine, cities far remote from the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011837_0906_0F9D87EDB0BC0360"/>
ſeat of danger, diſcovered no greater ſteadineſs than thoſe which lay more expoſed. Thus, a confederacy, lately ſo powerful as to ſhake the Imperial throne, fell to pieces and was diſſolved in the ſpace of a few weeks; ſcarce any member of that formidable combination now remaining in arms, but the Elector and Landgrave, whom the Emperor, having from the beginning mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out as the victims of his vengeance, was at no pains to reconcile. Nor did he grant thoſe who ſubmitted to him a generous and unconditional pardon. Conſcious of his own ſuperiority, he treated them both with haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and rigour. All the Princes in perſon, and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by their deputies, were compelled to implore mercy in the humble poſture of ſupplicants. As the Emperor laboured under great difficulties from the want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he impoſed heavy fines upon them, which he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied with moſt rapacious exactneſs. The Duke of Wur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg paid three hundred thouſand crowns; the city of Augſburgh an hundred and fifty thouſand; Ulm an hundred thouſand; Frankfort eighty thouſand; Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingen fifty thouſand; and the reſt in proportion to their abilities, or their different degrees of guilt. They were obliged, beſides, to renounce the league of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalde; to furniſh aſſiſtance, if required, towards exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Imperial ban againſt the Elector and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave; to give up their artillery and warlike ſtores to the Emperor; to admit garriſons into their principal cities and places of ſtrength; and in this diſarmed and dependent ſituation, to expect the final award which the Emperor ſhould think proper to pronounce when the war came to an iſſue <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 411, &amp;c. Thuan. lib. iv. p. 125. Mem. de Ribier, tom. i. 606.</note>. But, amidſt the great variety of articles dictated by Charles on this occaſion, he, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his original plan, took care that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to religion ſhould be inſerted, and to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree were the confederates humbled or overawed, that, forgetting the zeal which had ſo long animated them, they were ſolicitous only about their ſafety, without venturing to inſiſt on a point, the mention of which they ſaw him avoiding with ſo much induſtry. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011837_0907_0F9D87EE70397D50"/>
of Memmingen alone made ſome feeble efforts to procure a promiſe of protection in the exerciſe of their religion, but were checked ſo ſeverely by the Emperor's miniſters, that they inſtantly fell from their demand.</p>
                  <p>THE Elector or Cologne, whom, notwithſtanding the ſentence of excommunication iſſued againſt him by the Pope, Charles had hitherto allowed to remain in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the archiepiſcopal ſee, being now required by the Emperor to ſubmit to the cenſures of the church this virtuous and diſintereſted prelate, unwilling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his ſubjects, on his account, to the miſeries of war, voluntarily reſigned that high dignity. With a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration becoming his age and character, he choſe to enjoy truth, together with the exerciſe of his religion, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of a private life, rather than to diſturb ſociety by engaging in a doubtful and violent ſtruggle in order to retain his office <note n="b" place="bottom">Sleid. 418. Thuan. lib. iv. 128.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the Elector of Saxony reached the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of his country. As Maurice could aſſemble no force equal to the army which accompanied him, he, in, a ſhort time, not only recovered poſſeſſion of his own territories, but over-ran Miſnir, and ſtripped his rival of all that belonged to him, except Dreſden and Leipſic, which being towns of ſome ſtrength could not be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly reduced. Maurice, obliged to quit the field, and to ſhut himſelf up in his capital, diſpatched courier af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter courier to the Emperor, repreſenting his dangerous ſituation, and ſoliciting him with the moſt earneſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to march immediately to his relief. But Charles, buſy at that time in preſcribing terms to ſuch members of the league as were daily returning to their allegiance, thought it ſufficient to detach Albert Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of Brandenburgh Anſpach with three thouſand men to his aſſiſtance. Albert, though an enterprizing and active officer, allowed himſelf to be ſurprized by the Elector, who killed many of his troops, diſperſed the remainder, and took him priſoner <note n="c" place="bottom">Avila 99. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>n. de Ribier, tom. i. 620.</note>. Maurice continued as much expoſed as formerly; and if his enemy had known how to improve the opportunity which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011837_0908_0F9D87EF30908690"/>
itſelf, his ruin muſt have been immediate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable. But the Elector, no leſs ſlow and dilatory when inveſted with the ſole command, than he had been formerly when joined in authority with a partner, never gave any proof of military activity but in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt Albert. Inſtead of marching directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Maurice, whom the defeat of his ally had greatly alarmed, he inconſiderately liſtened to overtures of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, which his artful antagoniſt propoſed with no other intention than to amuſe him, and to ſlacken the vigour of his operations.</p>
                  <p>SUCH, indeed, was the poſture of the Emperor's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that he could not march inſtantly to the relief of his ally. Soon after the ſeparation of the confederate army, he, in order to eaſe himſelf of the burden of maintaining a ſuperfluous number of troops, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed the Count of Buren with his Flemings <note n="d" place="bottom">Avila 83 6. Mem. de Ribier, tom. i. 592.</note>, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Spaniards and Germans, together with the papal forces, would be fully ſufficient to cruſh any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vigour that yet remained among the members of the league. But Paul, growing wiſe too late, began now to diſcover the imprudence of that meaſure, from which the more ſagacious Venetians had endeavoured in vain to diſſuade him. The rapid progreſs of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial arms, and the eaſe with which they had broken a combination that appeared ſo firm and powerful, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at length his eyes, made him forget at once all the advantages which he had expected from ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat triumph over hereſy, and placed, in the ſtrongeſt light, his own impolitic conduct, in having contributed towards acquiring for Charles ſuch an immenſe increaſe of power, as would enable him, after oppreſſing the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Germany, to give law with abſolute authority to all the ſtates of Italy. The moment he perceived his error, he endeavoured to correct it. Without giving the Emperor any warning of his intention, he ordered Farneſe, his grandſon, to return inſtantly to Italy with all the troops under his command, and at the ſame time recalled the licence which he had granted Charles, of appropriating to his own uſe, a large ſhare of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:011837_0909_0F9D87EFF3A9C4E0"/>
in Spain. He was not deſtitute of pretences to juſtify this abrupt deſertion of his ally. The term of ſix months, during which the ſtipulations in their treaty were to continue in force, was now expired; the league, in oppoſition to which their alliance had been framed, ſeemed to be entirely diſſipated; Charles, in all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations with the Princes and cities which had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his will, had neither conſulted the Pope, nor had allotted him any part of the conqueſts which he had made, nor had communicated to him any ſhare in the vaſt contributions that he had raiſed. He had not even made any proviſion for the ſuppreſſion of hereſy, or the re-eſtabliſhment of the Catholic religion, which were Paul's chief inducements to beſtow the treaſures of the church ſo liberally in carrying on the war. Theſe colours, how ſpecious ſoever, did not conceal from the Emperor that ſecret jealouſy which was the true motive of the Pope's conduct. But, as Paul's orders with regard to the march of his troops were no leſs peremptory than unexpected, it was impoſſible to prevent their retreat. Charles exclaimed loudly againſt this treachery, in abandoning him ſo unſeaſonably, while he was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a war undertaken in compliance with his earneſt ſolicitations, and from which, if ſucceſsful, ſo much honour and advantage would redound to the church. To complaints he added threats and expoſtulations. But Paul remained inflexible; his troops continued their march towards the eccleſiaſtical ſtate; and in an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate memorial, intended as an apology for his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he diſcovered new and more manifeſt ſymptoms of alienation from the Emperor, together with a deep-root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed terror of his power <note n="e" place="bottom">F. Paul. 208. Pallavic. par. ii. p. 5. Thuan. 126.</note>. Charles weakened by the withdrawing of ſo great a body from his army, which was already much diminiſhed by the number of garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he had been obliged to throw into the towns which had capitulated, found it neceſſary to recruit his forces by new levies, before he could venture to march in perſon towards Saxony.</p>
                  <p>THE fame and ſplendour of his ſucceſs could not have failed of attracting ſuch multitudes of ſoldiers into
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011837_0910_0F9D87F0B0E230D0"/>
his ſervice from all the extenſive territories now ſubject to his authority, as muſt have ſoon put him in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taking the field againſt the Elector; but the ſudden and violent eruption of a conſpiracy at Genoa, as well as the great revolutions which that event, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely myſterious in its firſt appearances, ſeemed to portend, obliged him to avoid entangling himſelf in new operations in Germany, before he had fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its ſource and tendency. The form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which had been eſtabliſhed in Genoa, at the time when Andrew Doria reſtored liberty to his country, though calculated to obliterate the memory of former diſſenſions, and received at firſt with eager approbation, did not, after a trial of near twenty years, give univerſal ſatisfaction to theſe turbulent and factious republicans. As the entire adminiſtration of affairs was now lodged in a certain number of noble families, many, envying them that pre-eminence, wiſhed for the reſtitution of a popular government, to which they had been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and though all reverenced the diſintereſted virtue of Doria, and admired his talents, not a few were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of that aſcendant which he had acquired in all the councils of the commonwealth. His age, however, his moderation, and love of liberty, afforded ample ſecurity to his countrymen that he would not abuſe his power, nor ſtain the cloſe of his days by attempting to overturn that fabrick, which it had been the labour and pride of his life to erect. But that authority and influence, which in his hands were innocent, they eaſily ſaw would prove deſtructive, if uſurped by any citizen of greater am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or leſs virtue. A citizen of this dangerous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter had actually formed ſuch pretenſions, and with ſome proſpect of ſucceſs. Giannetino Doria, whom his grand uncle Andrew deſtined to be the heir of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortune, aimed likewiſe at being his ſucceſſor in power. His temper haughty, inſolent, and overbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a degree as would ſcarce have been tolerated in one born to reign, was altogether inſupportable in the citizen of a free ſtate; and the more ſagacious among the Genoeſe already feared and hated him as the enemy of thoſe liberties for which they were indebted to his uncle. While Andrew himſelf, blinded by that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011837_0911_0F9D87F172083270"/>
and undiſcerning affection which perſons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age often contract for the younger members of their family, ſet no bounds to the indulgence with which he treated him; ſeeming leſs ſolicitous to ſecure and perpetuate the freedom of the commonwealth, than to aggrandize that undeſerving kinſman.</p>
                  <p>BUT, whatever ſuſpicion of Doria's deſigns, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſſatisfaction with the ſyſtem of adminiſtration in the commonwealth, theſe circumſtances might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, they would have ended, it is probable, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than murmurings and complaints, if John Lewis Fieſco, Count of Lavagna, obſerving this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſguſt, had not been encouraged by it to attempt one of the boldeſt actions recorded in hiſtory. That young nobleman, the richeſt and moſt illuſtrious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the republic, poſſeſſed, in an eminent degree, all the qualities which win upon the human heart, which command reſpect, or ſecure attachment. He was grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and majeſtic in his perſon; magnificent to profuſion; of a generoſity that prevented the wiſhes of his friends, and exceeded the expectations of ſtrangers; of an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating addreſs, gentle manners, and a flowing affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But under the appearance of theſe virtues, which ſeemed to form him for enjoying and adorning civil life, he concealed all the diſpoſitions which mark men out for taking the lead in the moſt dangerous and dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies; an inſatiable and reſtleſs ambition, a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that diſdained ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. Such a temper could ill brook that ſtation of inferiority, wherein he was placed in the republic; and as he envied the power which the elder Doria had acquired, he was filled with indignation at the thoughts of its deſcending, like an hereditary poſſeſſion, to Gian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netino. Theſe various paſſions, preying with violence on his turbulent and aſpiring mind, determined him to attempt overturning that domination to which he could not ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>AT firſt he thought of an alliance with Francis, and even propoſed it to the French ambaſſador at Rome, as the moſt effectual means of accompliſhing this; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expelling Doria together with the Imperial faction by his aſſiſtance, he reſolved to put the republic once

more under the protection of that Monarch hoping in return for that ſervice to be entruſted with the principal ſhare in the adminiſtration of government. But having communicated his ſcheme to a few choſen confidence, from whom he kept nothing ſecret, Verrina, the chief of them, a man of deſperate fortune, capable alike of adviſing and of executing the moſt audacious deeds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated with earneſtneſs againſt the folly of expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the moſt imminent danger, while he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed another to reap all the fruits of his ſucceſs; and exhorted him warmly to aim himſelf at that pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in his country, to which he was deſtined by his illuſtrious birth, was called by the voice of his fellow-citizens, and would be raiſed by the zeal of his friends. This diſcourſe opened ſuch vaſt proſpects to Fieſco, and ſo ſuitable to his genius, that abandoning his own plan, he eagerly adopted that of Verrina. The other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent, though ſenſible of the hazardous nature of the undertaking, did not chooſe to condemn what their patron had ſo warmly approved. It was inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, in this dark cabal, to aſſaſſinate the two Dorias, as well as the principal perſons of their party, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem of government, and to place Fieſco on the ducal throne of Genoa. Time, however, and preparations were requiſite to ripen ſuch a deſign for execution; and while he was employed in carrying on theſe, Fieſco made it his chief care to guard againſt every thing that might betray his ſecret, or create ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. The diſguiſe he aſſumed was of all others the moſt impenetrable. He ſeemed to be abandoned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to pleaſure and diſſipation. A perpetual gaiety, diverſified by the purſuit of all the amuſements becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his age and rank, engroſſed, in appearance, the whole of his time and thoughts. But amidſt this hurry of diſſipation, he proſecuted his plan with the moſt cool attention, neither retarding the deſign by a timid heſitation, nor precipitating the execution by an exceſs of impatience. He continued his correſpondence with the French ambaſſador at Rome, though without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to him his real intentions, that by his means he might ſecure the protection of the French arms, if hereafter he ſhould find it neceſſary to call them to his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011837_0913_0F9D87F30B0672E0"/>
aid. He entered into a cloſe confederacy with Farneſe Duke of Parma, who being diſguſted with the Emperor for refuſing to grant him the inveſtiture of that dutchy, was eager, to promote any meaſure that tended to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his influence in Italy, or to ruin a family ſo implicitly devoted to him as that of Doria. Being ſenſible, that in a maritime ſtate, the acquiſition of naval power was what he ought chiefly to aim at, he purchaſed four gallies from the Pope, who probably was not unacquainted with the deſign which he had formed, and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of it. Under colour of fitting out one of theſe gallies to ſail on a cruize againſt the Turks, he not only aſſembled a good number of his own vaſſals, but engaged in his ſervice many bold adventurers, whom the truce between the Emperor and Solyman had deprived of their uſual occupation and ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Fieſco was taking theſe important ſteps, he preſerved ſo admirably his uſual appearance of being devoted intirely to pleaſure and amuſement, and paid court with ſuch artful addreſs to the two Dorias, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not only on the generous and unſuſpicious mind of Andrew, but deceived Giannetino, who, conſcious of his own criminal intentions, was more apt to diſtruſt the deſigns of others. So many inſtruments being now prepared, nothing remained but to ſtrike the blow. Various conſultations were held by Fieſco with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents, in order to ſettle the manner of doing it with the greateſt certainty and effect. At firſt, they propoſed to murder the Dorias and their chief adherents, during the celebration of high maſs in the principal church; but as Andrew was often abſent from theſe religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, on account of his great age, that deſign was laid aſide. It was then concerted that Fieſco ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the uncle and nephew, with all their friends whom he had marked out as victims, to his houſe; where it would be eaſy to cut them off at once without danger or reſiſtance; but as Giannetino was obliged to leave the town on the day which they had choſen, it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary likewiſe to alter this plan. They at laſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to attempt by open force, what they found dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to effect by ſtratagem, and fixed on the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſecond and third of January, for the execution
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011837_0914_0F9D87F3B0FB1BB8"/>
of their enterprize. The time was choſen with great propriety; for, as the Doge of the former year was to quit his office, according to cuſtom, on the firſt of the month, and his ſucceſſor could not be elected ſooner than the fourth, the republic remained during that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval in a ſort of anarchy, and Fieſco might with leſs violence take poſſeſſion of the vacant dignity.</p>
                  <p>THE morning of that day Fieſco employed in viſiting his friends, paſſing ſome hours among them with a ſpirit as gay and unembaraſſed as at other-times. Towards evening he paid court to the Dorias with his uſual marks of reſpect, and ſurveying their countenance and behaviour with the attention natural in his ſituation, was happy to obſerve the perfect ſecurity in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, without the leaſt foreſight or dread of that ſtorm which had been ſo long a gathering, and was now ready to burſt over their heads. From their palace he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own, which ſtood by itſelf in the middle of a large court, ſurrounded by a high wall. The gates had been ſet open in the morning, and all perſons, without diſtinction, were allowed to enter, but ſtrong guards poſted within the court ſuffered no one to return. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina, meanwhile, and a few perſons truſted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the conſpiracy, after conducting Fieſco's vaſſals, as well as the crews of his gallies into the palace in ſmall bodies, with as little noiſe as poſſible, diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through the city, and in the name of their patron, invited to an entertaiment the principal citizens whom they knew to be diſguſted with the adminiſtration of the Dorias, and to have both inclination and courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a change in the government. Of the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons who now filled the palace, a few only knew for what purpoſe they were aſſembled, the reſt aſtoniſhed at finding, inſtead of the preparations for a feaſt, a court crouded with armed men, and apartments filled with the inſtruments of war, gazed on each other with a mixture of impatience, curioſity and terror.</p>
                  <p>WHILE their minds were in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe and agitation, Fieſco appeared. With a look full of alacrity and confidence, he addreſſed himſelf to the perſons of chief diſtinction, telling them, that they were not now called to partake of the pleaſure of an entertainment, but to
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011837_0915_0F9D87F5104C8410"/>
join in a deed of valour, which would lead them to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and immortal renown. He ſet before their eyes the exorbitant as well as intolerable authority of the elder Doria, which the ambition of Giannetino, and the partiality of the Emperor to a family more devoted to him than to their country, was about to enlarge and to render perpetual. This unrighteous domination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, you have it now in your power to ſubvert, and to eſtabliſh the freedom of your country on a firm baſis. The tyrants muſt be cut off. I have taken the moſt effectual meaſures for this purpoſe. My aſſociates are numerous. I can depend on allies and protectors if neceſſary. Happily the tyrants are as ſecure as I have been provident. Their inſolent contempt of their countrymen, has baniſhed the ſuſpicion and timidity which uſually render the guilty quick-ſighted to diſcern, as well as ſagacious to guard againſt the vengeance which they deſerve. They will now feel the blow, before they ſuſpect any hoſtile hand to be nigh. Let us then ſally forth, that we may deliver our country by one generous effort, almoſt unaccompanied with danger, and certain of ſucceſs. Theſe words, uttered with that irreſiſtable fervour which animates the mind when rouzed by great objects, made the deſired impreſſion on the audience. Fieſco's vaſſals, ready to execute whatever their maſter ſhould command, received his diſcourſe with a murmur of applauſe. To many whoſe fortunes were deſperate, the licence and confuſion of an inſurrection afforded an agreeable proſpect. Thoſe of higher rank and more virtuous ſentiments, durſt not diſcover the ſurprize or horror with which they were ſtruck at the propoſal of an enterprize ſo unexpected and attrocious; as each ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the other to be in the ſecret of the conſpiracy, and ſaw himſelf ſurrounded by perſons who waited only a ſignal from their leader to perpetrate the greateſt crime. With one voice then all applauded, or feigned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud, the undertaking.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus fixed and encouraged his aſſociates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave them his laſt orders, he haſtened for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the apartment of his wife, a lady of the noble houſe of Cibo, whom he loved with tender affection, and whoſe beauty and virtue rendered her worthy of his love.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:011837_0916_0F9D87F533DBE8D0"/>
The noiſe of the armed men who crouded the court and palace, having long before this reached her ears, ſhe concluded ſome hazardous enterprize to be in hand, and ſhe trembled for her huſband. He found her in all the anguiſh of uncertainty and fear; and as it was now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep his deſign concealed, he informed her of what he had undertaken. The proſpect of a ſcene ſo full of horror as well as danger, compleated her agony; and foreboding immediately in her mind the fatal iſſue of it, ſhe endeavoured, by her tears, her entreaties and her deſpair, to divert him from his purpoſe. Fieſco, after trying in vain to ſooth and to inſpire her with hope, broke from a ſituation into which an exceſs of tenderneſs had unwarily ſeduced him, though it could not ſhake his reſolution. "Farewel," cried he, as he quitted her apartment, "you ſhall either never ſee me more, or you ſhall behold to-morrow every thing in Genoa ſubject to your power."</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as he rejoined his companions, he allotted each his proper ſtation; ſome were appointed to aſſault and ſeize the different gates of the city; ſome to make themſelves maſters of the different ſtreets or places of ſtrength: Fieſco reſerved for himſelf the attack of the harbour where Doria's gallies were laid up, as the poſt of chief importance, and of greateſt danger. It was now midnight, and the citizens ſlept in the ſecurity of peace, when this band of conſpirators, numerous, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and well armed, ruſhed out to execute their plan. They ſurprized, without reſiſtance, ſome of the gates. They got poſſeſſion of others after a ſharp conflict with the ſoldiers on guard. Verrina, with the galley that had been fitted out againſt the Turks, blocked up the mouth of the Darſena or little harbour where Doria's fleet lay. All poſſibility of eſcape being by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution cut off, when Fieſco attempted to enter the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from the ſhore to which they were made faſt, as they were unrigged and diſarmed, having no crew on board but the ſlaves chained to the oar, they were in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make reſiſtance. Every quarter of the city was now filled with noiſe and tumult, and all the ſtreets reſounding with the cry of <hi>Fieſco and liberty.</hi> At that name, ſo popular and beloved, many of the lower rank
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011837_0917_0F9D87F5F1904B20"/>
took arms, and joined the conſpirators. The nobles and partizans of the ariſtocracy, aſtoniſhed or affrighted, ſhut the gates of their houſes, and thought of nothing but ſecuring them from pillage. At laſt, the noiſe excited by this ſcene of violence and confuſion, reached the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Doria; Giannetino ſtarted immediately from his bed, and imagining that it was occaſioned by ſome mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny among the ſailors, ruſhed out with a few attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and hurried towards the harbour. The gate of St. Thomas through which he had to paſs, was already in the poſſeſſion of the conſpirators, who, the moment he entered, fall upon him with the utmoſt fury, and murdered him upon the ſpot. The ſame muſt have been the fate of the elder Doria, if Jerome de Fieſco had executed his brother's plan, and had proceeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to attack him in his palace; but he, from the ſordid conſideration of preventing its being plundered amidſt the confuſion, having forbid his followers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. Andrew got intelligence of his nephew's death, as well as of his own danger; and mounting on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, ſaved himſelf by flight. Meanwhile, a few ſenators that had the courage to aſſemble in the palace of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public <note n="y" place="bottom">Il palazza della de Signoria.</note>. At firſt, ſome of the moſt daring among them attempted to rally the ſcattered ſoldiers, and to attack a body of the conſpirators; but being repulſed with loſs, all agreed that nothing now remained, but to treat with the party which ſeemed to be irreſiſtible. Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were accordingly ſent to learn of Fieſco what were the conceſſions with which he would be ſatisfied, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſubmit to whatever terms he ſhould pleaſe to preſcribe.</p>
                  <p>BUT by this time Fieſco, with whom they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to negociate, was no more. Juſt as he was going to leave the harbour, where every thing had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his wiſh, that he might join his victorious companions, he heard ſome extraordinary uproar on board the Admiral galley. Alarmed at the noiſe, and fearing that the ſlaves might break their chains, and overpower his aſſociates, he ran thither; but the plank which reached from the ſhore to the veſſel happening to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:011837_0918_0F9D87F830B427A8"/>
overturn, he fell into the ſea, whilſt he hurried forward too precipitately. Being loaded with heavy armour, he ſunk to the bottom, and periſhed in the very moment when he muſt have taken full poſſeſſion of every thing that his ambitious heart could deſire. Verrina was the firſt who diſcovered this fatal accident, and foreſeeing, at once, all its conſequences, concealed it with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt induſtry from every one but a few leaders of the conſpiracy. Nor was it difficult, amidſt the darkneſs and confuſion of the night, to have kept it ſecret, until a treaty with the ſenators ſhould have put the city in the power of the conſpirators. All their hopes of this were diſconcerted by the imprudence of Jerome Fieſco, who, when the deputies of the ſenate enquired for his brother, the Count of Lavagna, that they might make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to him, replied with a childiſh vanity, "I am now the only perſon to whom that title belongs, and with me you muſt treat." Theſe words diſcovered both to his friends and enemies what had happened, and made the impreſſion that might have been expected upon both. The deputies, encouraged by this event, the only one which could occaſion ſuch a ſudden revolution as might turn to their advantage, aſſumed inſtantly, with admirable preſence of mind, a new tone, ſuitable to the change in their circumſtances, and made high demands. While they endeavoured to gain time by protracting the negociation, the reſt of the ſenators were buſy in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their partizans, and forming a body capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the palace of the republic. On the other hand, the conſpirators, aſtoniſhed at the death of a man whom they adored and truſted, and placing no confidence in Jerome, a giddy youth, felt their courage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>away, and their arms fall from their hands. That profound and amazing ſecrecy with which the conſpiracy had been concerted, and which had contributed hitherto ſo much to its ſucceſs, proved now the chief cauſe of its miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The leader was gone, the greater part of thoſe who acted under him, knew not his confidents, and were ſtrangers to the object at which he aimed. There was no perſon among them whoſe authority or abilities intitled him to aſſume Fieſco's place, or to finiſh his plan; after having loſt the ſpirit which animated it, life
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011837_0919_0F9D87F847A0FCD8"/>
and activity deſerted the whole body. Many of the conſpirators withdrew to their houſes, hoping, that amidſt the darkneſs of the night they had paſſed unobſerved, and might remain unknown. Others ſought for ſafety by a timely retreat; and before break of day, all of them fled with precipitation from a city, which, but a few hours before, was ready to acknowledge them as maſters.</p>
                  <p>NEXT morning every thing was quiet in Genoa; not an enemy was to be ſeen; few marks of the violence of the former night appeared, the conſpirators having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted their enterprize with more noiſe than bloodſhed, and gained all their advantages by ſurprize rather than by force of arms. Towards evening Andrew Doria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the city, being met by all the inhabitants, who received him with acclamations of joy. Though the diſgrace as well as danger of the preceding night, were freſh in his mind, and the mangled body of his kinſman ſtill before his eyes, ſuch was his moderation and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, that the decree iſſued by the ſenate againſt the conſpirators, did not exceed that juſt meaſure of ſeverity which was requiſite for the ſupport of government, and was dictated neither by the violence of reſentment, not the rancour of revenge <note n="z" place="bottom">Thuan. 93.

                  <p>AFTER taking the neceſſary precautions for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flame, which was now ſo happily extinguiſhed, from breaking out anew, the firſt care of the ſenate was to ſend an ambaſſador to the Emperor to give him a particular detail of what had happened, and to beg his aſſiſtance towards the reduction of Montobbio, a ſtrong fort on the hereditary eſtate of the Fieſci, in which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome had ſhut himſelf up. Charles was no leſs alarmed than aſtoniſhed at an event ſo ſtrange and unexpected. He could not believe that Fieſco, how bold or adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

ſoever, durſt have attempted ſuch an enterprize, but on foreign ſuggeſtion, and from hope of foreign aid. Being informed that the Duke of Parma was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the plan of the conſpirators, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſuppoſed that the Pope could not be ignorant of a meaſure, which his ſon had countenanced. Proceeding from this to a farther conjecture, which Paul's cautious maxims of policy in other inſtances, rendered extremely probable, he concluded that the French King muſt have known and approved of the deſign; and he began to apprehend that this ſpark might again kindle the flame of war which had raged ſo long in Italy. As he had drained his Italian territories of troops on account of the German war, he was altogether unprovided for reſiſting any hoſtile attack in that country; and on the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of danger he muſt have detached thither the greateſt part of its forces for its defence. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, it would not have been altogether pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Emperor to have advanced in perſon againſt the Elector, until he ſhould learn with ſome degree of certainty whether ſuch a ſcene were not about to open in Italy, as might put it out of his power to keep the field with an army ſufficient to oppoſe him.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK IX.</head>
                  <p>THE Emperor's dread of the hoſtile inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pope and French King did not proceed from any imaginary or ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuſpicion. Paul had already given the ſtrongeſt proofs both of his jealouſy and enmity. Charles could not hope, that Francis, after a rivalſhip of ſo long continuance, would behold the great advantages which he had gained over the confederate Proteſtants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling his antient emulation revive. He was not deceived in this conjecture. Francis had obſerved the rapid progreſs of his arms with deep concern, and though prevented hitherto, by circumſtances which have been mentioned, from interpoſing in order to check them, he was now convinced that, if he did not make ſome extraordinary and timely effort, Charles muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a degree of power as would enable him to give law to the reſt of Europe. This apprehenſion, which did not take its riſe from the envy of rivalſhip alone, but was entertained by the wiſeſt politicians of the age, ſuggeſted various expedients which might ſerve to retard the courſe of the Emperor's victories, and to form, by degrees, ſuch a combination againſt him as might put a ſtop to his dangerous career.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:011837_0922_0F9D87FA72FBBA30"/>WITH this view, Francis inſtructed his emiſſaries in Germany to employ all their addreſs in order to revive the courage of the confederates, and to prevent them from ſubmitting to the Emperor. He made liberal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of his aſſiſtance, and entering into a cloſe correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Elector and Landgrave, whom he knew to be the moſt zealous, as well as the moſt powerful of the whole body, he uſed every argument, and propoſed every advantage which could either confirm their dread of the Emperor's deſigns, or determine them not to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the inconſiderate credulity of their aſſociates in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their religion and liberties to his diſpoſal. While he took this ſtep towards continuing the civil war which raged in Germany, he endeavoured, likewiſe, to ſtir up foreign enemies againſt the Emperor. He ſolicited So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman to ſeize this favourable opportunity of invading Hungary, which had been drained of all the troops ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its defence, in order to form the army againſt the confederates of Smalkalde. He exhorted the Pope to repair, by a vigorous and ſeaſonable effort, the error of which he had been guilty in contributing to raiſe the Emperor to ſuch a formidable height of power. Finding Paul, both from the conſciouſneſs of his own miſtake, and his dread of its conſequences, abundantly diſpoſed to liſten to his exhortations, he availed himſelf of this favourable diſpoſition which the Pontiff began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, as an argument to gain the Venetians. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince them that nothing could ſave Italy, and even Europe from oppreſſion and ſervitude, but their joining the Pope and him, in giving the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to a general confederacy, in order to humble that ambitious Potentate, whom they had all equal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to dread.</p>
                  <p>HAVING ſet on foot theſe negociations in the ſouthern courts, he turned his attention next towards thoſe in the north of Europe. As the King of Denmark had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reaſons to be offended with the Emperor, Francis imagined that he would not be backward to approve of the league which he had projected; and leſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of caution or prudence ſhould reſtrain him from joining in it, he attempted to overcome theſe, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the young Queen of Scots in marriage to his

ſon <note n="a" place="bottom">Mem. de Rib. i. 600, 606.</note>. As the miniſters who governed England in the name of Edward VI. had openly declared themſelves converts to the opinions of the Reformers, as ſoon as it became ſafe upon Henry's death to lay aſide that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, which his unforgiving bigotry had forced them to aſſume, Francis flattered himſelf, that their zeal would not allow them to remain inactive ſpectators of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and deſtruction of thoſe who profeſſed the ſame faith with themſelves; and he hoped, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtruggles of faction incident to a minority, and the proſpect of an approaching rupture with the Scots, he might prevail on them likewiſe to take part in the common cauſe <note n="b" place="bottom">Mem. de Rib. i. 635.</note>.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Francis employed ſuch variety of expedients<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exerted himſelf with ſuch extraordinary activity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OPERATIONS ſo complicated, and which required the putting ſo many inſtruments in motion, did not eſcape the Emperor's obſervation. He was ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of Francis's intrigues in the ſeveral courts, as well as of his domeſtic preparations; and ſenſible how fatal an interruption a foreign war would prove to his deſigns in Germany, he trembled at the proſpect of that event. The danger, however, appeared to him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable as it was great. He knew the inſatiable and well directed ambition of Solyman, and that he always choſe the ſeaſon for beginning his military enterprizes with prudence equal to the valour with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them. The Pope, as he had good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, wanted not pretexts to juſtify a rupture, nor incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to begin hoſtilities. He had already made ſome

The Venetians, Charles was well aſſured, had long obſerved the growth of his power with jealouſy, which added to the ſolicitations and promiſes of France, might at laſt quicken their flow counſels, and overcome their natural caution. The Danes and Engliſh, it was evident, had both peculiar reaſon to be diſguſted, as well as ſtrong motives to act againſt him. But above all, he dreaded the active emulation of Francis himſelf, whom he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the ſoul and mover of any confederacy that could be formed againſt him; and as that Monarch had afforded protection to Verrina, who ſailed directly to Marſeilles upon the miſcarriage of Fieſco's, conſpiracy, Charles expected every moment the commencement of theſe hoſtile operations in Italy, of which he conceived the inſurrection in Genoa to have been only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>BUT while he remained in this ſtate of ſuſpenſe and ſolicitude, there was one circumſtance which afforded him ſome proſpect of eſcaping the danger. The French King's health began to decline. A diſeaſe, the effect of his intemperance and inconſiderate purſuit of pleaſure, preyed gradually on his conſtitution. The preparations of war, as well as the negociations in the different courts, began to languiſh, together with the Monarch, who gave ſpirit to both. The Genoeſe, during that interval, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Montobbio, took Jerome Fieſco priſoner, and putting him, together with his chief adherents to death, extinguiſhed all remains of the conſpiracy. Several of the Imperial cities in Germany, deſpairing of timely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from France, ſubmitted to the Emperor. Even the Landgrave ſeemed diſpoſed to abandon the Elector, and to bring matters to a ſpeedy accommodation, on ſuch terms as he could obtain. In the mean time,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011837_0925_0F9D87FCB21559A0"/>
Charles waited with impatience the iſſue of a diſtemper, which was to decide whether he muſt relinquiſh all other ſchemes, in order to prepare for reſiſting a combination of the greater part of Europe againſt him, or whether he might proceed to invade Saxony, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or fear of danger.</p>
                  <p>THE good fortune, ſo remarkably propitious to his family, that ſome hiſtorians have called it the <hi>Star of the Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> did not deſert him on this occaſion. Francis died at Rambouillet, on the laſt day of March, in the fifty-third year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign. During twenty-eight years of that time, as avowed rivalſhip ſubſiſted between him and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which involved not only their own dominions, but the greater part of Europe in wars, proſecuted with more violent animoſity, and drawn out to a greater length, than had been known in any former period. Many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances contributed to both. Their animoſity was founded in oppoſition of intereſt, heightened by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal emulation, and exaſperated not only by mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, but by reciprocal inſults. At the ſame time, whatever advantage one ſeemed to poſſeſs towards gaining the aſcendant, was wonderfully balanced by ſome favourable circumſtance, peculiar to the other. The Emperor's dominions were of great extent, the French King's lay more compact; Francis governed his kingdom with abſolute power; that of Charles was limited, but he ſupplied the want of authority by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; the troops of the former were more impetuous and enterprizing; thoſe of the latter better diſciplined, and more patient of fatigue. The talents and abilities of the two Monarchs were as different as the advantages which they poſſeſſed, and contributed no leſs to prolong the conteſt between them. Francis took his reſolutions ſuddenly, proſecuted them at firſt with warmth, and puſhed them into execution with a moſt adventrous courage; but being deſtitute of the perſeverance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſurmount difficulties, he often abandoned his deſigns, or relaxed the vigour of purſuit, from impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſometimes from levity. Charles deliberated long, and determined with coolneſs; but, having once fixed his plan, he adhered to it with inflexible obſtinacy,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011837_0926_0F9D87FD705B0B28"/>
and neither danger nor diſcouragement could turn him aſide from the execution of it. The ſucceſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes was altogether as different as their characters, and was uniformly influenced by them. Francis, by his impetuous activity, often diſconcerted the Emperor's beſt laid ſchemes; Charles, by a more calm but ſteady proſecution of his deſigns, checked the rapidity of his rival's career, and baffled or repulſed his moſt vigorous efforts. The former, at the opening of a war or of a campaign, broke in upon his enemy with the violence of a torrent, and carried all before him; the latter, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until he ſaw the force of his rival begin to abate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the end not only all that he had loſt, but made new acquiſitions. Few of the French Monarch's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts towards conqueſt, whatever promiſing aſpect they might wear at firſt, were conducted to an happy iſſue; many of the Emperor's enterprizes, even after they appeared deſperate and impracticable, terminated in the moſt proſperous manner. Francis was dazzled with the ſplendour of an undertaking; Charles was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by the proſpect of its turning to his advantage. The degree, however, of their comparative merit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, has not been fixed either by a ſtrict ſcrutiny into their abilities for government, or by an impartial conſideration of the greatneſs and ſucceſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and Francis is one of thoſe Monarchs who occupies a higher rank in the temple of fame, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his talents or performances intitle him to hold. This pre-eminence he owed to many different circumſtances. The ſuperiority which Charles acquired by the victory of Pavia, and which from that period he preſerved through the remainder of his reign, was ſo manifeſt, that Francis's ſtruggle againſt his exorbitant and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dominion was viewed by moſt of the other powers, not only with the partiality which naturally ariſes for thoſe who gallantly maintain an unequal conteſt, but with the favour due to one who was reſiſting a common enemy, and endeavouring to ſet bounds to a Monarch equally formidable to them all. The characters of Princes, too, eſpecially among their contemporaries, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not only upon their talents for government, but upon their qualities as men. Francis, notwithſtanding
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011837_0927_0F9D87FE3113FED0"/>
the many errors conſpicuous in his foreign policy and domeſtic adminiſtration, was nevertheleſs humane, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and generous. He poſſeſſed dignity without pride; affability free from meanneſs; and courteſy exempt from deceit. All who had acceſs to him, and no man of merit was ever denied that privilege, reſpected and loved him. Captivated with his perſonal qualities, he ſubjects forgot his defects as a Monarch, and admiring him as the moſt accompliſhed and amiable gentleman in his dominions, they never murmured at acts of male-adminiſtration, which in a Prince of leſs engaging diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, would have been deemed unpardonable. This admiration, however, muſt have been temporary only, and would have died away with the courtiers who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it; the illuſion ariſing from his private virtues muſt have ceaſed, and poſterity would have judged of his public conduct with its uſual impartiality; but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other circumſtance prevented this, and his name hath been tranſmitted to poſterity with increaſing reputation. Science and the arts had, at that time, made little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in France. They were juſt beginning to advance beyond the limits of Italy, where they had revived, and which had hitherto been their only ſeat. Francis took them immediately under his protection, and vied with Leo himſelf, in the zeal and munificence with which he encouraged them. He invited learned men to his court, he converſed with them familiarly, he employed them in buſineſs, he raiſed them to offices of dignity, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them with his confidence. That race of men, not more prone to complain when denied the reſpect to which they fancy themſelves intitled, than apt to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when treated with the diſtinction which they conſider as their due, thought they could not exceed in gratitude to ſuch a benefactor, and ſtrained their invention, and employed all their ingenuity in panegyric. Succeeding authors, warmed with their deſcriptions of Francis's bounty, adopted their encomiums, and refined upon them. The appellation of Father of Letters beſtowed upon Francis, hath rendered his memory ſacred among hiſtorians, and they ſeem to have regarded it as a ſort of impiety to uncover his infirmities, or to point out his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Thus Francis, notwithſtanding his inferior abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:011837_0928_0F9D87FEF481B238"/>
and want of ſucceſs, hath more than equalled the fame of Charles. The virtues which he poſſeſſed as a man, have intitled him to greater admiration and praiſe than have been beſtowed upon the extenſive genius and fortunate arts of a more capable, but leſs amiable rival.</p>
                  <p>BY his death, a conſiderable change was made in the ſtate of Europe. Charles, grown old in the arts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and command, had now to contend only with younger Monarchs, who could not be regarded as an equal match for him, who had ſtood the encounter with Henry VIII. and Francis I. and come off with honour in all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe different conteſts. By this event he was eaſed of all his diſquietude, and was happy to find that he might begin with ſafety thoſe operations againſt the Elector of Saxony, which he had hitherto been obliged to ſuſpend. He knew the abilities of Henry II. who had juſt mounted the throne of France, to be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to thoſe of his father, and foreſaw that he would be ſo much occupied for ſome time in diſplacing the late King's miniſters, whom he hated, and in gratifying the ambitious demands of his own favourites, that he had nothing to dread, either from his perſonal efforts, or from any confederacy which this unexperienced Prince could form.</p>
                  <p>BUT as it was uncertain how long ſuch an interval of ſecurity might continue, Charles determined inſtantly to improve it; and as ſoon as he heard of Francis's demiſe, he began his march from Egra, on the borders of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia. But the departure or the papal troops, together with the retreat of the Flemings, had ſo much diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his army, that ſixteen thouſand men were all he could aſſemble. With this inconſiderable body he ſet out on an expedition, the event of which was to decide what degree of authority he ſhould poſſeſs from that period in Germany; but as this little army conſiſted chiefly of the veteran Spaniſh and Italian bands, he did not, in truſting to them, commit much to the deciſion of chance, and even with ſo ſmall a force he had reaſon to entertain the moſt ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs. The Elector, it is true, had levied an army greatly ſuperior in number; but neither the experience and diſcipline of his troops, nor the abilities of his officers, were to be compared
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011837_0929_0F9D87FFB0E472F0"/>
with thoſe of the Emperor. The Elector, beſides, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> ſuperiority in number, and was alone ſufficient to have occaſioned his ruin. Inſtead of keeping his forces united, detached one great body towards the frontiers of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, in order to facilitate his junction with the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Emperor entered the ſouthern frontier of Saxony, and attacked Altorf upon the Elſter. The folly of the meaſure which the Elector had taken was immediately ſeen, the troops poſted in that town ſurrendering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance; and thoſe in all the other places between that and the Elbe, either imitated their example, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> as the Imperialiſts approached. Charles, that they might not recover from the panic with which they ſeemed to be ſtruck, advanced without loſing a moment. The Elector, who had fixed his head quarters at Meiſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, continued in his wonted ſtate of fluctuation and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. He even became more undetermined, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the danger grew near and called for prompt and deciſive reſolutions. Sometimes he acted, as if he had reſolved to defend the banks of the Elbe, and to hazard a battle with the enemy, as ſoon as the detachments which he had called were able to join him. At other times, he abandoned this as raſh and perilous, ſeeming to adopt the more prudent councils of thoſe who adviſed him to endeavour at protracting the war, and for that end to retire under the fortifications of Wittemberg, where the Imperialiſts could not attack him without manifeſt diſadvantage, and where he might wait in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſuccours which he expected from Meckle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Pomerania, and the Proteſtant cities on the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. Without fixing upon either of theſe plans, he broke down the bridge at Meiſſen, and marched along the eaſt bank of the Elbe to Muhlberg. There he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated anew, and after much heſitation, adopted one
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:011837_0930_0F9D880070EA3398"/>
of theſe middle ſchemes, which are always acceptable to feeble minds incapable of deciding. He left a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Muhlberg to oppoſe the Imperialiſts, if they ſhould attempt to paſs at that place, and advancing a few miles with his main body, encamped there in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the event, according to which he propoſed to regulate his ſubſequent motions.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES, meanwhile, puſhing forward inceſſantly, arrived the evening of the twenty-third of April on the banks of the Elbe oppoſite to Muhlberg. The river, at that place, was three hundred paces in breadth, above four feet in depth, its current rapid, and the bank poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Saxons was higher than that which he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied. Undiſmayed, however, by all theſe obſtactles, he called together his general officers, and without aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their opinions, communicated to them his intention of attempting next morning to force his paſſage over the river, and to attack the enemy wherever he could come up with them. They all expreſſed their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſuch a bold reſolution, and even the Duke of Alva, though naturally daring and impetuous, and Maurice of Saxony, notwithſtanding his impatience to cruſh his rival the Elector, remonſtrated earneſtly againſt it. But the Emperor, confiding in his own judgment, or good fortune, paid no regard to their arguments, and gave the orders neceſſary for executing his deſign.</p>
                  <p>EARLY in the morning, a body of Spaniſh and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian foot marched towards the river, and began an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant fire upon the enemy. The long heavy muſkets uſed in that age, did execution on the oppoſite bank, and many of the ſoldiers, hurried on by a martial ardour in order to get nearer the enemy, ruſhed into the ſtream, and advancing breaſt high, fired with a more certain aim, and with greater effect. Under cover of their fire, a bridge of boats was begun to be laid for the infantry; and a peaſant having undertaken to conduct the cavalry through the river by a ford with which he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, they alſo were put in motion. The Saxons poſted in Muhlberg endeavoured to obſtruct theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by a briſk fire from a battery, which they had erected; but as a thick fog covered all the low grounds upon the river, they could not take aim with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:011837_0931_0F9D880131A7DA60"/>
and the Imperialiſts ſuffered very little; at the ſame time the Saxons being much galled by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and Italians, they ſet on fire ſome boats which had been collected near the village, and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. The Imperialiſts perceiving this, ten Spaniſh ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers inſtantly ſtript themſelves, and holding their ſwords with their teeth, ſwam acroſs the river, put to flight ſuch of the Saxons as ventured to oppoſe them, ſaved from the flames as many boats as were ſufficient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their own bridge, and by this ſpirited and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful action, encouraged their companions no leſs that they intimidated the enemy.</p>
                  <p>BY this time, the cavalry, each trooper having a foot ſoldier behind him, began to enter the river, the light horſe marching in the front, followed by the men at arms, whom the Emperor led in perſon, mounted on a Spaniſh horſe, dreſſed in a ſumptuous habit, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a javelin in his hand. Such a numerous body ſtruggling through a great river, in which, according to the directions of their guide, they were obliged to make ſeveral turns, ſometimes treading on a firm bottom, ſometimes ſwimming, preſented to their companions, whom they left behind, a ſpectacle equally magnificent and intereſting <note n="d" place="bottom">Avila, 115. a.</note>. Their courage, at laſt, ſurmounted every obſtacle, no man betraying any ſymptom of fear, when the Emperor ſhared in the danger no leſs than the meaneſt ſoldier. The moment that they reached the oppoſite ſide, Charles, without waiting the arrival of the reſt of the infantry, advanced towards the Saxons with the troops which had paſſed along with him, who, fluſhed with their good fortune, and deſpiſing an enemy who had neglected to oppoſe them, when it might have been done with ſuch advantage, made no account of their ſuperior numbers, and marched on as to a certain victory.</p>
                  <p>DURING all theſe operations, which neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed much time, the Elector remained inactive in his camp; and from an infatuation which appears to be ſo amazing, that the beſt informed hiſtorians impute it to the treacherous arts of his generals, who deceived him
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:011837_0932_0F9D8801F0B7C958"/>
by falſe intelligence, he would not believe that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had paſſed the river, or could be ſo near at hand <note n="e" place="bottom">Camerar. ap. Freher. iii. 493. Struv. corp. hiſt. Germ. 1047, 1049.</note>. Being convinced, at laſt, of his fatal miſtake, by the concurring teſtimony of eye witneſſes, he gave orders for retreating towards Wittemberg. But a German ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, encumbered, as uſual, with baggage and artillery, could not be put ſuddenly in motion. They had ſcarce begun, to march when the light troops of the enemy came in view, and the Elector ſaw an engagement to be unavoidable. As he was no leſs bold in action than ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute in council, he made the diſpoſition for battle with the greateſt preſence of mind, and in the moſt proper manner, taking advantage of a great foreſt to cover his wings, ſo as to prevent his being ſurrounded by the enemy's cavalry, which were far more numerous than his own. The Emperor, likewiſe, ranged his men in order as they came up, and riding along the ranks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them with few, but efficacious words, to do their duty. It was with a very different ſpirit that the two armies advanced to the charge. As the day, which had hitherto been dark and cloudy, happened to clear up at that moment, this accidental circumſtance made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the different parties correſponding to the tone of their minds; the Saxons, ſurprized and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened, felt pain at being expoſed fully to the view of the enemy; the Imperialiſts, being now ſecure that the Proteſtant forces could not eſcape from them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the return of ſun-ſhine, as a certain preſage of victory. The ſhock of battle would not have been long or doubtful, if the perſonal courage which the Elector diſplayed, together with the activity which he exerted from the moment that the approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rendered an engagement certain, and cut off all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of heſitation, had not revived in ſome degree the ſpirit of his troops. They repulſed the Hungarian light horſe, who began the attack, and received with firmneſs the men at arms who next advanced to the charge; but as theſe were the flower of the Imperial army, were commanded by experienced officers, and
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011837_0933_0F9D8802B0CFAE88"/>
fought under the Emperor's eye, the Saxons ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to give way, and the light troops rallying at the ſame time, and falling on their flanks, the flight became general. A ſmall body of choſen ſoldiers, among whom the Elector had fought in perſon, ſtill continued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, and endeavoured to ſave their maſter by retiring into the foreſt; but being ſurrounded on every ſide, the Elector, wounded in the face, exhauſted with fatigue, and perceiving all reſiſtance to be vain, ſurrendered himſelf a priſoner. He was conducted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately towards the Emperor, whom he found juſt returned from the purſuit, ſtanding on the field of battle in the full exultation of ſucceſs, and receiving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations of his officers, upon this compleat victory obtained by his valour and conduct. Even in ſuch an unfortunate and humbling ſituation, the Elector's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was equally magnanimous and decent. Senſible of his condition, he approached his conqueror without any of the fullenneſs or pride, which would have been improper in a captive; and conſcious of his own digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he deſcended to no mean ſubmiſſion, unbecoming the high ſtation which he held among the German Princes. "The fortune of war," ſaid he, "has made me your priſoner, moſt gracious Emperor, and I hope to be treated"—Here, Charles harſhly interrupted him. "And am I then, at laſt, acknowledged to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; Charles of Ghent was the only title you lately al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me. You ſhall be treated as you deſerve." At theſe words, he turned from him abruptly, with an haughty air. To this cruel repulſe, the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans added reproaches in his own name, uſing expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſtill more ungenerous and inſulting. The Elector made no reply; but, with an unaltered countenance, which diſcovered neither aſtoniſhment nor dejection, accompanied the Spaniſh ſoldiers appointed to guard him <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid hiſt. 426.

in the purſuit, and a great number taken priſoners. About four hundred kept in a body, and eſcaped to Wittemberg, together with the Electoral Prince, who had likewiſe been wounded in the action. After reſting two days on the field of battle, partly to refreſh his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and partly to receive the deputies of the adjacent towns, which were impatient to ſecure his protection by ſubmitting to his will, the Emperor began to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Wittemberg, that he might terminate the war at once, by the reduction of that city. The unfortunate Elector was carried along in a ſort of triumph, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed every where as a captive, to his own ſubjects; a ſpectacle extremely afflicting to them, who both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and loved him; though the inſult was ſo far from ſubduing his firm ſpirit, that it did not even ruffle the wonted tranquillity and compoſure of his mind.</p>
                  <p>AS Wittemberg, the reſidence, in that age, of the Electoral branch of the Saxon family, was one of the ſtrongeſt cities in Germany, and would no be taken, if properly defended, without great difficulty, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror marched thither with the utmoſt diſpatch, hoping that while the conſternation occaſioned by his victory was ſtill recent, the inhabitants might imitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their countrymen, and ſubmit to his power, as ſoon as he appeared before their walls. But Sybilla of Cleves, the Elector's wife, a woman no leſs diſtinguiſhed by her abilities than her virtue, inſtead of abandoning herſelf to tears and lamentation upon her huſband's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, endeavoured, by her example as well as exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to animate the citizens; and ſhe inſpired them with ſuch reſolution, that, when ſummoned to ſurrender, they returned a vigorous anſwer, warning the Emperor to behave towards their Sovereign with the reſpect due to his rank, as they were determined to treat Albert of Brandenburgh, who was ſtill a priſoner, preciſely in the ſame manner that he treated him. The ſpirit of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, no leſs than the ſtrength of the city, ſeemed now to render a ſiege in form neceſſary. After ſuch a ſignal victory it would have been diſgraceful not to have undertaken it, though at the ſame time the Emperor was deſtitute of every thing requiſite for carrying it on. But Maurice removed all difficulties, by engaging to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:011837_0935_0F9D880430B8CF10"/>
furniſh proviſions, artillery, ammunition, pioneers, and whatever elſe ſhould be needed. Truſting to this, Charles gave orders to open the trenches before the town. It quickly appeared, that Maurice's eagerneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>duce the capital of thoſe dominions, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as his reward for taking arms againſt his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and deſerting the Proteſtant cauſe, had led him to promiſe what exceeded his power to perform. A bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering train was, indeed, carried ſafely down the Elbe from Dreſden to Wittemberg; but as Maurice had no ſufficient force to preſerve a ſecure communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his territories, and the camp of the beſiegers, Count Mansfeldt, who commanded a body of Electoral troops, deſtroyed a convoy of proviſions and military ſtores, and diſperſed a band of pioneers deſtined for the ſervice of the Imperialiſts. This put a ſtop to the progreſs of the ſiege, and convinced the Emperor that as he could not rely on Maurice's promiſes, recourſe ought to be had to ſome more expeditious as well as more certain method of getting poſſeſſion of the town.</p>
                  <p>THE unfortunate Elector was in his hands, and he was ungenerous and hard-hearted enough to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this, in order to make an experiment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he might not bring about his deſign, by working upon the tenderneſs of a wife for her huſband, or upon the piety of children towards their parent. With this view he ſummoned Sybilla a ſecond time to open the gates, letting her know, that if ſhe again refuſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the Elector ſhould anſwer with his head for her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy. To convince her that this was not an empty threat, he brought his priſoner to an immediate trial. The proceedings againſt him were as irregular, as the ſtratagem was barbarous. Inſtead of conſulting the ſtates of the empire, or remitting the cauſe to any court, which, according to the German conſtitution might have legally taken cognizance of the Elector's crime, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the greateſt Prince in the empire to the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a court-martial compoſed of Spaniſh and Italian officers, and in which the unrelenting Duke of Alva, a fit inſtrument for any act of violence, preſided. This ſtrange tribunal founded its charge upon the ban of the empire which had been iſſued againſt the priſoner, a
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:011837_0936_0F9D8804F03B1778"/>
ſentence pronounced by the ſole authority of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and deſtitute of every legal formality which could render it valid; but preſuming him to be thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly convicted of treaſon and rebellion, the court-martial condemned him to ſuffer death by being beheaded. This decree was intimated to the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor while amuſing himſelf in playing at cheſs with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of Brunſwick, his fellow priſoner. He pauſed for a moment, though without any ſymptom either of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize or terror; and after taking notice of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity as well as injuſtice of the Emperor's proceedings: "It is eaſy," continued he, "to comprehend his ſcheme. I muſt die, becauſe Wittemberg will not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; and I ſhall lay down my life with pleaſure, if, by that ſacrifice, I can preſerve the dignity of my houſe, and tranſmit to my poſterity the inheritance which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them. Would to God, that this ſentence may not effect my wife and children more than it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midates me! and that they, for the ſake of adding a few days to a life already too long, may not renounce honours and territories which they were born to poſſeſs<note n="g" place="bottom">Thuan. i. 142.</note>." He then turned to his antagoniſt, whom he challenged to continue the game. He played with his uſual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ingenuity, and having beat Erneſt, expreſſed all the ſatisfaction which is commonly felt on gaining ſuch victories. After this he withdrew to his own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might employ the reſt of his time in ſuch religious exerciſes as were proper in his ſituation <note n="h" place="bottom">Struvii corpus 1050.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IT was not with the ſame indifference, or compoſure, that the account of the Elector's danger was received at Wittemberg. Sybilla, who had ſupported with ſuch undaunted fortitude her huſband's misfortunes, while ſhe imagined that they could reach no farther than to diminiſh his power or territories, felt all her reſolution fail the moment his life was threatened. Solicitous to ſave that, ſhe deſpiſed every other conſideration; and was willing to make any ſacrifice in order to appeaſe an incenſed conqueror. At the ſame time, the Duke of Cleves, the Elector of Brandenburgh, and Maurice, to none of whom Charles had communicated the true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011837_0937_0F9D8805B0213678"/>
of his violent proceedings againſt the Elector, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded warmly with him to ſpare his life. The firſt was prompted to do ſo merely by compaſſion for his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and regard for his brother-in-law. The two others dreaded the univerſal reproach that they would incur, if, after having boaſted ſo often of the ample ſecurity which the Emperor had promiſed them with reſpect to their religion, the firſt effect of their union with him ſhould be the public execution of a Prince, who was juſtly held in reverence as the moſt zealous protector of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cauſe. Maurice, in particular, foreſaw that he muſt become the object of deteſtation to the Saxons, and could never hope to govern them with tranquillity, if he were conſidered by them as acceſſary to the death of his neareſt kinſman, in order that he might obtain poſſeſſion of his dominions.</p>
                  <p>WHILE they, from ſuch various motives, ſolicited Charles with the moſt earneſt importunity, not to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſentence, Sybilla, and the reſt of the Elector's family, conjured him by letters as well as meſſengers to ſcruple at no conceſſions that would extricate him out of the preſent danger, and deliver them from their fears and anguiſh on his account. The Emperor, perceiving that the expedient which he had tried began to produce the effect he intended, fell by degrees from his former rigour, and allowed himſelf to ſoften into promiſes of clemency and forgiveneſs, if the Elector would ſhew himſelf worthy of his favour by ſubmitting to reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms. The Elector, on whom the conſideration of what he might ſuffer himſelf had made no impreſſion, was melted by the tears of a wife whom he loved, and could not reſiſt the entreaties of his family. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their repeated ſolicitations, he agreed to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of accommodation, which he would otherwiſe have rejected with diſdain. The chief of them were, That he ſhould reſign the Electoral dignity, as well for himſelf as for his poſterity, into the Emperor's hands, to be diſpoſed of entirely at his pleaſure; that he ſhould inſtantly put the Imperial troops in poſſeſſion of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Wittemberg and Gotha; that he ſhould ſet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of Brandenburgh at liberty without ranſom; that he ſhould ſubmit to the decrees of the Imperial chamber,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011837_0938_0F9D88067004D4D8"/>
and acquieſce in whatever reformation the Emperor ſhould make in the conſtitution of that court; that he ſhould renounce all leagues againſt the Emperor or King of the Romans, and enter into no alliance, for the future, in which they were not comprehended. In return for theſe important conceſſions, the Emperor promiſed not only to ſpare his life, but to ſettle on him and his poſterity the city of Gotha and its territories, together with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual penſion of fifty thouſand florins, payable out of the revenues of the electorate; and likewiſe to grant him a ſum in ready money to be applied towards the diſcharge of his debts. Even theſe articles of grace were clogged with the mortifying condition of his remaining the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's priſoner during the reſt of his life<note n="i" place="bottom">Sleid. 427. Thuan. i. 142. Du Mont Corps Diplom. iv. p. 11, 332.</note>. To the whole, Charles had ſubjoined, that he ſhould ſubmit to the decrees of the Pope and council with regard to the controverted points in religion; but the Elector, though he had been perſuaded to ſacrifice all the objects which men commonly hold to be the deareſt and moſt valuable, was inflexible with regard to this point; and neither threats nor intreaties could prevail to make him renounce what he deemed to be truth, or perſuaded him to act in oppoſition to the dictates of his conſcience.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as the Saxon garriſon marched out of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg, the Emperor fulfilled his engagements to Maurice; and in reward for his merit in having deſerted the Proteſtant cauſe, and having contributed with ſuch ſucceſs towards the diſſolution of the Smalkaldic league, he gave him poſſeſſion of that city, together with all the other towns in the electorate. It was not without reluctance, however, that he made ſuch a ſacrifice; the extraordinary ſucceſs of his arms had begun to operate, in its uſual manner, upon his ambitious mind, ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new and vaſt projects for the aggrandizement of his family, towards the accompliſhment of which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Saxony would have been of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But as this ſcheme was not then ripe for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he durſt not yet venture to diſcloſe it; nor would it have been either ſafe or prudent to have offended

Maurice, at that juncture, by ſuch a manifeſt violation of all the promiſes, which had ſeduced him to abandon his natural allies.</p>
                  <p>THE Landgrave, Maurice's father-in-law, was ſtill in arms; and though now left alone to maintain the Proteſtant cauſe, was neither a feeble nor contemptible enemy. His dominions were of conſiderable extent; his ſubjects animated with zeal for the Reformation; and if he could have held the Imperialiſts at bay for a ſhort time, he had much to hope from a party whoſe ſtrength was ſtill unbroken, whoſe union as well as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour might return, and which had reaſon to depend, with certainty, on being effectually ſupported by the King of France. The Landgrave thought not of any thing ſo bold or adventurous; but being ſeized with the ſame conſternation which had taken poſſeſſion of his aſſociates, he was intent, only, how to procure favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms from the Emperor, whom he viewed as a conqueror, to whoſe will there was a neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. Maurice encouraged this tame and pacific ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by magnifying, on the one hand, the Emperor's power; by boaſting, on the other, of his own intereſt with his victorious ally; and by repreſenting the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous conditions which he could not fail of obtaining by his interceſſion for a friend, whom he was ſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to ſave. Sometimes, the Landgrave was induced to place ſuch unbounded confidence in his promiſes, that he was impatient to bring matters to a final accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. On other occaſions, the Emperor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this bold reſolution, which deſpair had ſuggeſted to an impatient ſpirit, fretted by diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was not of long continuance. Upon a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ſurvey of the enemy's power, and his own

The articles with regard to his renouncing the league of Smalkalde, acknowledging the Emperor's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſubmitting to the decrees of the Imperial chamber, were the ſame which had been impoſed on the Elector of Saxony. Beſides theſe, he was required to ſurrender his perſon and territories to the Emperor; to implore for pardon on his knees; to pay an hundred and fifty thouſand crowns towards defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the war; to demoliſh the fortifications of all the towns in his dominions, except one; to oblige the garriſon which he placed in it to take an oath of fidelity to the Emperor; to allow a free paſſage through his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories to the Imperial troops as often as it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; to deliver up all his artillery and ammunition to the Emperor; to ſet at liberty, without ranſom, Henry of Brunſwick, together with the other priſoners he had taken during the war; and neither to take arms himſelf, for the future, nor to permit any of his ſubjects to ſerve againſt the Emperor or his allies <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 430. Thuan. l. iv. 146.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Landgrave ratified theſe articles, though with the utmoſt reluctance, as they contained no ſtipulation with regard to the manner in which he was to be treated, and left him entirely at the Emperor's mercy. Neceſſity, however, compelled him to give his aſſent. Charles, who had aſſumed the haughty and imperious tone of a conqueror, ever ſince the reduction of Saxony, inſiſted on an unconditional ſubmiſſion, and would permit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be added to the terms which he had preſcribed, that could in any degree limit the fulneſs of his power, or reſtrain him from behaving as he ſaw meet, towards a Prince whom he regarded as abſolutely at his diſpoſal. But though he would not vouchſafe to negociate with the Landgrave, on ſuch a footing of equality, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:011837_0941_0F9D8808B16A6400"/>
any article to be inſerted among thoſe which he had dictated to him, that could be conſidered as a formal ſtipulation for the ſecurity and freedom of his perſon; he, or his miniſters in his name, gave the Elector of Brandenburgh and Maurice ſuch full ſatisfaction with regard to this point, that they aſſured the Landgrave, that Charles would behave to him in the ſame way that he had done to the Duke of Wurtemberg, and would allow him, as ſoon as he had made his ſubmiſſion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his own territories. Upon finding the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave to be ſtill poſſeſſed with his former ſuſpicions of the Emperor's intentions, and unwilling to truſt verbal or ambiguous declarations, in a matter of ſuch eſſential concern as his own liberty, they ſent him a bond ſigned by them both, containing the moſt ſolemn obligations, that if any violence whatſoever were offered to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, during his interview with the Emperor, they would inſtantly ſurrender themſelves to his ſons, and remain in their hands, to be treated by them in the ſame manner as the Emperor ſhould treat him <note n="b" place="bottom">Du Mont Corps Diplom. iv. p. 11, 336.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS, together with the indiſpenſable obligation of performing what was contained in the articles of which he had accepted, removed his doubts and ſcruples, or made it neceſſary to get over them. He repaired, for that purpoſe, to the Imperial camp at Hall in Saxony, where a circumſtance occurred which revived his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and increaſed his fears. Juſt as he was about to enter the chamber of preſence, in order to make his public ſubmiſſion to the Emperor, a copy of the articles which he had approved of was put into his hands, in order that he might ratify them anew. Upon peruſing them, he perceived that the Imperial miniſters had add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two new articles; one importing, that if an diſpute ſhould ariſe concerning the meaning of the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, the Emperor ſhould have the right of putting what interpretation upon them he thought moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the other, that the Landgrave was bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit implicitly to the deciſions of the council of Trent. This unworthy artifice, calculated to ſurprize him into an approbation of articles, to which he had not the moſt

With ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the Elector of Brandenburgh and Maurice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed at length on the Emperor's miniſters to drop the former article as unjuſt, and to explain the latter in ſuch a manner, that he could agree to it, without openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Proteſtant religion.</p>

The Emperor was ſeated on a magnificent throne, with all the enſigns of his dignity, ſurrounded by a numerous train of the Princes of the empire, among whom was Henry of Brunſwick, lately the Landgrave's priſoner, and now, by a ſudden reverſe of fortune, a ſpectator of his humiliation. The Landgrave was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced with great ſolemnity, and advancing towards the throne, fell upon his knees. His chancellor, who walked behind him, immediately read, by his maſter's command, a paper which contained an humble confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the crime whereof he had been guilty; an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that he had merited, on that account, the moſt ſevere puniſhment; an abſolute reſignation of himſelf and his dominions, to be diſpoſed of at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's pleaſure; a ſubmiſſive petition for pardon, his hopes of which were founded entirely on the Emperor's clemency; and it concluded, with promiſes of behaving, for the future, like a ſubject, whoſe principles of loyalty and obedience would be confirmed, and would even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive new force from the ſentiments of gratitude which muſt hereafter fill and animate his heart. While the chancellor was reading this abject declaration, the eyes of all the ſpectators were fixed on the unfortunate Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave; few could behold a Prince, ſo powerful as well as high-ſpirited, ſuing for mercy in the poſture of a ſuppliant, without being touched with commiſeration, and perceiving ſerious reflections ariſe in their minds upon the inſtability and emptineſs of human grandeur.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011837_0943_0F9D880A30D795F8"/>
The Emperor viewed the whole tranſaction with an haughty, unfeeling compoſure; and preſerving a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence himſelf, made a ſign to one of his ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to read his anſwer; the tenor of which was, That though he might have juſtly inflicted on him the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous puniſhment which his crimes deſerved, yet, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own generoſity, moved by the ſolicitations of ſeveral Princes in behalf of the Landgrave, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by his penetential acknowledgments, he would not deal with him according to the rigour of juſtice, and would ſubject him to no penalty which was not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the articles that he had already ſubſcribed. The moment the ſecretary had finiſhed, Charles turned away abruptly without deigning to give the unhappy ſuppliant any ſign of compaſſion or reconcilement. He did not even deſire him to riſe from his knees; which the Landgrave having ventured to do unbidden, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Emperor with an intention to kiſs his hand, flattering himſelf, that his guilt being now fully expiated, he might preſume to take that liberty.

                  <p>HE was received and entertained by that nobleman with the reſpect and courteſy due to ſuch a gueſt. But, after ſupper, while he was engaged in play, the Duke took the Elector and Maurice aſide, and communicated to them the Emperor's orders, that the Landgrave muſt remain a priſoner in that place under the cuſtody of a Spaniſh guard. As they had not hitherto entertained the moſt diſtant ſuſpicion of the Emperor's ſincerity and rectitude of intention, their ſurprize was exceſſive, and their indignation not inferior to it, on diſcovering how greatly they had been deceived themſelves, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly abuſed in having been made the inſtruments of deceiving and ruining their friend. They had recourſe to complaints, to arguments, and to intreaties, in order to ſave themſelves from that diſgrace, and to extricate him out of the wretched ſituation into which he had been betrayed by too great confidence in them. But the

Duke of Alva remained inflexible, and pleaded the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of executing the Emperor's commands. By this time it grew late, and the Landgrave, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what had paſſed, nor dreaded the ſnare in which he was entangled, prepared for departing, when the fatal orders were intimated to him. He was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He complained, he expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, he exclaimed; ſometimes inveighing againſt the Emperor's artifices as unworthy of a great and generous Prince; ſometimes cenſuring the credulity of his friends in truſting to Charles's inſidious promiſes; ſometimes charging them with meanneſs in ſtooping to lend their aſſiſtance towards the execution of ſuch a perfidious and diſhonourable ſcheme; and in the end, he required them to remember their engagements to his children, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to fulfil them. They, after giving way for a little to the torrent of his paſſion, ſolemnly aſſerted their own innocence and upright intention in the whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and encouraged him to hope, that as ſoon as they ſaw the Emperor, they would obtain redreſs of an injury which affected their own honour, no leſs than it did his liberty.

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:011837_0945_0F9D880BB0B75428"/>
had the mortification to find, that their former obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was forgotten, and little regard paid to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. He was ignorant, he told them, of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or private tranſactions with the Landgrave, nor was his conduct to be regulated by theſe; though he knew well what he himſelf had promiſed, which was not that the Landgrave ſhould be exempt from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but that he ſhould not be kept a priſoner during life <note n="e" place="bottom">According to ſeveral hiſtorians of great name, the Emperor, in his treaty with the Landgrave, ſtipulated that he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him in any priſon. But in executing the deed, which was written in the German tongue, the Imperial miniſters fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtituted the word <hi>ewiger</hi> inſtead of <hi>einiger,</hi> and thus the treaty, in place of a promiſe, that he ſhould not be detained in <hi>any</hi> priſon, contained only an engagement, that he ſhould not be detained in perpetual impriſonment. But authors, eminent for hiſtorical knowledge and critical accuracy, have called in queſtion the truth of this common ſtory. The ſilence of Sleidan with regard to it, as well as its not being mentioned in the various memorials which he has publiſhed concerning the Landgrave's impriſonment, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favour this opinion. But as ſeveral books which contain the information neceſſary towards diſcuſſing this point, with accuracy, are written in the German language, which I do not underſtand, I cannot pretend to enquire into this matter with the ſame accuracy with which I have endeavoured to ſettle ſome other controverted facts that have occurred in the courſe of this hiſtory. See Struv. Corp. 1052. Moſheim's Eccleſ. Hiſt. vol. ii. p. 161, 162. Engl. Edit.</note>. Having ſaid this with a peremptory and deciſive tone, he put an end to the conference; and they ſeeing no probability, at that time, of making any impreſſion upon the Emperor, who ſeemed to have taken his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution deliberately, and to be obſtinately bent on adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to it, were obliged to acquaint the unfortunate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner with the ill ſucceſs of their endeavours in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. This diſappointment threw him into a new and more violent tranſport of rage, ſo that to prevent his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to ſome deſperate extremity, the Elector and Maurice promiſed, that they would not quit the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, until, by the frequency and fervour of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, they had extorted his conſent to ſet him free. They accordingly renewed their ſolicitations a few days afterwards, but found Charles more haughty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable than before, and were warned, that if they touched again upon a ſubject ſo diſagreeable, and with
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:011837_0946_0F9D880C701E7B40"/>
regard to which he had determined to hear nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would inſtantly give orders to convey the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner into Spain. Afraid of hurting the Landgrave by an officious or ill-timed zeal to ſerve him, they not only deſiſted, but left the court, and as they did not chooſe to meet the firſt ſallies of the Landgrave's rage upon his learning the cauſe of their departure, they informed him of it by a letter, wherein they exhorted him to fulfil all that he had promiſed to the Emperor, as the moſt certain means of procuring a ſpeedy releaſe.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER violent emotions their abandoning his cauſe in this manner occaſioned, his impatience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover liberty made him follow their advice. He paid the ſum which had been impoſed on him, ordered his fortreſſes to be razed, and renounced all alliances that could give offence. This prompt compliance with the will of the conqueror produced no effect. He was ſtill guarded with the ſame vigilant ſeverity; and being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about, with the degraded Elector of Saxony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Emperor went, their diſgrace and his triumph was each day renewed. The fortitude and equanimity with which the Elector bore theſe repeated inſults, were not more remarkable than the Landgrave's fretfulneſs and impatience. His active impetuous mind could ill brook reſtraint; and reflection upon the ſhameful arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices by which he had been decoyed into that ſituation, as well as indignation at the injuſtice with which he was ſtill detained in it, drove him often to the wildeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of paſſion.</p>
                  <p>THE people of the different cities, to whom Charles thus wantonly expoſed theſe illuſtrious priſoners as a public ſpectacle, were ſenſibly touched with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult offered to the Germanic body, and murmured loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at this indecent treatment of two of its greateſt Princes. They had ſoon other cauſes of complaint, and ſuch as affected them more nearly. Charles proceeded to add oppreſſion to inſult, and arrogating to himſelf all the rights of a conqueror, exerciſed them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigour. He ordered his troops to ſeize the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and military ſtores belonging to ſuch as had been members of the Smalkaldic league, and having collected upwards of five hundred pieces of cannon, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011837_0947_0F9D880D31603E58"/>
in that age, he ſent part of them into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, part into Italy, and part into Spain, in order to ſpread, by this means, the fame of his ſucceſs, and that they might ſerve as monuments of his having ſubdued a nation, hitherto deemed invincible. He then levied, by his ſole authority, large ſums as well upon thoſe who had ſerved him with fidelity during the war, as upon ſuch as had been in arms againſt him; upon the former, as their contingent towards a war, which having been undertaken, as he pretended, for the common benefit, ought to be carried on at the common charge; upon the latter, as a fine by way of puniſhment for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. By theſe exactions he amaſſed above one mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſix hundred thouſand crowns, a ſum which appeared prodigious in the ſixteenth century. But ſo general was the conſternation which had ſeized the Germans upon his rapid ſucceſs, and ſuch their dread of his victorious troops, that all implicitly obeyed his commands; though, at the ſame time, theſe extraordinary ſtretches of power greatly alarmed a people, jealous of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and habituated during ſeveral ages to conſider the Imperial authority as neither extenſive nor formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. This diſcontent and reſentment, how induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſoever they concealed them, became univerſal; and the more theſe paſſions were reſtrained and kept down for the preſent, the more likely were they to burſt out ſoon with additional violence.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Charles gave law to the Germans like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered people, Ferdinand treated his ſubjects in Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia with ſtill greater rigour. That kingdom poſſeſſed privileges and immunities as extenſive as thoſe of any nation in which the feudal inſtitutions were eſtabliſhed. The prerogative of their Kings was extremely limited, and the crown itſelf elective. Ferdinand, when placed on the throne, had confirmed their liberties with every ſolemnity preſcribed by their exceſſive ſolicitude for the ſecurity of a conſtitution of government to which they were extremely attached. He ſoon began, however, to be weary of a juriſdiction ſo much circumſcribed, and to deſpiſe a ſceptre which he could not tranſmit to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and notwithſtanding all his former engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he attempted to overturn the conſtitution from
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:011837_0948_0F9D880DF0935D20"/>
its foundations; that inſtead of an elective kingdom he might render it hereditary. But the Bohemians ſeemed reſolved not to relinquiſh, tamely, privileges which they had long enjoyed. At the ſame time, many of them having embraced the doctrines of the Reformers, the ſeeds of which John Huſs and Jerome of Prague had planted in their country about the beginning of the preceding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the deſire of acquiring religious liberty mingled itſelf with their zeal for their civil rights; and theſe two kindred paſſions heightening, as uſual, each other's force, precipitated them immediately into violent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. They had not only refuſed to ſerve their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign againſt the confederates of Smalkalde, but having entered into a cloſe alliance with the Elector of Saxony, they bound themſelves, by a ſolemn aſſociation, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their antient conſtitution; and to perſiſt, until they ſhould obtain ſuch additional grants as they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary towards perfecting the preſent model of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or rendering it more permanent. They choſe Caſpar Phlug, a nobleman of diſtinction, to be their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and levied an army of thirty thouſand men to enforce their petitions. But either from the weakneſs of their leader, or from the diſſenſions in a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy body, which having united haſtily, was not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly compacted, or from ſome other unknown cauſe, the ſubſequent operations of the Bohemians bore no proportion to the zeal and ardour with which they took their firſt reſolutions. They ſuffered themſelves to be amuſed ſo long with negociations and overtures of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds, that before they could enter Saxony, the battle of Muhlberg was fought, the Elector deprived of his dignity and territories, the Landgrave confined to cloſe cuſtody, and the league of Smalkalde entirely diſſipated. The ſame dread of the Emperor's power which had ſeized the reſt of the Germans, reached them. As ſoon as their Sovereign approached with a body of Imperial troops, they inſtantly diſperſed, thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but how to atone for their paſt guilt, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome hope of forgiveneſs, by a prompt ſubmiſſion. But Ferdinand, who entered his dominions full of that implacable reſentment which inflames Monarchs whoſe authority has been deſpiſed, was not to be molified by
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:011837_0949_0F9D880EB1F1A8E8"/>
the late repentance and involuntary return of rebellious ſubjects to their duty. He even heard, unmoved, the intreaties and tears of the citizens of Prague, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him in the poſture of ſuppliants, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored for mercy. The ſentence which he pronounced againſt them was rigorous to extremity; he aboliſhed many of their privileges, he abridged others, and new-modelled the conſtitution according to his pleaſure. He puniſhed many of thoſe who had been moſt active in forming the late aſſociation againſt him with death, and ſtill a greater number with confiſcation of their goods, or perpetual baniſhment. He obliged all his ſubjects, of every condition, to give up their arms to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in forts where he planted garriſons; and after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming his people, he loaded them with new and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant taxes. Thus, by an ill conducted and unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effort to extend their privileges, the Bohemians not only enlarged the ſphere of the royal prerogative which they intended to have circumſcribed, but they almoſt annihilated thoſe liberties which they aimed at eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a broader and more ſecure foundation <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 408, 419, 434. Thuan. l. iv. 129, 150. Struv. Corp. ii.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, having now humbled, and, as he imagined, ſubdued the independent and ſtubborn ſpirit of the Germans, by the terror of arms and the rigour of puniſhment, held a Diet at Auſburg, in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe finally the controverſies with regard to religion, which had ſo long diſturbed the empire. He durſt not, however, truſt the determination of a matter ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the free ſuffrage of the Germans, broken as their minds now were to ſubjection. He entered the city at the head of his Spaniſh troops, and aſſigned them quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there. The reſt of his ſoldiers he cantoned in the adjacent villages; ſo that the members of the Diet, while they carried on their deliberations, were ſurrounded by the ſame army which had overcome their countrymen. Immediately after his public entry, Charles gave a proof of the violence with which he intended to proceed. He took poſſeſſion by force of the cathedral, together with one of the principal churches; and his prieſts having, by various ceremonies, purified them from the pollution
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:011837_0950_0F9D880F7373C4A8"/>
with which they ſuppoſed the unhallowed miniſtrations of the Proteſtants to have defiled them, they re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great pomp the rites of the Romiſh worſhip <note n="o" place="bottom">Sleid. 435, 437.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE concourſe of members to this Diet was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; the importance of the affairs concerning which it was to deliberate, and the fear of giving offence to the Emperor by an abſence which lay open to miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, brought together almoſt all the Princes, nobles and repreſentatives of cities who had right to ſit in that aſſembly. The Emperor, in the ſpeech with which he opened the meeting, called their attention im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the point, which ſeemed chiefly to merit it. Having mentioned the fatal effects of the religious diſſenſions which had ariſen in Germany, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his own unwearied endeavours to procure a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral council, which alone could provide a remedy ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to theſe evils, he exhorted them to recognize its authority, and to ſtand to the award of an aſſembly, to which they had originally appealed, as having the ſole right of judgment in the caſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT the council, to which Charles wiſhed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all their controverſies, had, by this time, undergone a violent change. The fear and jealouſy, with which the Emperor's firſt ſucceſs againſt the confederates of Smalkalde had inſpired the Pope, continued to increaſe. Not ſatisfied with attempting to retard the progreſs of the Imperial arms, by the ſudden recal of his troops, Paul began to conſider the Emper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> as an enemy, the weight of whoſe power he muſt ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>el, and againſt whom he could not be too haſty in taking precautions. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the immediate effect of the Emperor's acquiring abſolute power in Germany, would be to render him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely maſter of all the deciſions of the council, if it ſhould continue to meet in Trent. It was dangerous to allow a Monarch, ſo ambitious, to get the command of this formidable engine, which he might employ at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to limit or overturn the papal authority. As the only method of preventing this, he determined to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the council to ſome city more immediately under his own juriſdiction, and at a greater diſtance from the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011837_0951_0F9D881030FD36C8"/>
terror of the Emperor's arms, or the reach of his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. An incident fortunately occurred which gave this meaſure the appearance of being neceſſary. One or two of the fathers of the council, together with ſome of their domeſtics, happening to die ſuddenly, the phyſicians, deceived by the ſymptoms, or ſuborned by the Pope's legates, pronounced the diſtemper to be infectious and peſtilential. Some of the prelates, ſtruck with a panic, retired; others were impatient to be gone; and after a ſhort conſultation, the council was tranſlated to Bologna, a city ſubject to the Pope. All the biſhops in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial intereſt, warmly oppoſed this reſolution, as taken without neceſſity, and founded on falſe or frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts. All the Spaniſh prelates, and moſt of the Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, by the Emperor's expreſs command, remained at Trent; the reſt, to the number of thirty-four, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the legates to Bologna. Thus a ſchiſm commenced, in that very aſſembly, which had been call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heal the diviſions of Chriſtendom; the fathers of Bologna inveighing againſt thoſe who ſtaid at Trent, as contumacious and regardleſs of the Pope's authority; while the others accuſed them of being ſo far intimidated by the fears of imaginary danger, as to remove to a place where their conſultations could prove of no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice towards re-eſtabliſhing peace and order in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <note n="p" place="bottom">F. Paul, 248, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, at the ſame time, employed all his intereſt to procure the return of the council to Trent, But Paul, who highly applauded his own ſagacity in having taken a ſtep which put it out of Charles's power to acquire the direction of that aſſembly, paid no regard to a requeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the object of which was ſo extremely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. The ſummer was conſumed in fruitleſs nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations with reſpect to this point, the importunity of the one, and the obſtinacy of the other daily increaſing. At laſt, an event happened which widened the breach irreparably, and rendered the Pope utterly averſe from liſtening to any propoſal that came from the Emperor. Charles, as has been already obſerved, had ſo violently exaſperated Peter Lewis Farneſe, the Pope's ſon, by
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011837_0952_0F9D8811747CEB90"/>
refuſing to grant him the inveſtiture of Parma and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia, that he had watched ever ſince that time with all the vigilance of reſentment for an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging that injury. He had endeavoured to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his father into open hoſtilities againſt the Emperor, and had earneſtly ſolicited the King of France to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Italy. His hatred and reſentment extended to all thoſe whom he knew that the Emperor favoured; he perſecuted Gonzaga, governor of Milan, with ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and had encouraged Fieſco in his attempt upon the life of Andrew Doria, becauſe both Gonzaga and Doria poſſeſſed a great degree of the Emperor's eſteem and confidence. His malevolence and ſecret intrigues were not unknown to the Emperor, who could not be more deſirous to take vengeance on him, than Gonzaga and Doria were to be employed as his inſtruments in inflicting it. Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>neſe, by the profligacy of his life, and by enormities of every kind, equal to thoſe committed by the worſt tyrants who have diſgraced human nature, had rendered himſelf ſo odious, that they thought any violence whatever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be attempted againſt him. They ſoon found among his own ſubjects, perſons who were eager, and even deemed it meritorious to lend their hands in ſuch a ſervice. As he, animated with the jealouſy which uſually poſſeſſes petty Sovereigns, had employed all the cruelty and fraud, whereby they endeavour to ſupply their defect of power, in order to humble and extirpate the nobility ſubject to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, five noblemen of the greateſt diſtinction in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia, combined to avenge the injuries, which they themſelves had ſuffered, as well as thoſe which he had offered to their order. They formed their plan in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Gonzaga; but it remains uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he originally ſuggeſted the ſcheme to them, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved of what they propoſed, and co-operated in carrying it on. They concerted all the previous ſteps with ſuch foreſight, conducted their intrigues with ſuch ſecrecy, and diſplayed ſuch courage in the execution of their deſign, that it may be ranked among the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious deeds of that nature mentioned in hiſtory. One body of the conſpirators ſurprized, at mid-day, the gates of the citadel of Placentia where Farneſe reſided, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011837_0953_0F9D8811B073EA58"/>
his guards, and murdered him. Another party of them made themſelves maſters of the town, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their fellow-citizens to take arms, in order to reaſſume their liberty. The multitude ran towards the citadel, from which three great guns, a ſignal concerted with Gonzaga, had been fired; and before they could gueſs the cauſe or the authors of the tumult, they ſaw the lifeleſs body of the tyrant hanging by the heels from one of the windows of the citadel. But ſo univerſally deteſtable had he become, that not one expreſſed any ſentiment of concern at ſuch a ſad reverſe of fortune, or of indignation at this ignominious treatment of a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince. The exultation at the ſucceſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was general, and all applauded the actors in it, as the deliverers of their country. The body was tumbled into the ditch that ſurrounded the citadel, and expoſed to the inſults of the rabble; the reſt of the citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their uſual occupations, as if nothing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary had happened.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE next morning, a body of troops arriving from the frontiers of the Milaneſe, where they had been poſted in expectation of the event, took poſſeſſion of the city in the Emperor's name, and reinſtated the inhabitants in the poſſeſſion of their antient privileges. Parma, which the Imperialiſts attempted likewiſe to ſurprize, was ſaved by the vigilance and fidelity of the officers whom Farneſe had intruſted with the command of the garriſon. The death of a ſon whom, notwithſtanding his infamous vices, Paul loved with an exceſs of parental tenderneſs, overwhelmed him with the deepeſt affliction; and the loſs of a city, of ſuch conſequence as Placentia, greatly embittered his ſorrow. He accuſed Gonzaga, in open conſiſtory, of having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a cruel murder in order to prepare the way for an unjuſt uſurpation, and immediately demanded of the Emperor ſatisfaction for both; for the former, by the puniſhment of Gonzaga; for the latter by the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Placentia to his grandſon Octavio, its rightful owner. But Charles, who, rather than quit a prize of ſuch value, was willing to expoſe himſelf to the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being acceſſary to the crime which had given an opportunity of ſeizing it, and to bear the infamy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding his own ſon-in-law of the inheritance which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011837_0954_0F9D881272681D20"/>
to him, eluded all his ſolicitations, and determined to keep poſſeſſion of the city together with its territories <note n="q" place="bottom">F. Paul. 257. Pallavic. 41, 42. Thuan. iv. 156. Mem. de Ribier. 59, 67. Natalis Comitis Hiſtor. lib. iii. p. 64.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS reſolution, flowing from an ambition ſo rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to be reſtrained by no conſideration either of decency or juſtice, tranſported the Pope ſo far beyond his uſual moderation and caution, that he was eager to take arms againſt the Emperor in order to be avenged on the murderers of his ſon, and to recover the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wreſted from his family. Conſcious, however, of his own inability to contend with ſuch an enemy, he warmly ſolicited the French King and the republic of Venice to join in an offenſive league againſt Charles. But Henry was intent, at that time, on other objects. His antient allies the Scots, having been defeated by the Engliſh in one of the greateſt battles ever fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two rival nations, he was about to ſend a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous body of veteran troops into that country, as well to preſerve it from being conquered, as to gain the acquiſition of a new kingdom to the French monarchy, by marrying his ſon the Dauphin to the young Queen of Scotland. An undertaking accompanied with ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt advantages, the ſucceſs of which appeared to be ſo certain, was not to be relinquiſhed for the remote proſpect of benefit from an alliance depending upon the precarious life of a Pope of fourſcore, who had nothing at heart but the gratification of his own private reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inſtead, therefore, of ruſhing headlong into the alliance propoſed, Henry amuſed the Pope with ſuch general profeſſions and promiſes, as might keep him from any thoughts of endeavouring to accommodate his differences with the Emperor, but at the ſame time avoided any ſuch engagement as might occaſion an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate rupture between Charles and himſelf, or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate him into a war for which he was not prepared. The Venetians, though much alarmed at ſeeing Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in the hands of the Imperialiſts, imitated the wary conduct of the French King, which reſembled ſo nearly the ſpirit with which they themſelves uſually carried on their negociations <note n="r" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 63, 71, 78, 85, 95.

                     <pb n="136" facs="unknown:011837_0955_0F9D881330C48710"/>BUT, though the Pope found that it was not in his power to light up immediately the flames of war, he did not forget the injuries, which he was obliged for the preſent to endure; reſentment ſettled deeper in his mind, and became more rancorous in proportion as he felt the difficulty of gratifying it. It was, while theſe ſentiments of enmity were in full force, and the deſire of vengeance at its height, that the Diet of Augſburg, by the Emperor's command, petitioned the Pope, in name of the whole Germanic body, to enjoin the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates who had retired to Bologna, to return again to Trent, and to renew their deliberations in that place. Charles had been at great pains in bringing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to join in this requeſt. Having obſerved a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable variety of ſentiments among the Proteſtants with reſpect to the ſubmiſſion which he had required to the decrees of the council, ſome of them being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether intractable, while others were ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its right of juriſdiction upon certain conditions, he employed all his addreſs in order to gain or to divide them. He threatened and over-awed the Elector Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine, a weak Prince, and obnoxious to vengeance on account of the aſſiſtance which he had given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of Smalkalde. The hope of procuring liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Landgrave, together with the formal confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his own electoral dignity, overcame Maurice's ſcruples, or prevented him from oppoſing what he knew would be agreeable to the Emperor. The Elector of Brandenburgh, leſs influenced by religious zeal than any Prince of that age, was eaſily induced to imitate their example in aſſenting to all that the Emperor required. The deputies of the cities remained ſtill to be brought over; they were more tenacious of their principles, and though every thing that could operate either on their hopes or fears was tried, the utmoſt that they would promiſe was to acknowledge the juriſdiction of the council, if effectual proviſion were made for ſecuring the divines of all parties free acceſs to that aſſembly, with entire liberty of debate; and if all points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy were decided according to ſcripture and the uſage of the primitive church. But when the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, containing this declaration, was preſented to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011837_0956_0F9D881480CC6C08"/>
he ventured to put in practice a very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary artifice. Without reading the paper, or taking any notice of the conditions on which they had inſiſted, he ſeemed to take it for granted that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with his demand, and gave thanks to the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their full and unreſerved ſubmiſſion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the council. The deputies, though aſtoniſhed at what they had heard, did not attempt to ſet him right, both parties being better pleaſed that the matter ſhould remain under this ſtate of ambiguity, than to puſh for an explanation, which muſt have occaſioned a diſpute, and would have led, perhaps, to a rupture <note n="s" place="bottom">F. Paul, 259. Sleid. 440. Thuan. tom. i. 155.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAVING obtained this ſeeming ſubmiſſion of the Diet to the authority of the council, Charles employed that as an argument to enforce their petition for its return to Trent. But the Pope, from the ſatisfaction of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Emperor, as well as from his own averſion to what was demanded, reſolved, without heſitation, that this petition ſhould be rejected; though, in order to avoid the imputation of being influenced wholly by reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he had the addreſs to throw it upon the fathers at Bologna, to put a direct negative upon the requeſt. He referred to their conſideration the petition of the Diet, and they, ready to confirm by their aſſent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the legates were pleaſed to dictate declared, that the council could not, in conſiſtence with its dignity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Trent, unleſs the prelates, who, by remaining there, had diſcovered a ſchiſmatic ſpirit, would firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Bologna, and join their brethren; and that, even after their junction, the council could not renew its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations with any proſpect of benefit to the church, if the Germans did not prove their intention of obeying its future decrees to be ſincere, by yielding immediate obedience to thoſe which it had already paſſed <note n="t" place="bottom">F. Paul, 250. Pallav. ii. 49.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS anſwer was communicated to the Emperor by the Pope, who, at the ſame time, exhorted him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with demands that appeared to be ſo reaſonable. But Charles was better acquainted with the duplicity of the Pope's character than to be deceived by ſuch a
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:011837_0957_0F9D8814B1464200"/>
groſs artifice; he knew that the prelates of Bologna durſt utter no ſentiment but what Paul inſpired; and, therefore, overlooking them as mere inſtruments in the hand of another, he conſidered their reply as a full diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Pope's intentions. As he could no longer hope to acquire ſuch an aſcendant in the council as to render it ſubſervient to his own plan, he ſaw it to be neceſſary that Paul ſhould not have it in his power to turn againſt him the authority of ſo venerable an aſſembly. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent this, he ſent two Spaniſh lawyers to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna, who, in the preſence of the legates, proteſted, That the tranſlation of the council to that place had been unneceſſary, and founded on falſe or frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts; that while it continued to meet there, it ought to be deemed an unlawful and ſchiſmatical conventicle; that all its deciſions ought of courſe to be held as null and invalid; and that as the Pope, together with the corrupt eccleſiaſtics who depended on him, had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the care of the church, the Emperor, as its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, would employ all the power which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, in order to preſerve it from thoſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with which it was threatened. A few days after, the Imperial ambaſſador at Rome demanded an audience of the Pope, and in preſence of all the cardinals as well as foreign miniſters, proteſted againſt the proceedings of the prelates at Bologna, in terms equally harſh and diſreſpectful <note n="u" place="bottom">F. Paul, 264. Pallav. 51. Sleid. 4, 6. Goldaſti Conſtit. Imperial. i. 561.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IT was not long before Charles proceeded to carry theſe threats, which greatly alarmed both the Pope and council at Bologna, into execution. He let the Diet know the ill ſucceſs of his endeavours to procure a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable anſwer to their petitions, and that the Pope, equally regardleſs of their entreaties, and of his ſervices to the church, had refuſed to gratify them, by allowing the council to meet again at Trent; that, though all hope of holding this aſſembly in a place where they might look for freedom of debate and judgment, was not to be given up, the proſpect of it was, at preſent, diſtant and uncertain; that, in the mean time, Germany
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:011837_0958_0F9D881571EE8FF0"/>
was torn in pieces by religious diſſenſions, the purity of the faith corrupted, and the minds of the people diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with a multiplicity of new opinions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, formerly unknown among Chriſtians; that, moved by the duty which he owed to them as their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and to the church as its protector, he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome divines, of known abilities and learning, to prepare a ſyſtem of doctrine, to which all ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form until a council, ſuch as they wiſhed for, could be convocated. This ſyſtem was compiled by Pflug, Held<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Agricola, of whom the two former were digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries in the Romiſh church, but remarkable for their pacific and healing ſpirit; the laſt was a Proteſtant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ſuſpected, not without reaſon, of having been gained by bribes and promiſes, to betray or miſlead his party on this occaſion. The articles preſented to the Diet of Ratiſbon, in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty-one, in order to reconcile the contending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſerved as a model for the preſent work. But as the Emperor's ſituation was much changed ſince that time, and he found it no longer neceſſary to manage the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants with the ſame delicacy as at that juncture, the conceſſions in their favour were not now ſo numerous, nor did they extend to points of ſo much conſequence. The treatiſe contained a compleat ſyſtem of theology, conformable in almoſt every article to the tenets of the Romiſh church, though expreſſed, for the moſt part, in the ſofteſt words, or in ſcriptural phraſes, or in terms of ſtudied ambiguity. Every doctrine, however, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Popery, was retained; and all the rites, which the Proteſtants condemned as inventions of men, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the worſhip of God, were enjoined. With regard to two points only, ſome relaxation of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour was granted, and ſome latitude in practice admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Such eccleſiaſtics as had married, and would not put away their wives, were allowed nevertheleſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the functions of their ſacred office; and thoſe provinces which had been accuſtomed to partake of the cup, as well as of the bread in the ſacrament of the Lord's Supper, were ſtill indulged the privilege of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both. Even theſe were declared to be conceſſions for the ſake of peace, and granted only for a ſeaſon, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance

                  <p>THIS ſyſtem of doctrine, known afterwards by the name of the <hi>Interim,</hi> becauſe it contained temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations which were to continue no longer in force than until a free general council could be held, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror preſented to the Diet, with a pompous declaration of his ſincere intention to re-eſtabliſh tranquillity and order in the church, as well as of his hopes that their adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe regulations would contribute greatly to bring about that deſirable event. It was read, in preſence, according to form. As ſoon as it was finiſhed the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Mentz, preſident of the electoral college, roſe up haſtily, and having thanked the Emperor for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied and pious endeavours in order to reſtore peace to the church, he, in name of the Diet, ſignified their approbation of the ſyſtem of doctrine which he had prepared, together with their reſolution of conforming to it in every particular. The whole aſſembly was amazed at a declaration ſo unprecedented and unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional, as well as at the Elector's preſumption, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to deliver the ſenſe of the Diet, upon a point, which had not hitherto been the ſubject of conſultation or debate. But not one member had the courage to contradict what the Elector had ſaid; ſome being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by fears, others remaining ſilent through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. The Emperor held the archbiſhop's decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be a full conſtitutional ratification of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, and prepared to enforce the obſervance of it, as a decree of the empire <note n="y" place="bottom">Sleid. 460. F. Paul, 273. Pallav. 63.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING this Diet, the wife and children of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, warmly ſeconded by Maurice of Saxony, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to intereſt the members in behalf of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prince, who ſtill languiſhed in confinement. But Charles, who did not chooſe to be brought under the neceſſity of rejecting any requeſt that came from ſuch a reſpectable body, in order to prevent their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, laid before the Diet an account of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:011837_0960_0F9D8816F089E358"/>
with the Landgrave, together with the motives which had at firſt induced him to detain that Prince in cuſtody, and which rendered it prudent, as he alledged, to keep him ſtill under reſtraint. It was no eaſy matter to give any good reaſon for an action, incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified. But he thought the moſt frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts might be produced in an aſſembly willing to be deceived, and afraid of nothing ſo much as to diſcover that it ſaw his conduct in its true colours. His account of his own conduct was accordingly admitted to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfactory, and after ſome feeble intreaties that he would extend his clemency to his unfortunate priſoner, the Landgrave's concerns were no more mentioned <note n="z" place="bottom">Sleid. 441.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN order to counterbalance the unfavourable impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which this inflexible rigour might leave in their minds, Charles, as a proof that his gratitude was no leſs permanent and unchangeable than his reſentment, inveſted Maurice, in the electoral dignity, with all the legal formalities. The ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp, in an open court, ſo near the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the degraded Elector was kept a priſoner, that he could view it from his windows. Even this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult did not ruffle his uſual tranquillity; and turning his eyes that way, he beheld a proſperous rival receiving thoſe enſigns of dignity of which he had been ſtripped, without uttering one ſentiment unbecoming the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which he had preſerved amidſt all his calamities <note n="a" place="bottom">Thuan.

                  <p>IMMEDIATELY after the diſſolution of the Diet, the Emperor ordered the Interim to be publiſhed in the German as well as Latin language. It met with the uſual reception of conciliating ſchemes when propoſed to men heated with diſputation; both parties declaimed againſt it with equal violence. The Proteſtants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it as a ſyſtem containing the groſſeſt errors of Popery, diſguiſed with ſo little art, that it could impoſe only on the moſt ignorant, or on thoſe who by wilfully ſhutting their eyes favoured the deception. The Papiſts inveighed againſt it, as a work, in which ſome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:011837_0961_0F9D8817B14D5680"/>
of the church were impiouſly given up, others meanly concealed, and all of them delivered in terms calculated rather to deceive the unwary, than to inſtruct the ignorant, or to reclaim thoſe who were enemies to the truth. While the Lutheran divines fiercely attacked it, on one hand, the general of the Dominicans with no leſs vehemence impugned it, on the other. But at Rome, as ſoon as the contents of the Interim came to be known, the indignation of the courtiers and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics roſe to the greateſt height. They exclaimed againſt the Emperor's profane encroachment on the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal function, in preſuming, with the concurrence of an aſſembly of laymen, to define articles of faith, and to regulate modes of worſhip. They compared this raſh deed to that of Uzzah, who, with an unhallowed hand, had touched the ark of God; or to the bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of thoſe Emperors, who had rendered their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory deteſtable, by endeavouring to model the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church according to their pleaſure. They even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to find out a reſemblance between the Emperor's conduct and that of Henry VIII. and expreſſed their fear of his imitating the example of that Monarch, by uſurping the title as well as juriſdiction belonging to the head of the church. All therefore, contended, with one voice, that as the foundations of eccleſiaſtical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were now ſhaken, and the whole fabrick ready to be overturned by a new enemy; ſome powerful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of defence muſt be provided, and a vigorous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance muſt be made, at the beginning, before he grew too formidable to be oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, whoſe judgment was improved by longer experience in great tranſactions, as well as by a more extenſive obſervation of human affairs, viewed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with more acute diſcernment, and derived comfort from the very circumſtance which filled them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. He was aſtoniſhed, that a Prince of ſuch ſuperior ſagacity, as the Emperor, ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with a ſingle victory, as to imagine that he might give law to mankind, and decide even in thoſe matters, with regard to which they are moſt impatient of dominion. He ſaw that, by joining any one of the contending parties in Germany, Charles might have
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:011837_0962_0F9D881870B89C48"/>
had it in his power to have oppreſſed the other, but that the preſumption of ſucceſs had now inſpired him with the vain thought of his being able to domineer over both; he foretold that a ſyſtem, which all attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none defended, could not be of long duration; and that, for this reaſon, there was no need of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing in order to haſten its fall; for as ſoon as the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful hand which now upheld it was withdrawn, it would ſink of its own accord, and be forgotten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note n="b" place="bottom">Sleid. 468. F. Paul, 271, 277. Pallav. ii. 64.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Emperor, fond of his own plan, adhered to his reſolution of carrying it into full execution. But though the Elector Palatine, the Elector of Brandenburgh, and Maurice, influenced by the ſame conſiderations as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſeemed ready to yield implicit obedience to whatever he ſhould enjoin, he met not every where with a like obſequious ſubmiſſion. John Marquis of Brandenburgh Anſpach, although he had taken part with great zeal in the war againſt the confederates of Smalkalde, refuſed to renounce doctrines which he held to be ſacred, and reminding the Emperor of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated promiſes which he had given his Proteſtant allies, of allowing them the free exerciſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he claimed, in conſequence of theſe, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from receiving the Interim. Some other Princes, alſo, ventured to mention the ſame ſcruples, and to plead the ſame indulgence. But on this, as on other trying occaſions, the firmneſs of the Elector of Saxony was moſt diſtinguiſhed, and merited the higheſt praiſe. Charles, well knowing the authority of his example with all the Proteſtant party, laboured, with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, to gain his approbation of the Interim, and by employing ſometimes promiſes of ſetting him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſometimes threats of treating him with greater harſhneſs, attempted alternately to work upon his hopes and fears. But he was, alike, regardleſs of both. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having declared his fixed belief in the doctrines of the Reformation, "I cannot now," ſaid he, "in my old age, abandon the principles, for which I early contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor, in order to procure freedom during a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:011837_0963_0F9D8819302126D8"/>
years, will I betray that good cauſe, on account of which I have ſuffered ſo much, and am ſtill willing to ſuffer. Better for me to enjoy, in this ſolitude, the eſteem of virtuous men, together with the approbation of my own conſcience, than to return into the world, with the imputation and guilt of apoſtacy, to diſgrace and embitter the remainder of my days." By this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous reſolution, he ſet his countrymen a pattern of conduct, ſo very different from that which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror wiſhed to have exhibited to them, that it drew upon him freſh marks of his indignation. The rigour of his confinement was increaſed; the number of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants abridged; the Lutheran clergymen who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been permitted to attend him, were diſmiſſed; and even the books of devotion, which had been his chief conſolation during a tedious impriſonment, were taken from him <note n="c" place="bottom">Sleid. 462.</note>. The Landgrave of Heſſe, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in misfortune, did not maintain the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. His patience and fortitude were both ſo much exhauſted by the length of his confinement, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to purchaſe freedom at any price, he wrote to the Emperor, offering not only to approve of the Interim, but to yield an unreſerved ſubmiſſion to his will in every other particular. But Charles, who knew, that what courſe ſoever the Landgrave might hold, neither his example nor authority would prevail on his children or ſubjects to receive the Interim, paid no regard to his offers. He was kept confined as ſtrictly as ever; and while he ſuffered the cruel mortification of having his conduct ſet in contraſt to that of the Elector, he deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the ſmalleſt benefit from the mean ſtep which expoſed him to ſuch deſerved cenſure <note n="d" place="bottom">Sleid. 462.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT it was in the Imperial cities that Charles met with the moſt violent oppoſition to the Interim. Theſe ſmall commonwealths, the citizens of which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to liberty and independence, had embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, when firſt publiſhed, with remarkable eagerneſs; the bold ſpirit of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being peculiarly ſuited to the genius of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Among them, the Proteſtant teachers had
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011837_0964_0F9D8819F17237E8"/>
made the greateſt number of proſelytes. The moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent divines of the party were ſettled there as paſtors. By having the direction of the ſchools and other ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of learning, they had trained up diſciples as well inſtructed in the articles of their faith, as zealous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. Such perſons were not to be guided by example, or ſwayed by authority, but having been taught to examine, and to decide in matters of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, thought that they were both qualified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to judge for themſelves. As ſoon as the contents of the Interim were known, they, with one voice, joined in refuſing to admit it. Straſburgh, Conſtance, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Magdeburgh, together with many other towns of leſs note, preſented remonſtrances to the Emperor, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the irregular and unconſtitutional manner in which the Interim had been enacted, and beſeeching him not to offer ſuch violence to their conſciences, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their aſſent to a form of doctrine and worſhip, which appeared to them repugnant to the expreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the divine law. But Charles, having prevailed on ſo many Princes of the empire to approve of his new model, was not much moved by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe cities, which, how formidable ſoever they might have proved, it they could have been formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one body, lay ſo remote from each other, that it was eaſy to oppreſs them ſeparately, before it was poſſible for them to unite.</p>
                  <p>IN order to accompliſh this, the Emperor ſaw it to be requiſite that his meaſures ſhould be vigorous, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with ſuch rapidity as to allow no time for concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any common plan of oppoſition. Having laid down this maxim as the rule of his proceedings, his firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was upon the city of Augſburgh, which, though over-awed by the preſence of the Spaniſh troops, he knew to be as much diſſatisfied with the Interim as any in the empire. He ordered one body of theſe troops to ſeize the gates; he poſted the reſt in different quarters of the city; and aſſembling all the burgeſſes in the town, he, by his ſole abſolute authority, publiſhed a decree, aboliſhing their preſent form of government, diſſolving all their corporations and fraternities, and nominating a ſmall number of perſons, in whom he veſted, for the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011837_0965_0F9D881AB50DECA8"/>
future, the right of adminiſtration. Each of the perſons, thus choſen, took an oath to obſerve the Interim. An act of power, ſo unprecedented as well as arbitrary, which excluded the body of the inhabitants from any ſhare in the government of their own community, and ſubjected them to men who had no other merit than their ſervile devotion to the Emperor's will, gave general diſguſt; but as they durſt not venture upon reſiſtance, they were obliged to ſubmit in ſilence <note n="e" place="bottom">Sleid. 469.</note>. From Augſburgh, in which he left a garriſon, he proceeded to Ulm, and new-modelling its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with the ſame violent hand, he ſeized ſuch of their paſtors as refuſed to ſubſcribe the Interim, committed them to priſon, and at his departure carried them along with him in chains <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid. 472.</note>. By this ſeverity, he not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the reception of the Interim in two of the moſt powerful cities, but gave warning to the reſt what ſuch as continued refractory had to expect. The effect of the example was as great as he could have wiſhed, and many towns, in order to ſave themſelves from the like vengeance, found it neceſſary to comply with what he enjoined. This obedience, extorted by the rigour of authority, produced no change in the ſentiments of the Germans, and extended no farther than to make them conform ſo far to the letter of the law, as was barely ſufficient to ſcreen them from puniſhment. Their preachers accompanied thoſe ceremonies, the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the Interim preſcribed, with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of their tendency, as ſerved rather to confirm than to remove the ſcruples of their hearers with regard to them. The people, many of whom had grown up to mature years ſince the eſtabliſhment of the Reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and had been accuſtomed to no other form of public worſhip, beheld the pompous pageantry of the popiſh ſervice with contempt or horror; and in moſt places the Romiſh eccleſiaſtics who returned to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their churches could ſcarce be protected from inſult, or their miniſtrations from interruption. Thus, notwithſtanding the apparent compliance of ſo many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the inhabitants being accuſtomed to freedom, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011837_0966_0F9D881B7113C438"/>
with reluctance to the power which now oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. Their underſtanding as well as inclination revolted againſt the doctrines and rites impoſed on them; and though, for the preſent, they concealed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and reſentment, it was evident that theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions could not always be kept under reſtraint, but would break out at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>CHARLES, meanwhile, highly pleaſed with having bended the ſtubborn ſpirit of the Germans to ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubmiſſion, departed for the Low-Countries, fully determined to compel the cites, which ſtill ſtood out, to receive the Interim. He carried his two priſoners the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Heſſe along with him, either becauſe he durſt not leave them behind him in Germany, or becauſe he wiſhed to give his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, the Flemings, this illuſtrious proof of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his arms, and the extent of his power. Before Charles arrived at Bruſſels he was informed that the Pope's legates at Bologna had diſmiſſed the council by an indefinite prorogation, and that the prelates aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled there had returned to their reſpective countries. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity had driven the Pope into this meaſure. By the ſeceſſion of thoſe who had voted againſt the tranſlation, together with the departure of others, who grew weary of continuing in a place where they were not ſuffered to proceed to buſineſs, ſo few and ſuch inconſiderable members remained, that the pompous appellation of a general council could not, with decency, be beſtowed any longer upon them. Paul had no choice but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve an aſſembly which was become the object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and exhibited to all Chriſtendom a moſt glaring proof of the impotence of the Romiſh ſee. But, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable as the meaſure was, it lay open to be unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably interpreted, and had the appearance of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remedy at the very time when thoſe for whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery it was provided, were prevailed on to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its virtue, and to make trial of its effect. Charles did not fail to put this conſtruction on his conduct; and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:011837_0967_0F9D881C307526C0"/>
by an artful compariſon of his own efforts to ſuppreſs hereſy, with Paul's ſcandalous inattention to a point ſo eſſential, he endeavoured to render the Pontiff odious to all zealous Catholics. At the ſame time, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the prelates of his faction to remain at Trent, that the council might ſtill appear to have a being, and might be ready, whenever it was thought expedient, to reſume its deliberations for the good of the church <note n="h" place="bottom">Pallav. p. 11. 72.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE motive of Charles's journey to the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, beſides gratifying his favourite paſſion of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from one part of his dominions to another, was to receive Philip his only ſon, who was now in the twenty-firſt year of his age, and whom he had called thither, not only that he might be recognized by the ſtates of the Netherlands as heir apparent, but in order to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the execution of a vaſt ſcheme, the object of which, and the reception it met with, ſhall be hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. Philip, having left the government of Spain to Maximilian, Ferdinand's eldeſt ſon, to whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had given the Princeſs Mary, his daughter, in marriage, embarked for Italy attended by a numerous retinue of Spaniſh nobles <note n="i" place="bottom">Ochoa, Carolea, 362.</note>. The ſquadron which eſcorted him, was commanded by Andrew Doria, who, notwithſtanding his advanced age, inſiſted on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of performing, in perſon, the ſame duty to the ſon, which he had often diſcharged towards the father. He landed ſafely at Genoa; from thence he went to Milan, and proceeding through Germany, arrived at the Imperial court in Bruſſels. The ſtates of Brabant, in the firſt place, and thoſe of the other provinces in their order, acknowledged his right of ſucceſſion in common form, and he took the cuſtomary oath to preſerve all their privileges inviolate <note n="k" place="bottom">Haraei annal. Brabant. 652.</note>. In all the towns of the Low-Countries through which Philip paſſed he was received with extraordinary pomp. Nothing that could expreſs the reſpect of the people, or contribute to his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was neglected; pageants, tournaments, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpectacles of every kind were exhibited with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive magnificence which commercial nations diſplay,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011837_0968_0F9D881CF2BDA3A8"/>
when, on any occaſion, they depart from their uſual maxims of frugality. But amidſt theſe ſcenes of feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and pleaſure, Philip's natural ſeverity of temper was diſcernible. Youth itſelf could not render him agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor his being a candidate for power form him to courteſy. He maintained a haughty reſerve in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and diſcovered ſuch manifeſt partiality towards his Spaniſh attendants, together with ſuch an avowed preference to the manners of their country, as highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted the Flemings, and gave riſe to that antipathy, which afterwards occaſioned a revolution ſo fatal to him in that part of his dominions <note n="l" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 29.

                  <p>CHARLES was long detained in the Netherlands by a violent attack of the gout, which returned upon him ſo frequently, and with ſuch increaſing violence, that it had broken, to a great degree, the vigour of his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. He, nevertheleſs, did not intermit his endeavours to enforce the Interim. The inhabitants of Straſburgh, after a long ſtruggle, found it neceſſary to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; thoſe of Conſtance, who had taken arms in their own defence, were compelled by force not only to conform to the Interim, but to renounce their privileges as a free city, to do homage to Ferdinand as Archduke of Auſtria, and as his vaſſals to admit an Auſtrian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and garriſon <note n="m" place="bottom">Sleid. 474, 491.</note>.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK X.</head>
                  <p>WHILE Charles laboured, with ſuch unwearied induſtry, to overcome the obſtinacy of the Proteſtants, the effects of his ſteadineſs in the execution of his plan were rendered leſs conſiderable by his rupture with the Pope, which daily increaſed. The firm reſolution which the Emperor ſeemed to have taken againſt reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Placentia, together with his repeated encroachments on the eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, both by the regulations contained in the Interim, and by his attempt to re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a council at Trent, exaſperated Paul to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, who, with the weakneſs incident to old age grew more attached to his family, and more jealous or his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as he advanced in years. Puſhed on by theſe paſſions, he made new efforts to draw the French King into an alliance againſt the Emperor <note n="a" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 230.</note>. But finding that Monarch, notwithſtanding his hereditary enmity to Charles, and dread of his growing power, as unwilling as formerly to involve himſelf in immediate hoſtilities, he was obliged to contract his views, and to think of preventing future encroachments, ſince it was not in
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011837_0970_0F9D881E709B7F28"/>
his power to inflict vengeance on account of thoſe which were paſt. For this purpoſe, he determined to recal his grant of Parma and Placentia, and after declaring them to be re-annexed to the holy ſee, to indemnify Octavio by a new eſtabliſhment in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate. By this expedient, he hoped to gain two points of no ſmall conſequence; the ſecurity of Parma, firſt of all, as the Emperor would be cautious of invading the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the church, though he might ſeize without ſcruple a town belonging to the houſe of Farneſe; and in the next place, ſome chance of recovering Placentia, as his ſolicitations to that effect might decently be urged with greater importunity, and would infallibly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with more weight, when he was conſidered not as pleading the cauſe of his family, but as an advocate for the intereſt of the church. But while Paul was prid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in this device, as a happy refinement in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Octavio, an ambitious and high-ſpirited young man, who could not bear with patience to be ſpoiled of one half of his territories by the rapaciouſneſs of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, and to be deprived of the other by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of his grandfather, took meaſures in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the execution of a plan ſo fatal to his intereſt. He ſet out ſecretly from Rome, and having firſt endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurprize Parma, which attempt was fruſtrated by the fidelity of the governor to whom the Pope had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the defence of the town, he made overtures to the Emperor of renouncing all connection with the Pope, and depending entirely on him for his future fortune. This unexpected defection of one of the Pope's own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to an enemy whom he hated, irritated, almoſt to madneſs, a mind peeviſh with old age; and there was no degree of ſeverity to which Paul might not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt a grandſon whom he reproached as an unnatural apoſtate. But happily for Octavio, death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his carrying into execution the harſh reſolutions which he had taken with reſpect to him, and put an end to his pontificate in the ſixteenth year of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the eighty-ſecond of his age <note n="*" place="bottom">Among many inſtances of the credulity or weakneſs of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in attributing the death of illuſtrious perſonages to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary cauſes, this is one. Almoſt all the hiſtorians of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century affirm, that the death of Paul III. was occaſioned by the violent paſſions which the behaviour of his grandſon excited; that being informed, while he was airing himſelf, in one of his gardens near Rome, of Octavio's attempt on Parma, as well as of his negociations with the Emperor, by means of Gonzaga, he faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, continued ſome hours in a ſwoon, then fevered, and died within three days. This is the account given of it by Thuanus, lib. vi. 211. Adriani Iſtor. di ſuoi tempi, lib. vii. 480. and by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, 280. Even cardinal Pallavicini, better informed than any writer with regard to the events which happened in the papal court, and when not warped by prejudice or ſyſtem, more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in relating them, agrees with their narrative in its chief cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Pallav. b. ii. 74. Paruta, who wrote his hiſtory by command of the ſenate of Venice, relates it in the ſame manner. Hiſtories Venez. vol. iv. 212. But there was no occaſion to ſearch for any extraordinary cauſe, to account for the death of an old man of eighty-two. There remains an authentic account of this event, in which we find none of theſe marvellous circumſtances of which the hiſtorians are ſo fond. The cardinal of Ferrara, who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the affairs of France at the court of Rome, and M. L'Urfé, Henry's ambaſſador in ordinary there, wrote an account to that Monarch of the affair of Parma, and of the Pope's death. By theſe it appears, that Octavio's attempt to ſurprize Parma was made on the twentieth of October; that the next day in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not while he was airing himſelf in the gardens of Monte-Cavallo, the Pope received intelligence of what he had done; that he was ſeized with ſuch a tranſport of paſſion, and cried ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that his voice was heard in ſeveral apartments of the palace; that next day, however, he was ſo well as to give an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the cardinal of Ferrara, and go through buſineſs of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds; that Octavio wrote a letter to the Pope, not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Farneſe his brother, intimating his reſolution of throwing himſelf into the arms of the Emperor; that the Pope received this on the twenty-firſt without any new ſymptoms of emotion, and returned an anſwer to it; that on the twenty-ſecond of October, the day on which the cardinal of Ferrara's letter is dated, the Pope was in his uſual ſtate of health. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 247. By a letter of M. D'Urfé, Nov. 5. it appears, that the Pope was in ſuch good health, that on the third of that month he had celebrated the anniverſary of his coronation with the uſual ſolemnities. Ibidem, 251. By another letter from the ſame perſon, we learn, that on the ſixth of November, a catarrh, or defluxion fell down on the Pope's lungs, with ſuch dangerous ſymptoms, that his life was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpaired of, Ibid. 252. And by a third letter, we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he died November the tenth. In none of theſe letters is his death imputed to any extraordinary cauſe. It appears, that more than twenty days elapſed between Octavio's attempt on Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and the death of his grandfather, and that the diſeaſe was the natural effect of old age, not one of thoſe occaſioned by violence of paſſion.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="unknown:011837_0971_0F9D881F30FF6948"/>As this event had been long expected, there was an extraordinary concourſe of cardinals at Rome; and the various competitors having had time to form their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to concert their meaſures, their ambition and intrigues protracted the conclave to a great length. The Imperial and French factions ſtrove, with emulation, to promote one of their own number, and had, by turns, the proſpect of ſucceſs. But as Paul, during a long pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:011837_0972_0F9D881FF3BD0A78"/>
had raiſed many to the purple, and thoſe chiefly perſons of eminent abilities as well as zealouſly devoted to his family. Cardinal Farneſe had the command of a powerful and united ſquadron, by whoſe addreſs and firmneſs he exalted to the papal throne the Cardinal de Monte, whom Paul had employed as his principal le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the council of Trent, and truſted with his moſt ſecret intentions. He aſſumed the name of Julius III. and in order to expreſs his gratitude towards his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, the firſt act of his adminiſtration was to put Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavio Farneſe in poſſeſſion of Parma. When he was told of the injury which he did the holy ſee by alienating a territory of ſuch value, he briſkly replied, "That he would rather be a poor Pope, with the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a gentleman, than a rich one, with the infamy of having forgotten the obligations conferred upon him, and the promiſes which he had made <note n="b" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier.</note>." But all the luſtre of this candour or generoſity he quickly effaced by an action moſt ſhockingly indecent. According to an antient and eſtabliſhed practice, every Pope, upon his election, claims the privilege of beſtowing, on whom he pleaſes, the cardinal's hat, which falls to be diſpoſed of by his being veſted with the triple crown. Julius, to the aſtoniſhment of the ſacred college, conferred this mark of diſtinction, together with ample eccleſiaſtical reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and the right of bearing his name and arms, upon one Innocent, a youth of ſixteen, born of obſcure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and known by the name of the Ape, from his having been entruſted with the care of an animal of that ſpecies, in the Cardinal di Monte's family. Such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the higheſt dignity in the church would have
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011837_0973_0F9D8821378B15F0"/>
given offence, even in thoſe dark periods, when the credulous ſuperſtition of the people emboldened eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics to venture on the moſt flagrant violations of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum. But in an enlightened age, when, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of knowledge and philoſophy the obligations of duty and decency were better underſtood, when a blind veneration for the pontifical character was every where abated, and one half of Chriſtendom in open rebellion againſt the papal ſee, this action was viewed with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Rome was immediately filled with libels and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinades, which imputed the Pope's extravagant regard for ſuch an unworthy object to the moſt criminal paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Proteſtants exclaimed againſt the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuppoſing that the infallible ſpirit of divine truth could dwell in a breaſt ſo impure, and called mere loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ever, and with greater appearance of juſtice, for the immediate and thorough reformation of a church, the head of which was a diſgrace to the Chriſtian name <note n="c" place="bottom">Sleid. 492. F. Paul, 281. Pallav. ii. 76. Thuan. lib. vi. 215.</note>. The reſt of the Pope's conduct was of a piece with this firſt ſpecimen of his diſpoſitions. Having now reached the ſummit of eccleſiaſtical ambition, he ſeemed eager to indemnify himſelf, by an unreſtrained indulgence of his deſires, for the ſelf-denial or diſſimulation which he had thought it prudent to practiſe while in a ſubordinate ſtation. He became careleſs, to ſo great a degree, of all ſerious buſineſs, that he could ſeldom be brought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, but in caſes of extreme neceſſity; and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf to amuſements and diſſipation of every kind, he imitated the luxurious elegance of Leo, rather than the ſevere virtue of Adrian, the latter of which it was neceſſary to diſplay, in contending with a ſect which derived great credit from the rigid and auſtere manners of its teachers <note n="d" place="bottom">F. Paul, ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope, how ready ſoever to fulfil his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the family of Farneſe, diſcovered no inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerve the oath, which each cardinal had taken when he entered the conclave, that if the choice ſhould fall on him, he would immediately call the council to re-aſſume its deliberations. Julius knew, by experience,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:011837_0974_0F9D882183F47B50"/>
how difficult it was to confine ſuch a body of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow limits which it was the intereſt of the church of Rome to preſcribe; and how eaſily the zeal of ſome members, the raſhneſs of others, or the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Princes, on whom they depended, might precipitate a popular and ungovernable aſſembly into forbidden inquiries, as well as dangerous deciſions. He wiſhed, for theſe reaſons, to have eluded the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his oath, and gave an ambiguous anſwer to the firſt propoſals, which were made to him by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, with regard to that matter. But as Charles, either from his natural obſtinacy in adhering to the meaſures which he had once adopted, or from the mere pride of accompliſhing what was held to be almoſt impoſſible, perſiſted in his reſolution of forcing the Proteſtants to return into the boſom of the church. As he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded himſelf that the authoritative deciſions of the council might be employed with efficacy in combating their prejudices; and in conſequence of that perſuaſion, ſolicited earneſtly that a new bull of convocation might be iſſued, the Pope could not, with decency, reject that requeſt. When Julius found that he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the calling of a council, he endeavoured to take the merit of having procured the meeting of an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which was the object of ſuch general deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. A congregation of cardinals, to whom he referred the conſideration of what was neceſſary for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring peace to the church, recommended, by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the ſpeedy convocation of a council, as the moſt effectual expedient for that purpoſe; and as the new hereſies raged with the greateſt violence in Germany, they propoſed Trent as the place of its meeting, that by a near inſpection of the evil, the remedy might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with greater diſcernment and certainty of ſucceſs. The Pope warmly approved this advice, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had dictated, and ſent nuncios to the Imperial and French courts, in order to make known his intentions <note n="e" place="bottom">F. Paul, 281. Pallav. ii. 77.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the Emperor had ſummoned a new Diet to meet at Augſburgh, in order to enforce the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Interim, and to procure a more authentic
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011837_0975_0F9D882231A88258"/>
act of the empire, acknowledging the juriſdiction of the council, as well as an explicit promiſe of conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its decrees. He appeared there in perſon, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his ſon the Prince of Spain. Few of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were preſent, but all ſent deputies in their name. Charles, notwithſtanding the deſpotic authority with which he had given law in the empire during two years, knew that the ſpirit of independence among the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans was not entirely ſubdued, and for that reaſon took care to over-awe the Diet by a conſiderable body of Spaniſh troops which eſcorted him thither. The firſt point, ſubmitted to the conſideration of the Diet, was the neceſſity of holding a council. All the popiſh mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers agreed, without difficulty, that the meeting of that aſſembly ſhould be renewed at Trent, and promiſed an implicit acquieſcence in its decrees. The Proteſtants, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated and diſunited, muſt have followed their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the reſolution of the Diet have proved unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, if Maurice of Saxony had not begun, at this time, to diſcloſe new intentions, and to act a part very different from that which he had ſo long aſſumed.</p>
                  <p>BY an artful diſſimulation of his own ſentiments; by addreſs in paying court to the Emperor; and by the ſeeming zeal with which he forwarded all his ambitious ſchemes, Maurice had raiſed himſelf to the Electoral dignity; and having added the dominions of the elder branch of the Saxon family to his own, was become the moſt powerful Prince in Germany. But his long and intimate union with the Emperor had afforded him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opportunities of obſerving narrowly the dangerous tendency of his ſchemes. He ſaw the yoke that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for his country; and from the rapid as well as formidable progreſs of the Imperial power, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that but a few ſteps more remained to be taken, in order to render Charles as abſolute a Monarch in Germany, as he had become in Spain. The more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the condition was to which he himſelf had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, the more ſolicitous did he naturally become to maintain all its rights and privileges, and the more did he dread the thoughts of deſcending from the rank of a Prince almoſt independent, to that of a vaſſal ſubject to the will of a maſter. At the ſame time, he perceived
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011837_0976_0F9D8822F0ED19C8"/>
that Charles, inſtead of allowing liberty of conſcience, the promiſe of which had allured ſeveral Proteſtant Princes to aſſiſt him in the war againſt the confederates of Smalkalde, was bent on exacting a rigid conformity to the doctrines and rites of the Romiſh church. As he, notwithſtanding all the compliances which he had made from motives of intereſt, or an exceſs of confidence in the Emperor, was ſincerely attached to the Lutheran tenets, he determined not to be a tame ſpectator of the overthrow of a ſyſtem which he believed to be founded in truth.</p>
                  <p>THIS reſolution, flowing from the love of liberty, or zeal for religion, was ſtrengthened by political and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted conſiderations. In that elevated ſtation, in which Maurice was now placed, new and more extenſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects opened to his view. His rank and power intitled him to be the head of the Proteſtants in the empire. His predeceſſor, the degraded Elector, with inferior abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and territories leſs conſiderable, had acquired ſuch an aſcendant over the councils of the party; and Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice neither wanted diſcernment to ſee the advantage of this pre-eminence, nor ambition to aim at attaining it. But he found himſelf in a ſituation which rendered the attempt no leſs difficult, than the object of it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. On the one hand, the connection which he had formed with the Emperor was ſo intimate, that he could ſcarce hope to take any ſtep which tended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, without alarming his jealouſy, and drawing on himſelf the whole weight of that power, which had cruſhed the greateſt confederacy ever formed in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. On the other hand, the calamities which he had brought on the Proteſtant party were ſo recent and ſo great, that it ſeemed almoſt impoſſible to regain their confidence, or to rally and re-animate a body of men, after himſelf had been the chief inſtrument in breaking their union and vigour. Theſe conſiderations were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have diſcouraged any perſon of a ſpirit leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous than Maurice's. But to him the grandeur and vaſtneſs of the enterprizes were allurements; and he boldly reſolved on meaſures, of which a genius of an inferior order could have conceived no idea, or would
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:011837_0977_0F9D8823AFEFD9C0"/>
have trembled at the thoughts of the danger which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>HIS paſſions concurred with his intereſt in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this reſolution; and the reſentment excited by an injury, which he ſuddenly felt, added new force to the motives for oppoſing the Emperor, which ſound policy ſuggeſted. Maurice, by his authority, had prevailed on the Landgrave of Heſſe to put his perſon in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's power, and had obtained a promiſe from the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial miniſters that he ſhould not be detained a priſoner. This had been violated in the manner already related. The unhappy Landgrave exclaimed as loudly againſt his ſon-in-law as againſt Charles. The Princes of Heſſe required him inceſſantly to fulfil his engagements to their father, who had loſt his liberty by truſting to him; and all Germany ſuſpected him of having betrayed, to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy, the friend whom he was moſt bound to protect. Rouzed by theſe ſolicitations and reproaches, as well as prompted by duty and affection to his father-in-law, Maurice had employed not only entreaties but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances in order to procure his releaſe. All theſe Charles had diſregarded; and the ſhame of having been firſt deceived and then ſlighted by a Prince whom he had ſerved with zeal and ſucceſs, which merited a very different return, made ſuch a deep impreſſion on Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, that he waited with impatience for an opportunity of being revenged.</p>
                  <p>THE utmoſt caution as well as delicacy were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in taking every ſtep towards this end; as he had to guard, on the one hand, againſt giving a premature alarm to the Emperor; while, on the other, ſomething conſiderable and explicit was neceſſary to be done, in order to regain the confidence of the Proteſtant party. Maurice had accordingly applied all his powers of addreſs and diſſimulation to attain both theſe points. As he knew Charles to be inflexible with regard to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which he required to the Interim, he did not heſitate one moment whether he ſhould eſtabliſh that form of doctrine and worſhip in his dominions. But being ſenſible how odious it was to his ſubjects, inſtead of violently impoſing it on them by the mere terror of authority, as had been done in other parts of Germany,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:011837_0978_0F9D882471AEEAF8"/>
he endeavoured to render their obedience a voluntary deed of their own. For this purpoſe, he had aſſembled the clergy of his country at Leipſic, and had laid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim before them, together with the reaſons which made it neceſſary to conform to it. He had gained ſome of them by promiſes, others he had wrought upon by threats, and all were intimidated by the rigour with which obedience to the Interim was extorted in the neighbouring provinces. Even Melancthon, whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of every kind intitled him to the firſt place among the Proteſtant divines, being now deprived of the manly counſels of Luther, which were wont to inſpire him with fortitude, and to preſerve him ſteady amidſt the ſtorms and dangers that threatened the church, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into unwarrantable conceſſions, by the timidity of his temper, his fond deſire of peace, and his exceſſive complaiſance towards perſons of high rank. By his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and authority, no leſs than by Maurice's arts, the aſſembly was prevailed on to declare, that in points which were purely indifferent, obedience was due to the commands of a lawful ſuperior. Founding upon this maxim, no leſs uncontrovertible in theory, than dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous when carried into practice, eſpecially in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters, they proceeded to claſs, among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of things indifferent, ſeveral doctrines, which Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had pointed out as groſs and pernicious errors in the Romiſh creed, as well as many of thoſe rites which diſtinguiſhed the Reformed from the Popiſh worſhip, and by conſequence, they exhorted their people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Emperor's injunctions concerning theſe particulars <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid 481, 485.

                  <p>BY this dextrous conduct, the introduction of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim excited none of thoſe violent convulſions in Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which it occaſioned in other provinces. But though the Saxons ſubmitted, the more zealous Lutherans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt Melancthon and his aſſociates, as falſe brethren, who were either ſo wicked as to apoſtatize from the truth altogether; or ſo artful as to betray it by ſubtle diſtinctions; or ſo feeble ſpirited, as to give
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:011837_0979_0F9D8825323EA7D8"/>
it up from puſillanimity and criminal complaiſance to a Prince, capable of ſacrificing to his political intereſt, that which he himſelf regarded as moſt ſacred. Maurice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious what a colour of probability his paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct gave to theſe accuſations, as well as afraid of loſing entirely the confidence of the Proteſtants, iſſued a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration containing profeſſions of his zealous attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Reformed religion, and of his reſolution to guard againſt all the errors or encroachments of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſee <note n="g" place="bottom">Sleid. 485.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAVING gone ſo far in order to remove the fears and jealouſies of the Proteſtants, he found it neceſſary to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the impreſſion which ſuch a declaration might make on the Emperor. For that purpoſe, he not only renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his profeſſions of an unviolable adherence to his alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, but as the city of Magdeburgh ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in rejecting the Interim, he undertook to reduce it to obedience, and inſtantly ſet about levying the troops to be employed in that ſervice. This damped all the hopes which the Proteſtants begun to conceive of Maurice, in conſequence of his declaration, and left them more than ever at a loſs to gueſs at his real inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Their former ſuſpicion and diſtruſt of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and the divines of Magdeburgh filled Germany with writings, in which they repreſented him as the moſt formidable enemy of the Proteſtant religion, who treacherouſly aſſumed an appearance of zeal for its inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that he might more effectually execute his ſchemes for its deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>THIS charge, ſupported by the evidence of recent facts, as well as by his preſent dubious conduct, gained ſuch univerſal credit, that Maurice was obliged to take take a vigorous ſtep in his own vindication. As ſoon as the re-aſſembling of the council at Trent was propoſed in the Diet, his ambaſſadors proteſted, that their maſter would not acknowledge its authority, unleſs all the points which had been already decided there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, and conſidered as entire; unleſs the Proteſtant divines had a full hearing granted them, and were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deciſive voice in the council; and unleſs the Pope
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:011837_0980_0F9D8825F06D56C0"/>
renounced his pretenſions to preſide in the council, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſubmit to its decrees, and abſolved the biſhops from their oath of obedience, that they might deliver their ſentiments with greater freedom. Theſe demands, which were higher than any that the Reformers had ventured to make, even when the zeal of their party was warmeſt, or their affairs moſt proſperous, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced, in ſome degree, the effect of Maurice's prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt Magdeburgh, and kept the Proteſtants in ſuſpenſe with regard to his deſigns. At the ſame time, he had addreſs enough to repreſent this part of his conduct in ſuch a light to the Emperor, that it gave him no offence, and occaſioned no interruption of the ſtrict confidence which ſubſiſted between them. What the pretexts were which he employed in order to give ſuch a bold declaration an innocent appearance, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary hiſtorians have not explained; that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon Charles is certain, for he ſtill continued to proſecute his plan as well concerning the Interim as the council, with the ſame ardour; and to place the ſame confidence in Maurice, with regard to the execution of both.</p>
                  <p>THE Pope's reſolution concerning the council not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet known at Augſburgh, the chief buſineſs of the Diet was to enforce the obſervation of the Interim. As the ſenate of Magdeburgh, notwithſtanding various en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to frighten or to ſooth them into compliance, not only perſevered obſtinately in their oppoſition to the Interim, but began to ſtrengthen the fortifications of their city, and to levy troops in their own defence, Charles required of the Diet, that they would aſſiſt him in quelling this audacious rebellion againſt a decree of the empire. Had the members of the Diet been left to act agreeably to their own inclination, this demand would have been rejected without heſitation. All the Germans who favoured, in any degree, the new opinions in religion, and many who were influenced by no other conſideration than jealouſy of the Emperor's growing power, regarded this effort of the citizens of Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, as a noble ſtand for the liberties of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Even ſuch as had not reſolution to exert the ſame ſpirit, admired the gallantry of their enterprize, and
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:011837_0981_0F9D8826B3084520"/>
wiſhed it ſucceſs. But the preſence of the Spaniſh troops, together with the dread of the Emperor's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, over-awed thoſe who were preſent in the Diet to ſuch a degree, that without venturing to utter their own ſentiments, they tamely ratified, by their votes, whatever the Emperor was pleaſed to preſcribe. The rigorous decrees, which Charles had iſſued by his own authority againſt the Magdeburghers, were confirmed; a reſolution was taken to raiſe troops in order to beſiege the city in form; and perſons were named to fix the contingent in men or money to be furniſhed by each ſtate. At the ſame time, the Diet petitioned that Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice might be entruſted with the command of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to which Charles gave his conſent with great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, and with high encomiums upon the wiſdom of the choice which they had made <note n="h" place="bottom">Sleid. 503, 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>2.</note>. As Maurice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted all his ſchemes with profound and impenetrable ſecrecy; it is probable that he took no ſtep avowedly in order to obtain this charge. The recommendation of his countrymen was either purely accidental, or flowed from the opinion generally entertained of his great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and neither the Diet had any foreſight, nor the Emperor any dread of the conſequences which followed upon this nomination. Maurice accepted without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the truſt committed to him, inſtantly diſcerning the important advantages which he might derive from it.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, Julius, in preparing the bull for the convocation of the council, obſerved all thoſe tedious forms which the court of Rome can employ, with ſo much dexterity, to retard any diſagreeable meaſure. At laſt it was publiſhed, and the council ſummoned to meet at Trent on the firſt day of the enſuing month of May. As he knew that many of the Germans rejected or diſputed the authority and juriſdiction which the papal ſee claims with reſpect to general councils, he took care, in the preamble of the bull, to aſſert, in the ſtrongeſt terms, his own right, not only to call and preſide in that aſſembly, but to direct its proceedings; nor would he ſoften theſe expreſſions, in any degree, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the repeated ſolicitations of the Emperor, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw what offence they would give, and what conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be put on them. They were cenſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, with great ſeverity, by ſeveral members of the Diet, but whatever diſguſt or ſuſpicion they excited, ſuch abſolute direction of all their deliberations had the Emperor acquired, that he procured a receſs in which the authority of the council was recognized, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the proper remedy for the evils which at that time afflicted the church; all the Princes and ſtates of the empire, ſuch as had made innovations in religion, as well as thoſe who adhered to the ſyſtem of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, were required to ſend their repreſentatives to the council; the Emperor engaged to grant a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to ſuch as demanded it, and to ſecure them an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial hearing in the council; he promiſed to fix his reſidence in ſome city of the empire, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Trent, that he might protect the members of the council by his preſence, and take care that, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting their deliberations agreeable to ſcripture and the doctrine of the fathers, they might bring them to a deſirable iſſue. In this receſs, the obſervation of the Interim was more ſtrictly enjoined than ever, and the Emperor threatened all who had hitherto neglected or refuſed to conform to it, with the ſevereſt effects of his vengeance, if they perſiſted in their diſobedience <note n="i" place="bottom">Sleid. 512.

                  <p>DURING the meeting of this Diet, a new attempt was made in order to procure liberty to the Landgrave. That Prince, nowiſe reconciled by time to his ſituation, grew every day more impatient of reſtraint. Having often applied to Maurice and the Elector of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, who took every occaſion of ſoliciting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in his behalf, though without any effect, he now commanded his ſons to ſummon them, with legal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, to perform what was contained in the bond they had granted him, by ſurrendering themſelves to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame rigour as the Emperor had uſed him. This furniſhed them with a freſh pretext for renewing their application to the Emperor, together with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011837_0983_0F9D88283395CF80"/>
argument to enforce it. Charles firmly reſolved not to grant their requeſt; though, at the ſame time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extremely deſirous to get rid of their inceſſant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he endeavoured to prevail on the Landgrave to give up the obligation which he had received from the two Electors. But that Prince refuſing to part with a ſecurity which he deemed eſſential to his ſafety, the Emperor boldly cut the knot which he could not untie; and by a public deed annulled the bond which Maurice and the Elector of Brandenburgh had granted, abſolving them from all their engagements to the Landgrave. No pretenſion to a power ſo pernicious to ſociety as that of abrogating at pleaſure the moſt ſacred laws of honour, and moſt formal obligations of public faith, had hitherto been formed by any but the Roman Pontiffs, who, in conſequence of their claim of infallibility, arrogate the right of diſpenſing with precepts and duties of every kind. All Germany was filled with aſtoniſhment, when Charles aſſumed the ſame prerogative. The ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to which the empire was reduced, appeared to be more rigorous as well as intolerable than that of the moſt wretched and enſlaved nations, if the Emperor, by an arbitrary decree, might cancel thoſe ſolemn contracts, which are the foundation of that mutual confidence whereby men are held together in ſocial union. The Landgrave himſelf now gave up all hopes of recovering his liberty by the Emperor's conſent, and endeavoured to procure it by his own addreſs. But the plan which he had formed to deceive his guards being diſcovered, ſuch of his attendants as he had gained to favour his eſcape were put to death, and he was confined in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of Mechlin more cloſely than ever <note n="k" place="bottom">Sleid. 504. Thuan. l. vi. 234, 235.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER tranſaction was carried on during this Diet, with reſpect to an affair more nearly intereſting to the Emperor, and which occaſioned likewiſe a general alarm among the Princes of the empire. Charles, though formed with talents which fitted him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and conducting great deſigns, was not capable, as has been obſerved, of bearing extraordinary ſucceſs. Its operation on his mind was ſo violent and intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011837_0984_0F9D8828F4C932E8"/>
that it elevated him beyond what was moderate or attainable, and turned his whole attention to the purſuit of vaſt but chimerical objects. Such had been the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his victory over the confederates of Smalkalde. He did not long reſt ſatisfied with the ſubſtantial and certain advantages which were the reſult of that event, but deſpiſing theſe, as poor or inconſiderable fruits of ſuch great ſucceſs, he had aimed at bringing all Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many to an uniformity in religion, and at rendering the Imperial power deſpotic. Theſe were objects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſplendid, it muſt be acknowledged, and allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an ambitious mind; the purſuit at them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was attended with manifeſt danger, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of them very precarious. But the ſteps which he had already taken towards them, being accompanied with ſuch ſucceſs, his imagination, warmed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating this vaſt deſign, overlooked or deſpiſed all difficulties. As he conceived the execution of his plan to be certain, he began to be ſolicitous how he might render the poſſeſſion of ſuch an important acquiſition perpetual in his family, by tranſmitting the German empire, as well as the kingdoms of Spain, and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in Italy and the Low-Countries, to his ſon. Having long revolved this flattering idea in his mind, without communicating it, even to thoſe miniſters whom he moſt truſted, he had called Philip out of Spain, in hopes that his preſence would facilitate the carrying forward the ſcheme.</p>
                  <p>GREAT obſtacles, however, and ſuch as would have deterred any ambition leſs accuſtomed to overcome difficulties, were to be ſurmounted. He had, in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty, imprudently aſſiſted in procuring his brother Ferdinand the dignity of King of the Romans, and there was no probability that this Prince, who was ſtill in the prime of life, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d a ſon grown up to the years of manhood, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh, in favour of his nephew, the near proſpect of the Imperial throne, which Charles's infirmities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate of health opened to him. This did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emperor from venturing to make the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when Ferdinand, notwithſtanding his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reverence for his brother, and obſequious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:011837_0985_0F9D88E83261FEB8"/>
to his will in other inſtances, rejected it in a peremptory tone, he was not diſcouraged by one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. He renewed his applications to him by his ſiſter, Mary Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and who, by her great abilities, tempered with extreme gentleneſs of diſpoſition, had acquired an extraordinary influence over both the brothers. She entered warmly into a meaſure, which tended ſo manifeſtly to aggrandize the houſe of Auſtria; and flattering herſelf that ſhe could tempt Ferdinand to renounce the reverſionary poſſeſſion of the Imperial dignity for an immediate eſtabliſhment, ſhe aſſured him that the Emperor, by way of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for his giving up his chance of ſucceſſion, would inſtantly beſtow upon him territories of very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value, and pointed out in particular thoſe of the Duke of Wurtemberg, which might be confiſcated upon different pretexts. But Ferdinand was more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious than to be perſuaded, by her addreſs or intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to approve of a plan, which would have degraded him from the higheſt rank among the Monarchs of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope to that of a ſubordinate and dependent Prince. He was at the ſame time, more attached to his children than to fruſtrate, by a raſh conceſſion, all the high hopes in proſpect of which they had been educated.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the immoveable firmneſs which Ferdinand diſcovered, the Emperor did not abandon his ſcheme. He flattered himſelf that he might attain the object in view by another channel, and that it was not impoſſible to prevail on the electors to cancel their former choice of Ferdinand, or at leaſt to elect Philip a ſecond King of the Romans, ſubſtituting him as next in ſucceſſion to his uncle. With this view he took Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip along with him to the Diet, that the Germans might have an opportunity to obſerve and become acquainted with the Prince, in behalf of whom he courted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and he himſelf employed all the arts of addreſs or inſinuation to gain the electors, and to prepare them for lending a favourable ear to the propoſal. But no ſooner did he venture upon mentioning it to them, than they, at once, ſaw and trembled at the conſequences with which it would be attended. They had long felt all the inconveniences of having placed at the head of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011837_0986_0F9D88E8F2489EA0"/>
the empire, a Prince whoſe power and dominions were ſo extenſive; if they ſhould now repeat the folly, and continue the Imperial crown, like an hereditary dignity, in the ſame family, they foreſaw, that they would give the ſon an opportunity of carrying on that ſyſtem of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the father had begun; and would put it in his power to overturn whatever was yet left entire in the antient and venerable fabric of the German conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                  <p>THE character of the Prince, in whoſe favour this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary propoſition was made, rendered it ſtill leſs agreeable. Philip, though poſſeſſed with an inſatiable deſire of power, was a ſtranger to all the arts of conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating good-will. Haughty, reſerved and ſevere, he, inſtead of gaining new friends, diſguſted the antient and moſt devoted partizans of the Auſtrian intereſt. He ſcorned to take the trouble of acquiring the language of the country, to the government of which he aſpired; nor would he condeſcend to pay the Germans the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of accommodating himſelf, during his reſidence among them, to their manners and cuſtoms. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Electors and moſt illuſtrious Princes in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many to remain in his preſence uncovered, affecting a ſtately and diſtant demeanour, which the greateſt of the German Emperors, and even Charles himſelf, amidſt the pride of power and victory, had never aſſumed <note n="l" place="bottom">Frediman Andreae Zulich Diſſertatio politico—Hiſtorica de Naevis politicis Caroli V. Lipſ. 1706. 4to. p. 21.</note>. On the other hand, Ferdinand, from the time of his arrival in Germany, had ſtudied to render himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the people, by a conformity to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which ſeemed to flow from choice; and his ſon Maximilian, who was born in Germany, poſſeſſed in an eminent degree, ſuch amiable qualities, as rendered him the darling of his countrymen, and induced them to look forward to his election as a moſt deſirable event. Their eſteem and affection for him fortified the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſound policy had ſuggeſted; and determined the Germans to prefer the popular virtues of Ferdinand and his ſon, to the ſtubborn auſterity of Philip, which intereſt could not ſoften, nor ambition teach him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011837_0987_0F9D88E9B11454C0"/>
All the electors, the eccleſiaſtical as well as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, concurred in expreſſing ſuch ſtrong diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meaſure, that Charles, notwithſtanding the reluctance with which he gave up any point, was obliged to drop the ſcheme as impracticable. By his unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſeverance in puſhing it, he not only filled the Germans with new jealouſy of his ambitious deſigns, but laid the foundation of rivalſhip and diſcord in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian family, and forced his brother Ferdinand, in ſelf-defence, to court the electors, particularly Maurice of Saxony, and to form ſuch connections with them, as cut off all proſpect of renewing the propoſal with ſucceſs. Philip, ſoured by his diſappointment, was ſent back to Spain, to be called thence when any new ſcheme of ambition ſhould render his preſence neceſſary <note n="m" place="bottom">Sleid. 505.

                  <p>HAVING relinquiſhed this plan of domeſtic ambition which had long occupied and engroſſed him, Charles imagined that he would now have leiſure to turn all his attention towards his grand ſcheme of eſtabliſhing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of religion in the empire, by forcing all the contending parties to acquieſce in the deciſions of the council of Trent. But ſuch was the extent of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, the variety of connections in which this entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and the multiplicity of events to which theſe gave riſe, as ſeldom allowed him to apply his whole force to any one object. The machine which he had to conduct was ſo great and complicated, that an unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen irregularity, or obſtruction in one of the inferior wheels, often diſconcerted the motion of the whole, and diſappointed him of the moſt conſiderable effects which he expected. Such an unlooked-for occurrence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at this juncture, and created new obſtacles to the execution of his ſchemes with regard to religion. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius III. though he had confirmed Octavio Farneſe in the poſſeſſion of the dutchy of Parma, during the firſt effuſions of joy and gratitude on his promotion to the papal throne, ſoon began to repent of his own genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and to be apprehenſive of conſequences which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not foreſee, or had diſregarded while the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:011837_0988_0F9D88EA7230A200"/>
ſenſe of his obligations to the family of Farneſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The Emperor ſtill retained Placentia in his hands, and had not relinquiſhed his pretenſions to Parma, as a fief of the empire. Gonzaga, the governor of Milan, having, by the part which he took in the murder of the late Duke Peter Ludovico, offered an inſult to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Farneſe, which he knew could never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, had for that reaſon vowed its deſtruction, and employed all the influence, which his great abilities as well as long ſervices gave him with the Emperor, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading him to ſeize Parma by force of arms. Charles, in compliance with his ſolicitations, and that he might gratify his own deſire of annexing Parma to the Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe, liſtened to the propoſal; and Gonzaga, ready to take encouragement from the ſlighteſt appearance of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, began to aſſemble troops, and to make other preparations for the execution of his ſcheme.</p>

But as the expence of ſuch an effort far exceeded his ſcanty revenues, he repreſented his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pope, and implored that protection and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which was due to him as a vaſſal of the church. The Imperial miniſter, however, had already pre-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the Pope's ear; and by diſcourſing continually concerning the danger of giving offence to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as well as the imprudence of ſupporting Octavio in an uſurpation ſo detrimental to the holy ſee, had total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alienated him from the family of Farneſe. Octavio's remonſtrance and petition met, of conſequence, with a cold reception; and he, deſpairing of any aſſiſtance from Julius, began to look round for protection from ſome other quarter. Henry II. of France was the only Prince powerful enough to afford him this protection, and fortunately he was now in a ſituation which allowed him to undertake it. He had brought his tranſactions with the two Britiſh kingdoms, which had hitherto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his attention from the affairs of the continent, to ſuch an iſſue as he deſired. This he had effected partly by the vigour of his arms, partly by his dexterity in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage of the political factions which raged in

both kingdoms, and rendered the counſels of the Scots violent and precipitate, and the operations of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh feeble and unſteady. He had procured from the Engliſh favourable conditions of peace for his allies the Scots; he had prevailed on the nobles of Scotland not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>HAVING gained points of ſo much conſequence to his crown, and diſengaged himſelf with ſuch honour from the burden of ſupporting the Scots, and maintaining a war againſt England. Henry was now at full leiſure to purſue the meaſures which his hereditary jealouſy of the Emperor's power naturally ſuggeſted. He liſtened, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to the firſt overtures which Octavio Farneſe made him; and embracing eagerly an opportunity of recovering footing in Italy, he inſtantly concluded a treaty, in which he promiſed to eſpouſe his cauſe, and to furniſh him with all the aſſiſtance which he deſired. This tranſaction could not be long kept ſecret from the Pope, who foreſeeing the calamities which muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low if war was rekindled ſo near the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, immediately iſſued monitory letters, requiring Octavio, to relinquiſh his new alliance. Upon his refuſal to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the requiſition, he ſoon after pronounced his fief to be forfeited, and declared war againſt him as a diſobedient and rebellious vaſſal. But as he could not hope, with his own forces alone, to ſubdue Octavio, while ſupported by ſuch a powerful ally as the King of France, he had recourſe to the Emperor, who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſolicitous to prevent the eſtabliſhment of the French in Parma, ordered Gonzaga to ſecond Julius with all his troops. Thus the French took the field as the allies of Octavio; the Imperialiſts as the protectors of the holy ſee; and hoſtilities commenced between them, while Charles and Henry themſelves ſtill affected to give out that they would adhere inviolably to the peace of Creſpy.

                  <p>THE Emperor, nevertheleſs, was ſtraining his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the utmoſt, in order to eſtabliſh the reputation and juriſdiction of the council. He had prevailed on the three eccleſiaſtical Electors, the prelates of greateſt power and dignity in the church, next to the Pope, to repair thither in perſon. He had obliged ſeveral Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man biſhops of inferior rank to go to Trent themſelves, or to ſend their proxies. He granted an Imperial ſafe conduct to the ambaſſadors nominated by the Elector of Brandenburgh, the Duke of Wurtemberg, and other Proteſtant ſtates, to attend the council; and exhorted them to ſend their divines thither, in order to propound, explain and defend their doctrine. At the ſame time, his zeal anticipated the decrees of the council; and, as if the Proteſtant doctrines had already been condemned, he took large ſteps towards exterminating them. With this intention, he called together the miniſters of Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh; and after interrogating them concerning ſeveral controverted points, enjoined them to teach nothing with reſpect to theſe, contrary to the tenets of the Romiſh church. Upon their declining to comply with a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſo contrary to the dictates of their conſciences, he commanded them to leave the town in three days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revealing to any perſon the cauſe of their baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he prohibited them to preach for the future in any of the countries ſubject to the Imperial juriſdiction; and obliged them to take an oath that they would punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obey theſe injunctions. They were not the only victims to his zeal. The Proteſtant clergy, in moſt of the cities in the circle of Suabia, were ejected with the ſame violence; and in many places, ſuch magiſtrates as had diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their attachment to the new opinions, were diſmiſſed with the moſt abrupt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and their offices filled, in conſequence of the Emperor's arbitrary appointment, with the moſt bigotted of their adverſaries. The Reformed worſhip was almoſt entirely ſuppreſſed throughout that extenſive province. The antient and fundamental privileges of the free cities were violated. The people were compelled to attend

He fixed his reſidence in that city, as by its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in the neighbourhood of Trent, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Italy, it appeared a commodious ſtation, whence he might inſpect the operations of the council, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the progreſs of the war in the Parmeſan, without loſing ſight of the occurrences that might happen in Germany <note n="r" place="bottom">Sleid. 329.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions, the ſiege of Magdeburgh was carried on with various ſucceſs. At the time when Charles proſcribed the citizens of Magdeburgh, and put them under the ban of the empire, he had exhorted and even enjoined all the neighbouring ſtates to take arms againſt them, as rebels and common enemies. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by his exhortations as well as promiſes George of Mecklenburgh, a younger brother of the reigning Duke, an active and ambitious Prince, collected a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of thoſe ſoldiers of fortune who had accompanied Henry of Brunſwick in all his wild enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; and though a zealous Lutheran himſelf, invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the territories of the Magdeburghers, hoping, that by the merit of this ſervice, he might procure ſome part of their domains to be allotted to him as an eſtabliſhment. The citizens, unaccuſtomed as yet to endure patiently the calamities of war, could not be reſtrained from ſally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in order to ſave their lands from being laid waſte. They attacked the Duke of Mecklenburgh with more courage than conduct, and were repulſed with great ſlaughter. But as they were animated with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable ſpirit, which flows from zeal for religion, co-operating with the love of civil liberty, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſheartened by their misfortune, they prepared to defend themſelves with vigour. Many of the veteran ſoldiers who had ſerved in the long wars between the
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:011837_0993_0F9D88EE30B62F30"/>
Emperor and King of France, crowding to their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards under able and experienced officers, they acquired military ſkill by degrees, and added all the advantages of that to the efforts of undaunted courage. The Duke of Mecklenburgh, notwithſtanding the ſevere blow which he had given the Magdeburghers, not daring to inveſt a town ſtrongly fortified, and defended by ſuch a garriſon, continued to ravage the open country.</p>
                  <p>AS the hopes of booty drew many adventurers to his camp, Maurice of Saxony began to be jealous of the power which he poſſeſſed by being at the head of ſuch a numerous body, and marching towards Magdeburgh with his own troops, aſſumed the ſupreme command of the whole army, an honour to which his high rank and great abilities, as well as the nomination of the Diet, gave him an indiſputable title. With this united force he inveſted the town, and began the ſiege in form; claiming great merit with the Emperor on that account, as, from his zeal to execute the Imperial decree, he was expoſing himſelf once more to the cenſures and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the party with which he agreed in religious ſentiments. But the approaches to the town went on ſlowly; the garriſon interrupted the beſiegers by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſallies, in one of which the Duke of Mecklen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh was taken priſoner, levelled part of their works, and cut off the ſoldiers in their advanced poſts. While the citizens of Magdeburgh, animated by the diſcourſes of their paſtors, and the ſoldiers encouraged by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their officers, endured all the hardſhips of a ſiege without murmuring, and defended themſelves with the ſame ardour which they had at firſt diſcovered; the troops of the beſiegers acted with extreme remiſſneſs, repining at every thing they ſuffered in a ſervice which they diſliked. They broke out more than once, into open mutiny, demanding the arrears of their pay, which, as the Germans contributed with great reluctance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards defraying the expences of this war, amounted to a conſiderable ſum <note n="s" place="bottom">Thuan. 277. Sleid. 514.</note>. Maurice, too, had particular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though ſuch as he durſt not avow at that juncture,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:011837_0994_0F9D88EEEEEA19F0"/>
which induced him not to puſh the ſiege with vigour, and made him chooſe rather to continue at the head of an army expoſed to all the imputations which his dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory proceedings drew upon him, than to precipitate a conqueſt which might have brought him ſome acceſſion of reputation, but would have rendered it neceſſary to diſband his forces.</p>
                  <p>AT laſt, the inhabitants of the town beginning to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer diſtreſs from want of proviſions, and Maurice, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to protract matters any longer without filling the Emperor with ſuch ſuſpicions as might have diſconcerted all his meaſures, he concluded a treaty of capitulation with the city upon the following conditions; That the Magdeburghers ſhould humbly implore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the Emperor; that they ſhould not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture take arms, or enter into any alliance againſt the houſe of Auſtria; that they ſhould ſubmit to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Imperial chamber; that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the decree of the Diet at Augſburgh with reſpect to religion; that the new fortifications added to the town ſhould be demoliſhed; that they ſhould pay a fine of fifty thouſand crowns, deliver up twelve pieces of ordnance to the Emperor, and ſet the Duke of Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburgh, together with their other priſoners at liberty without ranſom. Next day their garriſon marched out, and Maurice took poſſeſſion of the town with great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary pomp.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE the terms of capitulation were ſettled, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice had held many conferences with Albert Count Mansfeldt, who had the chief command in Magdeburgh, and with Count Heideck, an officer who had ſerved with great reputation in the army of the league of Smalkalde, whom the Emperor had proſcribed on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his zeal for that cauſe, and whom Maurice had, notwithſtanding, ſecretly engaged in his ſervice, and admitted into the moſt intimate confidence. To them he communicated a ſcheme, which he had long revolved in his mind, for procuring liberty to his father-in-law the Landgrave, for vindicating the privileges of the Germanic body, and ſetting bounds to the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous encroachments of the Imperial power. Having conſulted with them about the meaſures which might
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:011837_0995_0F9D88EFB669D328"/>
be neceſſary for ſecuring the ſucceſs of ſuch an arduous enterprize, he gave Mansfeldt ſecret aſſurances that the fortifications of Magdeburgh ſhould not be deſtroyed, and that the inhabitants ſhould neither be diſturbed in the exerciſe of their religion, nor be deprived of any of their antient immunities. In order to engage Maurice more thoroughly from conſiderations of intereſt to fulfil theſe engagements, the ſenate of Magdeburgh elected him their Burgrave, a dignity which had formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Electoral houſe of Saxony, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled him to a very ample juriſdiction not only in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in its dependencies <note n="t" place="bottom">Sleid. 528. Thuan. 276. Obſidionis Magdeburgici deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio per Sebaſt. Beſſelmeierum. ap. Scard. ii. 518.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THUS the citizens of Magdeburgh, after enduring a ſiege of twelve months, and ſtruggling for their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, religious and civil, with an invincible fortitude, worthy of the cauſe in which it was exerted, had at laſt the good fortune to conclude a treaty which left them in a better condition than the reſt of their countrymen, whom their timidity, or want of public ſpirit, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into ſuch mean ſubmiſſions to the Emperor. But while a great part of Germany applauded the gallant conduct of the Magdeburghers, and rejoiced in their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſcaped the deſtruction with which they had been threatened, all admired Maurice's addreſs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his negociation with them, as well as the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with which he converted every event to his own advantage. They ſaw, with amazement, that after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflicted the Magdeburghers during many months with all the calamities of war, he was at laſt, by their voluntary election, veſted with ſupreme authority in that city which he had ſo lately beſieged; that after having been ſo long the object of their invectives and ſatire as an apoſtate, and an enemy to the religion which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; they ſeemed now to place unbounded confidence in his zeal and good will <note n="u" place="bottom">Arnoldi vita Maurit. apud Menken, ii. 1227.</note>. At the ſame time, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic articles in the treaty of capitulation were ſo perfectly conformable to thoſe which the Emperor had granted to the other Proteſtant cities, and Maurice took ſuch care to magnify his merit in having reduced a place which
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:011837_0996_0F9D88F070697E60"/>
had defended itſelf with ſo much obſtinacy, that Charles, far from ſuſpecting any thing fraudulent, or colluſive in the terms of accommodation, ratified them without he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, and abſolved the Magdeburghers from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ban which had been denounced againſt them.</p>
                  <p>THE only point that now remained to embarraſs Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice was how to keep together the veteran troops which had ſerved under him, as well as thoſe which had been employed in the defence of the town. For this, too, he found an expedient with ſingular art and felicity. His ſchemes againſt the Emperor were not yet ſo fully ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he durſt venture to diſcloſe them, and proceed openly to carry them into execution. The winter was approaching, which made it impoſſible to take the field immediately. He was afraid that it would give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature alarm to the Emperor, if he ſhould retain ſuch a conſiderable body in his pay until the ſeaſon of action returned in the ſpring. As ſoon then as Magdeburgh opened its gates, he ſent home his Saxon ſubjects, whom he could command to take arms and re-aſſemble on the ſhorteſt warning, to their own habitations; and at the ſame time, paying part of the arrears due to the merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary troops, who had followed his ſtandard, as well as to the ſoldiers who had ſerved in the garriſon, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them from their reſpective oaths of fidelity, and diſbanded them. But the moment he gave them their diſcharge, George Duke of Mecklenburgh, who was now ſet at liberty, offered to take them into his ſervice, and to become ſurety for the payment of what was ſtill owing to them. As ſuch adventurers were accuſtomed often to change maſters, they inſtantly accepted the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Thus, theſe troops were kept united, and ready to march wherever Maurice ſhould call them, while the Emperor, deceived by this artifice, and imagining that the Duke of Mecklenburgh had hired them with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſſert, by force of arms, his claim to a part of his brother's territories, ſuffered it to paſs without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, as if it had been a matter of no conſequence <note n="x" place="bottom">Thuan. 278.

                     <pb n="178" facs="unknown:011837_0997_0F9D88F2327BD7E8"/>HAVING ventured to take theſe ſteps which were of ſo much conſequence towards the execution of his ſchemes, Maurice, that he might divert the Emperor from obſerving their tendency too narrowly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſuſpicions which that muſt have excited, ſaw the neceſſity of employing ſome new artifice in order to engage his attention, and to confirm him in his preſent ſecurity. As he knew that the chief object of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's ſolicitude at this juncture, was how he might prevail with the Proteſtant ſtates of Germany to recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the authority of the council of Trent, and to ſend thither ambaſſadors in their own name, as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties from their reſpective churches, he took hold of this predominating paſſion, in order to amuſe and to deceive him. He affected a wonderful zeal to gratify Charles in what he deſired with regard to this matter; he nominated ambaſſadors, whom he impowered to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the council; he made choice of Melancthon, and ſome of the moſt eminent among his brethren, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a confeſſion of faith, and to lay it before that aſſembly. After his example, and probably in conſequence of his ſolicitations, the Duke of Wurtemberg, the city of Straſburgh, and other Proteſtant ſtates appointed am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and divines to attend the council. They all applied to the Emperor for his ſafe-conduct, which they obtained in the moſt ample form. This was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient for the ſecurity of the ambaſſadors, and they proceeded accordingly on their journey; but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate ſafe-conduct from the council itſelf, was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Proteſtant divines. The fate of John Huſs and Jerome of Prague, whom the council of Conſtance, in the preceding century, had condemned to the flames without regarding the Imperial ſafe-conduct, which had been granted them, rendered this precaution prudent and neceſſary. But as the Pope was no leſs unwilling that the Proteſtants ſhould be admitted to an hearing in the council, than the Emperor had been eager in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to demand it, the legate by promiſes and threats prevailed on the fathers of the council to decline iſſuing a ſafe-conduct in the ſame form with that which the council of Baſil had granted to the followers of Huſs. The Proteſtants, on their part, inſiſted upon the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011837_0998_0F9D88F2B6E30A68"/>
council's copying the preciſe words of that inſtrument. The Imperial ambaſſadors interpoſed in order to obtain what would ſatisfy them. Alterations in the form of the writ were propoſed; expedients were ſuggeſted; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts and counter-proteſts were taken; the legate, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his aſſociates laboured to gain their point by artifice and chicane; the Proteſtants adhered to theirs with firmneſs and obſtinacy. An account of every thing that paſſed in Trent was tranſmitted to the Emperor at Inſpruck, who, attempting from an exceſs of zeal, or of confidence in his own addreſs, to reconcile the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parties, was involved in a labyrinth of inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable negociations. By means of this, however, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice gained all that he had in view; the Emperor's time was wholely engroſſed, and his attention diverted; while he had leiſure to mature his ſchemes, to carry on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and to finiſh his preparations before he threw off the maſk, and ſtruck the blow which he had ſo long meditated <note n="z" place="bottom">Sleid. 526, 529.

                  <p>BUT previous to the hiſtory of Maurice's operations, ſome account muſt be given of a new revolution in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, which contributed not a little towards their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch extraordinary effects. When Solyman, in the year 1541, by a ſtratagem, which ſuited the baſe and inſidious policy of a petty uſurper, rather than the magnanimity of a mighty conqueror, deprived the young King of Hungary of the dominions which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left him, he had granted that unfortunate Prince the country of Tranſylvania, a province of his paternal kingdom. The government of this, together with the care of educating the young King, for he ſtill allowed him to retain that title, though he had rendered it only an empty name, he committed to the Queen and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuzzi, biſhop of Waradin, whom the late King had appointed his ſon's guardians, and regents of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, at a time when thoſe offices were of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. This co-ordinate juriſdiction occaſioned the ſame diſſenſions in a ſmall principality, as it would have excited in a great kingdom; an ambitious young Queen, conſcious of her capacity for governing, and an high

ſpirited prelate, contending who ſhould engroſs the greateſt ſhare in the adminiſtration. Each had their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans among the nobles, but as Martinuzzi, by his great talents, began to acquire the aſcendant, Iſabella turned his own arts againſt him, and courted the protection of the Turks.</p>
                  <p>THE neighbouring Baſhas, jealous of the biſhop's power, as well as abilities, readily promiſed her the aid which ſhe demanded, and would ſoon have obliged Martinuzzi to have given up to her the ſole direction of affairs, if his ambition, fertile in expedients, had not ſuggeſted to him a new meaſure, and one that tended not only to preſerve but to enlarge his authority. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded an agreement with the Queen, by the mediation of ſome of the nobles who were ſolicitous to ſave their country from the calamities of a civil war, he ſecretly diſpatched one of his confidents to Vienna, and entered into a negociation with Ferdinand. As it was no difficult matter to perſuade Ferdinand, that the ſame man whoſe enmity and intrigues had driven him out of a great part of his Hungarian dominions, might, upon a reconciliation, become equally inſtrumental in recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, he liſtened eagerly to the firſt overtures of an union with that prelate. Martinuzzi allured him by ſuch proſpects of advantage, and engaged, with ſo much confidence, that he would prevail on the moſt powerful of the Hungarian nobles to take arms in his favour, that Ferdinand, notwithſtanding his truce with Solyman, agreed to invade Tranſylvania. The command of the troops deſtined for that ſervice, conſiſting of veteran Spaniſh and German ſoldiers, was given to Caſtaldo Marquis de Piadena, an officer formed by the famous Marquis de Peſcara, whom he ſtrongly reſembled both in his enterprizing genius for civil buſineſs, and in his great knowledge in the art of war. This army, more formidable by the diſcipline of the ſoldiers, and the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the general, than by its number, was powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeconded by Martinuzzi and his faction among the Hungarians. As the Turkiſh Baſhas, the Sultan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being at the head of his army, on the frontiers of Perſia, could not afford the Queen ſuch immediate or effectual aſſiſtance as the exigency of her affairs required,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011837_1000_0F9D88F42FBE07D8"/>
ſhe quickly loſt all hopes of being able to retain any longer the authority which ſhe poſſeſſed as regent, and even began to deſpair of her ſon's ſafety.</p>
                  <p>MARTINUZZI did not ſuffer this favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of accompliſhing his own deſigns to paſs unimprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ventured, while ſhe was in this ſtate of dejection, to lay before her a propoſal, which, at any other time, ſhe would have rejected with diſdain. He repreſented how impoſſible it was for her to reſiſt Ferdinand's victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arms; that even if the Turks ſhould enable her to make head againſt them, ſhe would be far from changing her condition to the better, and could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as deliverers, but as maſters to whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhe muſt ſubmit; he conjured her, therefore, as ſhe regarded her own dignity, the ſafety of her ſon, or the ſecurity of Chriſtendom, rather to give up Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania to Ferdinand, and to make over to him her ſon's title to the crown of Hungary, than to allow both to be uſurped by the inveterate enemy of the Chriſtian faith. At the ſame time, he promiſed her, in Ferdinand's name, a compenſation for herſelf, as well as for her ſon, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their rank, and proportional to the value of what they were to ſacrifice. Iſabella, deſerted by ſome of her adherents, diſtruſting others, deſtitute of friends, and ſurrounded by Caſtaldo's and Martinuzzi's troops, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, though with a reluctant hand, theſe hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Upon this, ſhe ſurrendered ſuch places of ſtrength as were ſtill in her poſſeſſion, ſhe gave up all the enſigns of royalty, particularly a crown of gold, which, as the Hungarians believed, had deſcended from heaven, and conferred on him who wore it, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to the throne. As ſhe could not bear to remain a private perſon, in a country where ſhe once enjoyed ſovereign power, ſhe inſtantly ſet out with her ſon for Sileſia, in order to take poſſeſſion of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities of Oppelen and Ratibor, the inveſtiture of which Ferdinand had engaged to grant her ſon, and likewiſe to beſtow one of his daughters upon him in marriage.</p>
                  <p>UPON the reſignation of the young King, Martinuzzi, and after his example the reſt of the Tranſylvanian gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, ſwore allegiance to Ferdinand; who, in order to teſtify his grateful ſenſe of the zeal as well as ſucceſs
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011837_1001_0F9D88F4F07E5650"/>
with which that prelate had ſerved him, affected to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh him by every poſſible mark of favour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. He appointed him governor of Tranſylvania, with almoſt unlimited authority; he ordered Caſtaldo to pay the greateſt deference to his opinion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; he increaſed his revenues, which were already very great, by new appointments; he nominated him archbiſhop of Gran, and prevailed on the Pope to raiſe him to the dignity of a Cardinal. All this oſtentation of good will, however, was void of ſincerity, and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to conceal ſentiments the moſt perfectly its reverſe. Ferdinand dreaded Martinuzzi's abilities; diſtruſted his fidelity; and foreſaw, that as his extenſive authority enabled him to check any attempt towards circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or aboliſhing the extenſive privileges which the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian nobles poſſeſſed, he would ſtand forth, on every occaſion, the guardian of the liberties of his country, rather than act the part of a viceroy devoted to the will of his Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>FOR this reaſon, he ſecretly gave it in charge to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaldo, to watch his motions, to guard againſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and to thwart his meaſures. But Martinuzzi, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he did not perceive that Caſtaldo was placed as a ſpy on his actions, or becauſe he deſpiſed Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand's inſidious arts, aſſumed the direction of the war againſt the Turks with his uſual tone of authority, and conducted it with great magnanimity, and no leſs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He recovered ſome places of which the Infidels had taken poſſeſſion; he rendered their attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others abortive; and eſtabliſhed Ferdinand's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority not only in Tranſylvania, but in the Bannat of Temeſwar, and ſeveral of the countries adjacent. In carrying on theſe operations, he often differed in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Caſtaldo and his officers, and treated the Turkiſh priſoners with a degree of humanity, and even of generoſity, which Caſtaldo loudly condemned. This was repreſented at Vienna as an artful method of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friendſhip of the Infidels, that, by ſecuring their protection, he might ſhake off all dependence upon the Sovereign whom he now acknowledged. Though Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuzzi, in juſtification of his own conduct, contended that it was impolitic to exaſperate, by unneceſſary ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:011837_1002_0F9D88F5B2B84890"/>
an enemy prone to revenge, Caſtaldo's accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions gained credit with Ferdinand, prepoſſeſſed already againſt Martinuzzi, and jealous of every thing that could endanger his authority in Hungary, in proportion as he knew it to be precarious and ill eſtabliſhed. Theſe ſuſpicions, Caſtaldo confirmed and ſtrengthened, by the intelligence which he tranſmitted continually to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents at Vienna. By miſrepreſenting what was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and putting the worſt conſtruction on what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dubious in Martinuzzi's conduct; by imputing to him deſigns which he never formed, and charging him with actions of which he was not guilty; he at laſt convinced Ferdinand, that, in order to preſerve his Hungarian crown, he muſt cut off that ambitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. But Ferdinand, foreſeeing that it would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to proceed in the regular courſe of law againſt a ſubject of ſuch exorbitant power, as enabled him to ſet his Sovereign at defiance, determined to employ violence in order to obtain that ſatisfaction, which the laws were too feeble to afford him.</p>
                  <p>HE iſſued his orders accordingly to Caſtaldo, who willingly undertook that infamous ſervice. Having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the deſign to ſome Italian and Spaniſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers whom he could truſt, and concerted with them the plan of executing it; they entered Martinuzzi's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> early one morning, under pretence of preſenting to him ſome diſpatches which were to be ſent off imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to Vienna; and while he peruſed a paper with attention, one of their number ſtruck him with his poniard in the throat. The blow was not mortal; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuzzi ſtarted up with the intrepidity natural to him, and grappling the aſſaſſin, threw him to the ground; but the other conſpirators ruſhing in, an old man, unarmed, and alone, could not long ſuſtain ſuch an unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, but ſunk under the wounds which he received from ſo many hands. The dread of the foreign troops reſtrained the Tranſylvanians from riſing in arms, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take vengeance on the murderers of a prelate, who had long been the object of their love as well as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. They ſpoke of the deed, however, with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and execration; and exclaimed againſt Ferdinand,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:011837_1003_0F9D88F672BA8E98"/>
whom neither gratitude for recent and important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, nor reverence for a character conſidered as ſacred and inviolable among Chriſtians, could reſtrain from ſhedding the blood of a man, whoſe only crime was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to his native country. The nobles, deteſting the jealous as well as cruel policy of a court, which, upon uncertain and improbable ſurmiſes, had given up a perſon no leſs conſpicuous for his merit than his rank, to be butchered by aſſaſſins, either retired to their own eſtates, or, if they continued with the Auſtrian army, grew cold to the ſervice. The Turks, encouraged by the death of an enemy whoſe abilities they knew and dreaded, prepared to renew hoſtilities early in the ſpring; and, inſtead of the ſecurity which Ferdinand had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the removal of Martinuzzi, it was evident that his territories in Hungary were about to be attacked with greater vigour, and defended with leſs zeal than ever <note n="a" place="bottom">Sleid. 535.

                  <p>MEANWHILE, Maurice having almoſt finiſhed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and preparations, was on the point of declaring his intentions openly, and of taking the field againſt the Emperor.

Happily for him he found Henry in a diſpoſition to liſten to the firſt overture on his part, and in a ſituation which enabled him to bring the whole force of the French monarchy into action. Henry had long obſerved the progreſs of the Emperor's arms with jealouſy, and wiſhed to diſtinguiſh himſelf by trying his ſtrength againſt the ſame enemy, whom it had been the glory of his father's reign to oppoſe. He had laid hold on the firſt opportunity in his power of thwarting the Emperor's deſigns, by taking the Duke of Parma under his protection; and hoſtilities were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

begun, not only in that dutchy, but in Piedmont. Having terminated the war with England by a peace, no leſs advantageous to himſelf, than honourable for his allies the Scots, the reſtleſs and enterprizing courage of his nobles was impatient to diſplay itſelf on ſome theatre of action more conſpicuous than the petty operations in Parma or Piedmont afforded them.</p>
                  <p>JOHN DE FIESSE, biſhop of Bayonne, whom Henry bad ſent into Germany, under pretence of hiring troops to be employed in Italy, was empowered to conclude a treaty in form with Maurice and his aſſociates. As it would have been very indecent in a King of France to have undertaken the defence of the Proteſtant church, the intereſts of religion, how much ſoever they might be affected by the treaty, were not once mentioned in any of the articles. Religious concerns they pretended to commit entirely to the diſpoſition of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the only motives aſſigned for their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt Charles were to procure the Landgrave liberty, and to prevent the ſubverſion of the antient conſtitution and laws of the German empire. In order to accompliſh theſe ends, it was agreed, that all the contracting parties ſhould, at the ſame time, declare war againſt the Emperor; that neither peace nor truce ſhould be made but by common conſent, nor without including each of the confederates; that, in order to guard againſt the inconveniencies of anarchy, or of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to joint command, Maurice ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as head of the German confederates, with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authority in all military affairs; that Maurice and his aſſociates ſhould bring into the field ſeven thouſand horſe, with a proportionable number of infantry; that towards the ſubſiſtence of this army, during the three firſt months of the war, Henry ſhould contribute two hundred and forty thouſand crowns, and afterwards ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand crowns a month, as long as they continued in arms; that Henry ſhould attack the Emperor on the ſide of Lorrain with a powerful army; that if it were found requiſite to elect a new Emperor, ſuch a perſon ſhould be nominated as ſhall be agreeable to the King of France <note n="b" place="bottom">Recueil des Traites, tom. ii. 258. Thuan. lib. viii. 279.</note>. This treaty was concluded on the fifth of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:011837_1005_0F9D88F7F0D407D0"/>
October, ſome time before Magdeburgh ſurrendered, and the preparatory negociations were conducted with ſuch profound ſecrecy, that of all the Princes who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acceded to it, Maurice communicated what he was carrying on to two only, John Albert, the reigning Duke of Mecklenburgh, and William of Heſſe, the Landgrave's eldeſt ſon. The league itſelf was no leſs anxiouſly concealed, and with ſuch fortunate care, that no rumour concerning it reached the ears of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or his miniſters, nor do they ſeem to have conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt diſtant ſuſpicion of ſuch a tranſaction.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time Maurice, with a ſolicitude which was careful to draw ſome acceſſion of ſtrength from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter, applied to Edward VI. of England, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted a ſubſidy of four hundred thouſand crowns for the ſupport of a confederacy formed in defence of the Proteſtant religion. But the factions which prevailed in the Engliſh court during the minority of that Prince, and which deprived both the councils and arms of the nation of their wonted vigour, left the Engliſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters neither time or inclination to attend to foreign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and prevented Maurice's obtaining that aid, which their zeal for the Reformation would have prompted them to grant him <note n="c" place="bottom">Burnet's Hiſt. of the Reform. vol. ii. Append. 37.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE, however, having ſecured the protection of ſuch a powerful Monarch as Henry II. proceeded with great confidence, but with equal caution, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his plan. As he judged it neceſſary to make one effort more, in order to obtain the Emperor's conſent that the Landgrave ſhould be ſet at liberty, he ſent a ſolemn embaſſy, in his own name, and in that of the Elector of Brandenburgh, to Inſpruck. After reſuming, at great length, all the facts and arguments upon which they founded their claim, and repreſenting in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms, the peculiar engagements which bound them to be ſo aſſiduous in their ſolicitations, they renewed the requeſt in behalf of the unfortunate priſoner, which they had ſo often preferred in vain. The Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the Duke of Wurtemberg, the Dukes of Mecklen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, the Duke of Deuxponts, the Marquis of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:011837_1006_0F9D88F8B1EFC488"/>
Bareith, and the Marquis of Baden, by their ambaſſadors, concurred with them in their ſuit. Letters were likewiſe delivered to the ſame effect from the King of Denmark, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Dukes of Lunenburgh. Even the King of the Romans, moved with compaſſion towards the Landgrave in his wretched ſituation, or influenced, perhaps, by a ſecret jealouſy of his brother's power and deſigns, which, ſince his attempt to alter the order of ſucceſſion in the empire, he had come to view with other eyes, and dreaded to a great degree, joined in this application.</p>
                  <p>BUT Charles, conſtant to his own ſyſtem, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Landgrave, eluded a demand urged by ſuch powerful interceſſors; and having declared, That he would communicate his reſolution concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Maurice, as ſoon as he arrived at Inſpruck, where he was every day expected, he did not deign to deſcend into any more particular explication of his intentions <note n="d" place="bottom">Sleid. 531. Thuan. lib. viii. 280.</note>. This application, though of no benefit to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, was of great advantage to Maurice. It ſerved to juſtify his ſubſequent proceedings, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the neceſſity of employing arms in order to extort that equitable conceſſion, which his mediation or intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not obtain. It was of uſe, too, to confirm the Emperor in his ſecurity, as both the ſolemnity of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the ſolicitude with which ſo many Princes were drawn in to enforce it, led him to conclude, that Maurice placed all his hopes of reſtoring the Landgrave to liberty, in gaining his conſent to diſmiſs him.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE employed artifices ſtill more refined to conceal his machinations, to amuſe the Emperor, and to gain time. He affected to be more ſolicitous than ever to find out ſome expedient for removing the difficulties with regard to the ſafe-conduct for the Proteſtant divines appointed to attend the council, ſo that they might repair thither with ſafety. His ambaſſadors at Trent had frequent conferences concerning this matter, with the Imperial ambaſſadors in that city, and laid open their ſentiments to them with the appearance of the moſt unreſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. He was willing, at laſt, to have it believed,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:011837_1007_0F9D88F96F6CCAF8"/>
that he thought all differences with reſpect to this preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary article were on the point of being adjuſted; and, in order to give credit to this opinion, he commanded Melancthon, together with his brethren, to ſet out on their journey to Trent. At the ſame time, he held a cloſe correſpondence with the Imperial court at Inſpruck, and renewed on every occaſion his profeſſions of fidelity and attachment to the Emperor. He talked continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his intention of going to Inſpruck in perſon; he ordered a houſe to be hired for him in that city, and to be fitted up with the greateſt diſpatch for his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="e" place="bottom">Arnoldi vita Maurit. ap. Menken, ii. 1229.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT, profoundly ſkilled as Maurice was in the arts of deceit, and impenetrable as he thought the veil to be under which he concealed his deſigns, there were ſeveral things in his conduct which alarmed the Emperor amidſt his ſecurity, and tempted him frequently to ſuſpect that he was meditating ſomething extraordinary. As theſe ſuſpicions took their riſe from circumſtances inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in themſelves, or of an ambiguous as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain nature, they were more than counterbalanced by Maurice's addreſs; and the Emperor would not, lightly, give up his confidence in a man, whom he had once truſted and loaded with favours. One particular alone ſeemed to be of ſuch conſequence, that he thought it neceſſary to demand an explanation with regard to it. The troops, which George of Mecklenburgh had taken into pay after the capitulation of Magdeburgh, having fixed their quarters in Thuringia, lived at diſcretion on the lands of the rich eccleſiaſtics in their neighbourhood. Their licence and rapaciouſneſs were intolerable. Such as felt or dreaded their exactions, complained loudly to the Emperor, and repreſented them as a body of men kept in readineſs for ſome deſperate enterprize. But Maurice, partly by extenuating the enormities of which they had been guilty, partly by repreſenting the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of diſbanding theſe troops, or of keeping them to regular diſcipline, unleſs the arrears ſtill due to them, by the Emperor, were paid, either removed the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions which this had occaſioned, or as Charles was
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:011837_1008_0F9D88FA41801438"/>
not in a condition to ſatisfy the demands of theſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, obliged him to be ſilent with regard to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="f" place="bottom">Sleid. 549. Thuan. 339.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE time of action was now approaching. Maurice had privately diſpatched Albert of Brandenburgh to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, in order to confirm his league with Henry, and to haſten the march of the French army. He had taken meaſures to bring his own ſubjects together on the firſt ſummons; he had provided for the ſecurity of Saxony, while he ſhould be abſent with the army; and he held the troops in Thuringia, on which he chiefly depended, ready to advance on a moment's warning. All theſe complicated operations were carried on without being diſcovered by the court at Inſpruck, and the Emperor remained there in perfect tranquillity, buſied entirely in counteracting the intrigues of the Pope's lega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e at Trent, and in ſettling the conditions on which the Proteſtant divines ſhould be admitted into the council, as if there had not been any tranſaction of greater moment in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>THIS credulous ſecurity in a Prince, whoſe ſagacity in obſerving the conduct of all around him, commonly led him to an exceſs of diſtruſt, may ſeem unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and has been imputed to infatuation. But beſides, the exquiſite addreſs with which Maurice concealed his intentions, two circumſtances contributed to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The gout returned upon Charles ſoon after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Inſpruck, with an increaſe of violence; and his conſtitution being broken by ſuch frequent attacks, he was ſeldom able to exert his natural vigour of mind, or to conſider affairs with his uſual vigilance and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Granvelle, biſhop of Arras, his prime mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, though one of the moſt ſubtle ſtateſmen of that, or perhaps of any age, was on this occaſion the dupe of his own craft. He entertained ſuch an high opinion of his own abilities, and held the political talents of the Germans in ſuch contempt, that he deſpiſed all the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations given him concerning Maurice's ſecret machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or the dangerous deſigns which he was carrying on. When the Duke of Alva, whoſe dark ſuſpicious
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:011837_1009_0F9D88FAF0378950"/>
mind harboured many doubts concerning the Elector's ſincerity, propoſed calling him immediately to court, to anſwer for his conduct, he replied with great ſcorn, That theſe apprehenſions were groundleſs, and that a drunken German head was too groſs to form any ſcheme which he could not eaſily penetrate and baffle. Nor did he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this peremptory tone merely from confidence in his own diſcernment; he had bribed two of Maurice's miniſters, and received from them frequent and minute information concerning all their maſter's motions. But through this very channel, by which he expected to gain acceſs to all Maurice's counſels, and even to his thoughts, ſuch intelligence was conveyed to him as completed his deception. Maurice fortunately diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the correſpondence of the two traitors with Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle, and inſtead of puniſhing them for their crime, he dextrouſly availed himſelf of their fraud, and turned his own arts againſt the biſhop. He affected to treat theſe miniſters with greater confidence than ever; he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to his conſultations, and ſeemed to lay open his heart to them; and taking care all the while to let them be acquainted with nothing but what it was his intereſt ſhould be known, they tranſmitted to Inſpruck ſuch accounts as poſſeſſed Granvelle with a firm belief of his ſincerity and good intentions <note n="g" place="bottom">Melvil. Memoirs, fol. edit. p. 12.</note>. The Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the fulneſs of ſecurity, was ſo little moved by a memorial, in name of the eccleſiaſtical electors, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing him to be on his guard againſt Maurice, that he made light of this intelligence; and his anſwer to them abounds with declarations of his entire and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reliance on the fidelity as well as attachment of that Prince <note n="h" place="bottom">Sleid 535.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AT laſt Maurice's preparations were completed, and he had the ſatisfaction to find that his intrigues and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns were ſtill unknown. But, though now ready to take the field, he did not lay aſide the arts which he had hitherto employed; and by one piece of craft more, he deceived his enemies a few days longer. He gave out, that he was about to begin that journey to Inſpruck of which he had ſo often talked, and he took one of the

miniſters whom Granvelle had bribed to attend him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. After travelling poſt a few ſtages, he pretended to be indiſpoſed by the fatigue of the journey, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching the ſuſpected miniſter to make his apology to the Emperor for this delay, and to aſſure him that he would be at Inſpruck within a few days; as ſoon as this ſpy on his actions was gone, he mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, rode full ſpeed towards Thuringia, joined his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which amounted to twenty thouſand foot, and five thouſand horſe, and put it immediately in motion <note n="i" place="bottom">Melv. Mem. p. 13. Theſe circumſtances, concerning the Saxon miniſters, whom Granvelle had bribed, are not mentioned by the German hiſtorians; but, as Sir James Melvil received his information from the Elector Palatine, and as they are perfectly agreeable to the reſt of Maurice's conduct, they may be conſidered as authentic.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time he publiſhed a manifeſto containing his reaſons for taking arms. Theſe were three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; That he might ſecure the Proteſtant religion, which was threatened with immediate deſtruction; That he might maintain the conſtitution and laws of the empire, and ſave Germany from being ſubjected to the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an abſolute Monarch; That he might deliver the Landgrave of Heſſe from the miſeries of a long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt impriſonment. By the firſt, he rouzed all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the Reformation, a party formidable by their zeal as well as numbers, and rendered deſperate by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. By the ſecond, he intereſted all the friends of liberty, Catholics as well as Proteſtants, and made it their intereſt to unite with him in aſſerting the rights and privileges common to both. The third, beſides the glory which he acquired by his zeal to fulfil his engagements to the unhappy priſoner, was become a cauſe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concern, not only from the compaſſion which the Landgrave's ſufferings excited, but from indignation at the injuſtice and rigour of the Emperor's proceedings againſt him. Together with Maurice's manifeſto, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other appeared in the name of Albert, Marquis of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh Culmbach, who had joined him with a body of adventurers, whom he had drawn together. The ſame grievances which Maurice had pointed out are mentioned in it, but with an exceſs of virulence and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:011837_1011_0F9D88FD30FD4A50"/>
ſuitable to the character of the Prince in whoſe name it was publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>THE King of France added to theſe a manifeſto in his own name; in which, after taking notice of the antient alliance between the French and German nations, both deſcended from the ſame anceſtors; and after mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the applications, which, in conſequence of this, ſome of the moſt illuſtrious among the German Princes had made to him for his protection; he declared, That he now took arms to re-eſtabliſh the antient conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the empire, to deliver ſome of its Princes from captivity, and to ſecure the privileges and independence of all the members of the Germanic body. In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto, Henry aſſumed the extraordinary title of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Liberties of Germany, and of its captive Princes;</hi> and there was engraved on it a cap, the antient ſymbol of freedom, placed between two daggers, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to intimate to the Germans, that this bleſſing was to be acquired and ſecured by force of arms <note n="i" place="bottom">Sleid. 549. Thuan. lib. x. 339. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 371.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE had now a very different part to act, but his flexible genius was capable of accommodating itſelf to every ſituation. The moment he took arms, he was as bold and enterprizing in the field, as he had been cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and crafty in the cabinet. He advanced by rapid marches towards the Upper Germany. All the towns in his way opened their gates to him. He reinſtated the magiſtrates whom the Emperor had depoſed, and gave poſſeſſion of the churches to the Proteſtant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters whom he had ejected. He directed his march to Augſburgh, and as the Imperial garriſon which was too inconſiderable to think of defending it, retired imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, he took poſſeſſion of that great city, and made the ſame changes there, as in the towns through which he had paſſed.</p>
                  <p>NO words can expreſs the Emperor's aſtoniſhment and conſternation at events ſo unexpected. He ſaw a great number of the German Princes in arms againſt him, and the reſt either ready to join them, or wiſhing ſucceſs to their enterprize. He beheld a powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch united with them in cloſe league, ſeconding their
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:011837_1012_0F9D88FDF7A54510"/>
operations in perſon at the head of a formidable army, while he, through negligence and credulity, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him no leſs to ſcorn than to danger, had neither made, nor was in condition to make, any effectual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion either for cruſhing his rebellious ſubjects, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the invaſion of the foreign enemy. Part of his Spaniſh troops had been ordered into Hungary againſt the Turks; the reſt had marched back to Italy upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the war in the dutchy of Parma. The bands of veteran Germans had been diſmiſſed, becauſe he was not able to pay them; or had entered into Maurice's ſervice after the ſiege of Magdeburgh; and he remained at Inſpruck with a body of ſoldiers, ſcarce ſtrong enough to guard his own perſon. His treaſury was as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, as his army was reduced. He had received no remittances for ſome time from the new world. He had forfeited all credit with the merchants of Genoa and Venice, who refuſed to lend him money, though tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the offer of exorbitant intereſt. Thus, Charles, though undoubtedly the moſt conſiderable potentate in Chriſtendom, and capable of exerting the greateſt ſtrength, (as his power, though violently attacked, was ſtill unimpaired) found himſelf in a ſituation which rendered him unable to make ſuch a ſudden and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effort as the juncture required, and was neceſſary to have ſaved him from the preſent danger <note n="k" place="bottom">Sleid. 555. Thuan. 342.</note>.</p>
                  <p>IN this ſituation, he placed all his hopes on negociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the only reſource of thoſe who are conſcious of their own weakneſs. But thinking it inconſiſtent with his dignity to make the firſt advances to ſubjects who were in arms againſt him, he avoided that indecorum by employing the mediation of his brother Ferdinand. Maurice, confiding in his own talents to conduct any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation in ſuch a manner as to derive advantage from it, and hoping that by the appearance of facility in hearkening to the firſt overtures of accommodation, he might amuſe the Emperor, and tempt him to ſlacken the activity with which he was now preparing to defend himſelf, readily agreed to an interview with Ferdinand, in the town of Lintz, in Auſtria: and having left his
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:011837_1013_0F9D88FEAF21AC80"/>
army to proceed on its march, under the command of the Duke of Mecklenburgh, he repaired thither.</p>
                  <p>THE King of France punctually fulfilled his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his allies. He took the field early with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and well appointed army, and marching directly into Lorain, Toul and Verdun opened their gates at his approach. His forces appeared next before Metz, and that city, by a fradulent ſtratagem of the conſtable Montmorency, who having obtained permiſſion to paſs through it with a ſmall guard, introduced as many troops as were ſufficient to overpower the garriſon, was likewiſe ſeized without bloodſhed. Henry made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into all theſe towns with great pomp; he obliged the inhabitants to ſwear allegiance to him, and annexed theſe important conqueſts to the French monarchy. He left a ſtrong garriſon in Metz, From thence he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards Alſace, in order to attempt new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, to which the ſucceſs that had hitherto attended his arms invited him <note n="l" place="bottom">Thuan. 349.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE conference at Lintz did not produce any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Maurice, when he conſented to it, ſeems to have had nothing in view but to amuſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; for he made ſuch demands both in behalf of his confederates, and their ally the French King, as he knew would not be accepted by a Prince, too haughty to ſubmit, at once, to conditions dictated by an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But, how firmly ſoever Maurice adhered, during the negociation, to the intereſts of his aſſociates, or how ſteadily ſoever he kept in view the objects which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to take arms, he often profeſſed a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to terminate the differences with the Emperor in an amicable manner. Encouraged by this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a pacific diſpoſition, Ferdinand propoſed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond interview at Paſſau, on the twenty-ſixth of May, and that a truce ſhould commence on that day, and continue to the tenth of June, in order to give them leiſure for adjuſting all the points in diſpute.</p>
                  <p>UPON this, Maurice rejoined his army on the ninth of May, which had now advanced to Gundelfingen. He put his troops in motion next morning; and as ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:011837_1014_0F9D88FF715A9138"/>
days yet remained for action before the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truce, he reſolved, during that period, to venture upon an enterprize, the ſucceſs of which would be ſo deciſive, as would render the negociations at Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau extremely ſhort, and intitle him to treat upon his own terms. He foreſaw that the proſpect of a ceſſation of arms, which was to take place ſo ſoon, together with the opinion of his earneſtneſs to re-eſtabliſh peace, with which he had artfully amuſed Ferdinand, could not fail of inſpiring the Emperor with ſuch falſe hopes, that he would naturally become remiſs, and relapſe, into ſome degree of that ſecurity, which had already been ſo fatal to him. Relying on this conjecture, he marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards Inſpruck, and advanced with the moſt rapid motion that could be given to ſo great a body of troops. On the eighteenth he arrived at Fieſſen, a poſt of great conſequence, at the entrance into the Tyroleſe. There he found a body of eight hundred men, whom the Emperor had aſſembled, ſtrongly entrenched, in order to oppoſe his progreſs. He attacked them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with ſuch violence and impetuoſity, that they abandoned their lines precipitately, and falling back on a ſecond body poſted near Ruten, communicated to thoſe troops, the panic terror with which they themſelves had been ſeized, ſo that they likewiſe took to flight after a feeble reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>ELATED with this ſucceſs, which exceeded his moſt ſanguine hopes, Maurice paſſed on to Ehrenberg, a caſtle ſituated on a high and ſteep precipice, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the only paſs through the mountains. As this fort had been ſurrendered to the Proteſtants, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Smalkaldic war, becauſe the garriſon was then too weak to defend it, the Emperor, ſenſible of its importance, had taken care, at this juncture, to throw into it a body of troops ſufficient to maintain it againſt the greateſt army. But a ſhepherd, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a goat which had ſtrayed from his flock, having diſcovered an unknown path, by which it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to aſcend to the top of the rock, came with his ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable piece of intelligence to Maurice. A ſmall band of choſen ſoldiers, under the command of George of Mecklenburgh, was inſtantly ordered to follow this
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:011837_1015_0F9D89002FC01348"/>
guide. They ſet out in the evening, and clambering up the rugged track with infinite fatigue, as well as danger, they reached the ſummit unperceived; and at an hour which had been concerted, when Maurice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the aſſault on the one ſide of the caſtle, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the other, ready to ſcale the walls, which were feeble in that place, becauſe it had been hitherto deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inacceſſible. The garriſon, ſtruck with terror at the ſight of an enemy on a quarter where they had thought themſelves perfectly ſecure, immediately threw down their arms. Maurice, almoſt without bloodſhed, and, which was of greater conſequence to him, without loſs of time, took poſſeſſion of a place, the reduction of which might have retarded him long, and have required the utmoſt efforts of his valour and ſkill <note n="m" place="bottom">Arnoldi vita Maurit. 123.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE was now only two days march from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck, and without loſing a moment he ordered his infantry to advance thither, having left his cavalry, which was unſerviceable in that mountainous country, at Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, to guard the mouth of the paſs. He propoſed to advance with ſuch rapidity as to anticipate any accounts of the loſs of Ehrenberg, and to ſurprize the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, together with his attendants, in an open town, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of defence. But juſt as his troops began to move, a battallion of mercenaries mutinied, declaring that they would not ſtir until they had received the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, which, according to the cuſtom of that age, they claimed as the recompence due to them for having taken a place by aſſault. It was with great difficulty, as well as danger, and not without ſome conſiderable loſs of time, that Maurice quieted this inſurrection, and prevailed on the ſoldiers to follow him to a place where he promiſed them ſuch rich booty as would be an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reward for all their ſervices.</p>
                  <p>TO the delay occaſioned by this unforeſeen accident, the Emperor owed his ſafety. He was informed of the approaching danger, late in the evening, and knowing that nothing could ſave him but a ſpeedy flight, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly left Inſpruck, without regarding the darkneſs of the night, or the violence of the rain which happened to
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011837_1016_0F9D89020EF2F338"/>
fall at that time; and, notwithſtanding his being ſo much debilitated by the gout, that he could bear no motion but that of a litter, he travelled by the light of torches, taking his way over the Alps, by roads almoſt impaſſible. His courtiers and attendants followed him with equal precipitation, ſome of them on ſuch horſes as they could haſtily procure, many of them on foot, and all in the utmoſt confuſion. In this miſerable plight, very unlike the pomp with which Charles had appeared during the five preceding years, as the conqueror of Germany, he arrived at length with his dejected train at Villach, in Carinthia, and ſcarce thought himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure even in that remote inacceſſible corner.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE entered Inſpruck a few hours after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his attendants had left it; and, enraged that the prey ſhould eſcape out of his hands when he was juſt ready to ſeize it, he purſued them ſome miles; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to overtake perſons, to whom their fear gave ſpeed, he returned to the town, and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Emperor's baggage, and that of his miniſters to be plundered by the ſoldiers; while he preſerved untouched every thing belonging to the King or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, either becauſe he had formed ſome friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with that Prince, or becauſe he wiſhed to have it believed that ſuch a connection ſubſiſted between them. As there now remained only three days to the commencement of the truce, (with ſuch nicety had Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice calculated his operations) he ſet out for Paſſau, that he might meet Ferdinand on the day appointed.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE Charles left Inſpruck, he withdrew the guards placed on the degraded Elector of Saxony, whom, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five years, he had carried about with him as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner; and ſet him entirely at liberty, either with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to embaraſs Maurice by letting looſe a rival, who might diſpute his title to his dominions and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or from a ſenſe of the indecency of detaining him a priſoner, while he himſelf run the riſque of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his own liberty. But that Prince, ſeeing no way of eſcaping, but that which the Emperor took, and abhorring the thoughts of falling into the hands of a kinſman, whom he juſtly conſidered as the author of all his misfortunes, choſe rather to accompany Charles in
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:011837_1017_0F9D8902761ABD10"/>
his flight, and to expect the final deciſion of his fate from the treaty which was now approaching.</p>
                  <p>THIS was not the only effect which Maurice's opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions produced. It was no ſooner known at Trent that he had taken arms, than a general conſternation had ſeized the fathers of the council. The German pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates immediately returned home, that they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the ſafety of their territories. The reſt were extremely impatient to be gone; and the legate, who had hitherto diſappointed all the endeavours of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial ambaſſadors to procure for the Proteſtant divines an audience in the council, laid hold with joy on ſuch a plauſible pretext for diſmiſſing an aſſembly, which he had found it ſo difficult to govern. In a congregation held on the twenty eighth of April, a decree was iſſued for proroguing the council during two years, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing it to meet at the expiration of that time, if peace were then re-eſtabliſhed in Europe <note n="n" place="bottom">F. Paul, 353.</note>. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, however, continued no leſs than ten years; and its proceedings, when re-aſſembled in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſixty-two, fall not within the period preſcribed to this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>THE convocation of this aſſembly had been ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſired by all the ſtates and Princes in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who, from the wiſdom and piety of prelates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the whole body of the faithful, expected ſome charitable and efficacious endeavours towards compoſing the diſſenſions which unhappily had ariſen in the church. But the ſeveral Popes, by whoſe authority it was called, had other objects in view; and, exerting all their power or policy to attain theſe, acquired, by the abilities as well as addreſs of their legates, by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of many of the prelates, and by the ſervility of the indigent Italian biſhops, ſuch influence in the council, that they dictated all its decrees, and framed them, not with an intention to reſtore unity and concord to the church, but to eſtabliſh their own dominion, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm theſe tenets, upon which they imagined that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to be founded. Doctrines, which had hitherto been admitted upon the credit of tradition alone, and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:011837_1018_0F9D8903331F5B48"/>
received with ſome latitude of interpretation, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with a ſcrupulous nicety, and confirmed by the ſanction of authority. Rites, which had formerly been obſerved only in deference to cuſtom, ſuppoſed to be antient, were eſtabliſhed by the decrees of the church, and declared to be eſſential parts of its worſhip. The breach, inſtead of being cloſed, was widened, and made irreparable. In place of any attempt to reconcile the contending parties, a line was drawn with ſuch ſtudied accuracy, as aſcertained and marked out the diſtinction between them. This ſtill ſerves to keep them at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and muſt, without ſome ſignal interpoſition of Divine Providence, render the ſeparation perpetual.</p>
                  <p>OUR knowledge of the proceedings of this aſſembly is derived from three different authors. Father Paul of Venice wrote his hiſtory of the council of Trent, while the memory of what had paſſed there was recent, and ſome, who had been members of it, were ſtill alive. He has expoſed the intrigues and artifices by which it was conducted, with a freedom and ſeverity which have given a deep wound to the credit and reputation of the council. He has deſcribed its deliberations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained its decrees, with ſuch perſpicuity and depth of thought, with ſuch various erudition, and ſuch force of reaſon, as have juſtly intitled his work to be placed among the moſt admired hiſtorical compoſitions. About half a century thereafter, the Jeſuit Pallavicini publiſhed his hiſtory of the council, in oppoſition to that of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul, and by employing all the force of an acute and refining genius to invalidate the credit, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the reaſonings of his antagoniſt, he labours to prove, by artful apologies for the proceedings of the council, and ſubtile interpretations of its decrees, that it delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with impartiality, and decided with judgment as well as candour. Vargas, a Spaniſh doctor of laws, who was appointed to attend the Imperial ambaſſadors at Trent, ſent the biſhop of Arras a regular account of the tranſactions there, explaining all the arts which the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate employed to influence, or over-awe the council. His letters have been publiſhed, in which he inveighs againſt the papal court with that aſperity of cenſure, which was natural to a man whoſe ſituation enabled him
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:011837_1019_0F9D8903F2DEFEB8"/>
to obſerve its arts thoroughly, and who was obliged to exert all his attention and talents in order to diſappoint them. But, which ſoever of theſe authors an intelligent perſon takes for his guide, in forming a judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpirit of the council, he muſt diſcover ſo much ambition, as well as artifice, among ſome of the members, ſo much ignorance and corruption among others; he muſt obſerve ſuch a large infuſion of human policy and paſſions, but ſuch a ſcanty portion of that ſimplicity of heart, ſanctity of manners, and love of truth, which alone qualify men to determine what doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are worthy of God, and what worſhip is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him; that he will find it no eaſy matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any extraordinary influence of the Holy Ghoſt hovered over this aſſembly, and dictated its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>
                  <p>WHILE Maurice was employed in negociating with the King of the Romans at Lintz, or in making war on the Emperor in the Tyrol, the French King had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into Alſace as far as Straſburgh; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded leave of the ſenate to march through the city, he hoped that by repeating the ſame fraud which he had practiſed at Metz, he might render himſelf maſter of the place, and by that means ſecure a paſſage over the Rhine, into the heart of Germany. But the Straſburghers, inſtructed and put on their guard by the credulity and misfortune of their neighbours, ſhut their gates; and having aſſembled a garriſon of five thouſand ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, prepared their fortifications, razed the houſes in their ſuburbs, and determined to defend themſelves to the utmoſt. At the ſame time they ſent a deputation of their moſt reſpectable citizens to the King, in order to divert him from making any hoſtile attempt upon them. The Electors of Treves and Cologne, the Duke of Cleves, and other Princes in the neighbourhood, interpoſed in their behalf; beſeeching Henry that he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get ſo ſoon the title which he had generouſly aſſumed; and, inſtead of being the deliverer of Germany, become its oppreſſor. The Swiſs cantons ſeconded them with zeal, ſoliciting Henry to ſpare a city which had long been connected with their community in friendſhip and alliance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:011837_1020_0F9D8904B0CF3958"/>POWERFUL as this united interceſſion was, it would not have prevailed on Henry to forego a prize of ſo much value, if he had been in a condition to have ſeized it. But, in that age, the method of ſubſiſting nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous armies at a diſtance from the frontiers of their own country, was imperfectly underſtood, and neither the revenues of Princes, nor their experience in the art of war, were equal to the great and complicated efforts which ſuch an undertaking required. The French, though not far removed from their own country, began already to ſuffer for want of proviſions, and had no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient magazines collected to ſupport them during a ſiege, which muſt neceſſarily have been of great length <note n="o" place="bottom">Thuan. 351, 352.</note>. At the ſame time, the Queen of Hungary, governeſs of the Low-Countries, had aſſembled a conſiderable body of troops, which, under the command of Martin de Roſſem, laid waſte Champagne, and threatened the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent provinces of France. Theſe concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances obliged the King, though with reluctance, to abandon the enterprize. But being willing to acquire ſome merit with his allies, by this retreat, which he could not avoid, he pretended to the Swiſs that he had taken the reſolution merely in compliance with their requeſt <note n="p" place="bottom">Slied. 557. Brantome, tom. vii. 39.</note>; and then, after giving orders that all the horſes in his army ſhould be led to drink in the Rhine, as a proof of his having puſhed his conqueſts ſo far, he marched back towards Champagne.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the French King and the main army of the confederates were thus employed; Albert of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh was entruſted with the command of a ſeparate body of eight thouſand men, conſiſting chiefly of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries who had reſorted to his ſtandard, rather from the hope of plunder, than the expectation of regular pay. That Prince, ſeeing himſelf at the head of ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deſperate adventurers, ready to follow wherever he ſhould lead them, ſoon began to diſdain a ſtate of ſubordination, and to form ſuch vaſt ſchemes of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing himſelf, as ſeldom occur, even to ambitious minds, unleſs when civil war, or violent factions, rouze them to bold exertions, by alluring them with immediate hopes of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:011837_1021_0F9D89056EC61730"/>
ſucceſs. Full of theſe aſpiring thoughts, Albert made war in a manner very different from the other confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. He endeavoured to ſpread the terror of his arms by the rapidity of his motions, as well as the extent and rigour of his devaſtations; he exacted contributions wherever he came, in order to amaſs ſuch a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as would put it in his power to keep his army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; he laboured to get poſſeſſion of Nuremberg, Ulme, or ſome other of the free cities in Upper Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, in which, as a capital, he might fix the ſeat of his power. But, finding theſe cities on their guard, and in a condition to reſiſt his attacks, he turned all his rage againſt the Popiſh eccleſiaſtics, whoſe territories he plundered with ſuch wanton and mercileſs barbarity, as gave them a very unfavourable impreſſion of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that reformation in religion, with zeal for which he pretended to be animated. The biſhops of Bamberg and Wurzburgh, by their ſituation, lay particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his ravages; he obliged the former to transfer to him, in property, almoſt one half of his extenſive dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, and compelled the latter to advance an immenſe ſum, in order to ſave his country from ruin and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. During all theſe wild ſallies, Albert paid no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either to Maurice's orders, whoſe commands, as Generaliſſimo of the league, he had engaged to obey, or to the remonſtrances of the other confederates; and manifeſtly diſcovered that he attended only to his own private emolument, without any ſolicitude about the common cauſe, or the general objects which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to take arms <note n="q" place="bottom">Sleid. 561.

                  <p>MEANWHILE, Maurice having ordered his army to march back into Bavaria, and having publiſhed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation enjoining the Lutheran clergy and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of youth, to reſume the exerciſe of their functions in all the cities, ſchools, and univerſities, from which they had been ejected, met Ferdinand at Paſſau on the twenty-ſixth day of May. As matters of the greateſt conſequence to the future peace and independence of the empire were to be ſettled in this congreſs, the eyes of all Germany were fixed upon it. Beſides Ferdinand

and the Imperial ambaſſadors, the Duke of Bavaria, the biſhops of Saltzburgh, and Aichſtadt, the miniſters of all the Electors, together with deputies from moſt of the conſiderable Princes and free cities, reſorted to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau. Maurice, in name of his aſſociates, and the King of the Romans, as the Emperor's repreſentative, opened the negociation. The Princes who were preſent, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the deputies of ſuch as were abſent, acted as interceſſors or mediators between them.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE, in a long diſcourſe, explained the motives of his own conduct. After having enumerated all the unconſtitutional and oppreſſive acts of the Emperor's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, he, agreeably to the manifeſto, which he had publiſhed when he took arms againſt him, limited his demands to three articles. That the Landgrave of Heſſe ſhould be immediately ſet at liberty; That the grievances in the civil government of the empire ſhould be redreſſed; and that the Proteſtants ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the public exerciſe of their religion without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ferdinand and the Imperial ambaſſadors diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unwillingneſs to gratify him with regard to all all theſe points, the mediators wrote a joint letter to the Emperor, beſeeching him to deliver Germany from the calamities of a civil war, by giving ſuch ſatisfaction to Maurice, and his party, as might induce them to lay down their arms; and at the ſame time they prevailed upon Maurice to grant a prolongation of the truce for a ſhort time, during which they undertook to procure the Emperor's final anſwer to his demands.</p>
                  <p>THIS requeſt was preſented to the Emperor in the name of all the Princes of the empire, Popiſh as well as Proteſtant, in the name of ſuch as had lent a hand to forward his ambitious ſchemes, as well as of thoſe who had viewed the progreſs of his power with jealouſy and dread. The uncommon and cordial unanimity with which they concurred at this juncture, in enforcing Maurice's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and in recommending peace, flowed from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cauſes. Such as were moſt attached to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic church could not help obſerving that the Proteſtant confederates were at the head of a numerous army, while the Emperor was but juſt beginning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own defence. They foreſaw that great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011837_1023_0F9D8906F37687B0"/>
would be required of them, and would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary on their part, in order to cope with enemies who had been allowed to get the ſtart ſo far, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch formidable power. Experience had taught them, that the fruit of all theſe efforts would be reaped by the Emperor alone, and the more complete any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proved which they ſhould gain, the faſter would they bind their own fetters, and render them the more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Theſe conſiderations made them cautious how they contributed a ſecond time, by their indiſcreet zeal, to put the Emperor in poſſeſſion of power which would be fatal to the liberties of their country. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the implacable fierceneſs of the ſpirit of bigotry in that age, they choſe rather that the Proteſtants ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſecurity for their religion which they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than, by aſſiſting Charles to oppreſs them, to give ſuch additional force to the Imperial prerogative, as would overturn the conſtitution of the empire. To all theſe conſiderations, the dread of ſeeing Germany laid waſte by a civil war added new force. Many ſtates of the empire already felt the deſtructive rage of Albert's arms, others dreaded it, and all wiſhed for an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation between the Emperor and Maurice, which they hoped would ſave them from that cruel ſcourge.</p>
                  <p>SUCH were the reaſons that induced ſo many Princes, notwithſtanding the variety of their political intereſts, and the oppoſition in their religious ſentiments, to unite in recommending to the Emperor an accommodation with Maurice, not only as a ſalutary, but as a neceſſary meaſure. The motives which prompted Charles to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it were not fewer or of leſs weight. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſenſible of the advantage which the confederates had acquired through his own negligence; and he now felt the inſufficiency of his own reſources to oppoſe them. His Spaniſh ſubjects, diſguſted at his long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and weary of endleſs wars, which were of no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to their country, refuſed to furniſh him any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſupply either of men or money; and although he might hope by his addreſs, or importunity, to draw from them at laſt more effectual aid; that, he knew, was too diſtant to be of any ſervice in the preſent exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his affairs. His treaſury was drained; his veteran
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:011837_1024_0F9D8907B10BB1D0"/>
forces were diſperſed, or diſbanded, and he could not depend much either on the fidelity or courage of the new levied ſoldiers whom he was collecting. There was no hope of repeating with ſucceſs the ſame artifices which had weakened and ruined the Smalkaldic league. As the end at which he aimed was now known, he could no longer employ the ſpecious pretexts, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly concealed his ambitious deſigns. Every Prince in Germany was alarmed and on his guard; and it was vain to think of blinding them a ſecond time to ſuch a degree, as to make one part of them inſtruments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the other. The ſpirit of a confederacy, whereof Maurice was the head, experience had taught him to be very different from that of the league of Smalkalde; and from what he had already felt, he had no reaſon to flatter himſelf that its counſels would be as irreſolute, or its efforts as timid and feeble. If he ſhould reſolve on continuing the war, he might lay his account that the moſt conſiderable ſtates in Germany would take part in it againſt him; and a dubious neutrality was the utmoſt he could expect from the reſt. While the confederates found full employment for his arms in one quarter, the King of France would ſeize the favourable opportunity, and puſh on his operations in another, with almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſucceſs. That Monarch had already made conqueſts in the empire, which he was no leſs eager to recover, than impatient to be revenged on him for aiding his malecontent ſubjects. Though Henry had now retired from the banks of the Rhine, he had only varied the ſcene of hoſtilities, having invaded the Low-Countries with all his forces. The Turks, rouzed by the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the French King, as well as ſtimulated by reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Ferdinand, for having violated the truce in Hungary, had prepared a powerful fleet to ravage the coaſts of Naples and Sicily, which he had left almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs, by calling thence the greateſt part of the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops, to join the army which he was now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>FERDINAND, who went in perſon to Villach, in order to lay before the Emperor the reſult of the conferences at Paſſau, had likewiſe reaſons peculiar to himſelf for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring an accommodation. Theſe prompted him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:011837_1025_0F9D89086F7C6328"/>
with the greateſt earneſtneſs, the arguments which the Princes, aſſembled there, had employed in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it. He had obſerved, not without ſecret ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, the fatal blow which had been given to the deſpotic power, which his brother had uſurped in the empire. He was extremely ſolicitous to prevent Charles from recovering what he had loſt, as he foreſaw that he would immediately reſume with freſh eagerneſs, and a better chance of ſucceſs, his favourite ſcheme of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that power to his ſon, by excluding him from the right of ſucceſſion to the Imperial throne. On this account, he was willing to contribute towards circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Imperial authority, in order to render his own poſſeſſion of it certain. Beſides, Solyman, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated at the loſs of Tranſylvania, and ſtill more at the fradulent arts by which it had been ſeized, had ordered into the field an army of an hundred thouſand men, which having defeated a great body of Ferdinand's troops, and taken ſeveral places of importance, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened not only to complete the conqueſt of the province, but to drive him out of that part of Hungary which was ſtill ſubject to his juriſdiction. He was unable to reſiſt ſuch a mighty enemy; his brother, while engaged in a domeſtic war, could afford him no aid; and he could not even hope to draw from Germany the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent either of troops or money, uſually furniſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the invaſions of the Infidels. Maurice, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Ferdinand's perplexity, with regard to this laſt point, had offered, if peace were re-eſtabliſhed on a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure foundation, that he would march in perſon with his troops into Hungary, to his aſſiſtance. Such was the effect of this well-timed propoſal, that Ferdinand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of every other proſpect of relief, became the moſt zealous advocate the confederates could have choſen to urge their claims, and there was ſcarce any thing that they could have demanded which he would not have choſen to grant, rather than to have retarded a pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which he truſted as the only means of ſaving his Hungarian crown.</p>
                  <p>WHEN ſo many cauſes conſpired in rendering an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation elegible, it might have been expected that it would have immediately taken place. But the
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011837_1026_0F9D89093090F008"/>
inflexibility of the Emperor's temper, together with his unwillingneſs to relinquiſh, at once, objects which he had long purſued with ſuch earneſtneſs and aſſiduity, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalanced for ſome time, the force of all the motives which diſpoſed him to peace, and not only put that event at a diſtance, but ſeemed to render it uncertain. When Maurice's demands, together with the letter of the mediators at Paſſau, were preſented to him, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily refuſed to redreſs the grievances which were pointed out, nor would he agree to any ſtipulation for the immediate ſecurity of the Proteſtant religion, but propoſed referring both theſe to the determination of a future Diet. On his part, he required that inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ſhould be made to all who, during the preſent war, had ſuffered either by the licentiouſneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate troops, or the actions of their leaders.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE, who was well acquainted with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's arts, immediately concluded that he had nothing in view in theſe overtures but to amuſe and deceive; and therefore, without liſtening to Ferdinand's intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he left Paſſau abruptly, and joining his troops, which were encamped at Mergentheim, a city in Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia, belonging to the knights of the Teutonic order, he put them in motion, and renewed hoſtilities. As three thouſand men in the Emperor's pay had thrown themſelves into Franckfort on the Maine, and might from thence infeſt the neighbouring country of Heſſe, he marched towards that city, and laid ſiege to it in form. The briſkneſs of this enterprize, and the vigour with which Maurice carried on his approaches againſt the town, gave ſuch an alarm to the Emperor, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to lend a more favourable ear to Ferdinand's arguments in behalf of an accommodation. Firm and haughty as his nature was, he found it neceſſary to bend, and ſignified his willingneſs to make conceſſions on his part, if Maurice, in return, would abate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the rigour of his demands. Ferdinand, as ſoon as he perceived that he began to yield, did not deſiſt from his importunities, until he prevailed on him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what was the utmoſt that he would grant for the ſecurity of the confederates. Having gained this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult point, he inſtantly diſpatched a meſſenger to Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice's
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:011837_1027_0F9D8909F09B2168"/>
camp, and importing to him the Emperor's final reſolution, and conjured him not to fruſtrate his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the re-eſtabliſhment of peace; or, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable obſtinacy on his ſide, to diſappoint the wiſhes of all Germany for that ſalutary event.</p>
                  <p>MAURICE, notwithſtanding the proſperous ſituation of his affairs, was ſtrongly inclined to liſten to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Emperor, though over-reached and ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had now begun to aſſemble troops, and how ſlow ſoever his motions might be, while the firſt effects of his conſternation remained, he was ſenſible that Charles muſt at laſt act with vigour proportional to the extent of his power and territories, and lead into Germany an army formidable by its numbers, and ſtill more by the terror of his name, as well as the remembrance of his paſt victories. He could ſcarce hope that a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, compoſed of ſo many members, would continue to operate with ſufficient union and perſeverance to reſiſt the conſiſtent and well directed efforts of an army, at the abſolute diſpoſal of a leader accuſtomed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and to conquer. He felt already, although he had not hitherto experienced the ſhock of any adverſe event, that he was the head of a disjointed body. He ſaw from the example of Albert of Brandenburgh, how difficult it would be, with all his addreſs and credit, to prevent any particular member from detaching himſelf from the whole, and how impoſſible to recal him to his proper rank and ſubordination. This filled him with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for the common cauſe. Another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration gave him no leſs diſquiet with regard to his own particular intereſts. By ſetting at liberty the degraded Elector, and by repealing the act depriving him of his hereditary honours and dominions, the Emperor had it in his power to wound him in the moſt ſenſible part. The efforts of a Prince beloved by his antient ſubjects, and revered by all the Proteſtant party, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what had been unjuſtly taken from him, could ſcarce have failed of exciting commotions in Saxony, which would endanger all that he had acquired at the expence of ſo much diſſimulation and artifice. It was no leſs in the Emperor's power to render vain all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations of the confederates in behalf of the Landgrave.
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:011837_1028_0F9D890AAFEA1148"/>
He had only to add one act of violence more to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and rigour with which he had already treated him; and he had accordingly threatened the ſons of that unfortunate Prince, that if they perſiſted in their preſent enterprize, inſtead of ſeeing their father reſtored to liberty, they ſhould hear of his having ſuffered the puniſhment which his rebellion had merited <note n="r" place="bottom">Sleid. 571.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HAVING deliberated upon all theſe points with his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, Maurice thought it more prudent to accept of the conditions offered, though leſs advantageous than thoſe he had propoſed, than again to commit all to the doubtful iſſue of war <note n="s" place="bottom">Sleid. Hiſt. 563, &amp;c. Thuan. lib. x. 359, &amp;c.</note>. He repaired forthwith to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, and ſigned the treaty of peace; of which the chief articles were, That before the twelfth day of Auguſt, the confederates ſhall lay down their arms, and diſband their forces; That on or before that day the Landgrave ſhall be ſet at liberty, and conveyed in ſafety to his caſtle of Rheinfels; That a Diet ſhall be held within ſix months, in order to deliberate concerning the moſt proper and effectual method of preventing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all diſputes and diſſenſions about religion; That, in the mean time, neither the Emperor nor any other Prince, ſhall, upon any pretext whatever, offer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:011837_1029_0F9D890B6F71DBD8"/>
and liberties of the empire, ſhall be remitted to the approaching Diet; That Albert of Brandenburgh ſhall be comprehended in the treaty, provided he ſhall accede to it, and diſband his forces before the twelfth of Auguſt <note n="t" place="bottom">Recueil des Traitez, ii. 261.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the memorable treaty of Paſſau, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the vaſt fabric, in erecting which Charles had employed ſo many years, and had exerted the utmoſt of his power and policy; which annulled all his regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with regard to religion; defeated all his hopes of rendering the Imperial authority abſolute and hereditary in his family; and eſtabliſhed the Proteſtant church, which had hitherto ſubſiſted precariouſly in Germany, through connivance, or by expedients, upon a firm and ſecure baſis. Maurice reaped all the glory of having concerted and completed this unexpected revolution. It is a ſingular circumſtance, that the Reformation ſhould be indebted for its ſecurity and full eſtabliſhment in Germany, to the ſame hand which had formerly brought it to the brink of deſtruction, and that both events ſhould have been accompliſhed by the ſame arts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. The ends, however, which Maurice had in view, at theſe different junctures, ſeem to have been more attended to than the means by which he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; and he was now as univerſally extolled for his zeal and public ſpirit, as he had lately been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for his indifference and intereſted policy. It is no leſs worthy of obſervation, that the French King, a Monarch zealous for the Catholic faith, ſhould, at the very time he was perſecuting his own Proteſtant ſubjects with all the fierceneſs of bigotry, employ his power in order to protect and maintain the Reformation in the empire; and that the league for this purpoſe, which proved ſo fatal to the Romiſh church, ſhould be nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated and ſigned by a Roman Catholic biſhop. So won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully doth the wiſdom of God ſuperintend and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the caprice of human paſſions, and render them ſubſervient towards the accompliſhment of his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes!</p>
                  <p>LITTLE attention was paid to the intereſts of the French King during the negociations at Paſſau. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:011837_1030_0F9D890C2FEB6520"/>
and his aſſociates, having gained what they had in view, diſcovered no great ſolicitude about an ally, whom, perhaps, they reckoned to be over-paid, by his acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Lorain, for the aſſiſtance which he had given them. A ſhort clauſe, which they procured to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the treaty, importing, that the King of France might communicate to theſe confederates his particular pretenſions or cauſes of hoſtility, which they would lay before the Emperor, was the only ſign that they gave of their remembering how much they had been indebted to him for their ſucceſs. Henry experienced the ſame treatment, which every prince who lends his aid to the authors of a civil war may expect. As ſoon as the rage of faction began to ſubſide, and any proſpect of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation began to open, his ſervices were forgotten, and his aſſociates made a merit with their Sovereign, of the ingratitude with which they abandoned their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But how much ſoever Henry might be enraged at the perfidy of his allies, or at the impatience with which they haſtened to make their peace with the Emperor at his expence, he was perfectly ſenſible that it was more his intereſt to keep well with the Germanic body, than to reſent the indignities offered him by any particular members of it. For that reaſon he diſmiſſed the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he had received from Maurice and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates, and affected to talk in the ſame ſtrain, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, concerning his zeal for maintaining the antient conſtitution and liberties of the empire.</p>

                  <p>AS ſoon as the treaty of Paſſau was ſigned, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, in conſequence of his engagements with Ferdinand, marched into Hungary at the head of twenty thouſand men. But the vaſt ſuperiority of the Turkiſh armies, the frequent mutinies, both of the Spaniſh and German ſoldiers, occaſioned by their want of pay, together with the diſſentions between Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Caſtaldo, who was piqued at being obliged to reſign the chief command to him, prevented his performing any thing in that country worthy of his former fame, or of great benefit to the King of the Romans <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſluanhaffi Hiſt.

                  <p>WHEN Maurice ſet out for Hungary, the Prince of Heſſe parted from him with the forces under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and marched back into his own country, that he might be ready to receive his father upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and give up to him the reins of government which he had held during his abſence. But fortune was not yet weary of perſecuting the Landgrave. A battalion of mercenary troops, which had been in the pay of Heſſe, being ſeduced by Reifenberg their colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,

a ſoldier of fortune, and ready to engage in any enterprize, ſecretly withdrew from the young Prince as he was marching homewards, and joined Albert of Brandenburgh, who ſtill continued in arms againſt the Emperor, refuſing to be included in the treaty of Paſſau. Unhappily for the Landgrave, an account of this reached the Netherlands, juſt as he was diſmiſſed from the citadel of Mechlin where he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, but before he had got beyond the frontiers of that country. The Queen of Hungary, who govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in her brother's name, incenſed at ſuch an open violation of the treaty to which he owed his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, commanded him to be arreſted, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him again to the cuſtody of the ſame Spaniſh cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who had guarded him for five years with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere vigilence. Philip beheld all the horrors of his impriſonment renewed, and his ſpirits ſubſiding in the ſame proportion as they had riſen during the ſhort interval in which he had enjoyed liberty, he ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpair, and believed himſelf to be doomed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual captivity. But the matter being explained to the Emperor's full ſatisfaction, that the revolt of Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenberg's mercenaries could be imputed neither to the Landgrave nor to his ſon, he gave orders for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe; and Philip at laſt obtained the liberty for which he ſo long languiſhed <note n="*" place="bottom">Sleid. 573.

which he meditated againſt the King of France, he, among other expedients for that purpoſe, thought of releaſing from impriſonment a Prince whoſe merit entitled him no leſs to eſteem, than his ſufferings ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him the object of compaſſion. John Frederick took poſſeſſion accordingly of that part of his territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which had been reſerved for him, when Maurice was inveſted with the Electoral dignity. As he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to diſplay in this ſituation, the ſame virtuous magnanimity, for which he had been conſpicuous in a more proſperous and ſplendid ſtate, and which he had retained amidſt all his ſufferings, he lived ſeveral years in that high reputation to which he had ſo juſt a title.</p>
                  <p>THE loſs of Metz, Toul and Verdun, had made a deep impreſſion on the Emperor. Accuſtomed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all his operations againſt France with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to himſelf, he thought that it nearly concerned his honour not to allow Henry the ſuperiority in this war, or to ſuffer his own adminiſtration to be ſtained with the infamy of having permitted territories of ſuch conſequence to be diſmembered from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. This was no leſs a point of intereſt than of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. As the frontier of Champagne was more nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lay more expoſed than that of any province in France, he had frequently, during his wars with that kingdom, made inroads upon it with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and effect; but if Henry were allowed to retain his late conqueſts, France would gain ſuch a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble barrier on that ſide, as to be altogether ſecure, where formerly ſhe had been the weakeſt. On the other hand, the Emperor had now loſt as much, in point of ſecurity, as France had acquired, and being ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the defence which thoſe cities afforded it, lay open to be invaded on a quarter, where all the towns having been hitherto conſidered as interior, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any enemy, were but ſlightly fortified. Theſe conſiderations determined Charles to attempt recovering the three towns of which Henry had made himſelf maſter; and the preparations which he made againſt Maurice and his aſſociates enabled him to carry his reſolution into immediate execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="unknown:011837_1034_0F9D890F3391E398"/>AS ſoon, then, as the peace was concluded at Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, he left his inglorious retreat at Villach, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to Augſburg at the head of a conſiderable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Germans which he had levied, together with all the troops which he had drawn out of Italy and Spain. To theſe he added ſeveral battalions, which having been in the pay of the Confederates, entered into his ſervice when diſmiſſed by them; and he prevailed likewiſe on ſome of the Princes of the Empire to join him with their vaſſals. In order to conceal the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this formidable army, and to guard againſt alarming the French ſo as to put them on preparing for their defence, he gave out that he was to march forthwith into Hungary, in order to ſecond Maurice in his operations againſt the Infidels. When he began to advance towards the Rhine, and could no longer employ that pretext, he tried a new artifice, and ſpread a report that he was marching in order to chaſtiſe Albert of Brandenburg, whoſe cruel exactions in that part of the Empire called loudly for his interpoſition to check them.</p>
                  <p>BUT the French having grown acquainted, at laſt, with arts by which they had been ſo often deceived, viewed all Charles's motions with diſtruſt. Henry immediately gueſſed the true object of his vaſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and reſolved to defend the important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts which he had gained with vigour equal to that with which they were about to be attacked. As he foreſaw that he whole weight of the war would be turned againſt Metz, the fate of which would decide that of Toul and Verdun, he nominated Francis of Lorrain Duke of Guiſe to take the command in that city during the ſiege, the iſſue of which would equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the honour and intereſt of his country. His choice could not have fallen upon any perſon more worthy of that truſt. The Duke of Guiſe poſſeſſed, in a high degree, all the qualities of courage, ſagacity and preſence of mind, which render men eminent in military command. He was largely endowed with that magnanimity of ſoul which delights in bold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, and aſpires to fame by ſplendid and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary actions. He repaired with joy to the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011837_1035_0F9D89110BEC8938"/>
ſtation aſſigned him, as to a theatre on which he he might diſplay his great qualities under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate eye of his countrymen all ready to applaud him. The martial genius of the French nobility in that age, which conſidered it as the greateſt reproach to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inactive, when there was any opportunity of ſignalizing their courage, prompted great numbers to follow a leader who was the darling as well as the pattern of all that courted military fame. Several Princes of the blood, many noblemen of the higheſt rank, and all the young officers who could obtain the King's permiſſion, entered Metz as voluntiers. By their preſence they added ſpirit to the garriſon, and enabled the Duke of Guiſe to employ on every emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency perſons eager to diſtinguiſh themſelves, and fit to conduct any ſervice.</p>
                  <p>BUT with whatever alacrity the Duke of Guiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the defence of Metz, he found every thing, upon his arrival there, in ſuch a ſituation, as might have induced any perſon of leſs intrepid courage to deſpair of defending it with ſucceſs. The city was of great extent, with large ſuburbs; the walls were in many places feeble and without ramparts; the ditch narrow; and the old towers, which projected inſtead of baſtions, were at too great diſtance from each other to defend the ſpace between them. For all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects he endeavoured to provide the beſt remedy, which the time would permit. He ordered the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, without ſparing the monaſteries or churches, not even that of St. Arnulph, in which ſeveral Kings of France had been buried, to be levelled with the ground; but in order to guard againſt the imputation of impiety, to which ſuch a violation of ſo many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred edifices, as well as of the aſhes of the dead might expoſe him, he executed this with much religious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. Having ordered all the holy veſtments and utenſils, together with the bones of the Kings, and other perſons depoſited in theſe churches to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they were carried in ſolemn proceſſion to a church within the walls, he himſelf walking before them uncovered, with a torch in his hand. He then pulled down ſuch houſes as ſtood near the walls,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:011837_1036_0F9D891170D8FD58"/>
cleared and enlarged the ditch, repaired the ruinous fortifications, and erected new ones. As it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all theſe works ſhould be finiſhed with the utmoſt expedition, he laboured at them with his own hands; the officers and voluntiers imitated his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſoldiers ſubmitted with chearfulneſs to the moſt ſevere fatigues, when they ſaw that their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors did not decline to bear a part in theſe together with them. At the ſame time he compelled all uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſons to leave the place; he filled the magazines with proviſions and military ſtores; burnt the mills and deſtroyed the corn and forage for ſeveral miles round the town. Such were his popular talents, as well as his arts of acquiring an aſcendant over the minds of men, that the citizens ſeconded him with no leſs ardour than the ſoldiers; and every other paſſion being ſwallowed up in the zeal to repulſe the enemy, with which he inſpired them, they beheld the ruin of their eſtates, together, with the havock, which he made among their publick and private buildings, without any emotion of reſentment <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. xi. 387.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANTIME the Emperor, having collected all his forces, continued his march towards Metz. As he paſſed through the cities on the Rhine, he ſaw the diſmal effects of that licentious and waſteful war which Albert had carried on in theſe parts. Upon his approach, that Prince, though at the head of twenty thouſand men, withdrew into Lorrain, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to join the French King, whoſe arms he had quartered with his own in all his ſtandards and enſigns. Albert was not in a condition to cope with the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial troops, which amounted at leaſt to ſixty thouſand men, forming one of the moſt numerous and beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed armies that had been brought into the field, during that age, in any of the wars among the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Princes.</p>
                  <p>THE chief command under the Emperor, was committed to the Duke of Alva, aſſiſted by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Marignano, together with the moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of the Italian and Spaniſh generals. As it was
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:011837_1037_0F9D89122E6503A0"/>
towards the end of October, theſe intelligent officers repreſented the great danger of beginning, at ſuch an advanced ſeaſon, a ſiege which could not fail to prove very tedious. But Charles adhered to his own opinion with his uſual obſtinacy, and being confident that he had made ſuch preparations, and taken ſuch precautions as would enſure ſucceſs, he ordered the city to be inveſted. As ſoon as the duke of Alva ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, a large body of the French ſallied out and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked his van guard with great vigour, put it in confuſion, and killed or took priſoners a conſiderable number of men. By this early ſpecimen, which they gave of the conduct of their officers, as well as the valour of their troops, they ſhewed the Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts what an enemy they had to encounter, and how dear every advantage muſt coſt them. The place, however, was compleatly inveſted, the trenches were opened, and the other works begun.</p>
                  <p>THE attention both of the beſiegers and beſieged was turned for ſome time towards Albert of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and they ſtrove with emulation which ſhould gain that Prince, who ſtill hovered in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, fluctuating in all the uncertainty of irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, natural to a man, who being ſwayed by no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, was allured different ways by contrary views of intereſt. The French tempted him with offers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beneficial; the Imperialiſts ſcrupled at no promiſe which they thought would make an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon him. After much heſitation he was gained by the Emperor, from whom he expected to receive advantages, which were both more immediate and more permanent. As the French King, who began to ſuſpect his intentions, had appointed a body of troops under the Duke of Aumale, brother to the Duke Guiſe, to watch his motions, Albert fell upon them unexpectedly, with ſuch vigour, that he routed them entirely, killed many of the officers, wounded Aumale himſelf, and took him priſoner. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after this victory, he marched in triumph to Metz, and joined his army to that of the Emperor.

                  <p>THE Duke of Guiſe, though deeply affected with his brother's misfortune, did not remit, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the vigour with which he defended the town. He harraſſed the beſiegers by frequent ſallies, in which his officers were ſo eager to diſtinguiſh themſelves, that his authority, being ſcarce ſufficient to reſtrain the impetuoſity of their courage, he was obliged at different times to ſhut the gates and to conceal the keys, in order to prevent the Princes of the blood, and noblemen of the firſt rank, from expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to danger in every ſally. He repaired in the night what the enemy's artillery had beat down during the day, or erected behind the ruined works, new fortifications of almoſt equal ſtrength. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, on their part, puſhed on the attack with great ſpirit, and carried forward, at once, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt different parts of the town. But the art of attacking fortified places was not then arrived at that degree of perfection, to which it was carried towards the cloſe of the ſixteenth century, during the long war in the Netherlands. The beſiegers, after the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour of many weeks, found that they had made but little progreſs; and although their batteries had made breaches in different places, they ſaw, to their aſtoniſhment, works ſuddenly appear, in demoliſhing which their fatigues and dangers would be renewed. The Emperor, enraged at the obſtinate reſiſtance which his army met with, left Thionville, where he had been confined by a violent fit of the gout, and though ſtill ſo infirm that he was obliged to be carried in a litter, he repaired to the camp; that by his preſence he might animate the ſoldiers, and urge on the attack with greater ſpirit. Upon his arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, new batteries were erected, and new efforts made with redoubled ardour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:011837_1039_0F9D8913B0D720C8"/>BUT, by this time, the winter had ſet in with great rigour; the camp was alternately deluged with rain, or covered with ſnow; at the ſame time proviſions were become extremely ſcarce, as the body of French cavalry which hovered in the neighbourhood, often interrupted the convoys, or rendered their arrival difficult and uncertain. Diſeaſes began to ſpread among the ſoldiers, eſpecially among the Italians and Spaniards, unaccuſtomed to ſuch inclement weather; great numbers were diſabled from ſerving, and many died. At length, ſuch breaches were made as ſeemed practicable, and the Emperor reſolved to hazard a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſault, in ſpite of all the remonſtrances of his generals concerning the imprudence of attacking a numerous garriſon, conducted and animated by the moſt gallant of the French nobility, with an army weakened by diſeaſes, and diſheartned with ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Duke of Guiſe, ſuſpecting his intentions, from the extraordinary hurry which he obſerved in the enemy's camp, ordered all his troops to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective poſts. They appeared immediately on the wall, and behind the breaches, with ſuch a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined countenance, ſo eager for the combat, and ſo well prepared to give the aſſailants a warm reception, that the Imperialiſts, inſtead of advancing to the charge, when the word of command was given, ſtood motionleſs, in a timid dejected ſilence. The Emperor, perceiving that he could not truſt troops whoſe ſpirits were ſo much broken, retired abruptly to his quarters, complaining that he was now deſerted by his ſoldiers, who deſerved no longer the name of men <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. 397.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DEEPLY as this behaviour of his troops mortified and affected him, Charles would not hear of abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſiege, though he ſaw the neceſſity of changing the method of attack. He ſuſpended the fury of his batteries, and propoſed to proceed by the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure but tedious method of ſapping. But as it ſtill continued to rain or to ſnow almoſt inceſſantly, ſuch as were employed in this ſervice endured incredible

                     </gap> their mines, counter-worked them, and prevented their effect. At laſt, Charles, finding it impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any longer with the rigour of the ſeaſon, and with enemies, whom he could neither overpower by force, nor ſubdue by art, while at the ſame time a contagious diſtemper raged among his troops, and cut off daily great numbers of his officers as well as ſoldiers, yielded to the ſollicitations of his generals, who conjured him to ſave the remains of his army by a timely retreat; "Fortune," ſays he, "I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, reſembles other females, and chuſes to confer her favours on young men, while ſhe forſakes thoſe who are advanced in years."</p>
                  <p>UPON this, he gave orders immediately to raiſe the ſiege, and ſubmitted to the diſgrace of abandoning the enterprize, after having continued fifty-ſix days before the town, during which time he had loſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of thirty thouſand men, who died of diſeaſes, or were killed by the enemy. The Duke of Guiſe, as ſoon as he perceived the intention of the Imperialiſts, took meaſures to prevent their retiring unmoleſted, and ſent out ſeveral bodies, both of cavalry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, to infeſt their rear, to pick up ſtragglers, and to ſeize every opportunity of attacking them with advantage. Such was the confuſion with which they made their retreat, that the French might have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed them in the moſt cruel manner. But when they ſallied out, a ſpectacle preſented itſelf to their view, which extinguiſhed at once all hoſtile rage, and melted them into tenderneſs and compaſſion. The Imperial camp was filled with the ſick and wounded, with the dead and the dying. In all the different roads by which the army retired, numbers were found, who having made an effort beyond their ſtrength to eſcape, were left, when they could go no farther, to periſh without aſſiſtance. This they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their enemies, and were indebted to them for all the kind offices which their friends had not the power to perform. The duke of Guiſe immediately ordered proper refreſhments for ſuch as were dying

of hunger; he appointed ſurgeons to attend the ſick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as they recovered, he ſent them home, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an eſcort of ſoldiers, and with money to bear their charges. By theſe acts of humanity, which were uncommon in that age, when war was carried on with greater rancour and ferocity than at preſent, the Duke of Guiſe compleated the fame which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by his gallant and ſucceſsful defence of Metz, and engaged thoſe whom he had vanquiſhed to vie with his own countrymen in extolling his name <note n="†" place="bottom">Sleid. 575.

                  <p>TO theſe calamities in Germany, were added ſuch unfortunate events in Italy, as rendered this the moſt diſaſtrous year in the Emperor's life. During his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at Villach, Charles had applied to Coſmo de Medici, for the loan of two hundred thouſand crowns. But his credit, at that time, was ſo low, that, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain this inconſiderable ſum, he was obliged to put him in poſſeſſion of the principality of Piombi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, and, by giving up that, he loſt the footing which he had hitherto maintained in Tuſcany, and enabled Coſmo to aſſume, for the future, the tone and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince altogether independant. Much about the time that his indigence conſtrained him to part with this valuable territory, he loſt Siena, which was of ſtill greater conſequence, through the ill conduct of Don Diego de Mendoza <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xi. 376.</note>.</p>
                  <p>SIENA, like moſt of the great cities in Italy, had long enjoyed a republican government, under the protection of the Empire; but being torn in pieces by the diſſentions between the nobles and the people, which divided all the commonwealths, the faction of the people, which gained the aſcendant, beſought the Emperor to become the guardian of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration which they had eſtabliſhed, and admitted into
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011837_1042_0F9D8915EF4322E8"/>
their city a ſmall body of Spaniſh ſoldiers, whom he had ſent to countenance the execution of the laws, and to preſerve tranquillity among them. The direction of theſe troops was given to Mendoza, at that time ambaſſador for the Emperor at Rome, who perſuaded the credulous multitude, that it was neceſſary for their ſecurity againſt any future attempt of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to allow him to build a citadel in Siena; and as he flattered himſelf that by means of this fortreſs he might render the Emperor maſter of the city, he puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the works with all poſſible diſpatch. But he threw off the maſk too ſoon. Before the fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were compleated, he began to indulge his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral haughtineſs and ſeverity of temper, and to treat the citizens with great inſolence. At the ſame time the ſoldiers in garriſon being paid as irregularly as the Emperor's troops uſually were, lived almoſt at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion upon the inhabitants, and were guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny acts of licence and oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>THESE injuries awakened the Sieneſe to a ſenſe of their danger. As they ſaw the neceſſity of exerting themſelves, while the unfiniſhed fortifications of the citadel left them any hopes of ſucceſs, they applied to the French ambaſſador at Rome, who readily promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them his maſter's protection and aſſiſtance. At the ſame time, forgetting their domeſtic animoſities when ſuch a mortal blow was aimed at the liberty and exiſtence of the republick, they ſent agents to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled nobles, and invited them to concur with them in ſaving their country from the ſervitude with which it was threatned. As there was not a moment to loſe, meaſures were concerted ſpeedily, but with great prudence; and were executed with equal vigour. The citizens roſe ſuddenly in arms; the exiles flocked into the town from different parts with all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans, and what troops they could draw together; and ſeveral bodies of mercenaries in the pay of France appeared to ſupport them. The Spaniards, though ſurprized, and much inferior in number, defended themſelves with great courage; but ſeeing no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of relief, and having no hopes of maintaining their ſtation long, in a half-finiſhed fortreſs, they ſoon

gave it up. The Sieneſe, with the utmoſt alacrity, levelled it with the ground, that no monument might remain of that odious ſtructure, which had been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to enſlave them. At the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all connection with the Emperor, they ſent ambaſſadors to the King of France as the reſtorer of their liberty, and to intreat that he would ſecure to them the perpetual enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>TO theſe misfortunes, one ſtill more fatal had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſucceeded. The ſevere adminiſtration of Don Pedro de Toledo, viceroy of Naples, having filled that kingdom with murmuring and diſaffection, the Prince of Salerno, the head of the malecontents, had fled to the court of France, where all who bore ill-will to the Emperor or his miniſters, were ſure of finding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and aſſiſtance. That nobleman, in the uſual ſtile of exiles, boaſting much of his partizans, and of his great influence with them, prevailed on Henry to think of invading Naples, from expectation of being joined by all thoſe with whom the Prince of Salerno held correſpondence, or who were diſſatisfied with Toledo's government. But though the firſt hint of this enterprize was ſuggeſted by the Prince of Salerno, Henry did not chuſe that its ſucceſs ſhould entirely depend upon his being able to fulfil the promiſes which he had made. He applied for aid to Solyman, whom he courted after his father's example, as his moſt vigorous auxiliary againſt the Emperor, and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited him to ſecond his operations by ſending a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful fleet into the Mediterranean. It was not difficult to obtain what he requeſted of the Sultan, who, at this time, was highly incenſed againſt the houſe of Auſtria, on account of their proceedings in Hungary. He ordered an hundred and fifty ſhips to be equipped, that they might ſail towards the coaſt of Naples, at whatever time Henry ſhould name, and might co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the French troops in their attempts upon that kingdom.

He appeared on the coaſt of Calabria at the time which had been agreed on, landed at ſeveral places, plundered and burnt ſeveral villages; and at laſt caſting anchor in the bay of Naples, filled that city with conſternation. But as the French fleet, detained by ſome accident, which the contemporary hiſtorians have not explained, did not join the Turks according to concert, they, after waiting twenty days, without hearing any thing of it, ſet ſail for Conſtantinople, and thus delivered the viceroy of Naples from the terror of an invaſion, which he was in no condition to have reſiſted <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. 375, 380.

                  <p>AS the French had never given ſo ſevere a check to the Emperor in any former campaign, they expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immoderate joy at the ſucceſs of their arms. Charles himſelf, accuſtomed to a long ſeries of proſperity, felt the blow moſt ſenſibly, and retired from Metz into the Low-Countries, much dejected with the cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune which affected him in his declining age, when the violence of the gout had increaſed to ſuch a pitch, as entirely broke the vigour of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and rendered him peeviſh, difficult of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and often incapable of applying to buſineſs. But whenever he enjoyed any interval of eaſe, all his thoughts were bent upon revenge; and he deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the utmoſt ſollicitude, concerning the moſt proper means of annoying France, and of effacing the ſtain which had obſcured the reputation and glory of his arms. All the ſchemes concerning Germany, which had engroſſed him ſo long, being diſconcerted by the peace of Paſſau, the affairs of the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came only ſecondary objects of attention; and enmity to France was the predominant paſſion which chiefly occupied his mind.</p>
                  <p>THE turbulent ambition of Albert of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh excited violent commotions, which diſturbed the Empire during this year. That Prince's troops having ſhared in the calamities of the ſiege of Metz, were greatly reduced in number. But the Emperor, prompted by gratitude for his diſtinguiſhed ſervices
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011837_1045_0F9D89183330A510"/>
on that occaſion, or perhaps with a ſecret view of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting diviſions among the Princes of the Empire, having paid up all the money due to him, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, by that ſum, to hire ſo many of the ſoldiers, diſmiſſed from the Imperial army, that he was ſoon at the head of a body of men as numerous as ever. The biſhops of Bamberg and Wurtzburg having ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the Imperial chamber to annul, by its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the iniquitous conditions which Albert had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to ſign, than court unanimouſly finding all their engagements with him to be void in their own nature, becauſe they had been extorted by force; enjoined Albert to renounce all claim to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them; and exhorted all the Princes of the Empire, if he ſhould perſiſt in ſuch an unjuſt demand, to take arms againſt him, as a diſturber of the publick tranquillity. To this deciſion, Albert oppoſed the confirmation of his tranſactions with the two prelates, which the Emperor had granted him as the reward of his having joined the Imperial army at Metz; and in order to intimidate his antagoniſts, and to convince them of his reſolution not to relinquiſh his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he put his troops in motion, that be might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the territory in queſtion. Various endeavours were employed, and many expedients propoſed, in order to prevent the kindling a new war in Germany. But the ſame warmth of temper which rendered Albert turbulent and enterprizing, inſpiring him with the moſt ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs, even in his wildeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, he diſdainfully rejected all reaſonable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures of accommodation.</p>
                  <p>UPON this, the Imperial chamber iſſued its decree againſt him, and required the Elector of Saxony, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſeveral other Princes mentioned by name, to take arms in order to carry it into execution. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and thoſe aſſociated with him were not unwilling to undertake this ſervice. They were extremely ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to maintain publick order, by ſupporting the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Imperial chamber, and ſaw the neceſſity of giving a timely check to the uſurpations of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prince who had no principle of action but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own intereſt, and no motive to direct him
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:011837_1046_0F9D8918F2C2BC58"/>
but the impulſe of ungovernable paſſions. They had good reaſon to ſuſpect that the Emperor encouraged Albert in his extravagant an irregular proceedings, and ſecretly afforded him aſſiſtance, that, by raiſing him up to rival Maurice in power, he might, in any future broil, make uſe of his aſſiſtance to counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and controul the authority which the other had acquired in the Empire <note n="*" place="bottom">Sleid. 585. Mem. de Ribier, ii, 442. Arnoldi. vita Maurit. ap. Menken. ii. 1242.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THESE conſiderations united the moſt powerful Princes in Germany in a league againſt Albert, of which Maurice was declared generaliſſimo. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable confederacy, however, wrought no change in Albert's ſentiments; but as he knew that he could not reſiſt ſo many Princes, if he ſhould allow them time to aſſemble their forces, he endeavoured, by his activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to deprive them of all the advantage which they might derive from their united power and numbers; and, for that reaſon, marched directly againſt Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, the enemy whom he dreaded moſt. It was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for the allies, that the conduct of their affairs was committed to a Prince of ſuch abilities. He, by his authority and example, had inſpired them with vigour, and having carried on their preparations with a degree of rapidity, of which confederate bodies are ſeldom capable, he was in condition to face Albert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could make any conſiderable progreſs.</p>
                  <p>THEIR armies, which were nearly equal in number, each conſiſting of twenty-four thouſand men, met at Sieverhauſen in the dutchy of Lunenburgh; and the violent animoſity againſt each other, which poſſeſſed the two leaders, did not ſuffer them to continue long inactive. The troops, inflamed with the ſame hoſtile rage, marched fiercely to the combat; they fought with the greateſt obſtinacy; and as both generals were capable of availing themſelves of every favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occurrence, the battle remained long doubtful, each gaining ground upon the other alternately. At laſt victory declared for Maurice, who was ſuperior in cavalry, and Albert's army fled in confuſion, leaving four thouſand dead in the field, and their camp, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:011837_1047_0F9D8919B273D138"/>
and artillery in the hands of the conquerors. The allies bought their victory dear, their beſt troops ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered greatly, two ſons of the Duke of Brunſwick, a Duke of Lunenburg, and many other perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, were among the number of the ſlain <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtoria pugnae infelicis inter Maurit. &amp; Albert.

But all theſe were ſoon forgotten, for Maurice himſelf, as he led up to a ſecond charge a body of horſe which had been broken, received a wound with a piſtol bullet in the belly, of which he died two days after the battle, in the thirty-ſecond year of his age, and in the ſixth after his attaining the electoral dignity.</p>
                  <p>OF all the perſonages who have appeared in the hiſtory of this active age, when great occurrences, and ſudden revolutions, called forth extraordinary talents to view, and afforded them full opportunity to diſplay themſelves, Maurice may juſtly be conſidered as the moſt remarkable. If his exorbitant ambition, his profound diſſimulation, and his unwarrantable u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation of his kinſman's honours and dominions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from being praiſed as a virtuous man; his prudence in concerting his meaſures, his vigour in executing them, and the uniform ſucceſs with which they were attended, entitle him to the appellation of a great Prince. At an age, when impetuoſity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit commonly predominates over political wiſdom, when the higheſt efforts even of a genius of the firſt order is to fix on a bold ſcheme, and to execute it with promptitude and courage, he formed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted an intricate plan of policy, which deceived the moſt artful Monarch in Europe. At the very junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when the Emperor had attained almoſt unlimited deſpotiſm, Maurice, with power ſeemingly inadequate to ſuch an undertaking, compelled him to relinquiſh all his uſurpations, and eſtabliſhed, not only the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but civil, liberties of Germany on ſuch foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as have hitherto remained unſhaken. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at one period of his life, his conduct excited the jealouſy of the Proteſtants, and at another drew on him the reſentment of the Roman Catholicks,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:011837_1048_0F9D891B30929200"/>
ſuch was his maſterly addreſs, that he was the only Prince of the age, who in any degree poſſeſſed the confidence of both, and whom both lamented as the moſt able as well as faithful guardian of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and laws of his country.</p>
                  <p>THE conſternation which Maurice's death occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among his troops, prevented them from making the proper improvement of the victory which they had gained. Albert, whoſe active courage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe liberality, rendered him the darling of ſuch mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary adventurers as were little ſollicitous about the juſtice of his cauſe, ſoon re-aſſembled his broken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and made freſh levies, with ſuch ſucceſs, that he was quickly at the head of fifteen thouſand men, and renewed his depredations with additional fury. But Henry of Brunſwick, having taken the command of the allied troops, defeated him in a ſecond battle, ſcarce leſs bloody than the former. Even then his courage did not ſink, nor were his reſources exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He made ſeveral efforts, and ſome of them very vigorous, to retrieve his affairs: but, being laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ban of the Empire by the Imperial chamber, being driven by degrees out of all his hereditary ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, as well as thoſe which he had uſurped; being forſaken by many of his officers, and overpowered by the number of his enemies, he fled for refuge into France. After having been, for a conſiderable time, the terror and ſcourge of Germany, he linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a few years in an indigent and dependant ſtate of exile, the miſeries of which his reſtleſs and arrogant ſpirit endured with the moſt indignant impatience. Upon his death without iſſue, his territories, which had been ſeized by the Princes who took arms againſt him, were reſtored, by a decree of the Emperor, to his collateral heirs of the houſe of Brandenburgh <note n="*" place="bottom">Sleid. 592. 945. 599.

the degraded Elector, claimed the electoral dignity, and that part of his patrimonial eſtate, of which he had been violently ſtripped after the Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaldic war. Auguſtus, Maurice's only brother, pleaded his right not only to the hereditary poſſeſſions of their family, but to the electoral dignity and to the territories which Maurice had acquired. As Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus was a Prince of conſiderable abilities, as well as of great candour and gentleneſs of manners, the States of Saxony, forgetting the merits and ſufferings of their former maſter, declared warmly in his favour. His pretenſions were powerfully ſupported by the King of Denmark whoſe daugther he had married, and zealouſly eſpouſed by the King of the Romans out of regard to Maurice's memory. The degraded Elector though ſecretly favoured by his ancient enemy the Emperor, was at laſt obliged to relinquiſh his claim, upon obtaining a ſmall addition to the territories which had been allotted to him, together with a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, ſecuring to his family the eventual ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon a failure of male heirs in the Albertine line. That unfortunante but magnanimous Prince died next year, ſoon after ratifying this treaty of agreement; and the electoral dignity is ſtill poſſeſſed by the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Auguſtus <note n="†" place="bottom">Thuan. 409.

                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions in Germany, war was carried on in the Low-Countries with conſiderable vigour. The Emperor, impatient to efface the ſtain which his ignominious repulſe at Metz left upon his his military reputation, had an army early in the field, and laid ſiege to Terouane. Though the town was of ſuch importance that Francis uſed to call it one of the two pillows on which a King of France might ſleep with ſecurity, the fortifications were in diſrepair; Henry, truſting to what had happened at Metz, thought nothing more was neceſſary to render all the efforts of the enemy abortive, than to reinforce the garriſon with a conſiderable number of the young nobility.

<pb n="212" facs="unknown:011837_1050_0F9D891BF24E24B0"/>
by aſſault. That it might not fall again into the hands of the French, Charles ordered not only the fortifications but the town to be raſed, and the inhabitants to be diſperſed in the adjacent cities. Elated with this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the Imperialiſts immediately inveſted Heſdin, which though defended with great bravery, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken by aſſault, and ſuch of the garriſon as eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſword were made priſoners. The Emperor entruſted the conduct of this ſiege to Emanuel Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of Savoy Prince of Piedmont, who, on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, gave the firſt diſplay of his great talents for military command, which ſoon entitled him to be ranked among the firſt generals of that age, and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated his re-eſtabliſhment in his hereditary dominions, the greater part of which having been over-run by Francis in his expeditions into Italy, were ſtill occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Henry <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. 411. Haraei Annales Brabant, 669.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE loſs of theſe towns, together with ſo many perſons of diſtinction, either killed or taken by the enemy, was no inconſiderable calamity to France, and Henry felt it very ſenſibly; but he was ſtill more mortified at the Emperor's having aſſumed his wonted ſuperiority in the field ſo ſoon after the blow at Metz, which the French had repreſented as fatal to his power. He was aſhamed, too, of his own remiſſneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſecurity at the opening of the campaign; and, in order to repair that error, he aſſembled a numerous army, and led it into the Low-Countries.</p>
                  <p>ROUZED at the approach of ſuch a formidable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Charles left Bruſſels, where he had been ſhut up ſo cloſely during ſeven months, that it came to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in many parts of Europe that he was dead; and though he was ſo much debilitated by the gout that he could ſcarce bare the motion of a litter, he haſtened to join his army. The eyes of all Europe were turned with expectation towards theſe mighty and exaſperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rivals, between whom a deciſive battle was now thought unavoidable. But Charles having prudently declined to hazard a general engagement, and the violence of the autumnal rains rendering it impoſſible for the French to undertake any ſiege, they retired
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:011837_1051_0F9D891CB6A0A650"/>
without having performed any thing ſuitable to the great preparations which they had made <note n="*" place="bottom">Haraeus 672. Thuan. 414.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Imperial arms did not make the ſame progreſs in Italy. The narrowneſs of the Emperor's finances ſeldom allowed him to act with vigour in two different places at the ſame time; and having exerted himſelf to the utmoſt in order to make a great effort in the Low-Countries, his operations on the other ſide of the Alps were proportionally feeble. The viceroy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in conjunction with Coſmo di Medici, who was greatly alarmed at the introduction of French troops into Siena, endeavoured to become maſter of that city. But inſtead of reducing the Sieneſe, the Imperialiſts were obliged to retire abruptly in order to defend their own country, upon the appearance of the Turkiſh fleet, which threatned the coaſt of Naples; and the French not only eſtabliſhed themſelves more firmly in Tuſcany, but by the aſſiſtance of the Turks, conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great part of the iſland of Corſica, ſubject, at that time, to the Genoeſe <note n="†" place="bottom">Thuan. 417.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE affairs of the houſe of Auſtria declined no leſs in Hungary during the courſe of this year. As the troops which Ferdinand kept in Tranſylvania receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their pay very irregularly, they lived almoſt at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion upon the inhabitants; and their inſolence and rapaciouſneſs greatly diſguſted all ranks of men, and alienated them from their new ſovereign, who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of protecting, plundered his ſubjects. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at this, added to their deſire of revenging Martinuzzi's death, wrought ſo much upon a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nobility, impatient of injury, and upon a fierce people, prone to change, that they were ripe for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. At that very juncture, their late Queen, Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, together with her ſon, appeared in Tranſylvania. Her ambitious mind could not bear the ſolitude and inactivity of a private life, and repenting quickly of the ceſſion which ſhe had made of the crown, in the year one thouſand five hundred and fifty-one, ſhe left the place of her retreat, hoping that the diſſatisfaction of the Hungarians with the Auſtrian government,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:011837_1052_0F9D891D7805BC60"/>
would prompt them to recognize once more her ſon's right to the crown. Some noblemen of great emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence declared immediately in his favour. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw of Belgrade, by Solyman's order, eſpouſed his cauſe in oppoſition to Ferdinand; the Spaniſh and German ſoldiers, inſtead of advancing againſt the enemy, mutinied for want of pay, declaring that they would march back to Vienna; ſo that Caſtaldo, their general, was obliged to abandon Tranſylvania to Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella and the Turks, and to place himſelf at the head of the mutiniers, that by his authority he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from plundering the Auſtrian territories, through which they paſſed <note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. 430.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FERDINAND's attention was turned ſo entirely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the affairs of Germany, and his treaſures ſo much exhauſted by his late efforts in Hungary, that he made no attempt to recover this valuable province, although a favourable opportunity for that purpoſe preſented itſelf, as Solyman was then engaged in a war with Perſia, and involved beſides in domeſtick calamities which engroſſed and diſturbed his mind. Solyman, though diſtinguiſhed, by many accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from the other Ottoman Princes, had all the paſſions peculiar to that violent and haughty race. He was jealous of his authority, ſudden and furious in his anger, and ſuſceptible of all that rage of love, which reigns in the Eaſt, and often produces the wildeſt and moſt tragical effects. His favourite miſtreſs was a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſian ſlave, of exquiſite beauty, who bore him a ſon called Muſtapha, whom, both on account of his birth-right and merit, he deſtined to be the heir of his crown. Roxalana, a Ruſſian captive, ſoon ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Circaſſian, and gained the Sultan's heart. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the addreſs to retain the conqueſt which ſhe had made, ſhe kept poſſeſſion of his love without any rival for many years, during which ſhe brought him ſeveral ſons and one daughter. All the happineſs, however, which ſhe derived from the unbounded ſway that ſhe had acquired over a monarch, whom one half of the world revered or dreaded, was embittered by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reflections on Muſtapha's acceſſion to the throne,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:011837_1053_0F9D891E2EB91AF8"/>
and the certain death of her ſons, who ſhe foreſaw would be immediately ſacrificed, according to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous jealouſy of Turkiſh policy, to the ſafety of the new Emperor. By dwelling continually on this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy idea, ſhe came gradually to view Muſtapha as the enemy of her children, and to hate him with more than a ſtep-mother's ill-will. This prompted her to wiſh his deſtruction, in order to ſecure for one of her own ſons the throne which was deſtined for him. Nor did ſhe want either ambition to attempt ſuch a high enterprize, or the arts requiſite for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into execution. Having prevailed on the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to give her only daughter in marriage to Ruſtan the Grand Viſier, ſhe diſcloſed her ſcheme to that crafty miniſter, who, perceiving that it was his own intereſt to co-operate with her, readily promiſed his aſſiſtance towards aggrandizing that branch of the royal line, to which he was now ſo nearly allied.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as Roxalana had concerted her meaſures with this able confident, ſhe began to affect a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful zeal for the Mahometan religion, to which Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſuperſtitiouſly attached, and propoſed to found and endow a royal Moſque, a work of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but deemed by the Turks meritorious in the higheſt degree. The Mufti whom ſhe conſulted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved much of her pious intention; but, having been gained and inſtructed by Ruſtan, told her that ſhe being a ſlave could derive no benefit herſelf from that holy deed, for all the merit of it would accrue to Solyman, the maſter whoſe property ſhe was. Upon this ſhe ſeemed to be overwhelmed with ſorrow, and to ſink into the deepeſt melancholy, as if ſhe had been diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with life and all its enjoyments. Solyman, who was abſent with the army, being informed of this dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, and of the cauſe from which it proceeded, diſcovered all the ſollicitude of a lover to remove it, and by a writing under his hand declared her a free woman. Roxalana having gained this point, proceeded to build the Moſque, and re-aſſumed her uſual chearfulneſs and gaiety of ſpirit. But when Solyman, on his return to Conſtantinople, ſent an eunuch, according to the cuſtom of the ſeraglio, to bring her to partake of his bed, ſhe,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:011837_1054_0F9D891EF1A5FDD0"/>
ſeemingly with deep regret, but in the moſt peremptory manner, declined to follow the eunuch, declaring that what had been an honour to her while a ſlave, became a crime, as ſhe was now a free woman, and that ſhe would not involve either the Sultan or herſelf in the guilt that muſt be contracted by ſuch an open violation of the law of their prophet. Solyman, whoſe paſſion this difficulty, as well as the affected delicacy which gave riſe to it, heightened and inflamed, had recourſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Mufti for his direction. He replied, agreeably to the Koran, that Roxalana's ſcruples were well founded, but added, artfully, in words which Ruſtan had taught him to uſe, that it was in the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's power to remove theſe difficulties, by eſpouſing her as his lawful wife. The amorous monarch cloſed eagerly with the propoſal, and ſolemnly married her according to the form of the Mahometan ritual; tho' by doing ſo, he diſregarded a maxim of policy which the pride of the Ottoman blood had taught all the Sultans ſince Bajezet I. to conſider as inviolable. From his time, none of the Turkiſh monarchs had married, becauſe, when he was vanquiſhed and taken priſoner by Tamerlane, his wife had been abuſed with barbarous inſolence by the Tartars. That no ſimilar calamity might ſubject the Ottoman family to the like diſgrace, the Sultans admitted none to their bed but ſlaves, whoſe diſhonour could not bring any ſuch ſtain upon their houſe.</p>
                  <p>BUT the more uncommon the ſtep was, the more it convinced Roxalana of the unbounded influence which ſhe had acquired over the Sultan's heart; and emboldened her to proſecute, with greater hopes of ſucceſs, the ſcheme that ſhe had formed in order to deſtroy Muſtapha. This young Prince having been intruſted by his father, according to the practice of the Sultans in that age, with the government of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral different provinces, was at that time inveſted with the adminiſtration in Diarbequir, the ancient Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, which Solyman had wreſted from the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and added to his empire. In all theſe different commands, Muſtapha had conducted himſelf with ſuch cautious prudence as could give no offence to his
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:011837_1055_0F9D891FB35B08A0"/>
father, though at the ſame time, he governed with ſo much moderation as well as juſtice, and diſplayed ſuch valour and generoſity as rendered him equally the favourite of the people and the darling of the ſoldiery.</p>
                  <p>THERE was no room to lay any folly or vice to his charge, that could impair the high opinion which his father entertained of him. Roxalana's malevolence was more refined, ſhe turned his virtues againſt him, and made uſe of theſe as engines for his deſtruction. She often mentioned, in Solyman's preſence, the ſplendid qualities of his ſon; ſhe celebrated his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, his liberality, his popular arts, with malicious and exaggerated praiſe. As ſoon as ſhe pereeived that the Sultan heard theſe encomiums, which were often repeated, with uneaſineſs; that ſuſpicion of his ſon began to mingle itſelf with his former eſteem for him; and that by degrees he came to view him with jealouſy and fear, ſhe introduced, as by accident, ſome diſcourſe concerning the rebellion of his father Selim againſt Bajazet his grandfather; ſhe took notice of the bravery of the veteran troops under Munſtapha's command, and of the neighbourhood of Diarbequir to the territories of the Perſian Sophi. Solyman's mortal enemy. By theſe arts whatever remained of paternal tenderneſs was entirely extinguiſhed, and ſuch paſſions were kindled in his breaſt, as gave all Roxalana's malignant ſuggeſtions the colour not only of probability but truth. A deep rooted hatred ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, now, to his ſuſpicions and fear of Muſtapha. He appointed ſpies to obſerve and report all his words and actions; he watched and ſtood on his guard againſt him as his moſt dangerous enemy.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus alienated the Sultan's heart from Muſtapha, Roxalana ventured upon another ſtep, and entreated Solyman to allow her own ſons the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of appearing at court, hoping that, by gaining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to their father, they might, by their good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and dutiful deportment, inſinuate themſelves into that place in his affections, which Muſtapha had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held; and, though what ſhe demanded was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the Ottoman family in that age, the uxorious monarch granted her requeſt. To
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:011837_1056_0F9D8920732A1178"/>
all theſe female intrigues Ruſtan added an artifice ſtill more ſubtle, which compleated the Sultan's deluſion, and heightened his jealouſy and fear. He wrote to the Baſhaws of the provinces adjacent to Diarbequir, inſtructing them to ſend him regular intelligence of Muſtapha's proceedings in his government, and to each of them he gave a private hint, flowing, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, from his zeal for their intereſt, that nothing would be more acceptable to the Sultan, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive favourable accounts of a ſon, whom he deſtined to ſuſtain the glory of the Ottoman name. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws, ignorant of his fraudulent intention, and eager to pay court to their ſovereign at ſuch an eaſy price, filled their letters with ſtudied but fatal panegyricks of Muſtapha, repreſenting him as a Prince worthy to ſucceed ſuch an illuſtrious father, and as endowed with talents which might enable him to emulate, perhaps to equal his fame. Theſe letters were induſtriouſly ſhewn to Solyman, at the ſeaſons when it was known that they would make the deepeſt impreſſion. Every expreſſion in recommendation of his ſon wounded him to the heart; he ſuſpected his principal officers of being ready to favour the moſt deſperate attempts of a Prince whom they were ſo fond to praiſe; and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying that he ſaw them already aſſaulting his throne with rebellious arms, he determined, while it was yet in his power, to anticipate the blow, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own ſafety by his ſon's death.</p>
                  <p>FOR this purpoſe, though under pretence of renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war againſt Perſia, he ordered Ruſtan to march towards Diarbequir at the head of a numerous army, and to rid him of a ſon, whoſe life he deemed inconſiſtent with his own ſafety. But that crafty miniſter did not chooſe to be loaded with the odium of having executed this cruel order. As ſoon as he arrived in Syria he wrote to Solyman, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was ſo imminent as called for his immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; that the camp was full of Muſtapha's emiſſaries; that many of the ſoldiers were corrupted; that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of all leaned towards him; that he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a negociation which had been carried on with the Sophi of Perſia, in order to marry Muſtapha with one
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:011837_1057_0F9D892130B934A0"/>
his daughters; that he already felt both his talents and his authority to be inadequate to the exigencies of ſuch an arduous conjecture, that the Sultan alone had ſagacity to diſcern what reſolution ſhould be taken in thoſe circumſtances, and power to carry that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution into execution.</p>
                  <p>THIS charge of courting the friendſhip of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi, Roxalana and Ruſtan had reſerved as the laſt and moſt envenomed of all their calumnies. It operated with the violence which they expected from Solyman's inveterate abhorrence of the Perſians, and threw him into the wildeſt tranſports of rage. He ſet out inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Syria, and haſtened thither with all the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and impatience of fear and revenge. As ſoon as he joined his army near Aleppo, and had concerted meaſures with Ruſtan, he ſent a Chiaus or meſſenger of the court to his ſon, requiring him to repair imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to his preſence. Muſtapha, though no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his ſtep-mother's machinations, or to Ruſtan's malice, or to his father's violent temper, yet relying on his innocence, and hoping to diſcredit the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his enemies by the promptitude of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, followed the meſſenger without delay to Aleppo. The moment he arrived in the camp, he was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Sultan's tent. As he entered it, he obſerved nothing that could give him any alarm; no additional croud of attendants, no body of armed guards, but the ſame order and ſilence which always reign in the Sultan's apartments. In a few minutes, however, ſeveral mutes appeared, at the ſight of whom Muſtapha, knowing what was his doom, cried with a loud voice, "Lo, my death!" and attempted to fly. The mutes ruſhed forward to ſeize him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and ſtruggled, demanding with the utmoſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee the Sultan; and deſpair, together with the hope of finding protection from the ſoldiers, if he could eſcape out of the tent, animated him with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrength, that for ſome time, he baſſled all the efforts of the executioners. Solyman was within hearing of his ſon's cries, as well as of the noiſe which the ſtruggle occaſioned. Impatient of this delay of his revenge, and ſtruck with terror at the thought of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:011837_1058_0F9D8922A0B1E368"/>
Muſtapha's eſcaping, he drew aſide the curtain which divided the tent, and thruſting in his head, darted a fierce look towards the mutes, and with wild and threatning geſtures ſeemed to chide them for ſloth and timidity. At ſight of his father's furious and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting countenance, Muſtapha's ſtrength failed, and his courage forſook him; the mutes faſtened the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring about his neck, and in a moment put an end to his life.</p>
                  <p>THE dead body was expoſed before the Sultan's tent. The ſoldiers gathered round it, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating that mournful object with aſtoniſhment, and ſorrow, and indignation, were ready, if a leader had not been wanting, to have broke into the wildeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of rage. After giving vent to the firſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their grief, they retired each man to his tent, and ſhutting themſelves up, bewailed in ſecret the cruel fate of their favourite; nor was there one of them who taſted food or even water during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that day. Next morning, the ſame ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſilence reigned in the camp; and Solyman, being afraid that ſome dreadful ſtorm would follow this ſullen calm, in order to appeaſe the enraged ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, deprived Ruſtan of the ſeals, ordered him to leave the camp, and raiſed Achmet, a gallant officer much beloved in the army, to the dignity of Viſier. This change, however, was made in concert with Ruſtan himſelf; that crafty miniſter ſuggeſting it as the only expedient which could ſave himſelf or his maſter. But within a few months, when the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoldiers began to ſubſide, and the name of Muſtapha to be forgotten, Achmet was ſtrangled by the Sultan's command, and Ruſtan re-inſtated in the office of Viſier. Together with his former pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he reaſſumed the plan for extirminating the race of Muſtapha which he had concerted with Roxalana; and, as they were afraid that an only ſon whom Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha had left, might grow up to avenge his death, they redoubled their activity, and, by employing the ſame arts againſt him which they had practiſed againſt his father, they inſpired Solyman with the ſame fears, and prevailed on him to iſſue orders for putting to

death that young innocent Prince. Theſe orders were executed, with barbarous zeal, by an eunuch, who was diſpatched to Burſa, the place were the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided; and no rival was left to diſpute the Ottoman throne with the ſons of Roxalana <note n="*" place="bottom">Angerii Giſlenii Buſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SUCH a tragical ſcene, productive of ſo deep diſtreſs, ſeldom occurs but in the hiſtory of the great monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the Eaſt, where the force of the climate works up and ſublimes all the paſſions of the human mind into the greateſt fury, and the abſolute power of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns enables them to act with uncontrouled vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but while it paſſed in the court of Solyman and engaged his whole attention, Charles was purſuing with the utmoſt ardour a new ſcheme for aggrandiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his family. About this time, Edward the ſixth of England, after a ſhort reign, in which he diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch virtues as filled his ſubjects with ſanguine hopes of being happy under his government, and made them bear with patience all that they ſuffered from the weakneſs, the diſſentions, and the ambition of the miniſters who aſſumed the adminiſtration during his minority, was ſeized with a lingering diſtemper which threatened his life. The Emperor no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an account of this, than his ambition, always attentive to ſeize every opportunity of acquiring an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of power or of territories to his ſon, ſuggeſted the thought of adding England to his other kingdoms, by the marriage of Philip with the Princeſs Mary, the heir of Edward's crown. Being apprehenſive, however, that his ſon, who was then in Spain, might decline a match with a Princeſs in her thirty-eighth year, and eleven years older than himſelf <note n="†" place="bottom">Play. hiſt. Council. Trid. v. ii. c. 13. p. 150.</note>; Charles determined, notwithſtanding his own age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, to make offer of himſelf as a huſband to his couſin.</p>
                  <p>BUT though Mary was ſo far advanced in years, and deſtitute of every charm, either of perſon or of manners, that could win affection, or command e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, Philip, without heſitation, gave his conſent
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:011837_1060_0F9D89236F5153B8"/>
to the match propoſed by his father, and was willing, according to the uſual maxim of Princes, to ſacrifice his inclination to his ambition. In order to inſure ſucceſs, the Emperor, even before Edward's death, began to take ſuch ſteps as might facilitate it. Upon Edward's demiſe, Mary mounted the throne of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; the pretenſions of the lady Jane Gray proving as unfortunate, as they were ill founded †. Charles ſent immediately a pompous embaſſy to London, to congratulate Mary on her acceſſion to the throne, and to propoſe the alliance with his ſon. The Queen, dazzled with the proſpect of marrying the heir of the greateſt Monarch in Europe; fond of uniting more cloſely with her mother's family, to which ſhe had been always warmly attached; and eager to ſecure the powerful aid which ſhe knew would be neceſſary towards carrying on her favourite ſcheme of re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Romiſh religion in England, liſtened in the moſt favourable manner to the propoſal. Among her ſubjects, it met with a very different reception. Philip, it was well known, contended for all the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the church of Rome with a ſanguinary zeal, which exceeded the meaſure even of Spaniſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry: this alarmed all the numerous partizans of the Reformation. The Caſtilian haughtineſs and reſerve were far from being acceptable to the Engliſh, who, having ſeveral times ſeen their throne occupied by thoſe who were born ſubjects, had become accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an unceremonious and familiar intercourſe with their ſovereigns. They could not think, without the utmoſt uneaſineſs, of admitting a foreign Prince to that influence in their councils, which the huſband of their Queen would naturally poſſeſs. They dreaded, both from Philip's over-bearing temper, and from the maxims of the Spaniſh monarchy which he had imbibed, that he would infuſe ideas into the Queen's mind, dangerous to the liberties of the nation, and would introduce foreign troops and money into the kingdom to aſſiſt her in any attempt againſt them.</p>
                  <p>FULL of theſe apprehenſions, the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, though in that age extremely obſequious to the
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:011837_1061_0F9D8924300D7BB0"/>
will of their Monarchs, preſented a warm addreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spaniſh match; many pamphlets were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, repreſenting the dangerous conſequences of the alliance with Spain, and deſcribing Philip's bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and arrogance in the moſt odious colours. But Mary, inflexible in all her reſolutions, paid no regard to the remonſtrances of her Commons, or to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people. The Emperor, having ſecured, by various arts, the miniſters whom he truſted moſt, they approved warmly of the match, and large ſums were remitted by him in order to gain the reſt of the council. Cardinal Pole, whom, the Pope, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Mary's acceſſion, had diſpatched as his legate into England, in order to reconcile his native country to the ſee of Rome, was detained by the Emperor's command at Dillinghen, in Germany, leſt by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he ſhould thwart Philip's pretenſions, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his intereſt in favour of his kinſman Courtnay Earl of Devonſhire, whom the Engliſh ardently wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſovereign to chuſe for a huſband <note n="*" place="bottom">Palav. hiſt. Council. Trid. v. ii. c. 13. p. 150.</note>.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the negociation was carried forward with the greateſt rapidity, the Emperor agreeing, without heſitation, to every article in favour of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland which Mary's miniſters either repreſented as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſoothe the people and reconcile them to the match, or that was ſuggeſted by their own fears and jealouſy of a foreign maſter. The chief articles were, that Philip, during his marriage with the Queen, ſhould bear the title of King of England, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire adminiſtration of affairs, as well as the ſole diſpoſal of all revenues, offices, and benefices ſhould remain with the Queen; that the heirs of the marriage ſhould, together with the crown of England, inherit the dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Burgundy and the Low-Countries; that if Prince Charles, Philip's only ſon by a former marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſhould die without iſſue, his children by the Queen, whether male or female, ſhould ſucceed to the crown of Spain and all the Emperor's hereditary dominions; that before the conſummation of the marriage, Philip ſhould ſwear ſolemnly that he would retain no domeſtick who was not a ſubject of the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:011837_1062_0F9D8924EFDFFB40"/>
Queen, and would bring no foreigners into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that might give umbrage to the Engliſh; that he would make no alteration in the conſtitution or laws of England; that he would not carry the Queen, or any of his children born of this marriage, out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that if the Queen ſhould die before him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue, he ſhould leave the crown to the lawful heir, without claiming any right of adminiſtration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; that England ſhould not, in conſequence of this marriage, be engaged in any war ſubſiſting between France and Spain; and that the alliance between France and England ſhould remain in full force <note n="†" place="bottom">Rymer's Foed. vol. xv. 377. 393. Mem. de Ribier, ii. 498.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT this treaty, though both the Emperor and Mary's miniſters employed their utmoſt addreſs in framing it ſo as to pleaſe the Engliſh, was far from quieting their fears and jealouſies. They ſaw that words and promiſes were a feeble ſecurity againſt the encroachments of an ambitious Prince, who, as ſoon as he got poſſeſſion of the power and advantages which the Queen's huſband muſt neceſſarily enjoy, could eaſily evade any of the articles that either limited his authority, or obſtructed his ſchemes. They were convinced that, the more favourable the conditions of the preſent treaty were to England, the more Philip would be tempted to violate them; and they dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that England, like Naples, Milan, and the other countries annexed to the Spaniſh crown, would ſoon feel the intolerable weight of its oppreſſive dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and be conſtrained, as theſe had been, to waſte its wealth and vigour in wars wherein it had no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and from which it could derive no advantage. Theſe ſentiments prevailed ſo generally, that every part of the kingdom was filled with diſcontent at the match, and with indignation againſt the adviſers of it. Sir Thomas Wyat, a gentleman of ſome note, and of good intentions towards the publick, took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this, and rouſed the inhabitants of Kent to arms, in order to ſave their country from a foreign yoke. Such numbers reſorted in a ſhort time to his ſtandard; he marched to London with ſuch rapidity; and the Queen was ſo unutterly provided for defence, that the aſpect of affairs was extremely threatening,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:011837_1063_0F9D8925B0188000"/>
and if any nobleman of diſtinction had joined the male-contents, or had Wyat poſſeſſed talents equal, in any degree, to the boldneſs of his enterprize, the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection muſt have proved fatal to Mary's power. But all his meaſures were concerted with ſo little prudence, and executed with ſuch irreſolution, that many of his followers forſook him; the reſt were diſperſed by an handful of men; and he himſelf was taken priſoner, without having made any effort worthy of the cauſe that he had undertaken, or ſuitable to the ardour with which he engaged in it. He ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to his raſhneſs and rebellion. The Queen's authority was confirmed and increaſed by her ſucceſs in defeating this inconſiderate attempt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge it. The lady Jane Gray, whoſe title the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of her relations had ſet up in oppoſition to the Queen's, was, notwithſtanding her youth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, brought to the ſcaffold. The lady Elizabeth, the Queen's ſiſter, was obſerved with the moſt jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous attention. The treaty of marriage was ratified by the parliament.</p>
                  <p>PHILIP landed in England, with a magnificent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, celebrated his nuptials with great ſolemnity, and though he could not lay aſide his natural ſeverity and pride, or aſſume gracious and popular manners, he endeavoured to conciliate the favour of the Engliſh nobility by his extraordinary liberality. In caſe that ſhould fail of acquiring him ſuch influence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the kingdom, as he aimed at obtaining, the Emperor kept a body of twelve thouſand men on the coaſt of Flanders, in readineſs to embark for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and to ſupport him in all his enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>EMBOLDENED by all theſe favourable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Mary purſued the ſcheme of extirpating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion out of her dominions, with the moſt precipitant zeal. The laws of Edward the ſixth in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Reformation were repealed; the proteſtant clergy ejected; all the forms and rites of the Popiſh worſhip were re-eſtabliſhed; the nation was ſolemnly abſolved from the guilt which it had contracted during the period of its apoſtacy, and was publickly reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:011837_1064_0F9D89266E7EE888"/>
to the church of Rome, by cardinal Pole, who immediately after the Queen's marriage was permitted to continue his journey to England, and to exerciſe his legantine functions with the moſt ample power. Not ſatisfied with having overturned the Proteſtant church, and having eſtabliſhed her own ſyſtem on its ruins, Mary inſiſted that all her ſubjects ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the ſame mode of worſhip which ſhe preferred; ſhould profeſs their faith in the ſame creed which ſhe had approved; and abjure every practice or opinion that was deemed repugnant to either of them. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, altogether unknown in the Engliſh conſtitution, were veſted in certain perſons appointed to take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of hereſy, and they proceeded to exerciſe them with more than inquiſitorial ſeverity. The proſpect of danger, however, did not intimidate the teachers of the Proteſtant doctrines, who believed that they were contending for truths of the utmoſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the happineſs of mankind. They boldly avowed their ſentiments, and were condemned to that cruel death which the church of Rome reſerves for its enemies. This ſhocking puniſhment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with that barbarity which the rancour of falſe zeal alone can inſpire. The Engliſh, who are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in humanity to no people in Europe, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the mildneſs of their publick executions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, with aſtoniſhment and horror, perſons who had filled the moſt reſpectable ſtations in their church, and who were venerable on account of their age, their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and their literature, condemned to endure tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to which even the moſt atrocious criminals were not ſubjected.</p>
                  <p>THIS extreme rigour did not accompliſh the end at which Mary aimed. The patience and fortitude with which theſe martyrs for the Reformation ſubmitted to their ſuffering, the heroick contempt of death expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by perſons of every rank, and age, and ſex, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed many more in the Proteſtant faith, than the threats of their enraged perſecutors could frighten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to apoſtacy. The buſineſs of ſuch as were entruſted with trying of hereticks grew upon them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be as endleſs as it was odious. The Queen's
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:011837_1065_0F9D89272E5EA6B8"/>
ableſt miniſters became ſenſible how impolitick as well as dangerous it was to irritate the people, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſpectacle of public executions, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted both as unjuſt and cruel. Even Philip was ſo thoroughly convinced of her having run to an exceſs of rigour, that, on this occaſion, he aſſumed a part to which he was little accuſtomed, becoming an advocate for moderation and lenity.</p>
                  <p>BUT, notwithſtanding this attempt to ingratiate himſelf with the Engliſh, they diſcovered a conſtant jealouſy and diſtruſt of all his intentions; and when ſome members, who had been gained by the court, ventured to move in the houſe of Commons that the nation ought to aſſiſt the Emperor, the Queen's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, in his war againſt France, the propoſal was rejected with general diſſatisfaction. A motion which was made, that the parliament ſhould give its conſent that Philip might be publickly crowned as the Queen's huſband, met with ſuch a cold reception that it was inſtantly withdrawn †.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the King of France had obſerved the progreſs of the Emperor's negociation in England with much uneaſineſs. The great acceſſion of territories as well as reputation which his enemy would acquire by the marriage of his ſon with the Queen of ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful kingdom was obvious and formidable. He eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſaw that the Engliſh, notwithſtanding all their fears and precautions, would be ſoon drawn in to take part in the quarrels on the continent, and be compelled to act in ſubſerviency to the Emperor's am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſchemes. For this reaſon, Henry had given it in charge to his ambaſſador at the court of London, to employ all his addreſs in order to defeat or retard the treaty of marriage; and as there was not, at that time, any Prince of the blood in France, whom he could propoſe to the Queen as a huſband, he inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to co-operate with ſuch of the Engliſh as wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſovereign to marry one of her own ſubjects. But the Queen's ardour and precipitation, in cloſing

                     <pb n="228" facs="unknown:011837_1066_0F9D8927EEBA6700"/>
with the firſt overtures in favour of Philip, having rendered all his endeavours ineffectual, Henry was ſo far from thinking it prudent to give any aid to the Engliſh malecontents, though earneſtly ſollicited by Wyat and their other leaders, who tempted him to take them under his protection, by offers of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to France, that he commanded his ambaſſador to congratulate the Queen in the warmeſt terms upon the ſuppreſſion of the inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>BUT, notwithſtanding theſe external profeſſions, he dreaded ſo much the conſequence of this alliance, which more than compenſated for all that the Emperor had loſt in Germany, that he determined to carry on his military operations both in the Low-Countries, and in Italy, with extraordinary vigour, in order that he might compel Charles to accept of an equitable peace, before his daughter-in-law could ſurmount the averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her ſubjects to a war on the continent, and prevail on them to aſſiſt the Emperor either with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or troops. For this purpoſe, he exerted himſelf to the utmoſt in order to have a numerous army early aſſembled on the frontiers of the Netherlands, and while one part of it laid waſte the open country of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois, the main body, under the Conſtable Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, advanced towards the provinces of Liege and Hainant by the foreſt of Ardennes.</p>
                  <p>THE campaign was opened with the ſiege of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh, a town which the Queen of Hungary, the governeſs of the Low-Countries, had fortified at great expence; but, being deſtitute of a ſufficient garriſon, it ſurrendered in ſix days. Henry, elated with this ſucceſs, put himſelf at the head of his army, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting Bouvines, took it by aſſault, after a ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. With equal facility he became maſter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and then, turning to the left, bent his march towards the province of Artois. The vaſt ſums which the Emperor had remitted into England, had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted his treaſury, as to render his preparations, at this juncture, flower and more dilatory than uſual. He had no body of troops to make head againſt the French at their firſt entrance into his territories; and though he drew together all the forces in the country,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:011837_1067_0F9D8928B30CF070"/>
in the utmoſt hurry, and gave the command of them to Emanuel Philibert of Savoy, they were in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to face an enemy ſo far ſuperior in number. The Prince of Savoy, however, by his activity and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, made up for his want of troops. By watching all the motions of the French at a diſtance, and by chuſing his own poſts with ſuch ſkill as put it out of their power either to form any ſiege of conſequence or to attack him, he obliged them to fall back for want of ſubſiſtence towards their own frontiers, after having burnt all the open towns, and having plundered the country through which they marched with a cruelty and licence more becoming a body of light troops than a royal army led by a great monarch.</p>
                  <p>BUT Henry, that he might not diſmiſs his army without attempting ſome conqueſt adequate to the vaſt preparations, as well as ſanguine hopes with which he had opened the campaign, inveſted Renti, a place deemed in that age of great importance, as, by its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation on the confines of Artois and Boulonnais, it covered the former province, and protected the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which had made incurſions into the latter. The town, which was ſtrongly fortified and provided with a numerous garriſon, made a gallant defence; but being warmly preſſed by a powerful army, it muſt ſoon have yielded. The Emperor, who at that time enjoyed a ſhort interval of eaſe from the gout, was ſo ſollicitous to ſave it, that, although he could bear no other motion but that of a litter, he inſtantly put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of his army, which having received ſeveral reinforcements was now ſtrong enough to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the enemy. The French were eager to decide by a battle, what ſhould be the fate of Renti, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it from the Emperor's arrival in the camp; but Charles avoided it with great induſtry, and as he had nothing in view but to ſave the town, he hoped to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that, without expoſing himſelf to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſuch a dangerous and doubtful event.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all his precautions, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, about a poſt which both armies endeavoured to
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:011837_1068_0F9D89297A4413A0"/>
ſeize, brought on an engagement which proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt general. The Duke of Guiſe, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wing of the French which ſtood the brunt of the combat, diſplayed valour and conduct worthy of the defender of Metz; the Imperialiſts, after an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtruggle, were repulſed; the French remained maſters of the poſt in diſpute; and if the Conſtable, either from his natural caution and ſlowneſs, or from unwillingneſs to ſupport a rival whom he hated, had not delayed bringing up the main body to ſecond the impreſſion which Guiſe had made, the rout of the enemy muſt have been complete. The Emperor, notwithſtanding the loſs which he had ſuſtained, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the ſame camp; and the French, being ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened for proviſions, and finding it impoſſible to carry on the ſiege in the face of an hoſtile army, quitted their intrenchments. They retired openly, courting the enemy to approach, rather than ſhunning an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>BUT Charles, having gained his end, ſuffered them to march off unmoleſted. As ſoon as his troops en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their own country, Henry threw garriſons into the frontier towns, and diſmiſſed the reſt of the army. This encouraged the Imperialiſts to puſh forward with a conſiderable body of troops into Picardy, and by laying waſte the country with fire and ſword, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to revenge themſelves for the ravages which the French had committed in Hainault and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois <note n="†" place="bottom">Thuan. 460, &amp;c. Haraei Ann. Beab. 674.</note>. But as they were not able to reduce any place of importance, they gained nothing more than the enemy had done by this cruel and inglorious method of carrying on the war.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE, the arms of France were ſtill more unſucceſsful in Italy. The footing which the French had acquired in Siena occaſioned much uneaſineſs to Coſmo di Medici, the moſt ſagacious and enterprizing of all the Italian Princes. He dreaded the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of a powerful people, to whom all who favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ancient republican government in Florence would have recourſe, as to their natural protector
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:011837_1069_0F9D892A347732B8"/>
againſt that abſolute authority which the Emperor had enabled him to uſurp; he knew how odious he was to the French, on account of his attatchment to the Imperial party; and he foreſaw that if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to gather ſtrength in Siena, Tuſcany would ſoon feel the effects of their reſentment. For theſe reaſons, he wiſhed with the utmoſt ſollicitude for the expulſion of the French out of the Sieneſe, before they had time to eſtabliſh themſelves thoroughly in the country, or to receive ſuch reinforcements from France as would render it dangerous to attack them. As this, however, was properly the Emperor's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who was called by his intereſt as well as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to diſlodge theſe formidable intruders into the heart of his dominions, Coſmo laboured to throw the whole burden of the enterprize on him; and on that account had given no aſſiſtance, during the former campaign, but by advancing ſome ſmall ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards payment of the Imperial troops.</p>
                  <p>BUT as the defence of the Netherlands engroſſed all the Emperor's attention, and his remittances into England had drained his treaſury, it was obvious that his operations in Italy would be extremely feeble; and Coſmo plainly perceived that, if he himſelf did not take part openly in the war, and act with vigour, the French would ſcarce meet any annoyance. As his ſituation rendered this reſolution neceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, his next care was to execute it in ſuch a manner, that he might derive from it ſome other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, beſide that of driving the French out of his neighbourhood. With this view, he diſpatched an envoy to Charles, and offered to declare war againſt France, and to reduce Siena at his own charges, on condition that he ſhould be repaid whatever he ſhould expend in the enterprize, and be permitted to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m all his conqueſts until his demands were fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Charles, to whom, at this juncture, the war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Siena was an intolerable burden, and who had neither expedient nor reſource that could enable him to carry it on with proper vigour, cloſed gladly with this overture; and Coſmo, well acquainted with the low ſtate of the Imperial finaces, flattered himſelf that
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:011837_1070_0F9D892AEE4A8A48"/>
the Emperor, finding it impoſſible to re-imburſe him, would ſuffer him to keep quiet poſſeſſion of whatever places he ſhould conquer <note n="*" place="bottom">Adriani Iſtoria de ſuoi tempi, vol. i. 662.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FULL of theſe hopes, he made great preparations for war, and as the French King had turned the ſtrength of his arms againſt the Netherlands, he did not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of aſſembling ſuch a body of men, as would prove more than a ſufficient match for any force which he could bring into the field in Italy. He endeavoured to obtain aſſiſtance from the Pope, or at leaſt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his remaining neutral, by giving one of his daughters to that Pontiff's nephew. He attempted to detach the Duke of Orſini, whoſe family had been long attached to the French party, from his ancient confederates, by beſtowing on him another of his daughters; and, what was of greater conſequence than either of theſe, he engaged John James Medeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Marquis of Marignano, to take the command of his army <note n="†" place="bottom">Adriani Iſtoria, vol. i. p. 663.</note>. This officer, from a very low condition in life, had raiſed himſelf, through all the ranks of ſervice, to high command, and had diſplayed talents and acquired reputation in war, which entitled him to be placed on a level with the greateſt generals of that martial age. Having attained a ſtation of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence ſo diſproportionate to his birth, he laboured with a fond ſollicitude to conceal his original obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by giving out that he was deſcended of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Medici, to which honour the caſual reſemblance of his name was his only pretenſion. Coſmo, happy that he could gratify him at ſuch an eaſy rate, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his vanity in this point, acknowledged him as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and permitted him to aſſume the arms of his family: Medecino, eager to ſerve the head of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <pb n="233" facs="unknown:011837_1071_0F9D892BB9983B70"/>To oppoſe this able general, and the formidable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which he had aſſembled, the King of France made choice of Peter Strozzi, a Florentine nobleman, who had long reſided in France, as an exile, and who had riſen by his merit to high reputation and command in the army. He was the ſon of Philip Strozzi, who, in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirty-ſeven, had concurred with ſuch ardour in the attempt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the family of Medici out of Florence, and to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ancient republican form of government; and who had periſhed in the undertaking. The ſon inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the implacable averſion to the Medici, as well as the ſame enthuſiaſtick zeal for the liberty of Florence, which had animated his father, whoſe death he was impatient to revenge. Henry flattered himſelf that his army would make rapid progreſs under a general, whoſe zeal to promote his intereſt was rouſed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſuch powerful paſſions; eſpecially as he had allotted him, for the ſcene of action, his native country, in which he had many powerful partizans ready to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate all his operations.</p>
                  <p>BUT how ſpecious ſoever the motives might appear which induced Henry to make this choice, it proved fatal to the intereſts of France in Italy. Coſmo, as ſoon as he heard that the mortal enemy of his family was appointed to take the command in Tuſcany, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the King of France aimed at ſomething more than the protection of the Sieneſe, and ſaw the neceſſity of making extraordinary efforts, not merely to reduce Siena, but to ſave himſelf from deſtruction<note n="*" place="bottom">Pecci Memoire di Siena, vol. iv. p. 103, &amp;c.</note>.

As Coſmo ſuſtained the whole burden of military ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the expence of which muſt have exhauſted his revenues, neither the viceroy of Naples nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Milon were in condition to afford him any aid; and as the troops which Medecino had left in the camp before Siena could attempt nothing againſt it during his abſence; it was Strozzi's buſineſs to have protracted the war, and to have transferred the ſeat of it into the territories of Florence; but the hope of ruining the enemy with one deciſive blow, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated him into a general engagement not far from Marciano. The armies were nearly equal in number; but a body of Italian cavalry, in which Strozzi placed great confidence, having fled, either thro' the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery or cowardice of the officers who commanded it, without making any reſiſtance, the infantry remained expoſed to the attacks of all Medecino's troops.

                  <p>MEDECINO returned immediately to the ſiege of Siena with his victorious troops, and as Strozzi could not, after the utmoſt efforts of activity, collect as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men as to form the appearance of a regular army,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:011837_1073_0F9D892D3035FAE0"/>
he had leiſure to carry on his approaches againſt the town without moleſtation. But the Sieneſe, inſtead of ſinking into deſpair upon this cruel diſappointment of their only hope of obtaining relief, prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves to the utmoſt extremity, with that undaunted fortitude, which the love of liberty alone can inſpire. This generous reſolution was warmly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Monluc, who commanded the French gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in the town. The active and enterprizing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which he had diſplayed on many occaſions had procured him this command; and as he had ambition which aſpired at the higheſt military dignities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pretenſions to attain them but what he could derive from merit, he determined to diſtinguiſh his defence of Siena by extraordinary efforts of valour and perſeverance. For this purpoſe, he, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied induſtry, repaired and ſtrengthened the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; he trained the citizens to the uſe of arms, and accuſtomed them to go thro' the fatigues and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of ſervice in common with the ſoldiers; and as the enemy were extremely ſtrict in guarding all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues to the city, he huſbanded the proviſions in the magazines with the moſt parſimonious oeconom, and prevailed on the ſoldiers, as well as the citizens, to reſtrict themſelves to a very moderate daily allowance for their ſubſiſtence. Medecino, though his army was not numerous enough to ſtorm the town by open force, ventured twice to aſſault it by ſurprize, but he was received each time with ſo much ſpirit, and repulſed with ſuch loſs, as diſcouraged him from repeating the attempt, and left him no hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the town but by famine.</p>
                  <p>WITH this view, he fortified his own camp with great care, occupied all the poſts of ſtrength round the place, and having entirely cut off the beſieged from any communication with the adjacent country, he waited patiently until neceſſity ſhould compel them to open their gates. But the enthuſiaſtick zeal of the citizens for liberty, made them deſpiſe the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies occaſioned by ſcarcity of proviſions, and even ſupported them long under all the miſeries of famine; Monluc, by his example and exhortations, taught his
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:011837_1074_0F9D892DF1986940"/>
ſoldiers to vie with them in patience and abſtinence; and it was not until they had withſtood a ſiege of ten months, until they had eaten up all the horſes, dogs, and other animals in the place, and were reduced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to their laſt morſel of bread, that they propoſed a capitulation. Even then, they demanded honourable terms; and as Coſmo, though no ſtranger to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of their condition, was afraid that deſpair might prompt them to venture upon ſome wild enterprize, he immediately granted them conditions more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than they could have expected.</p>
                  <p>THE capitulation was made in the Emperor's name, who engaged to take the republick of Siena under the protection of the Empire; he promiſed to maintain the ancient liberties of the city, to allow the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the full exerciſe of their former authority, to ſecure the citizens in the undiſturbed poſſeſſion of their privileges and property; he granted an ample and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited pardon to all who had born arms againſt him; he reſerved to himſelf the right of placing a garriſon in the town, but engaged not to rebuild the citadel without the conſent of the citizens. Monluc and his French garriſon were allowed to march out with all the honours of war.</p>
                  <p>MEDECINO obſerved the articles of capitulation, ſo far as depended on him with great exactneſs. No vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or inſult whatever was offered to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the French garriſon was received with all the reſpect due to its ſpirit and bravery. But many of the citizens ſuſpecting from the extraordinary facility with which they had obtained ſuch favourable conditions, that the Emperor, as well as Coſmo, would take the firſt opportunity of violating them and diſdaining to poſſeſs a precarious liberty, which depended on the will of another, abandoned the place of their nativity, and accompanied the French to Monteé-Alcino, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ercole, and other ſmall towns in the territory of the republic. They eſtabliſhed in Monteé-Alcino the ſame model of government to which they had been accuſtomed at Siena, and appointing magiſtrates with the ſame titles and juriſdiction, ſolaced themſelves with this image of their ancient liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:011837_1075_0F9D892F4488A500"/>THE fears of the Sieneſe concerning the fate of their country were not imaginary, or their ſuſpicion of the Emperor and Coſmo ill-founded; for no ſooner had the Imperial troops taken poſſeſſion of the town, than Coſmo, without regarding the articles of capitulation, not only diſplaced the magiſtrates who were in office, and nominated new ones devoted to his intereſt, but commanded all the citizens to deliver up their arms to perſons whom he appointed to receive them. They ſubmitted to the former from neceſſity, though with all the reluctance and regret which men accuſtomed to liberty feel in obeying the firſt commands of a maſter. They did not yield the ſame tame obedience to the latter; and many perſons of diſtinction, rather than degrade themſelves, by ſurrendering their arms, from the rank of freemen to the condition of ſlaves, fled to their countrymen at Monté-Alcino, and choſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all the hardſhips, and encounter all the dangers which they had reaſon to expect in that new ſtation, where they had fixed the ſeat of their republick.</p>
                  <p>COSMO, not reckoning himſelf ſecure while ſuch numbers of implacable and deſperate enemies were ſettled in his neighbourhood, and retained any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of power, ſollicited Medecino to attack them in their different places of retreat, before they had time to recruit their ſtrength and ſpirits, after the many calamities which they had ſuffered. He prevailed on him, though his army was much weakened by hard duty during the ſiege of Siena, to inveſt Porto Ercole; and the fortifications being both ſlight and incompleat, the beſieged were ſoon compelled to open their gates. An unexpected order which Medecino received from the Emperor to detach the greater part of his troops into Piedmont, prevented farther operations, and permitted the Sieneſe exiles to reſide for ſome time undiſturbed in Monté-Alcino. But their unhappy countrymen who remained at Siena, were not yet at the end of their ſufferings; for the Emperor inſtead of adhering to the articles of capitulation, granted his ſon Philip the inveſtiture of that city and all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies; and Francis de Toledo, in the name of their new maſter, proceeded to ſettle the civil and

                  <p>THE Imperial army in Piedmont had been ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for ſome time, and its commanders ſo inactive that the Emperor, in order to give vigor to his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in that, quarter, found it neceſſary not only to call off Medecino's troops from Tuſcany, while in the career of conqueſt, but to employ in Piedmont a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of ſuch reputation and abilities, as might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance the great military talents of the Marchal Briſſac, who was at the head of the French forces in that country.</p>
                  <p>HE pitched on the Duke of Alva for that purpoſe; but it was as much the effect of a court intrigue, as of his opinion of the Duke's merit, which led him to this choice. Alva had long attended Philip with the utmoſt aſſiduity, and had endeavoured to work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his confidence by all the inſinuating arts of which his haughty and inflexible nature was capable. As he nearly reſembled that Prince in many features of his character, he began to gain much of his good will. Ruy Gomez de Silva, Philip's favourite, who dreaded the progreſs which this formidable rival made in his maſter's affections, had the addreſs to prevail with the Emperor to name Alva to this command. The Duke, though ſenſible that he owed this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the malicious arts of an enemy, who had no other aim than to remove him at a diſtance from court, was of ſuch punctilious honour, that he would not decline a command that appeared dangerous and difficult, but, at the ſame time, ſo haughty that he would not accept of it but on his own terms, inſiſting on being appointed the Emperor's Vicar General in Italy, with the ſupreme military command in all the Imperial and Spaniſh territories in that country. Charles granted all his demands; and he took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his new dignity with almoſt unlimited authority.</p>

Briſſac had under his command an army which, though inferior in number to the Imperialiſts, was compoſed of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen troops, which having grown old in ſervice in that country, where every town was fortified, and every caſtle capable of being defended, were perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the manner of carrying on war there. By their valour, and his own good conduct, Briſſac not only defeated all the attempts of the Imperialiſts, but added new conqueſts to the territories of which he was formerly maſter. Alva, after having boaſted with his uſual arrogance, that he would drive the French out of Piedmont in a few weeks, was obliged to retire into winter quarters, with the ignominy of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to preſerve entire that part of the country of which the Emperor had hitherto kept poſſeſſion <note n="f" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xv. 52<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AS the operations of this campaign in Piedmont were indeciſive, thoſe in the Netherlands were inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, neither the Emperor nor King of France being able to bring into the field an army ſtrong enough to undertake any enterprize of moment. But what Charles wanted in force he endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by a bold ſtratagem, the ſucceſs of which would have been equal to that of the moſt vigorous campaign. During the ſiege of Metz, Leonard Father Guardian of a convent of Franciſcans in that city had, by his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the French intereſt, inſinuated himſelf far into the eſteem and favour of the Duke of Guiſe. Being a man of an active and intriguing ſpirit, he had been extremely uſeful both in animating the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to ſuſtain with patience all the hardſhips of the ſiege, and in procuring intelligence of the enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and motions. The merit of theſe important ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, together with the warm recommendations of the Duke of Guiſe, ſecured him ſuch high confidence with Vielleville, who was appointed governor of Metz, when Guiſe left the town, that he was permitted to
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:011837_1078_0F9D8930F04E7098"/>
converſe or correſpond with whatever perſons he choſe, and nothing that he did created any ſuſpicion. This monk, from the levity natural to bold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting adventurers; or from reſentment againſt the French, who had not beſtowed on him ſuch rewards as he thought due to his own merit; or tempted, by the unlimited confidence which was placed in him, to imagine that he might carry on and accompliſh any ſcheme with perfect ſecurity; formed a deſign of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying Metz to the Imperialiſts.</p>
                  <p>HE communicated his intentions to the Queen-dowager of Hungary, who governed the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in name of her brother. She approving, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcruple, an act of treachery, from which the Emperor might derive ſuch ſignal advantage, aſſiſted the Father Guardian in concerting the moſt proper plan for enſuring its ſucceſs. They agreed that the Father Guardian ſhould endeavour to gain the monks of his convert to concur in promoting the deſign; that he ſhould introduce into the convent a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of choſen ſoldiers, diſguiſed in the habit of friars; that when every thing was ripe for execution, the governor of Thionville ſhould march towards Metz in the night with a conſiderable body of troops, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſcale the ramparts; that while the garriſon was employed in reſiſting the aſſailants, the monks ſhould ſet fire to the town in different places; that the ſoldiers who lay concealed ſhould ſally out of the convent, and attack thoſe who defended the ramparts in the rear. Amidſt the univerſal terror and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which events ſo unexpected would occaſion, it was not doubted but that the Imperialiſts might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſters of the town. As a recompence for this ſervice the Father Guardian ſtipulated that he ſhould be appointed biſhop of Metz, and ample rewards were promiſed to ſuch of his monks as ſhould be moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in co-operating with him.</p>
                  <p>THE Father Guardian accompliſhed what he had undertaken to perform with great ſecrecy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch. By his authority and arguments, as well as by the proſpect of wealth or honours which he ſet before his monks, he prevailed on all of them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:011837_1079_0F9D8931AED303C8"/>
into the conſpiracy. He introduced into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as many ſoldiers as were thought ſufficient, without being ſuſpected. The governor of Thionvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, appriſed in due time of the deſign, had aſſembled a proper number of troops for executing it; and the moment approached, which probably would have wreſted from Henry the moſt important of all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
                  <p>BUT happily for France, on the very day that was fixed for ſtriking the blow, Vielleville, an able and vigilant officer, received information from a ſpy whom he entertained at Thionville, that certain Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan friars reſorted frequently thither, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to many private conferences with the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who was carrying on preparations for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary enterprize with great diſpatch, but with a moſt myſterious ſecrecy. This was ſufficient to awaken Viel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leville's ſuſpicions. Without communicating theſe to any perſon, he inſtantly viſited the convent of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans; detected the ſoldiers who were concealed there; and forced them to diſcover as much as they knew concerning the nature of the enterprize. The Father Guardian, who had gone to Thionville that he might put the laſt hand to his machinations, was ſeized at the gate as he returned; and he, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſave himſelf from the rack, revealed all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the conſpiracy.</p>
                  <p>VIELLEVILLE not ſatisfied with having ſeized the traitors, and having fruſtrated their ſchemes, was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to take advantage of the diſcoveries which he had made, ſo as to be revenged on the Imperialiſts. For this purpoſe he marched out with the beſt troops in his garriſon, and placing theſe in ambuſh near the road, by which the father guardian had informed him that the governor of Thionville would approach Metz, he fell upon the Imperialiſts with great fury, as they advanced in perfect ſecurity, without ſuſpecting any danger to be near. Confounded at this ſudden attack, by an enemy whom they expected to ſurpriſe, they made little reſiſtance; and a great part of the troops employed in this ſervice, among which were many perſons of diſtinction, was killed or taken priſoners.
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:011837_1080_0F9D893270257468"/>
Before next morning, Vielleville returned to Metz in triumph.</p>
                  <p>NO reſolution was taken for ſome time concerning the fate of the Father Guardian and his monks, the framers and conductors of this dangerous conſpiracy. Regard for the honour of a body ſo numerous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable as the Franciſcans, and unwillingneſs to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a ſubject of triumph to the enemies of the Romiſh church by their diſgrace, ſeem to have occaſioned this delay. But at length, the neceſſity of inflicting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment upon them, in order to deter others from venturing to commit the ſame crime, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo evident, that orders were iſſued to proceed to their trial. Their guilt was made apparent by the cleareſt evidence; and ſentence of death was paſſed upon the Father Guardian together with twenty monks. On the evening previous to the day fixed for their execution, the jailor took them out of the dungeons in which they had hitherto been confined ſeparately, and ſhut them all up in one great room, that they might confeſs their ſins one to another, and join together in preparing for a future ſtate. But as ſoon as they were left alone, inſtead of employing themſelves in the religious exerciſes ſuitable to their condition, they began to reproach the Father Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and four of the ſenior monks, who had been moſt active in ſeducing them, for their inordinate ambition, which had brought ſuch miſery on them, and ſuch diſgrace upon their order. From reproaches they proceeded to curſes and exercrations, and at laſt in a frenzy of rage and diſpair, they fell upon them with ſuch violence, that they murdered the Father Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an on the ſpot, and ſo diſabled the other four, that it became neceſſary to carry them next morning in a cart, together with the dead body of the Father Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to the place of execution. Six of the youngeſt were pardoned, the reſt ſuffered the puniſhment which their crime merited <note n="g" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xv. p. 522. Belcar. Com. Rer. Gal. 866. Memoires da Marech.

Cardinal Pole indeed laboured with all the zeal becoming his piety and humanity, to re-eſtabliſh concord among the Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He had not only perſuaded his miſtreſs, the Queen of England, to enter warmly into his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to offer her mediation to the contending powers, but had prevailed both on the Emperor and King of France to ſend their plenipotentiaries to a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage between Gravelines and Ardres. He himſelf, together with Gardiner biſhop of Wincheſter repaired thither in order to preſide as mediators in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which were to be held for adjuſting all the points in difference. But though both the monarchs committed this negociation to thoſe miniſters, in whom they placed the greateſt confidence, it was ſoon evident that they came together with no ſincere deſire of accommodation. Each propoſed articles ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant that they could have no hopes of their being accepted. Pole, after exerting, in vain, all his zeal, addreſs and invention, in order to perſuade them to relinquiſh ſuch extravagant demands, and to conſent to the ſubſtitution of more equal conditions, became ſenſible of the folly of waſting time, in attempting to reconcile thoſe, whom their obſtinacy rendered irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable, broke off the conference, and returned into England <note n="h" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xv. p. 523.

                  <p>DURING theſe tranſactions in other parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, Germany enjoyed ſuch profound tranquillity, as afforded the diet full leiſure to deliberate, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh proper regulations concerning a point of the greateſt conſequence to the internal peace of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. By the treaty of Paſſau in one thouſand five hundred and fifty-two, it had been referred to the next diet of the Empire to confirm and perfect the plan of religious pacification, which was there agreed upon. The terror and confuſion with which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent commotions excited by Albert of Brandenburgh had filled the Empire, as well as the conſtant attention
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:011837_1082_0F9D8933EFE86F50"/>
which Ferdinand was obliged to give to the affairs of Hungary, had hitherto prevented the holding a diet, though it had been ſummoned ſoon after the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the treaty, to meet at Augſburg.</p>
                  <p>BUT as a diet was now neceſſary on many accounts, Ferdinand about the beginning of this year had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Augſburg. Though few of the Princes were preſent either in perſon or by their deputies, he opened the aſſembly by a ſpeech, in which he propoſed the termination of the diſſentions, to which the new tenets and controverſies with regard to religion had given riſe, not only as the firſt and great buſineſs of the diet, but as the point which both the Emperor and he had moſt at heart. He repreſented the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable obſtacles which the Emperor had to ſurmount before he could procure the convocation of a general council, as well as the fatal accidents which had for ſome time retarded, and had at laſt ſuſpended the conſultations of that aſſembly. He obſerved that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had already taught them how vain it was to expect any remedy for evils, which demanded immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, from a general council, the aſſembling of which would either be prevented, or its deliberations be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the diſſentions and hoſtilities of the Princes of Chriſtendom; That a national council in Germany, which, as ſome imagined, might be called with greater eaſe, and deliberate with more perfect ſecurity, was an aſſembly of an unprecedented nature, the juriſdiction of which was uncertain in its extent, and the form of its proceedings undefined; That in his opinion there remained but one method for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their unhappy differences, which though it had been often tried without ſucceſs, might yet prove effectual if it were attempted with a better and more pacific ſpirit than had appeared on fomer occaſions, and that was to chooſe a few men of learning, abilities and moderation, who by diſcuſſing the diſputed articles in an amicable conference, might explain them in ſuch a manner as to bring the contending parties either to unite in ſentiment, or to differ with charity.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſpeech being printed in common form, and diſperſed over the Empire, revived the fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:011837_1083_0F9D8934D7E2AB78"/>
of the Proteſtants; Ferdinand, they obſerved with much ſurprize, had not once mentioned, in his addreſs to the diet, the treaty of Paſſau, the ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which they conſidered as the great ſecurity of their religious liberty. The ſuſpicions to which this gave riſe were confirmed by the accounts which they daily received of the extreme rigor with which Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand treated their Proteſtant brethren in his heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary dominions, and as it was natural to conſider his actions as the ſureſt indication of his intentions, this diminiſhed their confidence in thoſe pompous profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of moderation or of zeal for the re-eſtabliſhment of concord, to which his practice was ſo utterly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>THE arrival of the Cardinal Morone, whom the Pope had appointed to attend the diet as his nuncio, compleated their conviction, and left them no room to doubt that ſome dangerous machination was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the peace or ſafety of the Proteſtant church. Julius elated with the unexpected return of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh nation from apoſtacy, began to flatter himſelf that the ſpirit of mutiny and revolt having now ſpent its force, the happy period was come when the church might reſume its ancient authority, and he obeyed by the people with the ſame tame ſubmiſſion as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Full of theſe hopes, he had ſent Morone to Augſburg with inſtructions to employ his eloquence in order to excite the Germans to imitate the laudable example of the Engliſh, and his political addreſs in order to prevent any decree of the diet to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the catholick faith. As Morone inherited from his father, the chancellor of Milan, uncommon talents for negociation and intrigue, he could ſcarce have failed of embarraſſing the meaſures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the diet or of defeating whatever they aimed at obtaining in it for their farther ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>BUT an unforeſeen event delivered them from all the danger which they had reaſon to apprehend from Morone's preſence. Julius, by abandoning himſelf to pleaſures and amuſements no leſs unbecoming his age than his character, having contracted ſuch habits of diſſipation, that any ſerious occupation, eſpecially if
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:011837_1084_0F9D8936418BACF8"/>
attended with difficulty, became an intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him, had long reſiſted the ſollicitations of his nephew to hold a conſiſtory, becauſe he expected there a violent oppoſition to his ſchemes in favour of that young man. But when all the pretexts which he could invent for eluding his requeſt were exhauſted, and at the ſame time his indolent averſion to buſineſs continued to grow upon him, he feigned indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather than yield to his nephew's importunity; and that he might give the deceit a greater colour of probability, he not only confined himſelf to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but changed his uſual diet and manner of life. By perſiſting too long in acting this ridiculous part, he contracted a real diſeaſe, of which he died in a few days, leaving his infamous minion the Cardinal de Monte to bear his name, and to diſgrace the dignity which he had conferred upon him <note n="i" place="bottom">Onuphr. Panvinius de vitis Pontificum. p. 320. Thuan. lib. xv. 517.</note>. As ſoon as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone heard of his death, he ſet out abruptly from Augſburg, where he had reſided only a few days, that he might be preſent at the election of a new Pontiff.</p>
                  <p>ONE cauſe of their ſuſpicions and fears being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Proteſtants ſoon became ſenſible that their conjectures concerning Ferdinand's intentions, how plauſible ſoever, were ill-founded, and that he had no thoughts of violating the articles favourable to them in the treaty of Paſſau. Charles, from the time that Maurice had defeated all his ſchemes in the Empire, and overturned the great ſyſtem of religious and civil deſpotiſm, which he had almoſt eſtabliſhed there, gave little attention to the internal government of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and permitted his brother to purſue whatever meaſures he judged moſt ſalutary and expedient. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand, leſs ambitious and enterprizing than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, inſtead of reſuming a plan, which he, with power and reſources ſo far ſuperior, had failed of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing, endeavoured to attach the Princes of the Empire to his family by an adminiſtration uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderate and equitable. To this he gave, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, particular attention, becauſe his ſituation at this juncture rendered it neceſſary to court their favour and ſupport with more than uſual aſſiduity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="unknown:011837_1085_0F9D89365719F890"/>CHARLES had again reſumed his favourite project of acquiring the Imperial crown for his ſon Philip, which the ill-reception it had met with when firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed had obliged him to intermit, but had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to relinquiſh. This led him warmly to renew his requeſts to his brother that he would accept of ſome compenſation for his prior right of ſucceſſion, and ſacrifice that to the grandeur of the houſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria. Ferdinand who was as little diſpoſed, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, to give ſuch an extraordinary proof of ſelf-denial, being ſenſible that, in order to defeat this ſcheme, not only the moſt inflexible firmneſs on his part, but a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous declaration from the Princes of the Empire in behalf of his title, were requiſite; was willing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their favour by gratifying them in every point that they deemed intereſting or eſſential.</p>
                  <p>ON the other hand, the Turks, after having wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him great part of his Hungarian territories, were ready to attack the provinces ſtill ſubject to his authority with a formidable army, againſt which he could bring no equal force into the field, unleſs the diet ſhould grant him immediate and extraordinary aid. For this he could not hope if the internal peace of the empire were not eſtabliſhed on a foundation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid in itſelf, and which ſhould appear, even to the Proteſtants, ſo ſecure and ſo permanent, as might not only allow them to engage in a diſtant war with ſafety, but encourage them to act with vigour.</p>
                  <p>A STEP taken by the Proteſtants themſelves, a ſhort time after the opening of the diet, rendered him ſtill more cautious of giving them any new cauſe of offence. As ſoon as the publication of Ferdinand's ſpeech created the fears and ſuſpicions which have been mentioned, the Electors of Saxony and Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, together with the Landgrave of Heſſe, met at Naumburgh, and renewing the ancient treaty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraternity which had long united their families, they added to it a new article, by which the contracting parties bound themſelves to adhere to the confeſſion of Augſburgh, and to maintain the doctrine which it contained in their reſpective dominions <note n="k" place="bottom">Chytrai Saxonia, 480.</note>.</p>

The members of the diet readily agreed to Ferdinand's propoſal of taking the ſtate of religion into conſideration, previous to any other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. But, as ſoon as they entered upon it, both parties diſcovered all the zeal and animoſity which a ſubject ſo intereſting naturally engenders, and which the rancour of controverſy, together with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of civil war, had inflamed to the higheſt pitch.</p>
                  <p>THE Proteſtants contended that the ſecurity which they claimed in conſequence of the treaty of Paſſau ſhould extend, without limitation, to all who had hitherto embraced the doctrine of Luther, or who ſhould here after embrace it. The Catholics, having firſt of all aſſerted the Pope's right as the ſupreme and final judge with reſpect to all articles of faith, inſiſted that the toleration granted, by the treaty of Paſſau, to ſuch as had adopted the new opinions; which on account of the preſent ſituation of the Empire, and for the ſake of peace, they were willing to confirm; ſhould not be extended either to thoſe cities which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Interim, or to ſuch eccleſiaſtics as ſhould for the future apoſtatize from the church of Rome. It was no eaſy matter to reconcile ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pretenſions, which were ſupported, on each ſide, by the moſt elaborate arguments, and the greateſt acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of expreſſion, that the abilities or zeal of theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians long exerciſed in diſputation could ſuggeſt. Ferdinand, however, by his addreſs and perſeverance; by ſoftening ſome things on each ſide; by putting a favourable meaning upon others; by repreſenting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly the neceſſity as well as the advantages of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and by threatening on ſome occaſions, when all other conſiderations were diſregarded, to diſſolve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, brought them at length to a concluſion in which they all agreed.</p>

ſeem ſtrange that a method of terminating their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, ſo ſuitable to the mind and charitable ſpirit of the Chriſtian religion, did not ſooner occur to the contending parties. But an expedient, which, how ſalutary ſoever it might be, was repugnant to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and practice of Chriſtians during many ages, did not lie obvious to diſcovery.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of ſentiment concerning the object or rights of religious worſhip ſeems to have been no ſource of animoſity, becauſe the acknowledging veneration to be due to any one God, did not apply denial of the exiſtence or the power of any other God; nor were the modes and rites of worſhip eſtabliſhed in one country incompatible with thoſe which other nations approved of and obſerved. Thus the errors in their ſyſtem of theology were of ſuch a nature as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of concord, and notwithſtanding the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing number of their deities, as well as the infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their ceremonies, a ſociable and tolerating ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſubſiſted almoſt univerſally in the pagan world.</p>
                  <p>BUT when the Chriſtian revelation declared one Supreme Being to be the ſole object of religions vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, preſcribed the form of worſhip moſt acceptable to him, whoever admitted the truth it held, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, every other mode of religion to be abſurd and impious. Hence the zeal of the firſt converts to the Chriſtian faith in propagating its doctrines, and the ardour with which they laboured to overturn every other form of worſhip. They employed, however, for this purpoſe no methods but ſuch as ſuited the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of religion. By the force of powerful arguments, they convinced the underſtandings of men; by the charms of ſuperior virtue, they allured and captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts. At length the civil power declared in favour of Chriſtianity, and though numbers, imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of their ſuperiors, crouded into the church, many ſtill adhered to their ancient ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Enraged at their obſtinacy, the miniſters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whoſe zeal was ſtill unabated, though their ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and virtue were much diminiſhed, forgot ſo far the nature of their own miſſion, and of the arguments
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011837_1089_0F9D893932118CF8"/>
which they ought to have employed, that they armed the Imperial power againſt theſe unhappy men, and as they could not perſuade, they tried to compel them to believe.</p>
                  <p>AT the ſame time, controverſies concerning arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith multiplied, from various cauſes, among chriſtians themſelves, and the ſame unhallowed wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which had firſt been uſed againſt the enemies of their religon, were turned againſt each other. Every zealous diſputant endeavoured to intereſt the civil magiſtrates in his cauſe, and each in his turn employed the ſecular arm to cruſh or to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his opponents. Not long after, the biſhops of Rome put in their claim to infallibility in explaining articles of faith, and deciding points in controverſy, and bold as the pretenſion was, they by their artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and perſeverance, impoſed on the credulity of mankind, and brought them to recognize it. To doubt or to deny any doctrine to which theſe unerring inſtructors had given the ſanction of their approbation, was held to be not only a reſiſting of truth, but an act of rebellion againſt their ſacred authority; and the ſeculiar power, of which by various arts they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the abſolute direction, was inſtantly employed to avenge both.</p>
                  <p>THUS Europe had been accuſtomed, during many centuries, to ſee ſpeculative opinions propagated or defended by force; the charity and mutual forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which Chriſtianity recommends with ſo much warmth were forgotten, the ſacred rights of conſcience and of private judgment were unheard of, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the idea of toleration, but even the word itſelf, in in the ſenſe now affixed to it was unknown. A right to extirpate error by force was univerſally allowed to be the prerogative of thoſe who poſſeſſed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth, and as each party of Chriſtians believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had got poſſeſſion of this invaluable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, they all claimed and exerciſed, as far as they were able, the rights which it was ſuppoſed to convey. The Roman catholics, as their ſyſtem reſted on the deciſions of an infallible judge, never doubted that truth was on their ſide, and openly called on the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:011837_1090_0F9D8939F320AB38"/>
civil power to repel the impious and heretical innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who had riſen up againſt it. The Proteſtants, no leſs confident that their doctrine was well founded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with equal ardour, the Princes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> party to check ſuch as preſumed to impugn or to oppoſe it. Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, Knox, the founders of the reformed church in their reſpective coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, inflicted, as far as they had power and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, the ſame puniſhments which were denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt their own diſciples by the church of Rome, on ſuch as called in queſtion any article in their creeds. To their followers, and perhaps to their opponents, it would have appeared a ſymptom of diffidence in the goodneſs of their cauſe, or an acknowledgment that it was not well founded, if they had not employed in its defence all thoſe means which it was ſuppoſed truth had a right to employ.</p>
                  <p>IT was towards the cloſe of the ſeventeenth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before toleration, under its preſent form, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted firſt into the republic of the United Provinces, and from thence introduced into England. Long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the calamities of mutual perſecution, the influence of free government, the light and humanity acquired by the progreſs of ſcience, together with the prudence and authority of the civil magiſtrate, were all requiſite in order to eſtabliſh a regulation ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the ideas which all the different ſects had adopted from miſtaken conceptions concerning the nature of religion and the rights of truth, or which all of them had derived from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous maxims eſtabliſhed by the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>THE receſs of Augſburg, it is evident, was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on no ſuch liberal and enlarged ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning freedom of religious enquiry or the nature of toleration. It was nothing more than a ſcheme of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, which political conſiderations alone had ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to the contending parties, and regard for their mutual tranquillity and ſafety had rendered neceſſary. Of this there can be no ſtronger proof than an article in the receſs itſelf, by which the benefits of the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are declared to extend only to the Catholicks on the one ſide, and to ſuch as adhered to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:011837_1091_0F9D893AB79CA9F0"/>
of Augſburg on the other. The followers of Zuinglius and Calvin remained, in conſequence of that excluſion, without any protection from the rigour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ain any legal ſecurity, until the treaty of Weſtpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, near a century after this period, provided that they ſhould be admitted to enjoy, in as ample manner as the Lutherans, all the advantages and protection which the receſs of Augſburg affords.</p>
                  <p>BUT if the followers of Luther were highly pleaſed with the ſecurity which they acquired by this receſs, ſuch as adhered to the ancient ſyſtem had no leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſatisfied with that article in it which preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entire to the Roman catholick church the benefices of ſuch eccleſiaſticks as ſhould hereafter renounce its doctrines. This article, known in Germany by the name of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Reſervation,</hi> was manifeſtly ſo conformable to the idea and to the rights of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church; and it appeared ſo equitable to prevent revenues, which had been originally appropriated for the maintenance of perſons attached to acertain ſyſtem, from being alienated to any other purpoſe, that the proteſtants, though they foreſaw its conſequences, were obliged to relinquiſh their oppoſition to it. As the Roman catholick Princes of the Empire have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en care to ſee this article exactly obſerved in every caſe where there was an opportunity of putting it in execution, it has proved the great barrier of the Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church in Germany againſt the Reformation; and as from this period the ſame temptation of intereſt did not allure eccleſiaſticks to relinquiſh the eſtabliſhed ſyſtem, there have been few of that order, who have loved truth with ſuch diſintereſted and ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to abandon for its ſake the rich benefices which they had in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>DURING the ſitting of the diet, Marcellus Cervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Cardinal of Santa Croce, was elected Pope in room of Julius. He, in imitation of Adrian, did not change his name on being exalted to the Papal Chair. As he equalled that Pontiff in purity of intention, and excelled him much in the arts of government, and ſtill more in knowledge of the ſtate and genius of the
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:011837_1092_0F9D893B75E45B30"/>
papal court; as he had capacity to diſcern what refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation it needed, as well as what it could bear, ſuch regulations were expected from his virtue and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as would have removed many of its groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt flagrant corruptions, and have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards reconciling to the church, ſuch as from indignation at theſe enormities had abandoned its communion. But this excellent Pontiff was only ſhewn to the church and immediately ſnatched away. The confinement in the conclave had impaired his health, and the fatigue of tedious ceremonies upon his acceſſion, together with too intenſe and anxious application of mind to the ſchemes of improvement which he meditated, exhauſted ſo entirely the vigour of his feeble conſtitution, that he ſickened on the twelfth, and died on the twentieth day after his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note n="m" place="bottom">Thuan. 520. F. Paul, 365. Onuph. Panvin. 321, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>ALL the refinements in artifice and intrigue, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to conclaves, were diſplayed in that which was held for electing a ſucceſſor to Marcellus; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Imperial and French factions labouring, with equal ardour, to gain the neceſſary number of ſuffrages for one of their own party. But, after a ſtruggle of no long duration, though conducted with all the warmth and eagerneſs natural to men contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſo great an object, they united in chuſing John Peter Caraffa the eldeſt member of the ſacred college and the ſon of Count Montorio, a nobleman of an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious family in the kingdom of Naples. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and influence of Cardinal Farneſe who favoured his pretenſions, Caraffa's own merit, and perhaps his great age, which ſoothed all the diſappointed candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates with the nearer proſpect of a new vacancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in bringing about this ſpeedy union of ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. In order to teſtify his reſpect for the memory of Paul III. by whom he had been created Cardinal, and his gratitude to the family of Farneſe, he aſſumed the name of Paul IV.</p>
                  <p>THE choice of a prelate of ſuch a ſingular character, and who had long held a courſe extremely different from that which uſually led to the dignity now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:011837_1093_0F9D893C3046AC50"/>
upon him, filled the Italians, who had neareſt acceſs to obſerve his manners and deportment, with aſtoniſhment, and kept them in ſuſpenſe and ſolicitude with regard to his future conduct Paul, though born in a rank of life which, without any other merit, might have ſecured to him the higheſt eccleſiaſtical preferments, had from his early years applied to ſtudy with all the affiduity of a man who had nothing but his perſonal accompliſhments to render him conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. By means of this he not only acquired profound ſkill in ſcholaſtick theology, but added to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable knowledge of the learned languages and of polite literature, the ſtudy of which had been lately revived in Italy, and was purſued at this time with great ardour. His mind, however, naturally gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ſevere, was more formed to imbibe the four ſpirit of the former, than to receive any degree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legance or liberality of ſentiment from the latter; ſo that he acquired rather the qualities and paſſions of a recluſe eccleſiaſtick, than the talents neceſſary for the conduct of great affairs. Accordingly, when he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into orders, although ſeveral rich benefices were beſtowed on him, and he was early employed as nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio in different courts, he ſoon became diſguſted with that courſe of life, and languiſhed to be in a ſituation more ſuited to his taſte and temper. With this view he reſigned at once all his eccleſiaſtical preferments, and having inſtituted an order of regular prieſts, whom he denominated Theatines, from the name of the archbiſhoprick which he had held, he aſſociated himſelf as a member of their fraternity, conformed to all the rigorous rules to which he had ſubjected them, and preferred the ſolitude of a monaſtick life, with the honour of being the founder of a new order, to all the vaſt objects which the court of Rome preſented to his ambition.</p>
                  <p>IN this retreat he remained for many years, until Paul III. induced by the ſame of his ſanctity and knowledge called him to Rome, in order to conſult with him concerning the meaſures which might be moſt proper and effectual for the ſuppreſſing of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and re-eſtabliſhing the ancient authority of the
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:011837_1094_0F9D893CEEAB6B10"/>
church. Having thus allured him from his ſolitude, the Pope, partly by his intreaties, and partly by his authority, prevailed on him to accept of a Cardinal's hat, to reaſſume the benefices which he had reſigned, and to return again into the uſual path of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ambition which he ſeemed to have relinquiſhed. But, during two ſucceſſive Pontificates, under the firſt of which the court of Rome was the moſt artful and intereſted, and under the ſecond the moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of any in Europe, Caraffa retained his monaſtic auſterity. He was an avowed and bitter enemy not only of all innovation in opinion, but of every irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in practice; he was the chief inſtrument in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the formidable and odious tribunal of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in the papal territories; he appeared a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent advocate on all occaſions for the juriſdiction and diſcipline of the church, and a ſevere cenſurer of every meaſure which ſeemed to flow from motives of policy or intereſt, rather than from zeal for the honour of the eccleſiaſtical order, and the dignity of the Holy See. Under a prelate of ſuch a character, the Roman cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers expected a ſevere and violent Pontificate, during which the principles of ſound policy would be ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the narrow prejudices of prieſtly zeal; while the people of Rome were apprehenſive of ſeeing the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and forbidding rigour of monaſtick manners ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in place of the gaiety or magnificence to which they had long been accuſtomed in the papal court. Theſe apprehenſions Paul was extremely ſolicitous to remove. At his firſt entrance on the adminiſtration he laid aſide that auſterity which had hitherto diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed his perſon and family, and when the maſter of his houſhold inquired in what manner he would chuſe to live, he haughtily replied, "as becomes a great Prince." He ordered the ceremony of his coronation to be conducted with more than uſual magnificence; and endeavoured to render himſelf popular by ſeveral acts of liberality and indulgence towards the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Rome<note n="n" place="bottom">Platina, p. 327. Caſtaldo Vita di Paolo IV. Rom. 1615. p. 70.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HIS natural ſeverity of temper, however, would have ſoon returned upon him, and would have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:011837_1095_0F9D893DB12227D0"/>
the conjectures of the courtiers, and the fears of the people, if he had not, immediately after his election, called to Rome two of his nephews, ſons of his brother the Count of Montorio. The eldeſt he promoted to be governor of Rome, the youngeſt who had hitherto ſerved as a ſoldier of fortune in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Spain or France, and whoſe diſpoſition as well as manners were ſtill more foreign from the clerical character than his profeſſion, he created a Cardinal, and appointed him legate of Bologna, the ſecond of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in power and dignity which a Pope can beſtow. Theſe marks of favour, no leſs ſudden than extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, he accompanied with the moſt unbounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and attachment, and forgetting all his former ſevere maxims, he ſeemed to have no other object than the aggrandizing of his nephews. Their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unfortunately for Paul, was too aſpiring to be ſatisfied with any moderate acquiſition. They had ſeen the family of Medici raiſed by the intereſt of the Popes of that houſe to ſupreme power in Tuſcany; Paul III. had by his abilities and addreſs ſecured the dutchies of Parma and Platentia to the family of Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe. They aimed at ſome eſtabliſhment for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, no leſs conſiderable and independant; and as they could not expect that the Pope would carry his indulgence towards them ſo far as to ſecularize any part of the patrimony of the church, they had no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of attaining what they wiſhed, but by diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Imperial dominions in Italy, in hopes of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome portion of them. This alone would have been to them a ſufficient reaſon for ſowing the ſeeds of diſcord between their uncle and the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>BUT Cardinal Caraffa, had, beſides, private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which filled him with hatred and enmity to the Emperor. While he ſerved in the Spaniſh troops he had not received ſuch marks of honour and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he thought due to his birth and merit. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with this ill-uſage, he had abruptly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Imperial ſervice, and entering into that of France; he had not only met with ſuch a reception as ſoothed his vanity, and attached him to the French intereſt, but by contracting an intimate friendſhip
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:011837_1096_0F9D893E76E8F608"/>
with Strozzi, who commanded the French army in Tuſcany, he had imbibed a mortal antipathy to the Emperor as the great enemy to the liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the Italian ſtates. Nor was the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indiſpoſed to receive impreſſions unfavourable to the Emperor. The oppoſition given to his election by the Cardinals of the Imperial faction left in his mind deep reſentment, which was heightened by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ancient injuries from Charles or his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
                  <p>OF this his nephews took advantage, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed various devices, in order to exaſperate him beyond a poſſibility of reconciliation. They aggravated every circumſtance which could be deemed any indication of the Emperor's diſſatisfaction with his promotion; they read to him an intercepted letter in which Charles taxed the Cardinals of his party with negligence or incapacity in not having defeated Paul's election: They pretended, at one time, to have diſcovered a conſpiracy formed by the Imperial miniſter and Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Medici againſt the Pope's life; they alarmed him, at another, with accounts of a plot for aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating themſelves. By theſe artifices, they kept his mind, which was naturally violent and become ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from old age, in ſuch perpetual agitation, as precipitated him into meaſures, which otherwiſe he would have been the firſt perſon to condemn<note n="o" place="bottom">Ripamontii Hiſt. Patriae, lib. iii. 1146. Ap. Graev. Theſ. vol. ii. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 615. Adriani Iſtor. i. 906.</note>. He ſeized ſome of the Cardinals who were moſt attached to the Emperor, and confined them in the caſtle of St. Angelo; he perſecuted the Colonnas and other Roman barons, the antient retainers to the Imperial faction, with the utmoſt ſeverity; and diſcovering on all occaſions his diſtruſt, fear, or hatred of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, he began at laſt to court the friendſhip of the French King, and ſeemed willing to throw himſelf abſolutely upon him for ſupport and protection.</p>
                  <p>THIS was the very point to which his nephews wiſhed to bring him as moſt favourable to their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſchemes; and as the accompliſhment of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on their uncle's life, whoſe advanced age did
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:011837_1097_0F9D893F2E2C5000"/>
not admit of loſing a moment unneceſſarily in negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, inſtead of treating at ſecond hand with the French ambaſſador at Rome, they prevailed on the Pope to diſpatch a perſon of confidence directly to the court of France, with ſuch overtures on his part as they hoped would not be rejected. He propoſed an alliance offenſive and defenſive between Henry and the Pope; that they ſhould attack the dutchy of Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany and the kingdom of Naples with their united forces; and if their arms ſhould prove ſucceſsful, that the ancient republican form of government ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed in the former, and the inveſtiture of the latter ſhould be granted to one of the French King's ſons, after reſerving a certain territory which ſhould be annexed to the patrimony of the church, together with an independent and princely eſtabliſhment for each of the Pope's nephews.</p>
                  <p>THE King, allured by theſe ſpecious projects, gave a moſt favourable audience to the envoy. But when the matter was propoſed in council, the conſtable Montmorency, whoſe natural caution and averſion to daring enterprizes increaſed with age and experience, remonſtrated with great vehemence againſt the alliance. He put Henry in mind how fatal every expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy had been to France during three ſucceſſive reigns, and if ſuch an enterprize had proved too great for the nation even when its ſtrength and finances were entire, there was no reaſon to hope for ſucceſs, if it ſhould be attempted now when both were exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by extraordinary efforts during wars, which had laſted, with little interruption, almoſt half a century. He repreſented the manifeſt imprudence of entering into engagements with a Pope of fourſcore, as any ſyſtem which reſted on no better foundation than his life muſt be extremely precarious, and upon the event of his death, which could not be diſtant, the face of things together with the inclination of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian States muſt inſtantly change, and the whole weight of the war be left upon the King alone. To theſe conſiderations he added the near proſpect which they now had of a final accommodation with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror who having taken the reſolution of retiring from
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:011837_1098_0F9D893FF103A350"/>
the world, wiſhed to tranſmit his kingdoms in peace to his ſon; and he concluded with repreſenting the abſolute certainty of drawing the arms of England up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on France, if it ſhould appear that the re-eſtabliſhment of tranquillity in Europe was prevented by the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Monarch.</p>
                  <p>THESE arguments, weighty in themſelves, and urged by a miniſter of great authority, would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have determined the King to decline any connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Pope. But the Duke of Guiſe and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cardinal of Lorrain, who delighted no leſs in hold and dangerous undertakings than Montmorency ſhunned them, declared warmly for an alliance with the Pope. The Cardinal expected to be entruſted with the conduct of the negociations in the court of Rome to which this alliance would give riſe; the duke laid his account with obtaining the command of the army which would be appointed to invade Naples; and conſidering themſelves as already in theſe ſtations, vaſt projects opened to their aſpiring and unbounded ambition. Their credit, together with the influence of the King's miſtreſs, the famous Diana of Poitiers, who was, at that time entirely devoted to the intereſt of the family of Guiſe, more than counterbalanced all Montmorency's prudent remonſtrances, and prevailed on an inconſiderate Prince to liſten to the overtures of the Pope's envoy.</p>
                  <p>THE Cardinal of Lorrain, as he had expected, was immediately ſent to Rome with full powers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the treaty, and to concert meaſures for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into execution. Meanwhile, the Pope, either from reflecting on the danger and uncertain iſſue of all military operations, or through the addreſs of the Imperial ambaſſador who had been at great pains to ſooth him, had not only begun to loſe much of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour with which he had ſet on foot the negociation with France, but even diſcovered great unwillingneſs to continue it. In order to rouſe him from this fit of deſpondency, and to rekindle his former rage, his nephews had recourſe to the arts which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready practiſed with ſo much ſucceſs. They alarmed him with new repreſentations of the Emperor's hoſtile
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:011837_1099_0F9D8940AE701790"/>
intentions, with freſh accounts which they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of threats uttered againſt him by the Imperial miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and with new diſcoveries which they pretended to have made of conſpiracies formed, and juſt ready to take effect againſt his life.</p>
                  <p>BUT theſe artifices, having been formerly tried, would not have operated a ſecond time with the ſame force, nor have made the impreſſion which they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Paul had not been excited by an offence of that kind which he was leaſt able to bear. He received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the receſs of the diet of Augſburg, and of the toleration which was thereby granted to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and this threw him at once into ſuch tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of paſſion againſt the Emperor and King of the Romans, as carried him headlong into all the violent meaſures, of his nephews. Full of high ideas with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the papal prerogative, and animated with the fierceſt zeal againſt hereſy, he conſidered the liberty of deciding concerning religious matters, which had been aſſumed by an aſſembly compoſed partly of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as a preſumptuous and unpardonable encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that juriſdiction which belonged to him alone; and regarded the indulgence which had been given to the Proteſtants as an impious act of that power which the diet had uſurped. He complained loudly of both to the Imperial ambaſſador. He inſiſted that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the diet ſhould immediately be declared illegal and void. He threatened the Emperor and King of the Romans, in caſe they ſhould either refuſe or delay to gratify him in this particular, with the ſevereſt effects of his vengeance. He talked in a tone of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and command which might have ſuited a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff of the twelfth century, when a papal decree was ſufficient to have ſhaken or to have overturned the throne of the greateſt Monarch, but which was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper in that age, eſpecially when addreſſed to the miniſter of a Prince who had ſo often made Pontiffs more formidable feel the weight of his power. The ambaſſador, however, heard all his extravagant propoſitions and menaces, with much patience, and endeavoured to ſooth him by putting him in mind of the extreme diſtreſs to which the Emperor was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:011837_1100_0F9D894172777AB8"/>
at Inſpruck, of the engagements which he had come under to the Proteſtants in order to extricate himſelf, of the neceſſity of fulfilling theſe, and of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating his conduct to the ſituation of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. But weighty as theſe conſiderations were, they made no impreſſion on the mind of the haughty and bigotted pontiff, who inſtantly replied, that he would abſolve him by his apoſtolick authority from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of theſe engagements, and even command him not to perform them; that in carrying on the cauſe of God and of the church, no regard ought to be had to the maxims of wordly prudence and policy, and that the ill ſucceſs of the Emperor's ſchemes in Germany might juſtly be deemed a mark of the divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt him, on account of his having paid little attention to the former, while he regulated his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct entirely by the latter. Having ſaid this, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ambaſſador abruptly without waiting for a reply.</p>
                  <p>HIS nephews took care to applaud and cheriſh theſe ſentiments, and eaſily wrought up his arrogant mind, fraught with all the monkiſh ideas concerning the extent of the papal ſupremacy, to ſuch a pitch of reſentment againſt the houſe of Auſtria, and to ſuch an high opinion of his own power, that he talked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually of his being the ſucceſſor of thoſe who had depoſed Kings and Emperors; that he was exalted as head over them all, and would trample ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him under his feet. In this diſpoſition, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Lorrain found the Pope, and eaſily perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſign a treaty, which had for its object, the ruin of a Prince againſt whom he was ſo highly exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated. The ſtipulations in the treaty were much the ſame as had been propoſed by the Pope's envoy at Paris; and it was agreed to keep the whole tranſaction ſecret until their united forces ſhould be ready to take the field <note n="p" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. 13. p. 163. F. Paul 365. Thuan lib. xv. 525. lib. xvi. 540. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 609, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>DURING the negociation of this treaty at Rome and Paris, an event happened which ſeemed to render the fears which had given riſe to it vain, and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:011837_1101_0F9D8942D585A0D8"/>
which were to follow upon it unneceſſary. This was the Emperor's reſignation of his hereditary domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to his ſon Philip; together with his reſolution to withdraw entirely from any concern in buſineſs or the affairs of this world, in order that he might ſpend the remainder of his days in retirement and ſolitude. Though it requires neither deep reflection nor extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſcernment to diſcover that the ſtate of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty is not exempt from cares and diſappointment; though moſt of thoſe who are exalted to a throne find ſolicitude, and ſatiety, and diſguſt to be their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attendants in that envied pre-eminence; yet, to deſcend voluntarily from the ſupreme to a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtation, and to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in order to attain the enjoyment of happineſs, ſeems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several inſtances, indeed, occur in hiſtory of Monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak Princes who took this reſolution raſhly, and repented of it as ſoon as it was taken; or unfortunate Princes from whoſe hands ſome ſtrong rival had wreſted their ſceptre, and compelled them to deſcend with reluctance into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtation. Diocleſian is perhaps the only Prince capable of holding the reins of government, who ever reſigned them from deliberate choice, and who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued during many years to enjoy the tranquillity of retirement without fetching one penitent ſigh, or caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back one look of deſire, towards the power or dignity which he had abandoned.</p>
                  <p>NO wonder, then, that Charles's reſignation ſhould fill all Europe with aſtoniſhment, and give riſe, both among his contemporaries, and among the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians of that period, to various conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the motives, which determined a Prince, whoſe ruling paſſion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-ſix, when objects of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion operate with full force on the mind, and are purſued with the greateſt ardour, to take a reſolution ſo ſingular and unexpected. But while many authors have imputed it to motives ſo frivolous and fantaſtical, as can hardly be ſuppoſed to influence any reaſonable
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:011837_1102_0F9D8942EE5680C8"/>
mind; while others have imagined it to be the reſult of ſome profound ſcheme of policy; hiſtorians more inteligent, and better informed, neither aſcribe it to caprice, nor ſearch for myſterious ſecrets of ſtate, where ſimple and obvious cauſes will fully account for the Emperor's conduct. Charles had been attacked early in life with the gout, and notwithſtanding all the precautions of the moſt ſkilful phyſicians in his time, the violence of the diſtemper encreaſed as he advanced in age, and the fits became every year more frequent, as well as more intolerable. Not only was the vigour of his conſtitution broken, but the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his mind were impared by the excruciating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he endured. During the continuance of the fits, he was altogether incapable of applying to buſineſs, and even when they began to abate, as it was only at intervals that he could attend to what was ſerious, he gave up the greateſt part of his time to trifling and even childiſh occupations, which ſerved to relieve or to amuſe his mind, enfeebled and worn out with exceſs of pain. Under theſe circumſtances, the conduct of ſuch affairs as occurred, of courſe, in governing ſo many kingdoms was a burden more than ſufficient; but to puſh forward and compleat the vaſt ſchemes, which the ambition of his more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive years had formed, or to keep in view and carry on the ſame great ſyſtem of policy, extending to every nation in Europe, and connected with the operations of every different court, were taſks, which far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtrength, and oppreſſed and overwhelmed his mind. As he had been long accuſtomed to view the buſineſs of every department, whether civil, or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, or eccleſiaſtical, with his own eyes, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide concerning it according to his own ideas; it gave him the utmoſt pain, when he felt his infirmities encreaſe ſo faſt upon him, that he was obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the conduct of all affairs to his miniſters. He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted every misfortune which befel him, and every miſcarriage that happened, even when the former was unavoidable, and the latter accidental, to his inability to take the inſpection of buſineſs himſelf. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of his hard fortune, in being oppoſed, in his
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:011837_1103_0F9D8943B5B3FC60"/>
declining years, to a rival, who was in the full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of life, and that while Henry could take and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all his reſolutions in perſon, he ſhould now be reduced, both in council and in action, to rely on the abilities of other men. Having thus grown old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, he wiſely judged it more decent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his infirmities in ſome ſolitude, than to expoſe them any longer to the publick eye; and prudently determined not to forfeit the fame, or loſe the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of his better years, by ſtruggling, with a vain obſtinacy, to retain the reins of government, when he was no longer able to hold them with ſteadineſs, or to guide them with addreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">Dom Leveſque in his memoirs of cardinal Granvelle gives a reaſon for the Emperor's reſignation, which, as I recollect, is not mentioned by any other hiſtorian. He ſays, that the Emperor having ceded the government of the kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan to his ſon, upon his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Queen of England; Philip, notwithſtanding the advice and entreaties of his father, removed all the miniſters and officers in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and appointed creatures of his own, to fill the places which they held. That he aſpired openly, and with little delicacy, to obtain a ſhare in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of affairs, in the Low-Countries. That he endeavoured to thwart the Emperor's meaſures, and to limit his authority, behaving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him ſometimes with inattention, and ſometimes with haughtineſs. That Charles finding that he muſt either yield to his ſon, or openly contend with him, in order to avoid theſe, which were both diſagreeable and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to a father, he took the reſolution of reſigning his crowns, and of retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the world, vol. i. p. 24, &amp;c. Dom Leveſque derived his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning theſe curious facts, which he relates very briefly, from the original papers of cardinal Granvelle. But as that vaſt collection of papers, one of the moſt valuable hiſtorical monuments of the ſixteenth century, and which could not fail of throwing much light on the tranſactions of Charles V. though preſerved and arranged by M. L'Abbé Boizot of Beſancon, is not publiſhed, I cannot determine what degree of credit ſhould be given to this account of Charles's reſignation. I have therefore taken no notice of it in relating this event.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT though Charles had revolved this ſcheme in mind for ſeveral years, and had communicated it to his ſiſters the dowager Queens of France and Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who not only approved of his intention, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to accompany him to whatever place of retreat he ſhould chooſe; ſeveral things had hitherto prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his carrying it into execution. He could not think of loading his ſon with the government of ſo many kingdoms, until he ſhould attain ſuch maturity of age, and of abilities, as would enable him to ſuſtain that weighty burden; but as Philip had now reached his twenty-eighth year, and had been early accuſtomed
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:011837_1104_0F9D894472F4BD20"/>
to buſineſs, for which he diſcovered both inclination and capacity, it can hardly be imputed to the partiality of paternal affection, that his ſcruples with regard to this point, were entirely removed; and that he thought he might, without further heſitation or delay, place him on the throne which he was about to abandon. His mother's ſituation had been another obſtruction in his way. For although ſhe had continued almoſt fifty years in confinement, and under the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of mind which concern for her huſband's death had brought upon her, yet the government of Spain, was ſtill veſted in her jointly with the Emperor; her name was inſerted together with his, in all the public writs iſſued in that kingdom; and ſuch was the fond attachment of the Spaniards to her, that they would probably have ſcrupled to recognize Philip as their ſovereign, unleſs ſhe had conſented to aſſume him as her partner on the throne. Her utter incapacity for buſineſs rendered it impoſſible to obtain this. But her death, which happened this year, removed this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; and as Charles, upon that event, became ſole Monarch of Spain, it left the ſucceſſion open to his ſon. The war with France had likewiſe been a reaſon for retaining the adminiſtration of affairs in his own hand, as he was extremely ſolicitous to have terminated it, that he might have given up his kingdoms to his ſon in peace with all the world. But as Henry had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no diſpoſition to cloſe with any of his overtures, and had even rejected propoſals of peace, which were equal and moderate, in a tone, that ſeemed to indicate a fixed purpoſe of continuing hoſtilities, he ſaw that it was vain to wait longer in expectation of an event, which, how deſirable ſoever, was altogether uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>AS this, then, appeared to be the proper juncture for executing the ſcheme which he had long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, Charles reſolved to reſign his kingdoms to his ſon, with a ſolemnity, ſuitable to the importance of the tranſaction, and to perform this laſt act of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, with ſuch formal pomp, as might leave a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſion on the minds not only of his ſubjects but of his ſucceſſor. With this view he called Philip
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:011837_1105_0F9D894537247C50"/>
out of England, where the peeviſh temper of his Queen, which increaſed with her deſpair of having iſſue, renderd him extremely unhappy, and the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Engliſh left him no hopes of obtaining the direction of their affairs. Having aſſembled the ſtates of the Low-Countries at Bruſſels, on the twenty-fifth of October, he ſeated himſelf, for the laſt time, in the chair of ſtate, on one ſide of which was placed his ſon, and on the other his ſiſter the Queen of Hungary regent of the Netherlands, with a ſplendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and princes of the Empire ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him. The preſident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained in a few words his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the States. He then read the inſtrument of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which Charles ſurrendered to his ſon Philip all his territories, juriſdiction, and authority in the Low-Countries, abſolving his ſubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Philip his lawful heir, and to ſerve him with the ſame loyalty and zeal that they had manifeſted, during ſo long a courſe of years, in ſupport of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES then roſe from his ſeat, and leaning on the ſhoulder of the Prince of Orange, becauſe he was unable to ſtand without ſupport, he addreſſed himſelf to the audience, and from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to aſſiſt his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without oſtentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed ſince the commencement of his adminiſtration. He obſerved, that from the ſeventeenth year of his age, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated all his thoughts and attention to publick ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, reſerving no portion of his time for the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his eaſe, and very little for the enjoyment of private pleaſure; that either in a pacifick or hoſtile manner, he had viſited Germany nine times, Spain ſix times, France four times, Italy ſeven times, the Low-Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by ſea; that while his health permitted him to diſcharge his duty, and the vigour of his conſtitution was equal, in any
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:011837_1106_0F9D8945EF8D04F8"/>
degree, to the arduous office of governing ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive dominions, he had never ſhunned labour, nor repined under fatigue; that now when his health was broken, and his vigour exhauſted by the rage of an incurable diſtemper, his growing infirmities admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him to retire, nor was he ſo fond of reigning, as to retain the ſceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his ſubjects, or to render them happy; that inſtead of a ſovereign worn out with diſeaſes, and ſcarce half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accuſtomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſagacity of maturer years; that, if during the courſe of a long adminiſtration, he had committed any material error in government, or if under the preſſure and amidſt the attention which he had been obliged to give ſo many and great affairs, he had either neglected or injured any of his ſubjects, he now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored their forgiveneſs; that for his part; he ſhould ever retain a grateful ſenſe of their fidelity and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and would carry the remembrance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his ſweeteſt conſolation, as well as the beſt reward for all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and in his laſt prayers to Almighty God would pour forth his ardent wiſhes for their welfare.</p>
                  <p>THEN turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and kiſſed his father's hand, "If, ſays he, I had left you by my death this rich inheritance, to which I have made ſuch large additions, ſome regard would have been juſtly due to my memory on that account; but now when I voluntarily reſign to you what I might have ſtill retained, I may well expect the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſſions of thanks on your part. With theſe, however, I diſpenſe, and ſhall conſider your concern for the welfare of your ſubjects, and your love of them, as the beſt and moſt acceptable teſtimony of your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to me. It is in your power, by a wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous adminiſtration, to juſtify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my paternal affection, and to demonſtrate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repoſe in you. Preſerve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholick faith in its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:011837_1107_0F9D8946AE799D10"/>
let the laws of your country be ſacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and if the time ſhall ever come, when you ſhall wiſh to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a ſon endowed with ſuch qualities, that you can reſign your ſceptre to him, with as much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as I give up mine to you."</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as Charles had finiſhed his long addreſs to his ſubjects and to their new ſovereign, he ſunk into the chair, exhauſted and ready to faint with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of ſuch an extraordinary effort. During his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the whole audience melted into tears, ſome from admiration of his magnanimity, others ſoftened by the expreſſions of tenderneſs towards his ſon, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepeſt ſorrow at loſing a ſovereign, who had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Netherlands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</p>
                  <p>PHILIP then aroſe from his knees, and after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks to his father, with a low and ſubmiſſive voice, for the royal gift which his unexampled boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had beſtowed upon him, he addreſſed the aſſembly of the ſtates, and regretting his inability to ſpeak the Flemiſh language with ſuch facility as to expreſs what he felt on this intereſting occaſion, as well as what he owed to his good ſubjects in the Netherlands, he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they would allow Granvelle biſhop of Arras, to deliver what he had given him in charge to ſpeak in his name. Granvelle, in a long diſcourſe, expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on the zeal with which Philip was animated for the good of his ſubjects, on his reſolution to devote all his time and talents to the promoting of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and on his intention to imitate his father's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in diſtinguiſhing the Netherlands with peculiar marks of his regard. Maës, a lawyer of great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, replied, in name of the States, with large profeſſions of their fidelity and affection to their new ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>THEN Mary, Queen-dowager of Hungary, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the regency, with which ſhe had been entruſted by her brother during the ſpace of twenty-five years. Next day Philip, in preſence of the States, took the
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:011837_1108_0F9D89477583CC70"/>
uſual oaths to maintain the rights and privileges of his ſubjects; and all the members, in their own name, and in that of their conſtituents, ſwore allegiance to him <note n="q" place="bottom">Godleveus Relatio Abdicationis Car.

                  <p>A FEW weeks thereafter, Charles, in an aſſembly no leſs ſplendid, and with a ceremony equally pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous, reſigned to his ſon the crowns of Spain, with all their territories depending on them, both in the old and in the new world. Of all theſe vaſt poſſeſſions, he reſerved nothing for himſelf but an annual penſion of an hundred thouſand crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a ſmall ſum for acts of beneficence and charity <note n="r" place="bottom">The Emperor's reſignation is an event not only of ſuch importance, but of ſuch a nature, that the preciſe date of it, one would expect, ſhould have been aſcertained by hiſtorians with the greateſt accuracy. There is, however, an amazing and unaccountable diverſity among them with regard to this point. All agree that the deed by which Charles transferred to his ſon his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in the Netherlands, bears date at Bruſſels the 25th of October. Sandoval fixes on the 23th of October as the day on which the ceremony of reſignation happened, and he was preſent at the tranſaction, vol. ii. p. 592. Godleveus who publiſhed a treatiſe de Abdicatione Caroli V. fixes the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ceremony as well as the date of the inſtrument of reſignation on the 25th. Peré Barre, I know not on what authority, fixes it on the 24th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Hiſt. D'Alem. viii. 976. Herrera agrees with Godleveus in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tom i. 155, as likewiſe does Pallavicini, whoſe authority with reſpect to dates, and every thing where a minute accuracy is requiſite, is of great weight. Hiſt. lib. xvi. p. 168. Hiſtorians differ no leſs with regard to the day on which Charles reſigned the crown of Spain to his ſon. According to M. de Thou, it was a month after his having reſigned his dominions in the Netherlands, i. e. about the 25th of November, Thuan. lib. 16 p. 571. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Sandoval it was on the 16th of January 1556, Sand. ii. 603. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio di Vera agrees with him, Epitome del Vida del Car. V. p. 110. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Pallavicini it was on the 17th. Pal. lib. xvi. p. 168. and with him Herrera agrees. Vida del D. Felipe, tom. i. p 233. But Ferreras fixes it on the firſt day of January. Hiſt. Gener. tom. ix. p. 371. M. de Beaucaire ſuppoſes the reſignation of the crown of Spain to have been executes, a few days after the reſignation of the Netherlands, Com. de Reb. Gall p. 879. It is remarkable that in the treaty of truce, at Vaucelles, though Charles had made over all his dominions to his ſon ſome weeks previous to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, all the ſtipulations are in the Emperor's name, and Philip is only deſigned King of England and Naples. It is certain Philip was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of Caſtile, &amp;c. at Valladolid ſooner than the 24th of March. Sandov. ii. p. 606, and previous to that ceremony, he did not chuſe, it would ſeem, to aſſume the title of King of any of his Spaniſh Kingdoms, or to perform any acts of royal juriſdiction. In a deed annexed to the treaty of truce, dated April 19th, he aſſumes the title of King of Caſtile, &amp;c. in the uſual ſtile of the Spaniſh monarchs in that age. Corps Dipl. tom. iv.

But his phyſicians remonſtrated ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his venturing to ſea at that cold and boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeaſon of the year, that he conſented, though with reluctance, to put off his voyage for ſome months.</p>
                  <p>BY yielding to their intreaties, he had the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before he left the Low-Countries, of taking a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſtep towards a peace with France, which he ardently wiſhed for, not only on his ſon's account, but that he might have the merit, when quitting the world, of re-eſtabliſhing that tranquillity in Europe, which he had baniſhed out of it almoſt from the time that he aſſumed the adminiſtration of affairs. Some time previous to his reſignation, commiſſioners had been appointed by him and by the French King, in order to treat of an exchange of priſoners. In their conferences at the abbey of Vaucelles, near Cambray, an expedient was accidentally propoſed for terminating hoſtilities betwixt the contending monarchs, by a long truce, during the ſubſiſtence of which, and without diſcuſſing their reſpective claims, each ſhould retain what was in his poſſeſſion. Charles, ſenſible how much his kingdoms were exhauſted by the expenſive and almoſt continual wars in which his ambition had engaged him, and eager to gain for his ſon a ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of peace, that he might eſtabliſh himſelf firmly on his throne, declared warmly for cloſing with the overture, though manifeſtly diſhonourable as well as diſadvantageous; and ſuch was the reſpect due to his wiſdom and experience, that Philip, notwithſtanding his unwillingneſs to purchaſe peace by ſuch conceſſions, did not preſume to urge his opinion in oppoſition to that of his father.</p>
                  <p>HENRY could not have heſitated one moment about giving his conſent to a truce or. ſuch conditions, as
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:011837_1110_0F9D8948F1480B08"/>
would leave him in quiet poſſeſſion of the greater part of the Duke of Savoy's dominions, together with the important conqueſt which he had made on the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frontier. But it was no eaſy matter to reconcile ſuch a ſtep with the engagements that he had come under to the Pope, in his late treaty with him. The Conſtable Montmorency, however, repreſented in ſuch a ſtriking light, the imprudence of ſacrificing the true inrereſts of his kingdom to theſe raſh obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and took ſuch advantage of the abſence of the Cardinal of Lorraine, who had ſeduced the King into his alliance with the Caraffas, that Henry, naturally fluctuating and unſteady, and apt to be influenced by the advice laſt given him, authorized his ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to ſign a treaty of truce with the Emperor for five years, on the terms which had been propoſed. But that he might not ſeem to have altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his ally the Pope, who he foreſaw would be highly exaſperated, he, in order to ſooth him, took care that he ſhould be expreſly included in the truce <note n="s" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 626.

                  <p>THE Count of Lalain repaired to Blois, and the Admiral Coligny to Bruſſels, the former to be preſent when the King of France, and the latter when the Emperor and his ſon, ratified the treaty and bound themſelves by oath to obſerve it <note n="t" place="bottom">One of Admiral Coligny's attendants, who wrote to the court of France an account of what happened while they reſided at Bruſſels, takes notice, as an inſtance of Philip's impoliteneſs, that he received the French ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in an apartment hung with tapeſtry, which repreſented the battle of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, the manner in which Francis I. was taken priſoner, his voyage to Spain, with all the circumſtances of his captivity and impriſonment at Madrid. Mem. de Ribier, ii. 634.</note>. When an account of the conferences at Vaucelles, and of the conditions of truce which had been propoſed there, were firſt carried to Rome, it gave the Pope no manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. He truſted ſo much to the honour of the French monarch, that he would not allow himſelf to think that Henry could forget ſo ſoon, or violate ſo ſhamefully, all the ſtipulations in his league with him. He had ſuch an high opinion of the Emperor's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he made do doubt of his refuſing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a truce on ſuch unequal terms; and on both
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:011837_1111_0F9D8949B11A7AF8"/>
theſe accounts he confidently pronounced that this like many preceding negociations, would terminate in nothing. But later and more certain intelligence ſoon convinced him that in political affairs no reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more fallacious, than, becauſe an event is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, to conclude that it will not happen. The ſudden and unexpected concluſion of the truce filled Paul with aſtoniſhment and terror. The Cardinal of Lorrain durſt not encounter that ſtorm of indignation, to which he knew he ſhould be expoſed from the haughty Pontiff, who had ſo good reaſon to be incenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but departing abruptly from Rome, he left to the Cardinal Tournon the difficult taſk of attempting to ſooth Paul and his nephews. They were fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the perilous ſituation in which they now ſtood. By their engagements with France, which were no longer ſecret, they had highly irritated Philip. They dreaded the violence of his implacable temper. The Duke of Alva, a miniſter, fitted as well by his abilities as by the ſeverity of his nature, for executing all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip's rigorous ſchemes, had advanced from Milan to Naples, and began to aſſemble troops on the frontiers of the Eccleſiaſtical State. While they, if deſerted by France, muſt not only relinquiſh all the hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and ſovereignty to which their ambition aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, but remain expoſed to the reſentment of the Spaniſh monarch, without one ally to protect them againſt an enemy with whom they were ſo little able to contend.</p>
                  <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, Paul had recourſe to the arts of negociation and intrigue, of which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal court knows well how to avail itſelf in order to ward off any calamity threatened by an enemy ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in power. He affected to approve highly of the truce, as an happy expedient for putting a ſtop to the effuſion of Chriſtian blood. He expreſſed his warmeſt wiſhes that it might prove the forerunner of a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peace. He exhorted the rival Princes to embrace this favourable opportunity of ſetting on foot a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation for that purpoſe, and offered, as their common father, to be mediator between them. Under this pretext, he appointed Cardinal Rebiba his nuncio to
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:011837_1112_0F9D894A70CD8BA8"/>
the court of Bruſſels, and his nephew Cardinal Caraffa to that of Paris. The publick inſtructions given to both were the ſame; that they ſhould uſe their utmoſt endeavours to prevail with the two monarchs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Pope's mediation, that by means of it, peace might be re-eſtabliſhed, and meaſures might be taken for aſſembling a general council. But under this ſpecious appearance of zeal for attaining objects ſo deſirable in themſelves, and ſo becoming his ſacred character to purſue, Paul concealed very different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, Caraffa, beſides his publick inſtructions, received a private commiſſion to ſolicit the French King to renounce the treaty of truce, and to renew his engagements with the Holy See, and he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to ſpare neither entreatries, nor promiſes, nor bribes, in order to gain that point. This both the uncle and the nephew conſidered as the real end of the embaſſy; while the other ſerved to amuſe the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or to deceive the Emperor and his ſon. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, accordingly, ſet out inſtantly for Paris, and travelled with the greateſt expedition, while Rebiba was detained ſome weeks at Rome; and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary for him to begin his journey, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſecret orders to protract it as much as poſſible, that the iſſue of Caraffa's negociation might be known before he ſhould reach Bruſſels, and according to that, proper directions might be given to him with regard to the tone which he ſhould aſſume, in treating with the Emperor and his ſon <note n="u" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. xiii. p. 169. Burnet Hiſt. of Reform. ii. App. 309.</note>.</p>
                  <p>CARAFFA made his entry into Paris with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pomp; and having preſented a conſecrated ſword to Henry as the protector, on whoſe aid the Pope relied in the preſent exigency, he beſought him not to diſregard the entreaties of a parent in diſtreſs, but to employ that weapon which he gave him in his defence. This he repreſented not only as a duty of filial piety, but as an act of juſtice. As the Pope, from confidence in the aſſiſtance and ſupport which his late treaty with France entitled him to expect, had taken ſuch ſteps as had irritated the King of Spain, he
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:011837_1113_0F9D894B2EA78310"/>
conjured Henry not to ſuffer Paul and his family to be cruſhed under the weight of that reſentment which they had drawn on themſelves merely by their attachment to France. Together with this argument addreſſed to his generoſity, he employed another which he hoped would work on his ambition. He affirmed that now was the time; when, with the moſt certain proſpect of ſucceſs; he might attack Philip's dominions in Italy; that the flower of the veteran Spaniſh bands had periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the wars of Hungary, Germany, and the Low-Countries; that the Emperor had left his ſon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted treaſury, and kingdoms drained of men; that he had no longer to contend with the abilities, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and good fortune of Charles, but with a monarch ſcarce ſeated on his throne, unpractiſed in command, odious to many of the Italian ſtates, and dreaded by all; that the Pope, who had already levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoldiers, would bring a conſiderable army into the field, which, when joined by a ſufficient number of French troops, might by one briſk and ſudden effort, drive the Spaniards out of Naples, and add to the crown of France a kingdom, the conqueſt of which had been the great object of all his predeceſſors during half a century, and the chief motive of all their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions into Italy.</p>
                  <p>EVERY word Caraffa ſpoke, made a deep impreſſion on Henry; conſcious, on the one hand, that the Pope had juſt cauſe to reproach him with not having conſulted the laws either of generoſity or of decency, when he renounced his league with him, and had agreed to the truce of Vaucelles; and eager on the other hand, not only to diſtinguiſh his reign by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which three former monarchs had attempted without ſucceſs, but likewiſe to acquire an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch dignity and value for one of his ſons. Reverence, however for the oath, by which he had ſo lately confirmed the truce of Vaucelles; the extreme old age of the Pope, whoſe death might occaſion an intire revolution in the political ſyſtem of Italy; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the repreſentations of Montmorency, who repeated all the arguments that he had uſed againſt the firſt league with Paul, and pointed out the great
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:011837_1114_0F9D894BEFFDFED8"/>
and immediate advantages which France derived from the truce; kept Henry for ſome time in ſuſpenſe, and might poſſibly have outweighed all Caraffa's arguments. But the Cardinal was not ſuch a novice in the arts of intrigue and negociation, as not to have expedients ready for removing or ſurmounting all theſe obſtacles. To obviate the King's ſcruple with regard to his oath, he produced powers from the Pope to abſolve him from the obligation of it. By way of ſecurity againſt any danger which he might apprehend from the Pope's death, he engaged that his uncle would make ſuch a nomination of Cardinals, as ſhould give Henry the abſolute command of the next election, and enable him to place in the Papal chair a perſon entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his intereſt.</p>
                  <p>IN order to counterbalance the effect of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's opinion and influence, he employed not only the active talents of the Duke of Guiſe, and the eloquence of his brother the Cardinal of Lorrain, but the addreſs of the Queen, aided by the more powerful arts of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of Poitiers, who, unfortunately for France, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated with Catharine in this point, though ſhe took pleaſure, on almoſt every other occaſion, to thwart and mortify her. They, by their united ſolicitations, eaſily ſwayed the King, who leaned of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to that ſide, towards which they wiſhed him to encline. All Montmorency's prudent remonſtrances were diſregarded; the nuncio abſolved Henry from his oath; and he ſigned a new league with the Pope, which rekindled the flames of war both in Italy and in the Low-Countries.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as Paul was informed by his nephew that there was a fair proſpect of his ſucceeding in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, he diſpatched a meſſenger after the nuncio Rebiba, with orders to return to Rome, without proceeding to Bruſſels. As it was now no longer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve that tone of moderation, which ſuited the character of a mediator, and which he had affected to aſſume, or to put any farther reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his reſentment againſt Philip, he boldly threw off the maſk, and took ſuch violent ſteps as rendered a rupture unavoidable. He ſeized and impriſoned the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:011837_1115_0F9D894CB1921BF8"/>
Spaniſh envoy at his court. He excommunicated the Collonna's; and having deprived Mark Antonio, the head of that family, of the dukedom of Paliana, he granted that dignity, together with the territory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, to his nephew the Count of Montorio. He ordered a legal information to be preſented in the conſiſtory of Cardinals againſt Philip, ſetting forth that he, notwithſtanding the fidelity and allegiance due by him to the Holy See, of which he held the crown of Naples, had not only afforded a retreat in his dominions to the Collonna's, whom the Pope had excommunicated and declared rebels, but had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with arms, and was ready, in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, to invade the Eccleſiaſtical State in an hoſtile manner; that ſuch conduct in a vaſſal was to be deemed treaſon againſt his liege lord, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which was the forfeiture of his fief. Upon this the conſiſtoral advocate requeſted the Pope to take cognizance of the cauſe, and to appoint a day for hearing of it, when he would make good every arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the charge, and expect from his juſtice that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which the heinouſneſs of Philip's crimes merited. Paul, whoſe pride was highly flattered with the idea of trying and paſſing judgment on ſo great a King, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his requeſt; and as if it had been no leſs eaſy to execute than to pronounce ſentence, declared that he would conſult with the Cardinals concerning the formalities requiſite in conducting the trial <note n="x" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. xiii. 171.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT while Paul allowed his pride and reſentment to drive him on with ſuch headlong impetuoſity, Philip diſcovered an amazing moderation on his part. He had been taught by the Spaniſh eccleſiaſticks who had the charge of his education, a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Holy See. This ſentiment, which had been early infuſed, grew up with him as he advanced in years, and took full poſſeſſion of his mind, which was naturally thoughtful, ſerious, and prone to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. When he foreſaw a rupture with the Pope approaching, he had ſuch violent ſcruples with reſpect to the lawfulneſs of taking arms againſt the Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:011837_1116_0F9D894D6E08DDC8"/>
of Chriſt, and the common father of all Chriſtians, that he conſulted ſome Spaniſh divines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point. Though they, with the uſual dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of caſuiſts in accommodating their reſponſes to the circumſtances of thoſe who apply to them for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſured him that, after employing prayers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances in order to bring the Pope to reaſon, he had full right, both by the laws of nature and of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, not only to defend himſelf when attacked, but to begin hoſtilities, if that were judged the moſt proper expedient, for preventing the effects of Paul's violence and injuſtice. Yet Philip ſtill deliberated and delayed, conſidering it as a moſt cruel misfortune, that his adminiſtration ſhould open with an attack on a perſon, whoſe ſacred function and character he ſo highly reſpected <note n="y" place="bottom">Ferrer. Hiſt. de Eſpagne ix. 373. Herrera, i. 308.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AT laſt the Duke of Alva, who, in compliance with his maſter's ſcruples, had continued to negociate long after he ſhould have begun to act, finding Paul inexorable, and that every overture of peace, and every appearance of heſitation on his part encreaſed the Pontiff's natural arrogance, took the field and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eccleſiaſtical territories. His army did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed twelve thouſand men, but it was compoſed of veteran ſoldiers, and commanded chiefly by thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man barons, whom Paul's violence had driven into exile. The valour of the troops, and the animoſity of their leaders who fought in their own quarrel, and to recover their own eſtates, ſupplied the want of numbers. As none of the French forces were yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, Alva ſoon became maſter of the Compagna Romana; ſome cities being ſurrendered through the cowardice of the garriſons, which conſiſted of raw ſoldiers, ill diſciplined, and worſe commanded; the gates of others being opened by the inhabitants, who were eager to receive back their ancient maſters. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, that he might not be taxed with impiety in ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patrimony of the church, took poſſeſſion of the towns which capitulated, in the name of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of cardinals, to which, or to the Pope that ſhould
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:011837_1117_0F9D894E31CB44C8"/>
be choſen to ſucceed Paul, he declared that he would immediately reſtore them.</p>
                  <p>THE rapid progreſs of the Spaniards, whoſe light troops made inroads to the gates of Rome, filled that city with conſternation; and Paul, though inflexible and undaunted himſelf, was obliged to give way ſo far to the fears and ſolicitations of the Cardinals, as to ſend deputies to Alva in order to propoſe a ceſſation of arms. The Pope yielded the more readily, as he was ſenſible of a double advantage which might be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from obtaining that point. It would deliver the inhabitants of Rome from their preſent terror, and would afford time for the arrival of the ſuccours which he expected from France. Nor was Alva un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to cloſe with the overture, both as he knew how deſirous his maſter was to terminate a war, which he had undertaken with reluctance, and as his army was ſo much weakened by garriſoning the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of towns which he had reduced, that it was ſcarce in a condition to keep the field without freſh recruits, A truce was accordingly concluded firſt for ten, and afterwards for forty days, during which various ſchemes of peace was propoſed, and perpetual nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations were carried on, but with no ſincerity on the part of the Pope. The return of his nephew the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to Rome, the receipt of a conſiderable ſum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the King of France, the arrival of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of French troops, together with the expectation of others which had begun their march, rendered him more arrogant than ever, and baniſhed all thoughts from his mind, but thoſe of war and revenge <note n="z" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. xiii. 177.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK XII.</head>
                  <p>WHILE theſe operations or intrigues kept the Pope and Philip buſy and attentive, the Emperor diſentangled himſelf finally from all the affairs of this world, and ſet out for the place of his retreat. He had hitherto retained the Imperial dignity not from any unwillingneſs to relinquiſh it, for after having reſigned the real and extenſive authority that he enjoyed in his hereditary dominions, to part with the limited and often ideal juriſdiction, which belongs to an elective crown, was no great ſacrifice. His ſole motive for delay was to gain a few months, for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one trial more, in order to accompliſh his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſcheme in behalf of his ſon. At the very time Charles ſeemed to be moſt ſenſible of the vanity of worldly grandeur, and when he appeared to be quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it not only with indifference, but with contempt, the vaſt ſchemes of ambition, which had ſo long oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied and engroſſed his mind, ſtill kept poſſeſſion of it. He could not think of leaving his ſon, among the Princes of Europe, in a rank inferior to that which he himſelf had held. As he had, ſome years before, made a fruitleſs attempt to ſecure the Imperial crown to Philip, that by uniting it to the kingdoms of Spain,
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:011837_1119_0F9D894FB1F65438"/>
and the dominions of the houſe of Burgundy, he might put it in his power to proſecute, with a better proſpect of ſucceſs, thoſe great plans, which his own infirmities had obliged him to abandon, he was ſtill unwilling to relinquiſh this flattering project as chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical or unattainable.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the repulſe which he had formerly met with from his brother Ferdinand, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his ſolicitations with freſh importunity, and during the ſummer, had tried every art, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every argument, which he thought could induce him to quit the Imperial throne to Philip, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the inveſtiture of ſome province, either in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in the Low-Countries, as an equivalent <note n="a" place="bottom">Ambaſſades des No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>illes, tom. v. 356.</note>. But Ferdinand, who was ſo firm and inflexible with regard to this point, that he had paid no regard to the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Emperor, even when they were enforced with all the weight of authority, which accompanies ſupreme power, received the overture, that now came from him in the ſituation to which he had deſcended, with greater indifference, and would not deign to liſten to it. Charles, aſhamed of his own credulity in having imagined that he might accompliſh that now, which he had attempted formerly without ſucceſs, deſiſted finally from his ſcheme. He then reſigned the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empire, and having transferred all his claims of obedience and allegiance from the Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick body, to his brother the King of the Romans, he executed a deed to that effect, with all the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, requiſite in ſuch an important tranſaction. The inſtrument of reſignation he committed to William Prince of Orange, and impowered him to lay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the college of electors <note n="b" place="bottom">Goldaſt. Conſtit. Imper. pars i. 576.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTHING now remained to detain Charles from that retreat for which he languiſhed. Every thing having been prepared ſome time for his voyage, he ſet out for Zuitburg in Zealand, where the fleet had orders to rendezvous. In his way thither he paſſed through Ghent, and after ſtopping there a few days, to indulge that tender and pleaſant melancholy, which
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:011837_1120_0F9D89506E771C70"/>
ariſes in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on viſiting the place of his nativity, and viewing the ſcenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he purſued his journey accompanied by his ſon Philip, his daughter the archdutcheſs, his ſiſters the dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his ſon-in-law, and a numerous retinue of the Flemiſh nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Before he went on board, he diſmiſſed them, with marks of his attention or regard, and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderneſs of a father who embraced his ſon for the laſt time, he ſet ſail on the ſeventeenth of September under the convoy of a large fleet of Spaniſh, Flemiſh and Engliſh ſhips, He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined a preſſing invitation, from the Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to land in ſome part of her dominions, in order to refreſh himſelf, and that ſhe might have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſeeing him once more. It cannot ſurely, ſaid he, be agreeable to a Queen to receive a viſit from a father-in-law, who is now nothing more than a private gentleman.</p>
                  <p>HIS voyage was proſperous and agreeable, and he arrived at Laredo in Biſcay on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As ſoon as he landed, he fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground; and conſidering himſelf now as dead to the world, he kiſſed the earth and ſaid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind." From Laredo he purſued his journey to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos, carried by his attendants ſometimes in a chair, and ſometimes in a horſe litter, ſuffering exquiſite pain at every ſtep, and advancing with the greateſt difficulty. Some of the Spaniſh nobility repaired to Burgos in order to pay court to him, but they were ſo few in number, and their attendance was ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that Charles obſerved it, and felt, for the firſt time, that he was no longer a Monarch. Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his early youth to the dutiful and officious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with which thoſe who poſſeſs ſovereign power are attended, he had received it with the credulity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Princes, and was weak enough to be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he now diſcovered, that he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to his fortune, for much of that obſequious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,

which he had fondly thought was paid to his perſonal qualities. But though he might have ſoon learned to forget the levity of his ſubjects, or to have deſpiſed their neglect, he was more deeply afflicted with his ſon's ingratitude, who, forgetting already how much he owed to his father's bounty, obliged him to remain ſome weeks at Burgos, before he paid him the firſt moiety of that ſmall penſion, which was all that he had reſerved of ſo many kingdoms. As with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſum, Charles could not diſmiſs his domeſticks with ſuch rewards as their ſervices merited, or his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity had deſtined for them, he could not help ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing both ſurpriſe and diſſatisfaction <note n="b" place="bottom">Strada de Bello Belg. lib. i. 9.</note>. At laſt the money was paid, and Charles having diſmiſſed a great number of his domeſticks, whoſe attendance he thought would be ſuperfluous or cumberſome in his retirement, he proceeded to Valadolid. There he took a laſt and tender leave of his two ſiſters, whom he would not permit to accompany him to his ſolitude, though they intreated it with tears, not only that they might have the conſolation of contributing by their attendance and care to mitigate or to ſooth his ſufferings, but that they might reap inſtruction and benefit by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in thoſe pious exerciſes, to which he had conſecrated the remainder of his days.</p>
                  <p>FROM Valladolid he continued his journey to Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zencia in Eſtremadura. He had paſſed through that city a great many years before, and having been ſtruck at that time with the delightful ſituation of the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of St. Juſtus belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles diſtant from that place, he had then obſerved to ſome of his attendants, that this was a ſpot to which Diocleſian might have retired with pleaſure. The impreſſion had remained ſo ſtrong on his mind, that he pitched on it as the place of his retreat. It was ſeated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a ſmall brook, and ſurrounded by riſing grounds, covered with lofty trees; both from the nature of the ſoil, and temperature of the climate, it was eſteemed the moſt healthful and delicious ſituation in Spain. Some months before his reſignation he had ſent an architect
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:011837_1122_0F9D8951F0F8D998"/>
thither, to add a new apartment to the monaſtery, for his accommodation; but he gave ſtrict orders that the ſtile of the building ſhould be ſuch as ſuited his preſent ſtation, rather than his former dignity. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only of ſix rooms, four of them in the form of Friars cells, with naked walls; and the other two, each twenty feet ſquare, were hung with brown cloth, and furniſhed in the moſt ſimple manner. They were all level with the ground; with a door on one ſide into a garden, of which Charles himſelf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cultivate with his own hands. On the other ſide it communicated with the chapel of the monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in which he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, ſcarce ſufficient for the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve domeſticks only. He buried there, in ſolitude and ſilence, his grandeur, his ambition, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all thoſe vaſt projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe, filling every kingdom in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of being ſubjected to his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note n="c" place="bottom">Sandov. ii. 607 &amp; Zuniga. 110. Thuan. lib. xviii. 609.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE contraſt between Charles's conduct, and that of the Pope at this juncture, was ſo obvious, that it ſtruck even the moſt careleſs obſervers; nor was the compariſon which they made much to Paul's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The former, a conqueror, born to reign, long accuſtomed to the ſplendour which accompanies ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, and to thoſe buſy and intereſting ſcenes in which an active ambition had engaged him, quitted the world, at an early period of life, that he might cloſe the evening of his days in tranquillity, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome interval for ſober thought, and ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection. The latter, a prieſt, who had paſſed the early part of his life in the ſhade of the ſchools, and in the ſtudy of the ſpeculative ſciences, who was ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſo detached from the world, that he had ſhut himſelf up for many years in the ſolitude of a cloiſter, and who was not raiſed to the Papal throne until he had reached the extremity of old age, diſcovered at

once all the impetuoſity of youthful ambition, and engaged in vaſt ſchemes, in order to accompliſh which, he ſcrupled not to ſcatter the ſeeds of diſcord and to kindle the flames of war in every corner of Europe. But Paul, regardleſs of the opinion and cenſures of mankind, held on his own courſe with his wonted arrogance and violence. Theſe, although they ſeemed already to have exceeded all bounds, roſe to a ſtill greater height, upon the arrival of the duke of Guiſe in Italy.</p>
                  <p>THAT which the two Princes of Lorrain foreſaw and deſired, had happened. The duke of Guiſe was entruſted with the command of the army appointed to march to the Pope's aſſiſtance. It conſiſted of twenty thouſand men, of the beſt troops in the ſervice of France. So high was the Duke's reputation, and ſuch the general expectation of beholding ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exertion of his courage and abilities in a war, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he had precipitated his country, chiefly with the deſign of gaining a field where he might diſplay his own talents, that many of the French nobility, who had no command in the troops employed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him as volunteers. This army paſſed the Alps in a rigorous ſeaſon, and advanced towards Rome, without any oppoſition from the Spaniards, who, as they were not ſtrong enough to act in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts, had collected all their forces in one body on the frontiers of Naples, for the defence of that kingdom.</p>
                  <p>EMBOLDENED by the approach of the French, the Pope let looſe all the fury of his reſentment againſt Philip, which, notwithſtanding the natural violence of his temper, prudential conſiderations had hitherto obliged him to keep under ſome reſtraint. He named commiſſioners, whom he impowered to paſs judgment in the ſuit, which the conſiſtoral advocate had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt Philip, in order to prove that he had forfeited the crown of Naples, by taking arms againſt the Holy See, of which he was a vaſſal. He recalled all the nuncios reſident in the courts of Charles V. of Philip, or of any of their allies. This was chiefly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt Cardinal Pole, the Papal legate in the
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:011837_1124_0F9D89536FD06AE0"/>
court of England, whoſe great merit, in having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſo ſucceſsfully to reconcile that kingdom to the church of Rome, together with the expectation of farther ſervices that he might perform, was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſcreen him from the reſentment which he had incurred by his zealous endeavours to re-eſtabliſh peace between the houſe of Auſtria and France. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an addition to be made to the anathemas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually denounced againſt the enemies of the church on Maunday-Thurſday, whereby he inflicted the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of excommunication on the authors of the late invaſion of the eccleſiaſtical territories, whatever their rank or dignity might be; and, in conſequence of this, the uſual prayers for the Emperor were omitted next day in the Pope's chapel.<note n="d" place="bottom">Pal. lib. xiii. 180. Mem. de Ribier, ii. 678.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT while the Pope indulged himſelf in theſe wild and childiſh ſallies of rage, he either neglected, or it exceeded his power, to take ſuch meaſures as would have rendered his reſentment really formidable, and fatal to his enemies. For, when the Duke of Guiſe entered Rome, where he was received with a triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pomp, which would have been more ſuitable if he had been returning from having terminated the war with glory, than when he was going to begin it with a doubtful chance of ſucceſs, he found none of the preparations for war in ſuch forwardneſs as Caraffa had promiſed, or he had expected. The Papal troops were far inferior in number to the quota ſtipulated; no magazines ſufficient for their ſubſiſtance were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor was money for paying them provided. The Venetians, agreeably to that cautious maxim which the misfortunes of their ſtate had firſt led them to adopt, and which was now become a fundamental principle in their policy, declared their reſolution to preſerve an exact neutrality, without taking any part in the quarrels of Princes, ſo far their ſuperiors in power. The other Italian ſtates were either openly united in league with Philip, or ſecretly wiſhed ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his arms againſt a Pontiff, whoſe inconſiderate ambition had rendered Italy once more the ſeat of war.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="287" facs="unknown:011837_1125_0F9D89542F6B2CE8"/>THE Duke of Guiſe perceived that the whole weight of the war would devolve on him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible, though too late, how imprudent it is to rely, in the execution of great enterprizes, on the aid of feeble allies. Puſhed on, however, by the Pope's impatience for action, as well as by his own deſire of performing ſomething of what he had ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently undertaken, he marched towards Naples, and began his operations. But the ſucceſs of theſe fell far ſhort of his former reputation, of what the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and of what he himſelf had promiſed. He opened the campaign with the ſiege of Civetella, a town of ſome importance on the Neapolitan frontier. But the obſtinacy with which the Spaniſh governor defended it, baffled all the impetuous efforts of the French valour, and obliged Guiſe, after a ſiege of three weeks, to retire from the town with diſgrace. He endeavoured to wipe off that ſtain, by advancing boldly towards the Duke of Alva's camp, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him battle. But that prudent commander, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the advantages of ſtanding on the defenſive before an invading enemy, declined an engagement, and kept within his entrenchments; and adhering to his plan with the ſteadineſs of a Caſtilian, eluded with great addreſs all Guiſe's ſtratagems, to draw him into action <note n="e" place="bottom">Herrera vida de Felipe, 181.</note>. Meanwhile ſickneſs waſted the French ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; violent diſſenſions had ariſen between Guiſe and the commander of the Pope's forces; the Spaniards renewed their incurſions into the eccleſiaſtical ſtate; the Pope, when he found, inſtead of the conqueſts and triumphs which he had fondly expected, that he could not ſecure his own territories from depredation, murmured, complained, and began to talk of peace. The duke of Guiſe, mortified to the laſt degree with having acted ſuch an inglorious part, not only ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his court either to reinforce his army, or to recal him, but urged Paul to fulfil his engagements; and called on Cardinal Caraffa, ſometimes with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſometimes with threats, to make good theſe magnificent promiſes, from a raſh confidence in which
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:011837_1126_0F9D8954EE917A70"/>
he had adviſed his maſter to renounce the truce of Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, and to join in league with the Pope <note n="f" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xxviii. 614. Palav. lib. xiii. 181. Durn. ii. app. 317.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT while the French affairs in Italy were in this wretched ſituation, an unexpected event happened in the Low-Countries, which called the Duke of Guiſe from a ſtation wherein he could acquire no honour, to the moſt dignified and important charge which could be committed to a ſubject. As ſoon as the French had diſcovered their purpoſe of violating the truce of Vaucelles, not only by ſending an army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italy, but by attempting to ſurprize ſome of the frontier towns in Flanders, Philip, though willing to have avoided a rupture, determined to proſecute the war with ſuch ſpirit, as ſhould make his enemies ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that his father had not erred, when he judged him to be ſo capable of government, that he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up the reins into his hands. As he knew that Henry had been at great expence in fitting out the army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of Guiſe, and that his treaſury was hardly able to anſwer the exorbitant and endleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of a diſtant war, he foreſaw that all his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Low-Countries muſt, of conſequence, be feeble, and be conſidered only as ſecondary to thoſe in Italy. For that reaſon he prudently reſolved to make his principal effort in that place where he expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the French to be weakeſt; and to bend his chief force againſt that quarter where they would feel a blow moſt ſenſibly. With this view, he aſſembled in the Low-Countries an army of about fifty thouſand men, the Flemings ſerving him on this occaſion with that active zeal, which ſubjects are wont to exert in obeying the commands of a new ſovereign. But Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, cautious and provident, even at that early period of life, did not reſt all his hopes of ſucceſs on that formidable force alone.</p>
                  <p>HE had been labouring for ſome time to engage the Engliſh to eſpouſe his quarrel; and though it was manifeſtly the intereſt of that kingdom to maintain a ſtrict neutrality, and the people themſelves were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the advantages which they derived from it; though he knew how odious his name was to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and how averſe they would be to co-operate
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:011837_1127_0F9D8955AFE6C588"/>
with him in any meaſure, he nevertheleſs did not deſpair of accompliſhing his point. He relied on the affection wherewith the Queen doated on him, which was ſo violent, that even his coldneſs and neglect had not extinguiſhed it; he knew her implicit reverence for his opinion, and her fond deſire of gratifying him in every particular. That he might work on theſe with greater facility, and more certain ſucceſs, he ſet out for England. The Queen who, during her huſband's abſence, had languiſhed in perpetual dejection, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed freſh ſpirits on his arrival; and without paying the leaſt attention either to the intereſt or to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of her people, entered warmly into all his ſchemes. In vain did her privy-council remonſtrate againſt the imprudence as well as danger of involving the nation in an unneceſſary war; in vain did they put in her mind of the ſolemn treaties of peace ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between England and France, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that nation had afforded her no pretext to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Mary, ſoothed by Philip's careſſes, or intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by the threats which his aſcendant over her emboldened him at ſome times to throw out, was deaf to every thing that could be urged in oppoſition to his ſentiments, and inſiſted with the greateſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence on an immediate declaration of war againſt France. The council, though all Philip's addreſs and Mary's authority were employed to gain or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe them, ſtruggled long, and yielded at laſt, not from conviction, but merely from deference to the will of their ſovereign. War was declared againſt France, the only one perhaps againſt that kingdom into which the Engliſh ever entered with reluctance. As Mary knew the averſion of the nation to this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhe durſt not call a parliament in order to raiſe money for carrying on the war. She ſupplied this want, however, by a ſtrain of prerogative; and levied large ſums on her ſubjects by her own authority. This enabled her to aſſemble a ſufficient body of troops, and to ſend eight thouſand men under the conduct of the Earl of Pembroke to join Philip's army <note n="g" place="bottom">Carte iii. 337.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="unknown:011837_1128_0F9D89566FAE3128"/>PHILIP, who was not ambitious of military glory, gave the command of his army to Emanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, and fixed his own reſidence at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, that he might be at hand to receive the earlieſt intelligence of his motions, and to aid him with his counſels. The duke opened the campaign with a maſterly ſtroke of addreſs, which juſtified Philip's choice, and diſcovered ſuch a ſuperiority of genius over the French generals, as almoſt enſured ſucceſs in his ſubſequent operations. He appointed the general rendezvous of his troops at a place conſiderably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from the country which he deſtined to be the ſcene of action; and having kept the enemy in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for a good time with regard to his intentions, he at laſt deceived them ſo effectually by the variety of his marches and counter-marches, that they conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he meant to bend all his force againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Champagne, and would attempt to penetrate into the kingdom on that ſide. In conſequence of this opinion, they drew all their ſtrength towards that quarter, and reinforcing the garriſons there, left the towns on other parts of the frontier deſtitute of troops ſufficient to defend them.</p>
                  <p>EMANUEL, as ſoon as he perceived that this feint had its full effect, turned ſuddenly to the right, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by rapid marches into Picardy, and ſending his cavalry, in which he was extremely ſtrong, before him, inveſted St. Quintin. This was a town deemed in that age of conſiderable ſtrength, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as there were few fortified cities between it and Paris. The fortifications, however, had been much neglected, the garriſon, weakened by draughts ſent towards Champagne, did not amount to a fifth part of the number requiſite for its defence; and the governor, though a brave officer, was neither of rank nor authority, equal to the command in a place of ſo much conſequence, beſieged by ſuch a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble army. A few days muſt have put the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy in poſſeſſion of the town, if the Admiral de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny, who thought it concerned his honour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſaving a place of ſuch importance to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and which lay within his juriſdiction as gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:011837_1129_0F9D89572F93E6B0"/>
of Picardy, had not taken the gallant reſolution of throwing himſelf into it, with ſuch a body of men as he could collect of a ſudden. This reſolution he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted with great intrepidity, and conſidering the nature of the enterprize, with no contemptible ſucceſs; for though one half of his ſmall body was cut off, he, with the other, broke through the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and entered the town. The unexpected arrival of an officer of ſuch high rank and reputation, and who had expoſed himſelf to ſuch danger in order to join them, inſpired the deſponding garriſon with courage. Every thing that the Admiral's great ſkill and experience in the art of war could ſuggeſt, for annoying the enemy, or defending the town, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; and the citizens as well as the garriſon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding his zeal with equal ardour, ſeemed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that they would hold out to the laſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice themſelves in order to ſave their country <note n="h" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xix. 647.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke of Savoy, whom the Engliſh under the Earl of Pembroke, joined about this time, puſhed on the ſiege with, the greateſt vigour. An army ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and ſo well ſupplied with every thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, carried on its approaches with great advantage againſt a garriſon which was ſtill ſo feeble that it durſt ſeldom venture to diſturb or retard the enemies opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by ſallies. The Admiral, ſenſible of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger and unable to avert it, acquainted his uncle the conſtable Montmorency, who had the command of the French army, with his ſituation, and pointed out to him a method by which he might throw relief into the town. The Conſtable, ſolicitous to ſave a town, the loſs of which would open a paſſage for the enemy into the heart of France; and eager to extricate his nephew out of that perilous ſituation, in which zeal for the publick had engaged him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, though aware of the danger, to attempt what he deſired. With this view he marched from La Fere towards St. Quintin at the head of his army, which was not by one half ſo numerous as that of the enemy, and having given the command of a body of choſen
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:011837_1130_0F9D8957EF53CC88"/>
men to Coligny's brother Dandelot who was colonel general of the French infantry, he ordered him to force his way into the town by that avenue which the Admiral had repreſented as moſt practicable, while he himſelf with the main army would give the alarm to the enemies camp on the oppoſite ſide, and endeavour to draw all their attention towards that quarter. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot executed his orders with greater intrepidity than conduct. His ſoldiers ruſhed on with ſuch headlong impetuoſity, that though it broke the firſt body of the enemy which ſtood in their way, it threw themſelves into the utmoſt confuſion; and being attacked by freſh troops which cloſed in upon them on every ſide, the greater part of them were cut in pieces, Dandelot, with about five hundred of the moſt adventrous, and moſt fortunate, making good his entrance into the town.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the Conſtable, in executing his part of the plan, advanced ſo near the camp of the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as rendered it impoſſible to retreat with ſafety in the face of an enemy ſo much ſuperior in number. The Duke of Savoy inſtantly perceived Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's error, and prepared, with the preſence of mind and abilities of a great general, to avail himſelf of it. He drew up his army in order of battle, with the greateſt expedition, and watching the moment when the French began to file off towards La Fere, he detached all his cavalry under the command of the count of Egmont to fall on the rear, while he at the head of his infantry, advanced to ſupport him. The French retired at firſt in perfect order, and with a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; but when they ſaw Egmont draw near with his formidable body of cavalry, the ſhock of which they were conſcious that they could not withſtand, the proſpect of imminent danger, added to diſtruſt of their general, whoſe imprudence every ſoldier now perceived, ſtruck them with general conſternation. They began inſenſibly to quicken their pace, and thoſe in the rear began to preſs ſo violently on ſuch as were before them, that in a ſhort time their march re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a ſlight rather than a retreat. Egmont ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their confuſion, charged them with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:011837_1131_0F9D8958B05C2850"/>
fury, and in a moment all their Genſdarmerie, the pride and ſtrength of the French armies in that age, gave way and fled with precipitation. The infantry, however, whom the conſtable, by his preſence and authority, kept to their colours, ſtill continued their retreat, until the enemy brought ſome pieces of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to bear upon their centre, which threw them into ſuch diſorder, that the cavalry renewing their attack, broke in, and the rout became univerſal. About four thouſand of the French fell in the field, and among thoſe the Duke of Anguyen a Prince of the blood, together with ſix hundred gentlemen. The Conſtable, as ſoon as he perceived the fortune of the the day to be irretrievable, ruſhed into the thickeſt of the enemy, with a reſolution not to ſurvive the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which his ill-conduct had brought upon his country; but having received a dangerous wound, and being waſted with the loſs of blood, he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with by ſome Flemiſh officers, to whom he was known, who protected him from the violence of the ſoldiers, and obliged him to ſurrender. Beſides the Conſtable, the Dukes of Montpenſier and Longuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, the Marechal St. André, many officers of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, three hundred gentlemen, and near four thouſand private ſoldiers were taken priſoners. All the colours belonging to the infantry, all the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and all the cannon, two pieces excepted, fell into the enemies hands. The victorious army did not loſe above fourſcore men. <note n="l" place="bottom">Thuan. 650. Haraei Annal. Brabant. ii. 692. Herrera, 291.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS battle no leſs fatal to France than the ancient victories of Creſſy and Agincourt, gained by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh on the ſame frontier, bore a more near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to theſe, in the ſuddenneſs of the rout; in the raſhneſs of the commander in chief; in the number of perſons of note ſlain or taken; and in the ſmall loſs ſuſtained by the enemy. It filled France with equal conſternation. Many inhabitants of Paris with the ſame precipitancy and trepidation, as if the enemy had been already at their gates, quitted the city, and retired into the interior provinces. The King, by his preſence and exhortations, endeavoured to conſole
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:011837_1132_0F9D89596F0070B0"/>
and to animate ſuch as remained, and applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the greateſt diligence to repair the ruinous fortifications of the city, prepared to defend it againſt the attack which he inſtantly expected. But happily for France, Philip's caution, together with the intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid firmneſs of the Admiral de Coligny not only ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the capital from the danger to which it was expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but gained the nation a ſhort interval, during which the people recovered from the terror and dejection occaſioned by a blow no leſs ſevere than unexpected, and Henry had leiſure to take meaſures for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſecurity with the ſpirit which became the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of a powerful and martial people.</p>
                  <p>PHILIP, immediately after the battle, viſited the camp at St. Quintin, where he was received with all the exultation of military triumph; and ſuch were his tranſports of joy on account of an event, which threw ſo much luſtre on the beginning of his reign, that they ſoftened his ſevere and haughty temper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unuſual flow of courteſy. When the Duke of Savoy approached, and was kneeling to kiſs his hands, he caught him in his arms, and embracing him with warmth, "It becomes me, ſays he, rather to kiſs your hands, which have gained me ſuch a glorious and almoſt bloodleſs victory."</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as the rejoicings and congratulations on Philip's arrival were over, a council of war was held in order to determine how they might improve their victory to the beſt advantage. The Duke of Savoy, ſeconded by ſeveral of the ableſt officers formed under Charles V. inſiſted that they ſhould immediately relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the ſiege of St. Quintin, the reduction of which was now an object below their attention, and advance di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards Paris; that as there were neither troops to oppoſe, nor any town of ſtrength to retard their march, they might reach that capital while under the full impreſſion of the aſtoniſhment and terror occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rout of the army, and take poſſeſſion of it without reſiſtance. But Philip, leſs adventrous or more prudent than his generals, preferred a moderate but certain advantage, to an enterprize of greater ſplendour, but of more doubtful ſucceſs. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:011837_1133_0F9D895A2E171668"/>
to the council the infinite reſources of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo powerful as France; the great number as well as martial ſpirit of its nobles; their attachment to their ſovereign; the vaſt advantages with which they could carry on war in their own territories; and the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable deſtruction, which muſt be the conſequence of their penetrating too raſhly into the enemy's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before they had ſecured ſuch a communication with their own, as might render a retreat ſafe, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any diſaſtrous event that ſhould become neceſſary. On all theſe accounts, he adviſed the continuance of the ſiege, and his generals acquieſced the more readily in his opinion, as they made no doubt of being maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the town in a few days, a loſs of time of ſo little conſequence in the execution of their plan, that they might eaſily repair it by their ſubſequent activity <note n="l" place="bottom">Belcar. Commentar. di Reb. Gallic. 901.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE weakneſs of the fortifications, and the ſmall number of the garriſon, which could no longer hope either for reinforcement, or relief, ſeemed to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe this calculation of Philip's generals. But, in making it, they did not attend ſufficiently to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Admiral de Coligny, who commanded in the town. A courage undiſmayed and undiſconcerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the greateſt dangers, an invention fruitful in reſources, a genius which rouzed and ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire new force upon every diſaſter, a talent of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the minds of men, together with a capacity of maintaining his aſcendant over them even under cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances the moſt adverſe and diſtreſsful, were qualities which Coligny poſſeſſed in a degree ſuperior to any general of that age. Theſe qualities were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to the ſtation in which he was now placed; and as he knew the infinite importance to his country of every hour which he could gain at this juncture, he exerted himſelf to the utmoſt in contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to protract the ſiege, and to detain the enemy from attempting any enterprize more dangerous to France. Such were the perſeverance and ſkill with which he conducted the defence, and ſuch the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and patience with which he animated the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that though the Spaniards, the Flemings, and
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:011837_1134_0F9D895AEF3D23C0"/>
the Engliſh, carried on the attack with all the ardour which national emulation inſpires, he held out the town ſeventeen days. He was taken priſoner, at laſt, on the breach, overpowered by the ſuperior number of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>HENRY availed himſelf, with the utmoſt activity, of the interval which the Admiral's well-timed obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy had afforded him. He appointed officers to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſcattered remains of the conſtable's army; he iſſued orders for levying ſoldiers in every part of the kingdom; he commanded the ban and arriere ban of the frontier provinces inſtantly to take the field, and to join the Duke of Nevers at Laon in Picardy; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the greater part of the veteran troops which ſerved under the Marechal Briſſac at Piedmont; he ſent courier after courier to the Duke of Guiſe, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, together with all his army, to return inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the defence of their country; he diſpatched one envoy to the Grand Seignior, to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of his fleet, and the loan of a ſum of money; he ſent another into Scotland, to incite the Scots to invade the north of England, that by drawing Mary's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that quarter, he might prevent her from rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing her troops which ſerved under Philip. Theſe efforts of the King were warmly ſeconded by the zeal of his ſubjects. The city of Paris granted him a free gift of three hundred thouſand livres. The other great towns imitated the liberality of the capital, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in proportion. Several noblemen of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion engaged to garriſon and to defend at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the towns which lay moſt expoſed to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enemy. Nor was this general concern for the publick confined to communities alone, or to thoſe in the higher ſphere of life, but diffuſing itſelf among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of every rank, each individual ſeemed diſpoſed to act with as much vigour as if the honour of the King, and the ſafety of the ſtate had depended on his perſonal efforts <note n="m" place="bottom">Mem. de Ribier, ii. 701, 703.</note>.</p>
                  <p>PHILIP, who was no ſtranger either to the prudent meaſures taken by the French monarch for the ſecurity of his dominions, or to the ſpirit with which his ſubjects
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:011837_1135_0F9D895BAFD4E368"/>
prepared to defend themſelves, perceived, when it was too late, that he had loſt an opportunity which could never be recalled, and that it was now vain to think of penetrating into the heart of France, He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, therefore, without much reluctance, a ſcheme which was too bold and hazardous to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agreeable to his cautious temper; and employed his army, during the remainder of the campaign, in the ſieges of Ham and Catelet. Of theſe, he ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter; and the reduction of theſe two petty towns, together with the acquiſition of St. Quintin, were all the advantages which he derived from one of the moſt deciſive victories gained in that century. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip himſelf, however, continued in high exultation, on account of his ſucceſs; and as all his paſſions were tinged with ſuperſtition, he, in memory of the battle of St. Quintin, which had been fought on the day conſecrated to St. Laurence, vowed to build a church, a monaſtery, and a palace ſacred to that ſaint and martyr. Before the expiration of the year, he laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an edifice, in which all theſe were united, at the Eſcurial in the neighboured of Madrid; and the ſame principle, which dictated the vow, directed the building. But the plan of the work was ſo formed as to reſemble a gridiron, which, according to the legendary tale, had been the inſtrument of St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence's martyrdom. Notwithſtanding the vaſt and expenſive ſchemes, in which his reſtleſs ambition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved him, Philip continued the building with ſuch perſeverance for twenty-two years, and reſerved ſuch vaſt ſums for this monument of his piety and vanity, that the monarchs of Spain are indebted to him for a royal reſidence, which though not the moſt elegant, is certainly the moſt ſumptuous and magnificient of any in Europe <note n="*" place="bottom">Colmenar Annales d'Eſpagne, tom. ii. p. 136.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt account of that fatal blow which the French had received at St. Quintin was carried to Rome by the courier whom Henry had ſent to recall the Duke of Guiſe. As Paul, even with the aſſiſtance of his French auxiliaries, had ſcarce been able to check
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:011837_1136_0F9D895C6FEF4550"/>
the progreſs of the Spaniſh arms, he foreſaw that as ſoon as he was deprived of their protection, his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories muſt be over-ran in a moment. He remonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore with the greateſt violence againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the French army, reproaching the Duke of Guiſe for his ill conduct, which had brought him into ſuch an unhappy ſituation; and complaining of the King for deſerting him ſo ungenerouſly under ſuch circumſtances. Guiſe's orders, however, were peremptory. Paul, inflexible as he was, found it neceſſary to accommodate his conduct to the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his affairs, and to employ the mediation of the Venetians, and of Coſmo di Medici in order to obtain peace. Philip, who had been forced unwillingly to a rupture with the Pope, and who, even while ſucceſs crowned his arms, doubted ſo much the juſtice of his own cauſe, that he had made frequent overtures of pacification, liſtened eagerly to the firſt propoſals of this nature from Paul, and diſcovered ſuch moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his demands as could ſcarce have been expected from a Prince elated with victory.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke of Alva on the part of Philip, and the Cardinal Caraffa in the name of his uncle, met at Cavi, and both being equally diſpoſed to peace, they, after a ſhort conference, terminated the war by a treaty on the following terms: That Paul ſhould renounce his league with France, and maintain for the future ſuch a neutrality as became the common father of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; That Philip ſhould inſtantly reſtore all the towns of the eccleſiaſtical territory of which he had taken poſſeſſion; That the claims of the Caraffa's, to the dutchy of Paliano, and other demeſnes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna's ſhould be referred to the deciſion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of Venice; that the Duke of Alva ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair in perſon to Rome, and after aſking pardon of Paul in his own name, and in that of his maſter, for having invaded the patrimony of the church, ſhould receive the Pope's abſolution from that crime. Thus Paul, through Philip's ſcrupulous timidity, finiſhed an unproſperous war without any detriment to the Papal See. The conqueror appeared humble, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his error; while he who had been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:011837_1137_0F9D895D2E150AF8"/>
retained his uſual haughtineſs, and was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every mark of ſuperiority<note n="n" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. xiii. 183, F. Paul. 380. Herrera, vol. i. 310.</note>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Duke of Alva, in terms of the treaty, repaired to Rome, and and in the poſture of a ſupplicant, kiſſed the feet, and implored the forgiveneſs of that very perſon, whom his arms had reduced to the laſt extremity. Such was the ſuperſtitious veneration of the Spaniards for the Papal character, that Alva, though perhaps the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man of the age, and accuſtomed from his infancy to a familiar intercourſe with Princes, acknowledged that when he approached the Pope, he was ſo much overawed, that his voice failed, and his preſence of mind forſook him <note n="o" place="bottom">Pallav. lib. xiii. 185. Summonte Iſtoria di Napoli, iv. 286.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT though this war, which at its commencement threatened mighty revolutions, was brought to an end without occaſioning any alteration in thoſe States, which were its immediate object, it produced effects of conſiderable conſequence in other parts of Italy. As Philip was extremely ſolicitous to terminate his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Paul as ſpeedily as poſſible, he was willing to make any ſacrifice in order to gain thoſe Princes, who, by joining their troops to the Papal and French army, might have prolonged the war. With this view, he entered into a negociation with Octavio Farneſe, Duke of Parma, and in order to ſeduce him from his alliance with France, he reſtored to him the city of Placentia with the territory depending on it, which Charles V. having ſeized in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty-ſeven, had kept from that time in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and had tranſmitted together with his other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions to Philip.</p>
                  <p>THIS ſtep made ſuch a diſcovery of Philip's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and views to Coſmo di Medici, the moſt ſagacious and provident of all the Italian Princes, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hopes of accompliſhing his favourite ſcheme of adding Siena and its territories to his dominions in Tuſcany. As his ſucceſs in this attempt depended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the delicacy of addreſs with which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, he employed all the refinements of policy in the negociation which he ſet on foot for this purpoſe.

                     </gap> Philip, whoſe treaſury he knew to be entirely drained by the expence of the war, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay the great ſums which he had advanced to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror during the ſiege of Siena. When Philip endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to elude a demand which he was unable to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy, he affected to be extremely diſquieted, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſecret of his diſguſt, inſtructed his ambaſſador at Rome to open a negociation with the Pope, which ſeemed to be the effect of it. The ambaſſador execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his commiſſion with ſuch dexterity, that Paul, imagining Coſmo to be entirely alienated from the Spaniſh intereſt, propoſed to him an alliance with France, which ſhould be cemented by the marriage of his eldeſt ſon to one of Henry's daughters. Coſmo received the overture with ſuch apparent ſatisfaction, and with ſo many profeſſions of gratitude for the high honour of which he had the proſpect, that not only the Pope's miniſters, but the French envoy at Rome talked confidently, and with little reſerve, of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of that important ally, as a matter certain and decided. The account of this was quickly carried to, Philip; and Coſmo, who foreſaw how much it would alarm him, had diſpatched his nephew Ludovico de Toledo into the Netherlands, that he might be at hand to obſerve and take advantage of his conſternation, before the firſt impreſſion which it made ſhould in any degree abate. Coſmo was extremely fortunate in the choice of the inſtrument whom he employed. Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do waited, with patience, until he diſcovered with certainty, that Philip had received ſuch intelligence of his uncle's negociations at Rome, as muſt have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſuſpicious mind with fear and jealouſy; and then craving an audience, he required payment of the money which had been borrowed by the Emperor, in the moſt earneſt and peremptory terms. In urging that point, he artfully threw out ſeveral dark hints and ambiguous declarations, concerning the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which Coſmo might be driven by a refuſal of this juſt demand, as well as by other grievances of which he had good reaſon to complain.</p>
                  <p>PHILIP, aſtoniſhed at an addreſs in ſuch a ſtrain, from a Prince ſo far his inferior as the Duke of Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:011837_1139_0F9D895EB350BFD0"/>
and comparing what he now heard with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which he had received from Italy, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concluded that Coſmo had ventured to aſſume this bold and unuſal tone on the proſpect of his union with France. In order to prevent the Pope and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from acquiring an ally, who by his abilities and the ſituation of his dominions would have added both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and ſtrength to their confederacy, he offered to grant Coſmo the inveſtiture of Siena, if he would conſent to accept of this, as an equivalent for the ſums due to him, and engage to furniſh a body of troops towards the defence of Philip's territories in Italy, againſt any power who ſhould attack them. As ſoon as Coſmo had brought Philip to this, which was the object of all his artifices and intrigues, he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the negociation by any unneceſſary delay, or any exceſs of refinement, but cloſed eagerly with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and Philip, in ſpite of the remonſtrances of his ableſt counſellors, ſigned a treaty with him to that effect <note n="p" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xviii. 624.

                  <p>AS no Prince was ever more tenacious of his rights than Philip, or leſs willing to relinquiſh any territory which he poſſeſſed, by what tenure ſoever he held it, theſe unſual conceſſions to the Dukes of Parma and Tuſcany, by which he wantonly gave up countries, in acquiring or defending which, his father had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed many years, and waſted much blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, cannot be accounted for from any motive, but his ſuperſtitious deſire of extricating himſelf out of the war which he had been forced to wage againſt the Pope. By theſe treaties, however, the balance of power among the Italian ſtates was poized with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er equality, and rendered leſs variable than it had been ſince it received the firſt violent ſhock from the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Charles VIII. of France. From this period I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly ceaſed to be the great theatre, on which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of Spain, France, and Germany, contended for power or for fame. Their diſſentions and hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were nevertheleſs as frequent and as violent as ever; but being excited by new objects, they ſtained
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:011837_1140_0F9D895F71989438"/>
other regions of Europe with blood, and rendered them, in their turn, miſerable by the devaſtations of war.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke of Guiſe left Rome on the ſame day that his adverſary the Duke of Alva made his ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubmiſſions to the Pope. He was received in France as the guardian angel of the kingdom. His late ill ſucceſs in Italy ſeeemed to be forgotten, while his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſervices, particularly his defence of Metz, were recounted with exaggerated praiſe; and he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed in every city through which he paſſed, as the reſtorer of publick ſecurity, who, after having ſet bounds by his conduct and valour to the victorious arms of Charles V. returned now at the call of his country, to check the formidable progreſs of Philip's power. The reception which he met with from Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was no leſs cordial and honourable. New titles were invented, and new dignities created in order to diſtinguiſh him. He was appointed lieutenant-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in chief both within and without the kingdom, with a juriſdiction almoſt unlimited, and hardly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that which was poſſeſſed by the king himſelf. Thus, through the ſingular felicity which attended the Princes of Lorrain, the miſcarriage of their own ſchemes contributed to aggrandize them. The cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his country, and the ill conduct of his rival the Conſtable, exalted the Duke of Guiſe to a height of dignity and power, which he could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to attain by the moſt fortunate and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſucceſs of his own ambitious projects.</p>
                  <p>THE Duke of Guiſe, eager to perform ſomething ſuitable to the high expectations of his countrymen, and that he might juſtify the extraordinary confidence which the King had repoſed in him, ordered all the troops, which could be got together, to aſſemble at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piegne. Though the winter was well advanced, and had ſet in with extreme rigour, he placed himſelf at their head, and took the field. By Henry's activity and the zeal of his ſubjects, ſo many ſoldiers had been raiſed in the kingdom, and ſuch conſiderable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been drawn from Germany and Swiſſerland, as formed an army reſpectable even in the eyes of a
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:011837_1141_0F9D896037246CB0"/>
victorious enemy. Philip, alarmed at ſeeing it put in motion at ſuch an uncommon ſeaſon, began to tremble for his new conqueſts, particularly St. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, the fortifications of which were hitherto but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly repaired.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Duke of Guiſe meditated a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant enterprize; and after amuſing the enemy with threatening ſucceſſively different towns on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Flanders, he turned ſuddenly to the left and inveſted Calais with his whole army. Calais had been taken by the Engliſh under Edward III. and was the fruit of that monarch's glorious victory at Creſſy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only place that they retained of their ancient and extenſive territories in France, and which opened to them, at all times, an eaſy and ſecure paſſage into the heart of that kingdom, their keeping poſſeſſion of it ſoothed the pride of the one nation as much as it mortified the vanity of the other. Its ſituation was naturally ſo ſtrong, and its fortifications deemed ſo impregnable, that no monarch of France, how adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous ſoever, had been bold enough to attack it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when the domeſtick ſtrength of England was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and exhauſted by the bloody wars between the houſes of York and Lancaſter, and its attention en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diverted from foreign objects, Calais had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained undiſturbed and unthreatened. Mary and her council, compoſed chiefly of Eccleſiaſticks, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with military affairs, and whoſe whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was turned towards extirpating hereſy out of the kingdom, had not only neglected to take any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions for the ſafety of this important place, but ſeemed to think that the reputation of its ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was ſufficient for its ſecurity. Full of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they ventured, even after the declaration of war, to continue a practice which the low ſtate of the Queen's finances, had introduced in times of peace. As the country adjacent to Calais was overflowed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the winter, and the marſhes around it became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable, except by one avenue, which the forts of St. Agatha and Newnhambridge commanded, it had been the cuſtom of the Engliſh to diſmiſs the greater part of the garriſon towards the end of autumn, and
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:011837_1142_0F9D8960EE2AA638"/>
to replace it in the ſpring. In vain did Lord Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, the governor of Calais, remonſtrate againſt this ill-timed parſimony, and repreſent the poſſibility of his being attacked ſuddenly, while had not troops ſufficient to man the works. The privy council treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe remonſtrances with ſcorn, as if they had flowed from the timidity or the rapaciouſneſs of the governor; and ſome of them, with that confidence which is the companion of ignorance, boaſted that they would defend Calais with their white rods againſt any enemy who ſhould approach it during winter <note n="*" place="bottom">Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e. iii. 345.</note>. In vain did Philip, who had paſſed through Calais as he returned from England to the Netherlands, warn the Queen of the danger to which it was expoſed; and acquainting her with what was neceſſary for its ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, offered to reinforce the garriſon during winter with a detachment of his own troops. Mary's counſellors, though obſequious to her in all points wherein religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was concerned, diſtruſted, as much as the reſt of their countrymen, every propoſition that came from her huſband; and ſuſpected this to be an artifice of Philip's in order to gain the command of the town, they neglected his intelligence, declined his offer, and left Calais with leſs than a fourth of the men requiſite for its defence.</p>
                  <p>IT was his knowledge of this, which encouraged the Duke of Guiſe to venture on an enterprize, that ſurprized his own countrymen no leſs than his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. As he knew that its ſucceſs depended on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting his operations with ſuch rapidity, as would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the Engliſh no time for throwing relief into the town by ſea, and prevent Philip from giving him any interruption by land, he puſhed the attack with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vigour little known in carrying on ſieges, during that age. He drove the Engliſh from Fort St. Agatha at the firſt aſſault; obliged them to abandon the fort of Newnhambrige, after defending it three days; took the caſtle which commanded the harbour by ſtorm; and, on the eighth day after he appeared before Calais compelled the governor, whoſe feeble garriſon, which did not exceed five hundred men,
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:011837_1143_0F9D8961B180E1D0"/>

                  <p>THE Duke of Guiſe, without allowing the Engliſh time to recover from the conſternation occaſioned by this blow, immediately inveſted Guiſnes, the garriſon of which, though more numerous, defended itſelf with leſs vigour, and after ſtanding one briſk aſſault, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the town. The caſtle of Hames was abandoned by the troops poſted there, without waiting the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>THUS, in a few days, during the depth of winter, and at a time when the fatal battle of St. Quintin had ſo depreſſed the ſanguine ſpirit of the French, that their utmoſt aim was to protect their own country, without dreaming of making conqueſts on the enemy; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing valour of one man drove the Engliſh out of Calais, after they had held it two hundred and ten years, and deprived them of every foot of land in a kingdom, where their dominions had been once ſo extenſive. This exploit, at the ſame time that it gave an high idea of the power and reſources of France to all Europe, ſet the Duke of Guiſe, in the opinion of his countrymen, far above all the generals of the age. They celebrated his conqueſts with immoderate tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of joy; while the Engliſh gave vent to all the paſſions, which animate a high-ſpirited people, when any great national calamity is manifeſtly owing to the ill conduct of their rulers. Mary and her miniſters, formerly odious, were now contemptible in their eyes. All the terrors of her ſevere and arbitrary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration could not reſtrain them from uttering execrations and threats againſt thoſe who, having wontonly involved the nation in a quarrel wherein it was no wiſe intereſted, had, by their negligence or incapacity, brought irreparable diſgrace on their country, and loſt the moſt valuable poſſeſſion belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Engliſh crown.</p>
                  <p>THE French King imitated the conduct of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conqueror, Edward III. with regard to Calais. He commanded all the Engliſh inhabitants to quit the town, and giving their houſes to his own ſubjects,
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:011837_1144_0F9D896271126890"/>
whom he allured to ſettle there by granting them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious immunities, he left a numerous garriſon, under an experienced governor, for their defence. After this, his victorious army went into quarters of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the uſual inaction of winter returned.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE Ferdinand aſſembled the college of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors at Frankfort, in order to lay before them the deed whereby Charles V. had reſigned the Imperial crown, and transferred it to him. This he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto delayed, on account of ſome difficulties which had occurred concerning the formalities requiſite in ſupplying a vacancy occaſioned by an event, to which there was no parallel in the annals of the Empire. Theſe being at length adjuſted, the Prince of Orange executed the commiſſion with which he had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by Charles; the Electors accepted of his reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; declared Ferdinand his lawful ſucceſſor; and put him in poſſeſſion of all the enſigns of the Imperial dignity.</p>
                  <p>BUT when the new Emperor ſent Guſman, his chancellor, to acquaint the Pope with this tranſaction, to teſtify his reverence towards the Holy See, and to ſignify that, according to form, he would ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch an ambaſſador extraordinary to treat with his holineſs concerning his coronation; Paul, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experience nor diſappointments could teach to bring down his lofty ideas of the papal prerogative to ſuch a moderate ſtandard as ſuited the genius of the times, refuſed to admit the envoy into his preſence, and declared all the proceedings at Frankfort irregular and invalid. He, contended that the Pope, as the vicegerent of Chriſt, was entruſted with the keys both of celeſtial and terreſtrial government; that from him the Imperial juriſdiction was derived; that though his predeceſſors had authorized the Electors to chuſe an Emperor, whom the Holy See confirmed, this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige was confined to thoſe caſes when a vacancy was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by death; that the inſtrument of Charles's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation had been preſented in an improper court, as it belonged to the Pope alone to reject or to accept of it, and to nominate a perſon to ſupply his place; that, ſetting aſide all theſe objections, Ferdinand's election
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:011837_1145_0F9D896333A89818"/>
laboured under two defects which alone were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to render it void, for the Proteſtant Electors had been admitted to vote, tho', by their apoſtacy from the catholick faith, they had forfeited that and every other privilege of the electoral office; that Ferdinand, by ratifying the conceſſions of ſeveral Diets in favour of hereticks, had rendered himſelf unworthy of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial dignity, which was inſtituted for the protection, not for the deſtruction of the church. But after thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering out theſe extravagant maxims, he added with an appearance of condeſcenſion, that if Ferdinand would renounce all title to the Imperial crown, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the election at Frankfort, make profeſſions of repentance for his paſt conduct, and ſupplicate him, with due humility, to confirm Charles's reſignation, as well as his aſſumption to the Empire, he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect every mark of favour from his paternal clemency and goodneſs. Guſman, though he had laid his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with conſiderable difficulties in his negociation with the Pope, little expected that he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived theſe antiquated and wild pretenſions, which aſtoniſhed him ſo much that he ſcarce knew in what tone he ought to reply. He prudently declined enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into any controverſy concerning the nature or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the papal juriſdiction, and confining himſelf to the political conſiderations, which ſhould determine the Pope to recognize an Emperor already in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he endeavoured to place theſe in ſuch a light, as he imagined could ſcarce fail to ſtrike Paul, if he were not altogether blind to his own intereſt. Philip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded Guſman's arguments with great earneſtneſs, by an ambaſſador whom he ſent to Rome of purpoſe, and beſought the Pope to deſiſt from claims ſo unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as might not only irritate and alarm Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand and the Princes of the Empire, but furniſh the enemies of the Holy See with a new reaſon for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting its juriſdiction as incompatible with the rights of Princes, and ſubverſive of all civil authority. But Paul, who deemed it a crime to attend any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuggeſted by human prudence or policy, when he thought himſelf called to aſſert the prerogatives of the Papal See, remained inflexible; and, during his
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:011837_1146_0F9D8963EE1A1FC0"/>

                  <p>WHILE Henry was preparing for the approaching campaign, he received accounts of the iſſue of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations in Scotland. Long experience having at laſt taught the Scots the imprudence of involving their country in every quarrel between France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, neither the ſolicitations of his ambaſſador, nor the addreſs and authority of the Queen-regent, could prevail on them to take arms againſt a kingdom, with which they were at peace. On this occaſion, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of a martial nobility and of a turbulent people, was reſtrained by regard for the publick intereſt and tranquillity, which, in former deliberations of this kind, had been ſeldom attended to, by a nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prone to ruſh into every new war. But though the Scots adhered with ſteadineſs to their pacific ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, they were extremely ready to gratify the French King in another particular, which he had given in charge to his ambaſſador.</p>
                  <p>THE young Queen of Scots had been affianced to the Dauphin, in the year one thouſand five hundred and forty-eight, and having been educated ſince that time in the court of France, ſhe had grown up to be the moſt amiable, and one of the moſt accompliſhed Princeſſes in that age. Henry demanded the conſent of her ſubjects to the celebration of the marriage, and a parliament which was held for that purpoſe, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eight commiſſioners to repreſent the whole body of the nation at that ſolemnity, with power to ſign ſuch deeds as might be requiſite before it was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In ſettling the articles of the marriage, the Scots took all the precautions, that prudence could dictate, in order to preſerve the liberty and independence of their country, while the French uſed every art to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to the Dauphin the conduct of affairs during the Queen's life, and the ſucceſſion of the crown on the event of her demiſe. The marriage was celebrated with pomp, ſuitable to the dignity of the parties, and the magnificence of a court, at that time, the moſt

ſplendid in Europe <note n="†" place="bottom">Keith's hiſtory of Scotland, p. 73. Append. 13. Corps Diplom. v. 21.</note>. Thus Henry, in the courſe of a few months, had the glory of recovering an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant poſſeſſion which antiently belonged to the crown of France, and of adding to it the acquiſition of a new kingdom. By this event, too, the Duke of Guiſe acquired new conſideration and importance; the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his niece to the apparent heir of the crown, raiſing him ſo far beyond the condition of other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as ſeemed to render the credit he had gained by his great actions, no leſs permanent than it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the campaign opened, ſoon after the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin's marriage, the Duke of Guiſe was placed at the head of the army with the ſame unlimited powers as formerly. Henry had received ſuch liberal ſupplies from his ſubjects, that the troops under his command were both numerous and well appointed; while Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, exhauſted by the extraordinary efforts of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year, had been obliged to diſmiſs ſo many of his forces during the winter, that he could not bring an army into the field capable of making head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The Duke of Guiſe did not loſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunity which his ſuperiority afforded him. He inveſted Toinville in the dutchy of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburg, one of the ſtrongeſt towns on the frontier of the Netherlands, and of great importance to France by its neighbourhood to Metz; and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſtinate valour with which it was defended, he forced it to capitulate after a ſiege of three weeks<note n="*" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xx. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>BUT the ſucceſs of this enterprize which it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would lead to other conqueſts, was more than counterbalanced by an event that happened in another part of the Low-Countries. The Marechal de Termes, governor of Calais, having penetrated into Flanders without oppoſition, inveſted Dunkirk with an army of fourteen thouſand men, and took it by ſtorm on the fifth day of the ſiege. From that he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Nieuport, which muſt have ſoon fallen into his hands, if the approach of the Count of Egmont with a ſuperior army had not made it prudent to retreat.
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:011837_1148_0F9D8965EF906440"/>
The French troops were ſo much encumbered with the booty which they had got at Dunkirk, or by ravaging the open country, that they moved ſlowly; and Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who had left his heavy baggage and artillery behind him, marched with ſuch rapidity, that he came up with them near Gravelines, and attacked them with the utmoſt impetuoſity. De Termes, who had the choice of the ground, having poſted his troops to advantage in the angle formed by the mouth of the river Aa and the ſea, received him with great firmneſs. Victory remained for ſome time in ſuſpenſe, the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate valour of the French, who foreſaw the unavoidable deſtruction that muſt follow upon a rout in an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's country, counterbalancing the ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Flemings, when one of thoſe accidents to which human prudence does not extend, decided the conteſt in favour of the latter. A ſquadron of Engliſh ſhips of war, which was cruizing on the coaſt, being drawn by the noiſe of the firing towards the place of engagement, entered the river Aa and turned its great guns againſt the right wing of the French with ſuch effect as immediately broke that body, and ſpread ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and confuſion through their whole army. The Flemings, to whom aſſiſtance, ſo unexpected and ſo ſeaſonable, gave freſh ſpirit, redoubling their efforts, that they might not loſe the advantage which fortune had preſented them, or give the enemy time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from their conſternation, the rout of the French ſoon became univerſal. Near two thouſand were killed on the ſpot; a greater number fell by the hands of the peaſants, who, in revenge for the cruelty with which their country had been plundered, purſued the fugitives and maſſacred them without mercy; the reſt were taken priſoners, together with de Termes their general, and many officers of diſtinction. <note n="†" place="bottom">Thuan. lib. xx. 694.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS ſignal victory, for which the Count of Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont was afterwards ſo ill requited by Philip, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of Guiſe to relinquiſh all other ſchemes, and to haſten towards the frontier of Picardy, that he might oppoſe the progreſs of the enemy there. This diſaſter reflected new luſtre on his reputation, and once
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:011837_1149_0F9D89663552E100"/>
more turned the eyes of his countrymen towards him, as the only general on whoſe arms victory always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and in whoſe conduct as well as good fortune, they could confide in every danger. Henry reinforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Guiſe's army with ſo many troops, drawn from the adjacent garriſons, that it ſoon amounted to forty thouſand men. That of the enemy, after the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Egmont with the Duke of Savoy, was not inferior in number. They encamped at the diſtance of a few leagues from one another; and each monarch having joined his reſpective army, it was expected that, after the viciſſitudes of good and bad ſucceſs during this and the former campaign, a deciſive bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle would at laſt determine which of the rivals ſhould take the aſcendant for the future, and give law to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. But though both had it in their power, neither of them diſcovered any inclination to bring the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a point of ſuch importance to depend upon the uncertain and fortuitous iſſue of a ſingle battle. The fatal engagements at St. Quintin and Gravelines were too recent to be ſoon forgotten, and the proſpect of encountering the ſame troops, commanded by the ſame generals, who had twice triumphed over his arms, inſpired Henry with a degree of caution which was not common to him. Philip, of a genius averſe to bold operations in war, naturally leaned to cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaſures, and would hazard nothing againſt a general, ſo fortunate and ſucceſsful as the Duke of Guiſe. Both monarchs, as if by agreement, ſtood on the defenſive, and fortifying their camps carefully, avoided every ſkirmiſh or rencounter that might bring on a general engagement.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the armies continued in this inaction, peace began to be mentioned in each camp, and both Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Philip diſcovered an inclination to liſten to any overture that tended to re-eſtabliſh it. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of France and Spain had been engaged during half a centry in almoſt continual wars, carried on at a great expence and productive of no conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to either. Exhauſted by extraordinary and unceaſing efforts, which far exceeded thoſe to which the nations of Europe had been accuſtomed before the
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:011837_1150_0F9D8966F4FF42C0"/>
rivalſhip between Charles V. and Francis I. both nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons longed ſo much for an interval of repoſe, in order to recruit their ſtrength, that their ſovereigns drew from them with difficulty the ſupplies neceſſary for carrying on hoſtilities. The private inclinations of both the Kings concurred with thoſe of their people. Philip was prompted to wiſh for peace by his fond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of returning to Spain. Accuſtomed from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to the climate and manners of that country, he was attached to it with ſuch extreme predilection, that he was unhappy in any other part of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But as he could not either with decency or ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty quit the Low-Countries, and venture on a voyage to Spain, during the continuance of war, the proſpect of a pacification which would put it in his power to execute this favourite ſcheme, was highly acceptable. Henry was no leſs deſirous of being delivered from the burden and avocations of war, that he might have leiſure to turn all his attention, and bend the whole force of his government towards ſuppreſſing the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Reformers, which were ſpreading with ſuch rapidity in Paris, and other great towns of France, that they began to grow formidable to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed church.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES theſe publick and avowed conſiderations ariſing from the ſtate of the two hoſtile kingdoms, or from the wiſhes of their reſpective monarchs, there was a ſecret intrigue carried on in the court of France, which contributed as much as either of the other, to haſten and to facilitate the negociation of a peace. The Conſtable Montmorency, during his captivity, beheld the rapid ſucceſs and growing favour of the Duke of Guiſe, with the envious ſolicitude of a rival. Every advantage gained by him he conſidered as a freſh wound to his own reputation, and he knew with what malevolent addreſs it would be improved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his credit with the King, and to augment that of the Duke of Guiſe. Theſe arts, he was afraid, might by degrees, work on the eaſy and ductile mind of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo as to efface all remains of his ancient affection towards him. But he could not diſcover any remedy for this unleſs he were allowed to return home, that he
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:011837_1151_0F9D896804CDDBC0"/>
might try whether by his preſence he could defeat the artifices of his enemies, and revive thoſe warm and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentiments which had long attached Henry to him, with a confidence ſo entire, as reſembled rather the cordiality of private friendſhip, than the cold and ſelfiſh connection between a monarch and one of his courtiers. While Montmorency was forming ſchemes and wiſhes for his return to France with much anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind, but with little hope of ſucceſs, an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected incident prepared the way for it. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Lorrain, who had ſhared with his brother in the King's favour, and participated of the power which that conferred, did not bear proſperity with the ſame diſcretion as the Duke of Guiſe. Intoxicated with their good fortune, he forgot how much they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their preſent elevation to their connexions with the Dutcheſs of Valentinois, and vainly aſcribed all to the extraordinary merit of their family. This led him not only to neglect his benefactreſs, but to thwart her ſchemes, and to talk with a ſarcaſtick liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her character and perſon. That ſingular wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, if we may believe contemporary writers, retained the beauty and charms of youth at the age of threeſcore, and on whom it is certain that Henry ſtill doated with all the fondneſs of love, felt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury with ſenſibility, and ſet herſelf with eagerneſs to revenge it. As there was no method of ſupplanting the Princes of Lorrain ſo effectually as by a coalition of intereſts with the Conſtable, ſhe propoſed the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of her grand-daughter with one of his ſons, as the bond of their future union, and Montmorency readily gave his conſent to the match. Having thus cemented their alliance, the dutcheſs employed all her influence with the King in order to confirm his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations towards peace, and to induce him to take the ſteps neceſſary for attaining it. She inſinuated that any overture of that kind would come with great propriety from the Conſtable, and if committed to the conduct of his prudence, could hardly fail of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>HENRY, long accuſtomed to devolve all affairs of importance on the Conſtable, and needing only this
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:011837_1152_0F9D896871BDAC50"/>
encouragement to return to his ancient habits, wrote to him immediately with his uſual familiarity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, impowering him, at the ſame time, to take the firſt opportunity of ſounding Philip and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with regard to peace. Montmorency made his application to Philip by the moſt proper channel. He opened himſelf to the Duke of Savoy, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the height of preferment to which he had been raiſed, and the military glory which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Spaniſh ſervice, was weary of remaining in exile, and languiſhed to return into his dominions. As there was no proſpect of his recovering poſſeſſion of theſe by force of arms, he conſidered a definitive treaty of peace between France and Spain, as the only event by which he could hope to obtain reſtitution. Being no ſtranger to Philip's private wiſhes with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to peace, he eaſily prevailed on him not only to diſcover a diſpoſition on his part towards accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to permit Montmorency to return, on his parole, to France, that he might confirm his own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in his pacifick ſentiments. Henry received the Conſtable with the moſt flattering marks of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard; abſence, inſtead of having abated or extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his friendſhip, ſeemed to have given it new ardour; and he aſſumed, from the moment of his appearance in court, a higher place, if poſſible, in his affection, and a more perfect aſcendant over his mind, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The Cardinal of Lorrain and Duke of Guiſe, prudently gave way to a tide of favour too ſtrong for them to oppoſe, and confining themſelves to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per departments, permitted, without any ſtruggle, the Conſtable and Dutcheſs of Valentinois to direct publick affairs at their pleaſure. They ſoon prevailed on the King to nominate plenipotentiaries to treat of peace. Philip did the ſame. The abbey of Cercamp was fixed on as the place of congreſs; and all milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry operations were immediately terminated by a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of arms.</p>
                  <p>WHILE theſe preliminary ſteps were taking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a treaty which reſtored tranquillity to Europe, Charles V. whoſe ambition had ſo long diſturbed it, ended his days in the monaſtry of St. Juſtus. When
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:011837_1153_0F9D896935954900"/>
Charles entered this retreat, he formed ſuch a plan of life for himſelf, as would have ſuited the condition of a private gentleman of a moderate fortune. His ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was neat but plain; his domeſticks few; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with them familiar; all the cumberſome and ceremonious forms of attendance in his perſon were entirely aboliſhed, as deſtructive of that ſocial eaſe and tranquillity which he courted in order to ſooth the remainder of his days. As the mildneſs of the climate, together with his deliverance from the burdens and cares of government procured him at firſt, a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable remiſſion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, perhaps, more complete ſatisfaction in this humble ſolitude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts and projects which had ſo long engroſſed and diſquited him, were quite effaced from his mind: Far from taking any part in the political tranſactions of the Princes of Europe, he reſtrained his curioſity even from any inquiry concerning them; and he ſeemed to view the buſy ſcene which he had abandoned with all the contempt and indifference ariſing from his thorough experience of its vanity, as well as from the pleaſing reflection of having diſentangled himſelf from its cares.</p>
                  <p>OTHER amuſements, and other objects now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied him. Sometimes he cultivated the plants in his garden with his own hands; ſometimes he rode out to the neighbouring wood on a little horſe, the only one that he kept, attended by a ſingle ſervant on foot. When in infirmities confined him to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which often happened, and deprived him of theſe more active recreations, he either admitted a few gentlemen who reſided near the monaſtry to viſit him, and entertained them familiarly at his table; or he employed himſelf in ſtudying the principles and in forming curious works of mechaniſm, of which he had always been remarkably fond, and to which his genius was peculiarly turned. With this view he had engaged Turriano, one of the moſt ingenious artiſts of that age, to accompany him in his retreat. He laboured toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him in framing models of the moſt uſeful
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:011837_1154_0F9D8969F14743D0"/>
machines, as well as making experiments with regard to their reſpective powers, and it was not ſeldom that the ideas of the monarch aſſiſted or perfected the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the artiſt. He relieved his mind, at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, with ſlighter and more fantaſtick works of mechaniſm, in faſhioning puppets, which by the ſtructure of internal ſprings, mimicked the geſtures and actions of men, to the no ſmall aſtoniſhment of the ignorant monks, who beholding movements, which they could not comprehend, ſometimes diſtruſted their own ſenſes, and ſometimes ſuſpected Charles and Turriano of being in compact with inviſible powers. He was particularly curious with regard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of clocks and watches, and having found, after repeated trials, that he could not bring any two of them to go exactly alike, he reflected, it is ſaid, with a mixture of ſurprize and regret on his own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in having beſtowed ſo much time and labour on the more vain attempt of bringing mankind to a preciſe uniformity of ſentiment concerning the intricate and myſterious doctrines of religion.</p>
                  <p>BUT in what manner ſoever Charles diſpoſed of the reſt of his time, he conſtantly reſerved a conſiderable portion of it for religious exerciſes. He regularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended divine ſervice in the chapel of the monaſtry, every morning and evening; he took great pleaſure in reading books of devotion, particularly the works of St. Auguſtine and St. Bernard; and converſed much with his confeſſor, and the prior of the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on pious ſubjects. Thus did Charles paſs the firſt year of his retreat, in a manner not unbecoming a man perfectly diſengaged from the affairs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and ſtanding on the confines of a future world either in innocent amuſement which ſoothed his pains, and relieved a mind worn out with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive application to buſineſs; or in devout occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, which he deemed neceſſary in preparing for another ſtate.</p>
                  <p>BUT about ſix months before his death, the gout, after a longer intermiſſion than uſual, returned with a proportional increaſe of violence. His ſhattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution had ſcarce vigour enough remaining to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch a ſhock. It enfeebled his mind as much as

his body, and from that period we ſcarce diſcern any traces of that ſound and maſculine underſtanding, which diſtinguiſhed Charles among his contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. An illiberal and timid, ſuperſtition depreſſed his his ſpirit. He had no reliſh for amuſements of any kind. He endeavoured to conform, in his manner of living, to all the rigour of monaſtick auſterity. He deſired no other ſociety than that of monks, and was almoſt continually employed with them in chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hymns in the Miſſal. As an expiation for his ſins, he gave himſelf the diſcipline in ſecret with ſuch ſeverity, that the whip of cords which he employed as the inſtrument of his puniſhment, was found after his deceaſe tinged with his blood. Nor was he ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe acts of mortification, which however ſevere, were not unexampled. The timorous and diſtruſtful ſolicitude which always accompanies ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition ſtill continued to diſquiet him, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating all that he had done, prompted him to aim at ſomething extraordinary, at ſome new and ſingular act of piety that would diſplay his zeal, and merit the favour of heaven. The act on which he fixed was as wild and uncommon, as any that ſuperſtition ever ſuggeſted to a weak and diſordered fancy. He reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to celebrate his own obſequies before his death. He ordered his tomb to be created in the chapel of the monaſtry. His domeſticks marched thither in fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proceſſion, with black tapers in their hands. He himſelf followed in his ſhroud. He was laid in his cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, with much ſolemnity. The ſervice for the dead was chanted, and Charles joined in the prayers which were offered up for the reſt of his ſoul, mingling his tears with thoſe which his attendants ſhed, as if they had been celebrating a real funeral. The ceremony cloſed with ſprinkling holy water on the coffin in the uſual form, and all the aſſiſtants retiring, the doors of the chapel were ſhut. Then Charles aroſe out of the coffin and withdrew to his apartment, full of theſe awful ſentiments, which ſuch a ſingular ſolemnity was calculated to inſpire. But either the fatiguing length of the ceremony, or the impreſſion which this image of death left on his mind affected him ſo much,
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:011837_1156_0F9D896B6DFE3738"/>
that the next day he was ſeized with a fever. His feeble frame could not long reſiſt its violence, and he expired on the twenty-firſt of September, after a life of fifty-eight years, ſix months, and twenty-five days<note n="*" place="bottom">Strada de Bello Belg. lib. i. p. 11.

                  <p>AS Charles was the firſt prince of the age in rank and dignity, the part which he acted, whether we conſider the greatneſs, the variety, or the ſucceſs of his undertakings, was the moſt conſpicuous. It is from an attentive obſervation of his conduct, not from the exaggerated praiſes of the Spaniſh hiſtorians, or the undiſtinguiſhing cenſure of the French, that a juſt idea of Charles's genius and abilities is to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. He poſſeſſed qualities ſo peculiar, as ſtrongly mark his character, and not only diſtinguiſh him from the Princes who were his contemporaries, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for that ſuperiority over them which he ſo long maintained. In forming his ſchemes, he was, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as by habit, cautious and conſiderate. Born with talents, which unfolded themſelves ſlowly, and were late in attaining maturity, he was accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ponder every ſubject that demanded his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with a careful and deliberate attention. He bent the whole force of his mind towards it, and dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it with a ſerious application, undiverted by pleaſure, and hardly relaxed by any amuſement, he revolved it, in ſilence in his own breaſt. He then communicated the matter to his miniſters, and after hearing their opinions, took his reſolution with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive firmneſs, which ſeldom follows ſuch ſlow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations. In conſequence of this, Charles's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, inſtead of reſembling the deſultory and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſallies of Henry VIII. or Francis I. had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a conſiſtent ſyſtem, in which all parts were arranged, the effects were foreſeen, and the accidents were provided for. His promptitude in execution was no leſs remarkable than his patience in deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He conſulted with phlegm, but he acted with vigour; and did not diſcover greater ſagacity in his choice of the meaſures which it was proper to purſue,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:011837_1157_0F9D896D06DCBAA8"/>
than fertility of genius in finding out the means for rendering his purſuit of them ſucceſsful. Though he had naturally ſo little of the martial turn, that during the moſt ardent and buſtling period of life, he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cabinet inactive, yet when he choſe at length to appear at the head of his armies, his mind was ſo formed for vigorous exertions in every direction, that he acquired ſuch knowledge in the art of war, and ſuch talents for command, as rendered him equal in reputation and ſucceſs to the moſt able generals of the age. But Charles poſſeſſed, in the moſt eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the ſcience which is of greateſt importance to a monarch, that of knowing men, and of adapting their talents to the various departments which he allotted to them. From the death of Chievres to the end of his reign, he employed no general in the field, no miniſter in the cabinet, no ambaſſador to a foreign court, no governor of a province, whoſe abilities were inadequate to the truſt which he repoſed in them. Though deſtitute of that bewitching affability of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which gained Francis the hearts of all who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached his perſon, he was no ſtranger to the virtues which ſecure fidelity and attachment. He placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence in his generals; he rewarded their ſervices with munificence; he neither envied their fame, nor diſcovered any jealouſy of their power. Almoſt all the generals who conducted his armies may be placed on a level with thoſe illuſtrious perſonages, who have attained the higheſt eminence of military glory; and his advantages over his rivals are to be aſcribed ſo manifeſtly to the ſuperior abilities of the commanders whom he ſet in oppoſition to them, that this might ſeem to detract in ſome degree, from his own merit, if the talent of diſcovering and employing ſuch inſtruments were not the moſt undoubted proof of a capacity for government.</p>
                  <p>THERE were, nevertheleſs, defects in his political character which muſt conſiderably abate the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due to his extraordinary talents. Charles's ambition was inſatiable; and though there ſeems to be no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for an opinion prevalent in his own age, that he had formed the chimerical project of eſtabliſhing an
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:011837_1158_0F9D896DAF980D30"/>
univerſal monarchy in Europe, it is certain that his deſire of being diſtinguiſhed as a conqueror involved him in continual wars, which exhauſted and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſubjects, and left him little leiſure for giving attention to the interior police and improvement of his kingdoms, the great objects of every Prince who makes the happineſs of his people the end of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Charles, at a very early period of life, having added the Imperial crown to the kingdoms of Spain, and to the hereditary dominions of the houſes of Auſtria and Burgundy, this opened to him ſuch a vaſt field of enterprize, and engaged him in ſchemes ſo complicated as well as arduous, that feeling his power to be unequal to the execution of theſe, he had often recourſe to low artifices unbecoming his ſuperior talents, and ſometimes ventured on ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations from integrity as were diſhonourable in a great Prince. His inſidious and fraudulent policy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more conſpicuous, and was rendered more odious, by a compariſon with the open and undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing character of his contemporaries Francis I. and Henry VIII. This difference, though occaſioned chiefly by the diverſity of their tempers, muſt be aſcribed, in ſome degree to ſuch an oppoſition in the principles of their political conduct as affords ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for this defect in Charles's behaviour, though it cannot ſerve as a juſtification of it. Francis and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom acted but from the impulſe of their paſſions, and ruſhed headlong towards the object in view. Charles's meaſures being the reſult of cool reflection, were diſpoſed into a regular ſyſtem, and carried on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a concerted plan. Perſons who act in the former manner naturally purſue the end in view without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming any diſguiſe, or diſplaying much addreſs. Such as hold the latter courſe are apt, in forming as well as in executing their deſigns, to employ ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements, as always lead to artifice in conduct and often degenerate into deceit.</p>
                  <p>THE circumſtances tranſmitted to us, with reſpect to Charles's private deportment and character, are fewer and leſs intereſting, than might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pected, from the great number of authors who have
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:011837_1159_0F9D896E700A5AE8"/>
undertaken to write an account of his Life. Theſe are not the object of this hiſtory, which aims at repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the tranſactions of the reign of Charles V. not at delineating his private virtues or defects.</p>
                  <p>MEANWHILE the plenipotentiaries of France, Spain and England continued their conferences at Cercamp; and though each of them, with the uſual art of nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators, made at firſt very high demands in name of their repective courts, yet as they were all equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of peace, they would have conſented recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to ſuch abatements and reſtrictions of their claims as muſt have removed every obſtacle to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The death of Charles V. was a new motive with Philip to haſten the concluſion of a treaty, as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his impatience for returning into Spain, where there was now no perſon greater or more illuſtrious than himſelf. But in ſpite of the concurring wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of all the parties intereſted, an event happened which occaſioned an unavoidable delay in their negociations. About a month after the opening of the conferences at Cercamp, Mary of England ended her ſhort and inglorious reign, and Elizabeth her ſiſter was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proclaimed Queen by the Engliſh with univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal joy. As the powers of the Engliſh plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries expired on the death of their miſtreſs, they could not proceed until they received a commiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from their new ſovereign.</p>
                  <p>HENRY and Philip beheld Elizabeth's elevation to the throne with equal ſolicitude. As during Mary's jealous adminiſtration, under the moſt difficult cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and in a ſituation extremely delicate, ſhe had conducted herſelf with prudence and addreſs far exceeding her years, they had conceived an high idea of her abilities, and already formed expectations of a reign very different from that of her ſiſter. Equally ſenſible of the importance of gaining her favour, both monarchs ſet themſelves with emulation to court it, and employed every art in order to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into her confidence. Each of them had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meritorious, with regard to Elizabeth, to plead in his own behalf. Henry had offered her a retreat in his dominions, if the dread of her ſiſter's violence
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:011837_1160_0F9D896F2FA73030"/>
ſhould force her to fly for ſafety out of England. Philip had, by his powerful interceſſion, prevented Mary from proceeding to the moſt fatal extremities againſt her. Each of them endeavoured now, to avail himſelf of the circumſtances in his favour. Henry wrote to Elizabeth ſoon after her acceſſion, with the warmeſt expreſſions of regard and friendſhip. He repreſented the war which had unhappily been kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led between their kingdoms, not as a national quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but as the effect of Mary's blind partiality to her huſband and fond compliance with all his wiſhes. He entreated her to diſengage herſelf from an alliance which had proved ſo unfortunate to England, and to conſent to a ſeparate peace with him, without ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her intereſts with thoſe of Spain, from which they ought now to be altogether disjoined. Philip on the other hand, unwilling to loſe his connection with England, the importance of which during a rupture with France he had ſo recently experienced, not only vied with Henry in declarations of eſteem for Elizabeth, and in profeſſions of his reſolution to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the ſtricteſt amity with her, but in order to confirm and perpetuate their union, he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her in marriage, and undertook to procure a diſpenſation from the Pope to that effect.</p>
                  <p>ELIZABETH weighed the propoſals of the two Monarchs attentively, and with that provident diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of her true intereſt which was conſpicuous in all her deliberations. She gave ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Henry's overture of a ſeparate negotiation, becauſe it opened a channel of correſpondence with France, which ſhe might find to be of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if Philip ſhould not diſcover ſufficient zeal and ſolicitude for ſecuring to her proper terms in the joint treaty. But ſhe ventured on this with the utmoſt reſerve and caution, that ſhe might not alarm Philip's ſuſpicious temper, and loſe an ally in attemping to gain an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes i. p. 4.</note>. Henry himſelf, by an unpardonable act of indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prevented her from carrying her intercourſe with him to ſuch a length as might have offended or alienated Philip. At the very time he was courting Elizabeth's
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:011837_1161_0F9D896FEE551D50"/>
friendſhip with the greateſt aſſiduity, he yielded with an inconſiderate facility to the ſolicitations of the Princes of Lorrain, and allowed his daughter-in-law the Queen of Scots to aſſume the title and arms of England. This ill-timed pretenſion, the ſource of many calamities to the unfortunate Queen of Scots, extinguiſhed at once all the confidence that might have grown between Henry and Elizabeth, and left in its place diſtruſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and antipathy. Elizabeth found that ſhe muſt unite her intereſts cloſely with Philip's, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect peace only from negociations carried on in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him<note n="†" place="bottom">Strype's Annals of the Reformation, i. 11.

                  <p>AS ſhe had granted a commiſſion, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her acceſſion, to the ſame plenipotentiaries whom her ſiſter had employed, ſhe now inſtructed them to act in every point in concert with the plenipotentiaries of Spain, and to take no ſtep until they had previouſly conſulted with them <note n="*" place="bottom">Forbes full view, i. 1. 37, 40.</note>. But though ſhe deemed it prudent to aſſume this appearance of confidence in the Spaniſh Monarch, ſhe knew preciſely how far to carry it; and diſcovered no inclination to accept of that extraordinary propoſal of marriage which Philip had made to her. The Engliſh had expreſſed ſo openly the deteſtation of her ſiſter's choice of him, that it would have been highly imprudent to have exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them by renewing that odious alliance. She was too well acquainted with Philip's harſh imperious temper, to think of him for a huſband. Nor could ſhe admit a diſpenſation from the Pope to be ſufficient to authorize her marrying him, without condemning her father's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and acknowledging of conſequence that her mother's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was null and her own birth illegitimate. But though ſhe determined not to yield to Philip's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, the ſituation of her affairs rendered it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reject them; ſhe returned her anſwer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in terms which were evaſive, but ſo tempered with reſpect, that though they gave him no reaſon to be ſecure of ſucceſs, they did not altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his hopes.</p>
                  <p>BY this artifice, as well as by the prudence with
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:011837_1162_0F9D8970B11C0968"/>
which ſhe concealed her ſentiments and intentions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, for ſome time after her acceſſion, ſhe ſo far gained upon Philip, that he warmly eſpouſed her intereſt in the conferences which were renewed at Cercamp, and afterwards removed to Chateau-Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſis. A definitive treaty, which was to adjuſt the claims and pretenſions of ſo many Princes, required the examination of ſuch a variety of intricate points, and led to ſuch infinite and minute details, as drew out the negociations to a great length. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Montmorency exerted himſelf with ſuch indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable zeal and induſtry, repairing alternately to the courts of Paris and Bruſſels, in order to obviate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move every difficulty, that all points in diſpute were adjuſted, at length, in ſuch a manner, as to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction, in every particular, to Henry and Philip; and the laſt hand was ready to be put to the treaty between them.</p>
                  <p>THE claims of England remained as the only obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to retard it. Elizabeth demanded the reſtitution of Calais, in the moſt preremptory tone, as an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial condition of her conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ting to peace; Henry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give up that important conqueſt; and both ſeemed to have taken their reſolution with unalterable firmneſs. Philip warmly ſupported Elizabeth's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to Calais, not merely from a principle of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the Engliſh nation, that he might appear to have contributed to their recovering what they had loſt by eſpouſing his cauſe; nor ſolely with a view of ſoothing Elizabeth by this manifeſtation of zeal for her intereſt; but in order to render France leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, by ſecuring to her ancient enemy this eaſy acceſs into the heart of the kingdom. The earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however, with which he ſeconded the arguments of the Engliſh plenipotentiaries, ſoon began to relax. During the courſe of the negociation, Elizabeth, who now felt herſelf firmly ſeated on the throne, began to take ſuch open and vigorous meaſures not only for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning all that her ſiſter had done in favour of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, but for eſtabliſhing the proteſtant church on a firm foundation, as convinced Philip that his hopes of an union with her had been from the beginning vain,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:011837_1163_0F9D897175638E88"/>
and were now deſperate. From that period, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitions in her favour became more cold and formal, flowing merely from regard to decorum, or from the conſideration of remote political intereſts. Elizabeth having reaſon to expect ſuch an alteration in his conduct, quickly perceived it. But as nothing would have been of greater detriment to her people, or more inconſiſtent with her ſchemes of domeſtick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, than the continuance of a war with France, ſhe ſaw the neceſſity of ſubmitting to ſuch conditions as the ſituation of her affairs impoſed, and that ſhe muſt lay her account with being deſerted by an ally who was now united to her by a very feeble tie, if ſhe did not ſpeedily reduce her demands to what was moderate and attainable. She accordingly gave new inſtructions to her ambaſſadors; and Philip's plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries acting as mediators between the French and them<note n="†" place="bottom">Forbes, i. 50.</note>, an expedient was fallen on, which juſtified, in ſome degree, Elizabeth's departing from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of her firſt demand with regard to Calais. All leſſer articles were ſettled without much diſcuſſion or delay. Philip, that he might not appear to have abandoned the Engliſh, inſiſted that the treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Henry and Elizabeth ſhould be concluded in form, before that between the French monarch and him. The one was ſigned on the ſecond day of April, the other on the day following.</p>
                  <p>THE treaty of peace between France and England contained no articles of real importance, but that which reſpected Calais. It was ſtipulated that the King of France ſhould retain poſſeſſion of that town, with all its dependencies, during eight years; that, at the expiration of that term, he ſhould reſtore it to England; that in caſe of non-performance, he ſhould forfeit five hundred thouſand crowns, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which ſum, ſeven or eight wealthy merchants, who were not his ſubjects, ſhould grant ſecurity; that five perſons of diſtinction ſhould be given as hoſtages till that ſecurity were provided; that, although the forfeit of five hundred thouſand crowns ſhould be paid, the right of England to Calais ſhould ſtill remain
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:011837_1164_0F9D8972304A6188"/>
entire, in the ſame manner as if the term of eight years were expired; that the King and Queen of Scotland ſhould be included in the treaty; that if they, or the French King, ſhould violate the peace by any hoſtile action, Henry ſhould be obliged inſtantly to reſtore Calais; that on the other hand, if any breach of the treaty proceeded from Elizabeth, then Henry and the King and Queen of Scots were abſolved from all the engagements which they had come under by this treaty.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the ſtudied attention with which ſo many precautions were taken, it is evident that Henry did not intend the reſtitution of Calais, nor is it probable that Elizabeth expected it. It was hardly poſſible that ſhe could maintain, during the courſe of eight years, ſuch perfect concord both with France and Scotland, as not to afford Henry ſome pretext for alledging that ſhe had violated the treaty. But even if that term ſhould elapſe without any ground for complaint, Henry might then chuſe to pay the ſum ſtipulated, and Elizabeth had no method of aſſerting her right but by force of arms. However, by throwing the articles in the treaty with regard to Calais into this form, Elizabeth ſatisfied her ſubjects of every denomination; ſhe gave men of diſcernment a ſtriking proof of her addreſs, in palliating what ſhe could not prevent; and amuſed the multitude, to whom the final ſurrender of a place of ſuch import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance would have appeared altogether infamous, with the proſpect of recovering in a ſhort time that favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>THE expedient which Montmorency employed, in order to facilitate the concluſion of peace between France and Spain, was the negociating two treaties of marriage, one between Elizabeth, Henry's eldeſt daughter, and Philip, who ſupplanted his ſon, the unfortunate Don Carlos, to whom that Princeſs had been promiſed in the former conferences at Cercamp, the other between Margaret, Henry's only ſiſter, and the duke of Savoy. For feeble as the ties of blood of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are among Princes, or how little ſoever they may regard them when puſhed on to act by motives of
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:011837_1165_0F9D8972F0247680"/>
ambition they aſſume on other occaſions the appearance of being ſo far influenced by theſe domeſtick affections, as to employ them to juſtify meaſures and conceſſions which they find to be neceſſary, but know to be impolitic or diſhonourable. Such was the uſe Henry made of the two marriages to which he gave his conſent. Having ſecured an honourable eſtabliſhment for his ſiſter and his daughter, he, in conſideration of theſe, granted terms both to Philip and the Duke of Savoy, of which he would not, on any other account, have ventured to approve.</p>
                  <p>THE principal articles in the treaty between France and Spain were, That a ſincere and perpetual amity ſhould be eſtabliſhed between the two crowns and their reſpective allies; that the two monarchs ſhould labour in concert to procure the convocation of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral council, in order to check the progreſs of hereſy, and reſtore unity and concord to the Chriſtian church; that all conqueſts made by either party, on this ſide of the Alps, ſince the commencement of the war in one thouſand five hundred and fifty-one, ſhould be mutually reſtored; that the dutchy of Savoy, the principality of Piedmont, the country of Breſſe, and all the other territories formerly ſubject to the dukes of Savoy, ſhould be reſtored to Emanuel Philibert, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the celebration of his marriage with Margaret of France, the towns of Turin, Quiers, Pignerol, Chivaz and Villanova excepted, of which Henry ſhould keep poſſeſſion until his claims on that Prince, in right of his grand-mother, ſhould be heard and decided in courſe of law; that as long as Henry retained theſe places in his hands, Philip ſhould be at liberty to keep garriſons in the towns of Vercelli and Aſti; that the French King ſhould immediately eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate all the places which he held in Tuſcany and the Sieneſe, and renounce all future pretenſions to them; that he ſhould reſtore the Marquiſate of Montferrat to the duke of Mantua; that he ſhould receive the Genoeſe into favour, and give up to them the towns which he had conquered in the iſland of Corſica; that none of the Princes or ſtates, to whom theſe ceſſions were made, ſhould call their ſubjects to account for
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:011837_1166_0F9D8973B72BD338"/>
any part of their conduct while under the dominion of their enemies, but ſhould bury all paſt tranſactions in oblivion. The Pope, the Emperor, the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, the King and Queen of Scots, and almoſt every Prince and ſtate in Chriſtendom, were comprehended in this pacification as the allies either of Henry or of Philip<note n="*" place="bottom">Recuell des Traitez, t. ii. 287.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THUS, by this famous treaty, peace was re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Europe. All the cauſes of diſcord which had ſo long embroiled the powerful monarchs of France and Spain, which had tranſmitted hereditary quarrels and wars from Charles to Philip, and from Francis to Henry, ſeemed to be wholly removed, or finally terminated: The French alone complained of the unequal conditions of a treaty, into which an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious miniſter, in order to recover his liberty, and an artful miſtreſs, than ſhe might gratify her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had ſeduced their too eaſy monarch. They exclaimed loudly againſt the folly of giving up to the enemies of France, an hundred and eighty-nine fortified places in the Low-Countries or in Italy, in return for the three inſignificant towns of St. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, Ham and Catelet. They conſidered it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible ſtain upon the glory of the nation, to renounce in one day territories ſo extenſive, and ſo capable of being defended, that the enemy could not have hoped to wreſt them out of their hands, after many years of victory and ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>BUT Henry, without regarding the ſentiments of his people, or being moved by the remonſtrances of his council, ratified the treaty, and executed with great fidelity whatever he had ſtipulated to perform. The duke of Savoy repaired with a numerous retinue to Paris, in order to celebrate his marrriage with Henry's ſiſter. The duke of Alva was ſent to the ſame capital, at the head of a ſplendid embaſſy, to eſpouſe Elizabeth in name of his maſter. They were received with extraordinary magnificence by the French court. Amidſt the rejoicings and feſtivities on that occaſion, Henry's days were cut ſhort by a
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:011837_1167_0F9D8974747E2BE0"/>
ſingular and tragical accident. His ſon, Francis II. a Prince under age of a feeble conſtitution, and of a mind ſtill weaker, ſucceeded him. Soon after Paul ended his violent and imperious Pontificate, at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with all the world, and diſguſted even with own nephews. They, perſecuted by Philip, and deſerted by the ſucceeding Pope, whom they had raiſed by their influence to the Papal throne, were condemned to the puniſhment which their crimes and ambition had merited, and their death was as infamous, as their lives had been criminal. Thus all the perſonages, who had long ſuſtained the principal characters on the great theatre of Europe, diſappeared about the ſame time. A more known period of hiſtory opens at this aera; other actors appear on the ſtage, with different views and different paſſions; new conteſts aroſe, and new ſchemes of ambition occupied and diſquieted mankind.</p>
                  <p>UPON reviewing the tranſactions of any active pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, in the hiſtory of civilized nations, the changes which are accompliſhed appear wonderfully diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the efforts which have been exerted. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts are never very extenſive or rapid, but among nations, whoſe progreſs in improvement is extremely unequal. When Alexander the Great, at the head of a gallant people, of ſimple manners, and formed to war by admirable military inſtitutions, invaded a ſtate ſunk in luxury, and enervated by exceſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement; when Genchizcan and Tamerlane, with their armies of hardy barbarians, poured in upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enfeebled by the climate in which they lived, or by the arts and commerce which they cultivated, they like a torrent, ſwept every thing before them, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing kingdoms and provinces in as ſhort ſpace of time as was requiſite to march through them. But when nations are in a ſimilar ſtate, and keep pace with each other in their advances towards refinement, they are not expoſed to the calamity of ſudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Their acquiſitions of knowledge, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the art of war, their political ſagacity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, are nearly equal. The fate of ſtates in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, depends not on a ſingle battle. Their internal
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:011837_1168_0F9D897530CE3788"/>
reſources are many and various. Nor are they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone intereſted in their own ſafety, or active in their own defence. Other ſtates interpoſe, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance any temporary advantage which either party may have acquired. After the fierceſt and moſt lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conteſt, all the rival nations are exhauſted, none are conquered. At length a peace is concluded, which re-inſtates each in poſſeſſion of almoſt the ſame power, and the ſame territories.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the ſtate of Europe during the reign of Charles V. No Prince was ſo much ſuperior to the reſt in power, as to render his efforts irreſiſtible, and his conqueſts eaſy. No nation had made progreſs in improvement ſo far beyond its neighbours, as to have acquired a very manifeſt pre-eminence. Each ſtate derived ſome advantage, or was ſubject to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, from its ſituation or its climate; each was diſtinguiſhed by ſomething peculiar in the genius of its people, or the conſtitution of its government, But the advantages poſſeſſed by one, were counter-balanced by circumſtances favourable to others; and this prevented any from attaining ſuch ſuperiority as might have been fatal to all. The nations of Europe in that age, as in the preſent, were like one great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; there were ſome features common to all, which fixed a reſemblance; there were certain peculiarities conſpicuous in each, which marked a diſtinction. But there was not among them that wide diverſity of character and of genius which, in almoſt every period of hiſtory, hath exalted the Europeans above the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the other quarters of the globe, and ſeems to have deſtined the one to rule, and the other to obey.</p>
                  <p>BUT though the near reſemblance and equality in improvement among the different nations of Europe, prevented the reign of Charles V. from being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by ſuch ſudden and extenſive conqueſts, as occur in ſome other periods of hiſtory, yet, during the courſe of his adminiſtration, all the conſiderable ſtates in Europe ſuffered a remarkable change in their political ſituation, and felt the influence of events, which have not hitherto ſpent their force, but ſtill
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:011837_1169_0F9D8975EE818C50"/>
continue to operate in a greater or in a leſs degree. It was during his reign, and in conſequence of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual efforts to which his enterprizing ambition rouzed them, that the different kingdoms of Europe acquired internal vigour, that they diſcerned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of which they were poſſeſſed, that they came both to feel their own ſtrength, and to know how to render it formidable to others. It was during his reign, too, that the different kingdoms of Europe, formerly ſingle and disjoined, became ſo thoroughly acquainted, and ſo intimately connected with each other, as to form one great political ſyſtem, in which each took a ſtation, wherein it has remained ſince that time with leſs variation, than could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected after the events of two active centuries.</p>
                  <p>THE progreſs, however, and acquiſitions of the houſe of Auſtria, were not only greater than thoſe of any other power, but more diſcernible and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I have already enumerated the vaſt territories which deſcended to Charles from his Auſtrian, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundian, and Spaniſh anceſtors <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. i. p, 331</note>. To theſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf added the Imperial dignity; and, as if all this had been too little, the bounds of the univerſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and a new world ſubjected to his command. Upon his reſignation, the Burgundian provinces, and the Spaniſh kingdoms with their dependencies, both in the old and new worlds, devolved to Philip. But Charles tranſmitted his dominions to his ſon, in a condition very different from that in which he had received them. They were augmented by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new provinces; they were habituated to obey an adminiſtration which was no leſs vigorous than ſteady; they were accuſtomed to expenſive and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering efforts, which, though neceſſary in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts between civilized nations, had been little known in Europe before the ſixteenth century. The provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Frieſland, Utrecht and Overyſſel, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by purchaſe from their former proprietors, and the dutchy of Gelders, of which he made himſelf maſter, partly by force of arms, and partly by the
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:011837_1170_0F9D8976B2D6BD70"/>
arts of negociation, were additions of great value to his Burgundian dominions. Ferdinand and Iſabella had tranſmitted to him all the provinces of Spain, from the bottom of the Pyrenees to the frontiers of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; but as he maintained a perpetual peace with that kingdom, amidſt the various efforts of his enterpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ambition, he made no acquiſition of territory in that quarter.</p>
                  <p>CHARLES had gained, however, a vaſt acceſſion of power in this part of his dominions. By this ſucceſs in the war with the commons of Caſtile, he exalted the regal prerogative on the ruins of the privileges of the people. Though he allowed the name of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to remain, and the formality of holding it to be continued, he reduced its authority and juriſdiction to nothing, and modelled it in ſuch a manner, that it became rather a junto of the ſervants of the crown, than an aſſembly of the repreſentatives of the people. One member of the conſtitution being thus lopped off, it was impoſſible but that the other muſt feel the ſtroke, and ſuffer by it. The ſuppreſſion of the popular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rendered the ariſtocratical leſs formidable. The grandees, prompted by the warlike ſpirit of the age, or allured by the honours which they enjoyed in a court, exhauſted their fortunes in military ſervice, or in attending on the perſon of their Prince. They did not dread, perhaps did not obſerve, the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous progreſs of the royal authority, which leaving them the vain diſtinction of being covered in preſence of their ſovereign, ſtripped them by degrees of that real power which they poſſeſſed while they formed one body, and acted in concert with the people. Charles's ſucceſs in aboliſhing the privileges of the commons, and in breaking the power of the nobles of Caſtile, encouraged Philip to invade the liberties of Aragon, which were ſtill more extenſive. The Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, accuſtomed to ſubjection themſelves, aſſiſted in impoſing the yoke on their more happy and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant neighbours. The will of the ſovereign became the ſupreme law in all the kingdoms of Spain; and Princes who were not checked in their plans by the jealouſy of the people, nor controuled in the execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:011837_1171_0F9D89777354B388"/>
them by the power of the nobles, could both aim at great objects and call forth the whole ſtrength of the monarchy in order to attain them.</p>
                  <p>AS Charles, by extending the regal prerogative, rendered the monarchs of Spain maſters at home, he added new dignity and power to their crown by his foreign acquiſitions. He ſecured to Spain the quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom of Naples, which Ferdinand had uſurped by fraud, and held with difficulty. He united the dutchy of Milan, one of the moſt fertile and populous provinces in Italy, to the Spaniſh crown; and left his ſucceſſors, even without taking their other territories into the account, the moſt conſiderable Princes in that country, which had been long the theatre of contention to the great powers of Europe, and in which they had ſtruggled with emulation to obtain the ſuperiority. When the French, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the treaty of Chateau-Cambreſis, withdrew their forces out of Italy, and finally relinquiſhed all their ſchemes of conqueſt on that ſide of the Alps, the Spaniſh dominions there roſe in importance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled their Kings, as long as the monarchy retained any degree of vigour, to preſerve the chief ſway in all the tranſactions of that country. But whatever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion either of interior authority or of foreign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Charles gained for the monarchs of Spain in Europe, it was inconſiderable when compared with his acquiſitions in the new world. He added, there, not provinces, but empires to his crown. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered territories of ſuch immenſe extent; he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſuch inexhauſtible veins of wealth, and opened ſuch boundleſs proſpects of every kind, as muſt have rouzed and called forth to action his ſucceſſor, though his ambition had been much leſs ardent than Philip's and muſt have rendered him not only enterprizing but formidable.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the elder branch of the Auſtrian family roſe to ſuch pre-eminence in Spain, the younger of which Ferdinand was the head, grew to be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Germany. The ancient hereditary dominions of the houſe of Auſtria in Germany, united to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia, which Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:011837_1172_0F9D89785CEACD30"/>
had acquired by marriage, formed a reſpectable power, and when the Imperial dignity was added to theſe, Ferdinand poſſeſſed territories more extenſive than had belonged to any Prince, Charles V. except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had been at the head of the Empire during ſeveral ages. Fortunately for Europe, the diſguſt which Philip conceived, on account of Ferdinand's refuſing to relinquiſh the Imperial crown in his favour not only prevented for ſome time the ſeparate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the houſe of Auſtria from acting in concert, but occaſioned a viſible alienation and rivalſhip. By degrees, however, regard to the intereſt of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily extinguiſhed this impolitic animoſity. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which was natural returned; the aggrandiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the houſe of Auſtria became the common object of all their ſchemes; they gave and received aſſiſtance alternately towards the execution of them; and each derived conſideration and importance from the other's ſucceſs. A family ſo great and ſo aſpiring became the general object of jealouſy and terror. All the power as well as policy of Europe were exerted dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a century, in order to check and humble it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can give a more ſtriking idea of the aſcendant which it had acquired, and of the terror which it had inſpired, than that after its vigour was ſpent with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exertions of its ſtrength, after Spain was become only the ſhadow of a great name, and its monarchs were ſunk into debility and dotage, the houſe of Auſtria ſtill continued to be formidable. The nations of Europe had ſo often felt its ſuperior power, and had been ſo conſtantly employed in guarding againſt it, that the dread of it became a kind of political habit, the influence of which remained when the cauſes, which had formed it, ceaſed to exiſt.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the houſe of Auſtria went on with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in enlarging its dominions, France made no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable acquiſition of new territory. All its ſchemes of conqueſt in Italy had proved abortive; it had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obtained no eſtabliſhment of conſequence in the new world; and after the continued and vigorous efforts of four ſucceſſive reigns, the confines of the
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:011837_1173_0F9D8978EE4CC498"/>
kingdom were much the ſame as Louis XI. had left them. But though France made not ſuch large ſtrides towards dominion as the houſe of Auſtria, it continued to advance by ſteps which were more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe they were gradual and leſs obſerved. The conqueſt of Calais put it out of the power of the Engliſh to invade France but at their utmoſt peril, and delivered the French from the dread of their ancient enemies, who, previous to that event, could at any time penetrate into the kingdom by that avenue, and thereby retard or defeat the execution of their beſt concerted enterprizes againſt any foreign power. The important acquiſition of Metz covered that part of their frontier which formerly was moſt feeble, and lay moſt expoſed to inſult. France, from the time of its obtaining theſe additional ſecurities againſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal invaſion, muſt be deemed the moſt powerful king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Europe, and is more fortunately ſituated than any on the continent, either for conqueſts or defence. From the confines of Artois to the bottom of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees, and from the Britiſh channel to the frontiers of Savoy and the coaſt of the Mediterranean, its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories lay compact and unmingled with thoſe of any other power. Several of the conſiderable provinces, which, by their having been long ſubject to the great vaſſals of the crown, who were often at variance or at war with their maſter, had contracted a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance, were now accuſtomed to recognize and to obey one ſovereign. As they became members of the ſame monarchy, they aſſumed the ſentiments of that body into which they were incorporated, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated with zeal towards promoting its intereſt and honour. The power and influence wreſted from the nobles were ſeized by the crown. The people were not admitted to ſhare in theſe ſpoils; they gained no new privilege; they acquired no additional weight in the legiſlator. It was not for the ſake of the people, but in order to extend their own prerogative, that the monarchs of France had laboured to humble their great vaſſals. Satisfied with having brought them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der entire ſubjection to the crown, they diſcovered no ſolicitude to free the people from their ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the nobles of whom they held.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="unknown:011837_1174_0F9D8979B12734C8"/>A MONARCH, at the head of a kingdom thus united at home and ſecure from abroad, was entitled to form great deſigns, becauſe he felt himſelf in a condition to execute them. The foreign wars which had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little interruption from the acceſſion of Charles VIII. had not only cheriſhed and augmented the martial genius of the nation, but by inuring the troops during the courſe of long ſervice to the fatigues of war, and accuſtoming them to obedience, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the force of diſcipline to their natural order. A gallant and active body of nobles who conſidered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as idle and uſeleſs, unleſs when they were in the field; who were ſcarce acquainted with any paſtime or exerciſe but what was military; and who knew no road to power, or fame, or wealth, but war, would not have ſuffered their ſovereign to remain long in inaction. The people, little acquainted with the arts of peace, and always ready to take arms at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their ſuperiors, were accuſtomed by the vaſt expence of long wars, carried on in diſtant countries, to bear impoſitions, which, how inconſiderable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſeem if eſtimated by the exorbitant rate of modern actions, appear immenſe when compared with the ſums levied in France, or in any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Europe, previous to the reign of Louis XI. As all the members of which the ſtate was compoſed were thus impatient for action, and capable of great efforts, the ſchemes and operations of France muſt have been no leſs formidable to Europe than thoſe of Spain. The ſuperior advantages of its ſituation, the contiguity and compactneſs of its territories, together with the peculiar ſtate of its political conſtitution at that juncture muſt have rendered its enterprizes ſtill more alarming and more deceſive. The King poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a degree of power as gave him the entire command of his ſubjects; the people were ſtrangers to thoſe occupations and habits of life which render men averſe to war, or unfit for it; and the nobles, though reduced to ſubordination neceſſary in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government, ſtill retained the high undaunted ſpirit which was the effect of their ancient indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The vigour of the Feudal times remained,
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:011837_1175_0F9D897A71BA3D68"/>
their anarchy was at an end; and the Kings of France could avail themſelves of the martial ardour which that ſingular inſtitution had kindled or kept alive, without being expoſed to any of the dangers or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which are inſeparable from it when in intire force.</p>
                  <p>A KINGDOM in ſuch a ſtate is, perhaps, capable of greater military efforts, than at any other period in its progreſs. But how formidable ſoever or fatal to the other nations of Europe, the power of ſuch a monarchy might have been, the civil wars which broke out in France, ſaved them at that juncture from feeling its effects. Theſe wars, of which religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the pretext and ambition the cauſe; wherein great abilities were diſplayed by the leaders of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent factions, and little conduct or firmneſs were manifeſted by the crown under a ſucceſſion of weak Princes, kept France occupied and embroiled for half a century. During theſe commotions, the internal ſtrength of the kingdom was much waſted, and ſuch a ſpirit of anarchy was ſpread among the nobles, to whom rebellion was familiar, and the reſtraint of laws unknown, that a conſiderable interval became requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, not only for recruiting the internal vigour of the nation, but for re-eſtabliſhing the authority of the Prince; ſo that it was long before France could turn her whole attention towards foreign tranſactions, or act with her proper force in foreign wars. It was long before ſhe roſe to that aſcendant in Europe, which ſhe has maintained ſince the adminiſtration of Cardinal Richlieu, and which the ſituation as well as extent of the kingdom, the nature of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the character of her people, entitle her to maintain.</p>
                  <p>WHILE the kingdoms on the continent grew into power and conſequence, England likewiſe made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable progreſs towards regular government and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſtrength. Henry VIII. probably without inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and certainly without any conſiſtent plan, of which his nature was incapable, purſued the ſcheme
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:011837_1176_0F9D897B31F8D4D8"/>
of depreſſing the nobility, which the policy of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Henry VII. had begun. The pride and caprice of his temper led him to employ chiefly new men in the adminiſtration of affairs, becauſe he found them moſt obſequious, or leaſt ſcrupulous; and he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferred on theſe ſuch plenitude of power, but exalted them to ſuch pre-eminence in dignity, as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and degraded the ancient nobility. By the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation or ſale of the church lands, which were diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated with a profuſion not inferior to the rapaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which they had been ſeized, as well as by the privilege granted by the ancient landholders of ſelling their eſtates, or diſpoſing of them by will, an immenſe property, formerly locked up, being brought into circulation, put the ſpirit of induſtry and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in motion, and gave it ſome conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of vigour. The road to power and to opulence became open to perſons of every condition. A ſudden and exceſſive flow of wealth from the Weſt Indies proved fatal to induſtry in Spain; a moderate acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in England to the ſum in circulation gave life to commerce, awakened the ingenuity of the nation, and and excited it to uſeful enterprize. In France, what the nobles loſt the crown gained. In England, the commons were gainers as well as the King. Power and influence accompanied of courſe the property which they acquired. They roſe to conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their fellow ſubjects; they began to feel their own importance; and extending their influence in the legiſlative body gradually, and often when neither they themſelves nor others foreſaw all the effect of their claims and pretenſions, they at laſt attained that high authority, to which the Britiſh conſtitution is indebted for the exiſtence, and muſt owe the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of its liberty. At the ſame time that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſtitution advanced towards perfection, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral incidents brought on a change in the ancient ſyſtem with reſpect to foreign powers, and introduced ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more beneficial to the nation. By diſclaiming the ſupremacy and juriſdiction of the Papal See, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſums were ſaved to the nation, of which it had been annually drained, by remittances to Rome
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:011837_1177_0F9D897C0296AC88"/>
for diſpenſations and indulgences, or in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expence of pilgrimages into foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note n="*" place="bottom">The loſs which the nation ſuſtained by moſt of theſe articles is obvious, and muſt have been great. Even that by pilgrimages was not inconſiderable In the year 1428, licence was obtained by no fewer than 916 perſons to viſit the ſhrine of St. James of Compoſtella in Spain. Rymer, vol x. In 1434, the number of pilgrims to the ſame place was 2460. Ibid. In 1445, they were 2100 vol. xi.</note>, or by payment of annates, firſt fruits, and a thouſand other taxes which that artful and rapacious court levied on the credulity of mankind. The idea of a juriſdiction different from the civil powers, and claiming not only to be independant but ſuperior to it, a wild ſoleciſm in government, apt not only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and diſquiet weak minds, but tending directly to diſturb ſociety, was finally aboliſhed. Government became more ſimple as well as more reſpectable, when no rank or character exempted any perſon from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amenable to the ſame courts, from being tried by the ſame judges, and from being acquitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the ſame laws.</p>
                  <p>BY the loſs of Calais the Engliſh were excluded from the continent. All ſchemes for invading France became of courſe as chimerical as they had formerly been pernicious. The views of the Engliſh were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, firſt by neceſſity, and afterwards from choice with in their own iſland. That rage for conqueſt which had poſſeſſed the nation during many centuries, and waſted its ſtrength in perpetual and fruitleſs wars, at length ceaſed. Thoſe active ſpirits which had known and followed no profeſſion but war, ſought for occupation in the arts of peace, and their country benefited as much by the one as it had ſuffered by the other. The nation, exhauſted by frequent expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the continent, recruited, and acquired new ſtrength; and when rouzed by any extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency to take part in foreign operations, the vigour of its efforts were proportionally great, becauſe they were only occaſional and of a ſhort continuance.</p>
                  <p>THE ſame principle which had led England to adopt this new ſyſtem with regard to the powers on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent occaſioned a change in its plan of conduct with reſpect to Scotland, the only foreign ſtate, with
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:011837_1178_0F9D897CAF247B40"/>
which, on account of its ſituation in the ſame iſland, the Engliſh had ſuch a cloſe connection as demanded their perpetual attention. Inſtead of proſecuting the ancient ſcheme of conquering that kingdom, which the nature of the country, defended by a brave and hardy people, rendered dangerous if not impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it appeared more eligible to endeavour at ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch influence in Scotland as might exempt England from any danger or diſquiet from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The national poverty of the Scots, together with the violence and animoſity of their factions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the execution of this plan eaſy to a people far ſuperior to them in wealth. Their popular leaders were gained; the miniſters and favourites of the crown were corrupted; and ſuch abſolute direction of their councils acquired, as rendered the operations of the one kingdom dependant in a great meaſure on the ſovereign of the other. Such perfect external ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty added to the interior advantages which England now poſſeſſed, muſt ſoon have raiſed it to new conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and importance; the long reign of Elizabeth, equally conſpicuous for wiſdom, for ſteadineſs, and for vigour, accelerated its progreſs, and carried it with greater rapidity towards that elevated ſtation which it hath ſince held among the powers of Europe.</p>
                  <p>DURING the period in which the political ſtate of the great kingdoms underwent ſuch changes, revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conſiderable importance happened in that of the ſecondary or inferior powers. Thoſe in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal court are moſt obvious, and of more extenſive conſequence.</p>
                  <p>IN the Preliminary Work, I have mentioned the riſe of that ſpiritual juriſdiction which the Popes claim as Vicars of Jeſus Chriſt, and have traced the progreſs of that authority which they poſſeſs as temporal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 99.</note>. There was nothing previous to the reign of Charles V. that tended to circumſcribe or to moderate their authority, but ſcience and philoſophy, which began to revive and to be cultivated. The progreſs of theſe, however, was ſtill inconſiderable; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways operate ſlowly; and it is long before their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

reaches the people, or can produce any ſenſible effect upon them. They may perhaps gradually, and in along courſe of years, undermine and ſhake an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed ſyſtem of falſe religion, but there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their having overturned one.

                  <p>LUTHER had attacked the Papal ſupremacy with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapons, and with an impetuoſity more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. The time and manner of his attack concurred with a multitude of circumſtances, which have been explained, in giving him immediate ſucceſs. The charm which had bound mankind for ſo many ages was broken at once. The human mind, which had continued long as tame and paſſive, as if it had been formed to believe whatever was taught, and to bear whatever was impoſed, rouſed of a ſudden and became inquiſitive, mutinous, and diſdainful of the yoke to which it had hitherto ſubmitted. That wonderful ferment and agitation of mind, which, at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time, appears unaccountable or is condemned as extravagant, was ſo general, that it muſt have been excited by cauſes which were natural and of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy. The Kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, England and Scotland, and almoſt one half of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nany threw off their allegiance to the Pope, aboliſhed his juriſdiction within their territories, and gave the ſanction of law to modes of diſcipline and ſyſtems of doctrine which were not only independant of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but hoſtile to it. Nor was this ſpirit of innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confined to thoſe countries which openly revolted from the Pope; it ſpread through all Europe, and broke out in every part of it with various degrees of violence. It penetrated early into France and made progreſs apace. The number of converts to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Reformers was ſo great, their zeal ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing, and the abilities of their leaders ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, that they ſoon ventured to contend for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority with the eſtabliſhed church, and were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the point of obtaining it. In all the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germany, which continued to acknowledge
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:011837_1180_0F9D897EF306CE20"/>
the Papal ſupremacy, as well as in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the Proteſtant doctrines were ſecretly taught, and had gained ſo many proſelytes, that they were ripe for revolt, and were reſtrained merely by the dread of their rulers from imitating the example of their neighbours, and aſſerting their independance. Even in Spain and in Italy, ſymptoms of the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſhake off the yoke appeared. The pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Pope to infallible knowledge and ſupreme power were treated by many perſons of eminent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abilities with ſuch ſcorn, or impugned with ſuch vehemence, that the moſt vigilant attention of the civil magiſtrate, the higheſt ſtrains of pontifical authority, and all the rigour of the inquiſitorial ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction were requiſite to check and extinguiſh it.</p>
                  <p>THE defection of ſo many opulent and powerful kingdoms from the Papal See, was a fatal blow to its grandeur and power. It abridged the dominions of the Popes in extent, it diminiſhed their revenues, and left them fewer rewards to beſtow on the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtics of various denominations, attached to them by vows of obedience as well as by ties of intereſt, and whom they employed as inſtruments to eſtabliſh or ſupport their uſurpations in every part of Europe. The countries too which now diſclaimed their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, were thoſe which formerly had been moſt devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. The empire of ſuperſtition differs from every other ſpecies of dominion; its power is often greateſt, and moſt implicitly obeyed in the provinces moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the ſeat of government; while ſuch as are ſituated nearer to that are more apt to diſcern the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices by which it is upheld, or the impoſtures on which it is founded. The perſonal frailities or vices of the Popes, the errors as well as corruption of their adminiſtration, the ambition, venality and deceit which reigned in their court, fell immediately under the obſervation of the Italians, and could not fail of diminiſhing that reſpect which begets ſubmiſſion. But in Germany, England, and the more remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, theſe were either altogether unknown, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only known by report, made a ſlighter impreſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="343" facs="unknown:011837_1181_0F9D897FB1CA23B8"/>
Their veneration for the Papal dignity increaſed with their diſtance from Rome; and that, added to their groſs ignorance, rendered them equally credulous and paſſive. In tracing the progreſs of the Papal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, the boldeſt and moſt ſucceſsful inſtances of encroachment are to be found in Germany and other countries diſtant from Italy. In theſe its impoſitions were heavieſt, and its exactions the moſt rapacious; ſo that in eſtimating the diminution of power which the court of Rome ſuffered in conſequence of the Reformation, not only the number but the character of the people who revolted, not only the great extent of territory, but the extraordinary obſequiouſneſs of the ſubjects which it loſt, muſt be taken into the account.</p>
                  <p>NOR was it only by this defection of ſo many kingdoms and ſtates which it occaſioned, that the Reformation contributed to diminiſh the power of the Roman Pontiffs. It obliged them to adopt a different ſyſtem of conduct towards the nations which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recognize their juriſdiction, and to govern them by new maxims and with a milder ſpirit. The Reformation taught them, by a fatal example, what they ſeem not before to have apprehended, that the credulity and patience of mankind might be overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and exhauſted. They became afraid of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing on any ſuch exertion of their authority as might alarm or exaſperate their ſubjects, and excite them to a new revolt. They ſaw a rival church eſtabliſhed in many countries of Europe, the members of which were on the watch to obſerve any errors in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and eager to expoſe them. They were ſenſible that the opinions adverſe to their power and uſurpations were not confined to their enemies alone, but had ſpread even among the people who ſtill adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. Upon all theſe accounts, it was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poſſible to lead and to govern their flock in the ſame manner as in thoſe dark and quiet ages, when faith was implicit, when ſubmiſſion was unreſerved, and all tamely followed and obeyed the voice of their ſhepherd. From the aera of the Reformation, the Popes have ruled rather by addreſs and management
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:011837_1182_0F9D89806E896420"/>
than by authority. The ſtile of their decrees is the ſame, but the effect of them is very different. Thoſe Bulls and Interdicts which, before the Reformation, made the greateſt Princes tremble, have ſince that period been diſregarded or deſpiſed by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. Thoſe bold deciſions and acts of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which, during many ages, not only paſſed uncenſured, but were revered as the awards of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred tribunal, would, ſince Luther's appearance, be treated by one part of of Europe as the effect of folly or arrogance, and be deteſted by the other as impious and unjuſt, The Popes, in their adminiſtration, have been obliged not only to accommodate themſelves to the notions of their adherents, but to pay ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the prejudices of their enemies. They ſeldom venture to claim new powers, or even to inſiſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately on their ancient prerogatives, leſt they ſhould irritate the former; they carefully avoid every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that may either excite the indignation or draw on them the deriſion of the latter. The policy of the court of Rome has become as cautious, circumſpect, and timid, as it was once adventurous and violent; and though their pretenſions to infallibility, on which all their authority is founded, does not allow them to renounce any juriſdiction which they have at any time claimed or exerciſed, they find it expedient to ſuffer many of their prerogatives to lie dormant, and not to expoſe themſelves by ill-timed attempts towards reviving theſe, to the riſque of loſing that remainder of power which they ſtill enjoy. Before the ſixteenth century, the Popes were the movers and directors in every conſiderable enterprize; they were at the head of every great alliance; and being conſidered as arbiters of the affairs of Chriſtendom, the court of Rome was the centre of political negociation and intrigue. From that time the greateſt operations in Europe have been carried on independant of them; they have ſunk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a level with the other petty Princes of Italy; they continue to claim, though they dare not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the ſame ſpiritual juriſdiction, but ſcarce retain any ſhadow of the temporal power which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="unknown:011837_1183_0F9D898130773618"/>BUT how fatal ſoever the Reformation may have been to the power of the Popes, it contributed to improve the church of Rome both in ſcience and in morals. The deſire of equalling the Reformers in thoſe talents which had procured them reſpect; the neceſſity of acquiring the knowledge requiſite for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their own tenets, or refuting the arguments of their opponents; together with the emulation na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural between two rival churches, engaged the Roman Catholic clergy to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of uſeful ſcience, which they cultivated with ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity and ſucceſs, that they have gradually become as eminent in literature, as they were in ſome periods infamous for ignorance. The ſame principle occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a change no leſs conſiderable in the manners of the clergy of the Romiſh church. Various cauſes which have formerly been enumerated, had concurred in introducing great irregularity, and even diſſolution of manners among the Popiſh clergy. Luther and his adherents began their attack on the church with ſuch vehement invectives againſt theſe, that in order to remove the ſcandal, and ſilence their declamations, greater decency of conduct became neceſſary. The Reformers themſelves were ſo eminent not only for the purity but even auſterity of their manners, and had acquired ſuch reputation among the people on that account, that the Roman Catholic Clergy muſt have ſoon loſt all credit, if they had not endeavoured to conform in ſome meaſure to their ſtandard. They knew that all their actions fell under the ſevere inſpection of the Proteſtants, whom enmity and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation prompted to obſerve every vice, or even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in their conduct; to cenſure them without indulgence, and to expoſe them without mercy. This rendered them, of courſe, not only cautious to avoid ſuch enormities as might give offence, but ſtudious to acquire the virtues that might merit praiſe. In Spain and Portugal, where the tyrannical juriſdiction of the Inquiſition cruſhed the Proteſtant faith as ſoon as it appeared, the ſpirit of Popery continues invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſcience has made ſmall progreſs, and the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eccleſiaſtics has undergone little change. But
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:011837_1184_0F9D88C070AEEFB8"/>
in thoſe countries where the members of the two churches have mingled freely with each other, or have carried on any conſiderable intercourſe, either commercial or literary, an extraordinary alteration in the ideas as well as in the morals of the Popiſh ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics, is manifeſt. In France, the manners of the Dignitaries and ſecular clergy have become decent and exemplary in an high degree. Many of them have been diſtinguiſhed for all the accompliſhments and virtues which can adorn their profeſſion; and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greatly from their predeceſſors before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, both in their maxims and in their conduct.</p>
                  <p>NOR has the influence of the Reformation been felt only by the inferior members of the Roman Catholick Church; it has extended to the See of Rome, to the ſovereign Pontiffs themſelves. Violations of decorum, and even treſpaſſes againſt morality, which paſſed without cenſure in thoſe ages, when neither the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Popes, nor the veneration of the people for their character, had any bounds; when there was no hoſtile eye to obſerve the errors in their conduct, and no adverſaries zealous to inveigh againſt them; would be liable now to the ſevereſt animadverſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite general indignation or horror. Inſtead of rivall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courts of temporal Princes in gaiety, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing them in licentiouſneſs, the Popes have ſtudied to aſſume manners more ſevere and more ſuitable to their eccleſiaſtical character. The chair of St. Peter hath not been polluted, during two centuries, by any Pontiff that reſembled Alexander VI. or ſeveral of his predeceſſors, who were a diſgrace to religion and to human nature. Throughout this long ſucceſſion of Popes, a wonderful decorum of conduct, compared with that of preceding ages, is obſervable. Many of them have been conſpicuous for the virtues becoming their high ſtation; and by their humanity, their love of literature, and their moderation, have made ſome attonement to mankind for the crimes of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. Thus the beneficial influences of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation have been more extenſive than they appear on a ſuperficial view; and this great diviſion in the Chriſtian church hath contributed, in ſome meaſure,
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:011837_1185_0F9D88C1306D00D0"/>
to encreaſe purity of manners, to diffuſe ſcience, and to inſpire humanity. Hiſtory recites ſuch a number of ſhocking events, occaſioned by religious diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it muſt afford particular ſatisfaction to trace any one ſalutary or beneficial effect to that ſource, from which ſo many fatal calamities have flowed.</p>
                  <p>THE republick of Venice which, at the beginning of the ſixteenth century, had appeared ſo formidable, that almoſt all the potentates of Europe united in a confederacy for its deſtruction, declined gradually from its ancient power and ſplendour. The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not only loſt a great part of their territory in the war excited by the league of Cambray, but the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues as well as vigour of the ſtate were exhauſted by their extraordinary and long continued efforts in their own defence; and that commerce by which they had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their wealth and power began to decay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes of its reviving. All the fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to their republick, which the ſagacity of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian ſenate foreſaw on the firſt diſcovery of a paſſage to the Eaſt-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, took place. Their endeavours to prevent the Portugueſe from eſtabliſhing themſelves in the Eaſt-Indies, not only by exciting the Soldans of Egypt and the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man monarchs to turn their arms againſt ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intruders, but by affording ſecret aid to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels in order to inſure their ſucceſs <note n="x" place="bottom">Freher. Script. Rer. German. vol. ii. 529.</note>, proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. The activity and valour of the Portugueſe ſurmoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Liſbon, inſtead of Venice, became the ſtaple for the precious commodities of the Eaſt. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, after having poſſeſſed for many years the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of that beneficial commerce, had the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be excluded from almoſt any ſhare in it. The diſcoveries of the Spaniards in the weſtern world, proved no leſs fatal to inferior branches of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. The original defects which were formerly pointed out in the conſtitution of the Venetian repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick continued, and the diſadvantages with which it
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:011837_1186_0F9D88C1EF2313E0"/>
undertook any great enterprize, increaſed rather than diminiſhed. The ſources from which it derived its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary riches and power being dried up, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior vigour of the ſtate declined, and of courſe, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered its external operations leſs formidable. Long before the middle of the ſixteenth century, Venice ceaſed to be one of the principal powers in Europe, and became a ſecondary and ſubaltern ſtate. But as the ſenate had the addreſs to conceal its diminution of power, under the veil of moderation and caution; as it made no raſh effort that could diſcover its impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; as the ſymptoms of political decay, in ſtates are not ſoon obſerved, and are ſeldom ſo apparent to their neighbours as to occaſion any ſudden alteration in their conduct towards them, Venice continued long to be conſidered and reſpected. She was treated not according to her preſent condition, but according to the rank which ſhe had formerly held. Charles, as well as the monarchs of France his rivals, courted her aſſiſtance with emulation and ſolicitude in all their enterprizes. Even down to the cloſe of the century, Venice remained not only an object of attention, but a conſiderable ſeat of political negociation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue.</p>
                  <p>THAT authority which the firſt Coſmo de Medici, and Lawrence, his grandſon, had acquired in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick of Florence by their beneficence and abilities, inſpired their deſcendants with the ambition of uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſovereignty in their country, and paved their way towards it. Charles placed Alexander de Medici at the head of the republick, and to the natural inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and power of the family added the weight and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Imperial protection. Of theſe, his ſucceſſor Coſmo, ſirnamed the Great, availed himſelf; and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing his ſupreme authority on the ruins of the ancient republican conſtitution, he tranſmitted that, together with the title of Grand Duke of Tuſcany, to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants. Their dominions were compoſed of the territories which had belonged to the three common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of Florence, Piſa, and Siena, and formed one of the moſt reſpectable of the Italian ſtates.</p>

                     <pb n="349" facs="unknown:011837_1187_0F9D88C2AF971B00"/>THE dukes of Savoy, during the former part of the ſixteenth century, poſſeſſed territories which were not conſiderable either for extent or value; and the French, having ſeized the greater part of them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged the reigning duke to retire for ſafety to the ſtrong fortreſs of Nice, where he ſhut himſelf up for ſeveral years; while his ſon, the Prince of Piedmont, endeavoured to better his fortune, by ſerving as an adventurer in the armies of Spain. The peace of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau Cambreſis reſtored to him his paternal domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As theſe are environed on every hand by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful neighbours, all whoſe motions the dukes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy muſt obſerve with the greateſt attention, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not only to guard againſt the danger of being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and overpowered, but that they may chuſe their ſide with diſcernment in thoſe quarrels wherein it is impoſſible for them to avoid taking part, this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity in their ſituation ſeems to have had no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable influence on their character. By rouzing them to perpetual attention, by keeping their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity always on the ſtretch, and engaging them in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continual action, it hath formed a race of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more ſagacious in diſcovering their true intereſt, more deciſive in their reſolutions, and more dextrous in availing themſelves of every occurrence which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf, than any perhaps that can be ſingled out in the hiſtory of mankind. By gradual acquiſitions the Dukes of Savoy have added to their territories as well as to their own importance; and aſpiring at length to regal dignity, which they obtained about half a century ago, they hold no inconſiderable rank among the monarchs of Europe.</p>
                  <p>THE territories which now form the republick of the united Netherlands, were loſt during the firſt part of the ſixteenth century, among the numerous provinces ſubject to the houſe of Auſtria; and were then ſo inconſiderable, that hardly one opportunity of mentioning them hath occurred in all the buſy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of this hiſtory. But ſoon after the peace of Chateau Cambreſis, the violent and bigoted maxims of Philip's government, carried into execution with unrelenting vigour by the duke of Alva, exaſperated

the free-people of the Low-Countries to ſuch a degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they threw of the Spaniſh yoke, and aſſerted their ancient liberties and laws. Theſe they defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a perſevering valour, which occupied the arms of Spain during half a century, exhauſted the vigour, ruined the reputation of that monarchy, and at laſt conſtrained their ancient maſters to recognize and to treat with them as a free independant ſtate. This ſtate founded on liberty, and reared by induſtry and oeconomy, had grown into reputation, even while ſtruggling for its exiſtence. But when peace and ſecurity allowed it to enlarge its views, and to extend its commerce, it roſe to be one of the moſt reſpectable as well as enterprizing powers in Europe.</p>
                  <p>THE tranſactions of the kingdoms in the North of Europe, have been ſeldom attended to in the courſe of this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>RUSSIA remained buried in that barbariſm and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, from which it was called about the beginning of the preſent century, by the creative genius of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Great, who made his country known and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to the reſt of Europe.</p>
                  <p>IN Denmark and Sweden, during the reign of Charles V. great revolutions happened in their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, civil as well as eccleſiaſtical. In the former kingdom, a tyrant being degraded from the throne and expelled the country, a new Prince was called by the voice of the people to aſſume the reigns of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In the latter, a fierce people, rouzed to arms by injuries and oppreſſion, ſhook off the Daniſh yoke, and conferred the regal dignity on its deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Guſtavus Ericſon, who had all the virtues of a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro and of a patriot. Denmark, exhauſted by foreign wars, or weakened by the diſſenſions between the King and the nobles, became incapable of ſuch efforts as were requiſite in order to recover the aſcendant which it had long poſſeſſed in the North of Europe. Sweden, as ſoon as it was freed from the dominion of ſtrangers, began to recruit its ſtrength, and acquired in a ſhort time ſuch interior vigour, that it became the firſt kingdom in the North. Early in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent century, it roſe to ſuch a high rank among the

powers of Europe, that it had the chief merit both in forming and conducting that powerful league, which protected not only the Proteſtant religion, but the liberties of Germany againſt the bigotry and ambition of the houſe of Auſtria.</p>
